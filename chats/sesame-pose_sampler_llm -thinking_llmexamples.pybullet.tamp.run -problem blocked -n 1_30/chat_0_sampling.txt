(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0:
           
           First, some basic info: Object 5 is a square (0.07 x 0.07) and Surface 0 is a rectangle ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I'm assuming no collisions yet since this is the first request.  A placement is stable if it's entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           Since it's square, I'll keep the approach simple. I'll focus on just a few angles to ensure variety without overcomplicating things.
           
           **1.  AABB Calculation:**
           
           I need to figure out how much space the object takes up when rotated.  The effective size (AABB) of the object changes with rotation. When `theta = 0` (or multiples of pi/2), the effective dimensions are the same as its base size. When `theta = pi/4` (or similar rotations), it's effectively a slightly larger square because of the diagonal.
           
           *   `theta = 0`:  The effective size is a rectangle with width and height 0.07.
           *   `theta = pi/4`: The effective size is a square with a side length  = `0.07 * (sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2)  = 0.07 * sqrt(2) / 2 ` or about 0.04949747.
           
           **2. Placement Generation**
           
           I'll generate 2 sets of 25 unique stable placements for object 5.
           I'll do a 5x5 grid for each orientation:
           *   Set 1:  theta=0
           *   Set 2: theta = pi/4
           
           For both sets, I'll calculate `s_eff = (size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y * abs(sin(theta)))/2` to get the effective bounding box and its half-extents.
           Then I'll compute the boundaries of the valid center points for x and y that would fit in surface 0.
           Finally, I generate a 5x5 grid in the valid ranges for the `x` and `y` center positions of the object, adding all of the positions to the `placements` list.
           
           **3. Output**
           
           The output will be 50 placements as requested. The object ID will be placed on surface 0, with a `(surface index, rotation angle, x_center, y_center)` tuple.
           
           Let's do this!

(Thoughts: **My reasoning process for object placement:**
           
           I've received a new request and need to place object ID 10 while avoiding the fixed obstacles, which are previous successful placements of object ID 5.  Object 10 is square, with an approximate side length of `0.09834`. I’ll consider placing it with `theta=0` (aligned with the axes) and possibly `theta=pi/4`.
           
           First, I examined the scene. Surface 0 is bounded by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The fixed obstacles, all object ID 5, are located at various positions on the surface. These obstacles have an AABB of `0.07` x `0.07`. I need to avoid any overlap.
           
           For placement, I'll calculate the valid placement zones for object 10. With `theta=0`, the effective size is `0.09834`. The effective AABB is `0.04917` around the center point.  I calculate the valid range for the center of the object (x and y) based on the surface bounds and object size.
           
           The x-center range is [4.24917, 4.75083] and y-center range is [-0.55083, -0.04917]. Now, I check for collisions with existing obstacles. The obstacles occupy x-ranges of [4.2, 4.27] and [4.3325, 4.4025]. I need to avoid these x-ranges to place the object without overlap.
           
           To avoid the existing obstacles at `theta = 0`, the new object with its AABB [x_center - 0.04917, x_center + 0.04917] cannot overlap. I find that `x_center` should be >= 4.31917 or <= 4.28333 to avoid it completely (in x). Thus, to be safe, I need the `x_center` to be at `x_center >= 4.45167`, which leaves my placement range starting at the beginning of column 3 [4.45167].
           
           The y placement range will be -0.55083 to -0.04917. Because I have calculated the x placement range to NOT overlap with the existing obstacles at `theta = 0`, the y range can be unrestricted to fit within the valid `y` of surface 0.
           
           So, for object 10, the valid center point placement range (x, y) is in the range of `[4.45167, 4.75083] * [-0.55083, -0.04917]`.  
           
           I will create a grid of 50 placements at `theta=0` with `x_step = 0.03324` (10 values) and `y_step = 0.125415` (5 values). I verify that the generated placement locations will not overlap in x with the existing obstacles. This assures that all 50 placements are valid. No need to attempt `pi/4` because 50 valid placements are possible.
