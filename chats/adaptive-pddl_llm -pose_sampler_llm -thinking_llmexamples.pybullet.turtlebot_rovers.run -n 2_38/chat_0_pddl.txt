User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 25 viable (x, y) locations for a robot base, given a specific target point (2.02, 0.77) and a constraint of staying within a maximum distance of 4 units from this target.  The operational environment is a bounded space, x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], and I need to avoid collisions with fixed obstacles while ensuring clear line-of-sight to the target.  This is a 'cold start' scenario; I have no prior feedback to guide me.
           
           To achieve this, I'm employing a two-pronged strategy:
           
           1.  **Exploration and Generation:** I'll begin by systematically generating potential base positions using a combination of methods. First, I'll focus on a spiral-like search pattern (using a set of radii and angles) around the target, which promotes diversity. Then, for comprehensive coverage, I'll also implement a grid-based search within the allowable bounds. This allows me to fill gaps in potential locations and ensure I can find the desired 25.
           
           2.  **Filtering and Obstacle Avoidance:** After generation, I will rigorously filter each candidate position to ensure it meets the criteria. This includes checking:
           
               *   **Environment Boundaries:** Each location must be within the defined operating space.
               *   **Distance Constraint:** Each location must be within a maximum distance of 4 units from the target point.
               *   **Collision Detection:** I am given a set of AABBs representing fixed obstacles.  I have modified the obstacles to include the room walls to prevent collisions and added LoS to the algorithm to prevent occlusion.
           
           I am particularly mindful of the central wall running along the y-axis, located at x=0.  This presents a significant line-of-sight challenge, and thus I will focus the generated search primarily on the side where the target resides. Since the target is positioned at x=2.02, I am making an intelligent guess that the locations should be around this x, and I will focus on locations where the robot base location's x is greater than 0.
           
           By combining an informed generation approach and a rigorous filtering process, I am confident I can identify 25 suitable robot base positions.
