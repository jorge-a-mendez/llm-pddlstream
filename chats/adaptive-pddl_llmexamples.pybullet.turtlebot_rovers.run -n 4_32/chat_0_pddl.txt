           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that represents a complex state involving multiple conditions. Specifically, the axiom requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Storage `v16` is free on rover `v12`. This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Storage `v16` is free on rover `v14`. This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received. This is false in the initial state.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received. This is false in the initial state.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective `v19` in mode `v11` has been received. This is false in the initial state.
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Image of objective `v20` in mode `v11` has been received. This is false in the initial state.
           9. `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists an object of type `stone` which is `v2`. This is true in the initial state (`v4`, `v1`, `v3` are type `v2`).
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a stone has been received. This is false in the initial state.
           11. `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists an object of type `soil` which is `v6`. This is true in the initial state (`v7`, `v8`, `v5` are type `v6`).
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of soil has been received. This is false in the initial state.
           
           The available actions are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions, as these actions do not allow for taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, or sending analysis.
           
           The plan should contain actions to achieve `receivedimage` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil).
           The initial state shows that:
           - Rover `v12` is at `v13`, and `v14` is at `v15`. Both have free storage `v16`.
           - `v10` is a camera, onboard both rovers, and supports mode `v11`.
           - `v9` is the lander.
           - There are several rocks of type `v2` (stone: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and type `v6` (soil: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           - All objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20` are visible to both rovers at #o3 via ray #o4.
           - Both rovers can communicate with the lander `v9` at #o0 via ray #o1.
           
           However, the only allowed actions are `move` (which doesn't change any of the goal predicates beyond the initial `atconf` state, which are already true) and `drop_rock` (which requires `full` storage, which is not the case, and even if it were, doesn't contribute to the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates).
           
           Given the limited set of allowed actions, specifically the lack of `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, it is impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
