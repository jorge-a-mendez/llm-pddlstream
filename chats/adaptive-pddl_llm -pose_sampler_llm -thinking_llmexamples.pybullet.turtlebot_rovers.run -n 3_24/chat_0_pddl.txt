           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Axiom: A Rover's Immobile Predicament**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to satisfy the conditions laid out by the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This involves gathering image data and receiving analysis reports for specific stone and soil samples. The initial conditions, namely the rovers' starting locations (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`), and the "free" status of their storage (`free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`) are already met.
           
           However, the core challenges lie in acquiring the necessary image data (`receivedimage`) and rock analyses (`receivedanalysis`). Analyzing the available actions, it's clear I'd use rover `v14` to perform these tasks. The plan was to have it sample a stone, send the analysis, and repeat the process for a soil sample, while simultaneously capturing and transmitting the necessary images.
           
           The issue, however, boils down to the *immobility* of the rovers. My initial analysis led me to the conclusion that rovers were capable of movement, but a deeper inspection of the `motion` predicate and the valid move actions revealed a critical limitation: the provided move actions are effectively "no-ops". The only moves available force each rover to stay in its initial position, rendering them functionally static.
           
           I attempted to define a sequence of actions, but quickly realized they depend on the rovers' ability to move to various locations to sample rocks and send the data. Since the rovers cannot move, the goal is unattainable. I've re-examined and cross checked everything, and I've double checked for all possible moves, this is a dead-end due to the mobility restrictions. The rovers are, effectively, stuck in place and unable to perform the needed tasks. Thus, I must conclude that `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable given the constraints.
