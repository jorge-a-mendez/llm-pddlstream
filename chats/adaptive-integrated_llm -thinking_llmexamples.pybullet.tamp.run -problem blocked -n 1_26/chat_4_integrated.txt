User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.415, 0.25), (-4.325, 0.34)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.37, 0.295, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.822, 0.57).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've come up with to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down my thought process along the way:**
           
           I need to get the object `green`, which is either `v8` or `v12`, onto the surface `v18`. From the given information, both `v8` and `v12` are "green" (they have the property `type(?, v17)`). I know that `v18` has an AABB that indicates it's a surface, so I need to find a way to make the statement `on(?green, v18)` true. This breaks down into the action of placing the object `?green` onto the surface `v18` at some pose `?p`.
           
           Looking at the scene, both `v8` and `v12` are supported by surfaces that are *not* `v18`. I need to figure out how to put one of them *on* `v18`. I see `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` in the initial state, meaning that placing either object on `v18` is already supported by the robot. From these, I realize both placing `v8` at the pose `#p0` and placing `v12` at the pose `#o2` would satisfy the requirement.
           
           I've got a choice here: pick and place `v8` or `v12`. I need to decide which one to use. I can perform `pick` and then `place` for `v8` to fulfill the condition.
           
           I need to construct a plan that:
           1.  Moves the robot's base to a configuration `q0` (the initial configuration for `v8`) so that the robot can pick `v8` up.
           2.  Moves the robot's base to a configuration `q1` so that the robot can place `v8` onto the pose `#p0` on `v18`.
           3.  Picks the object `v8` up from the pose `v9`.
           4.  Places the object `v8` at the target pose `#p0` on `v18`.
           The plan looks like this:
           
           1.  `move_base(v3, #q0, #t2)`
           2.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #g0, #q0, #t0)`
           3.  `move_base(#q0, #q1, #t4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t1)`
           
           This ensures that the axiom becomes true. I can see that `v8`'s a small object, perhaps like a cup. Its AABB shows it's around 0.07 x 0.07. The surface on `v18` is much larger, with extents from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). I choose `#p0` to be at (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), near the center of the surface, with a footprint that keeps it fully within the surface extents to ensure a stable placement for the object to be placed.
           
           In an alternative plan, pick and place `v12`, but `v12` requires one base movement for the pick and one for the place.
           
           The robot's base movement for `v8` looks far more practical given the geometry. While using `v12` has fewer base movements, it's not actually feasible because it is physically impossible. The geometry makes placing `v12` difficult, as the pick-up location is on a completely opposite side of the workspace. If I were to use `v12`, I'd have a harder time kinematically, due to the distance. However, for `v8`, because it is close in the same region of the table, this makes the operation more feasible. The action costs are impossible to calculate without coordinates of the configurations, but the plan using `v8`'s geometry makes more sense.
           
           In the end, since the robot can't kinematically reach the pick-up location of `v12` on a totally different x location from where the surface is located, I will use `v8`, despite two base motions needed.
