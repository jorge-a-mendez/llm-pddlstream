User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.415, 0.25), (-4.325, 0.34)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.37, 0.295, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.822, 0.57).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inaccessible Goal due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I must ensure an object of type `v17` is positioned "on" the surface `v18`. After analyzing the initial state, I've determined that this translates to achieving either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`. To accomplish this, according to the `on` axiom, I need to make sure either `v8` or `v12` is at pose `#o2`, which is a supported pose on the surface `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was to use a standard pick-and-place strategy: pick `v8` (for instance) from its initial pose `v9`, and then place it onto `#o2` on `v18`. However, a crucial constraint is at play: the problem explicitly states that I am only allowed to use the action instance `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. No `pick` or `place` instances are allowed because they are not provided in the allowed action instance list.
           
           This creates an insurmountable obstacle. Since I am unable to pick up, move, and place either `v8` or `v12`, I can't change their current `atpose` states. The initial state doesn't have either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` true. Since I can't modify the existing facts, I cannot achieve the goal. No valid plan exists under the given constraints, and the goal remains unreachable.
