User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.415, 0.25), (-4.325, 0.34)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.37, 0.295, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.822, 0.57).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)

           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, specifically of type `v17`, positioned *on* surface `v18`.  I've got three contenders: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`, all of type `v17`.  Looking at the initial state, it's immediately clear that none of these are currently on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought is, "Simple!  I'll just move one of them."  I can see that `v8` and `v12` *could* be placed on `v18` according to `stackable` constraints, at least based on what's available here. `v15` is out, no direct support for placing it on `v18`. But, how do I actually *move* them?  That's where the problem arises.
           
           I've looked at available actions. The only permitted action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That's a non-starter here. This doesn't manipulate objects themselves. It moves the base and alters the robot's configuration. It *cannot* change object positioning.
           
           My expertise tells me that achieving the `on` predicate here *demands* the existence of `pick` and `place` actions, or some equivalent that directly manipulates objects' positions with respect to other objects, like `supported`.  If I don't have these, I'm stuck.
           
           I've double-checked the problem definition. No wiggle room here, I am constrained to using only the single `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, since the only action I *can* use cannot achieve the task, I must conclude that the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable* given the initial conditions and action restrictions.
