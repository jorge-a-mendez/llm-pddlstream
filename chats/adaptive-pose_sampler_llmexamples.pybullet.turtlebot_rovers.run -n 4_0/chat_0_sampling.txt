User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square bounding box from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There's a vertical wall along the y-axis, defined by box 5. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment. Some of these are near the outer walls, like boxes 1, 2, 3, 4, and some are more internal, like boxes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.
           
           I will attempt to find positions within a 2-unit radius of the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not directly behind the obstacles, and I'll try to spread them out to cover different angles around the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous attempts for the target point (2.0367887020111084, 1.8461332321166992) revealed some issues. (1.05, 0.5) had no line of sight, suggesting an obstacle between it and the target. (2.0, 2.0) collided with fixed obstacles 7 and 22, which are in the upper right quadrant. (2.0, -1.0) also had no line of sight.
           
           Given the target is in the upper right, and (2.0, 2.0) collided, I need to be careful with positions close to the corner or too far in the positive x and y. The target point is (2.0367887020111084, 1.8461332321166992). This is very close to obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and obstacle 22 ((1.9957441341670852, 1.805088664272676), (2.0778332698551316, 1.8871777999607224)). The collision for (2.0, 2.0) is not surprising given these obstacles.
           
           I will try positions that are further away from the obstacles near the target and avoid the problematic upper-right corner. I will also try to vary the angle to the target.
