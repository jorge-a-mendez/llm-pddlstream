           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down how I'm tackling this placement problem.**  My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a small, 0.07 x 0.07 object on the given surface, which is defined by an AABB (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  The placement needs to define (surface index, rotation angle, x, y), and the object has to remain entirely *within* the specified surface.
           
           Since the object is square-like, I need to consider rotations to change the object's effective size. The crucial aspect is the effective bounding box of the object at varying rotation angles, calculated using the *W_eff* and *H_eff*. I decided to use the general formulas to calculate these, even though, for a perfect square, they're identical. To efficiently generate a variety of poses I'm iterating through distinct rotations.
           
           For placement, I need to calculate the bounding box based on the rotation angle using a loop. It's essentially the smallest rectangle containing the rotated object.  I'm choosing 10 angles for rotation: `0, pi/5, 2pi/5, ..., 9pi/5`, as these are sufficient to represent a diverse set of orientations. For *each* rotation, I calculate the allowed *x* and *y* ranges.  After that, I'm choosing *x* and *y* for a given rotation using: center and four quarter points.  I have logic to handle very small range for *x* and *y* to avoid generating points.  This results in 5 points for each angle, with a total of 50.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 10 on Surface 0, ensuring no collision with the already-placed Object ID 5. I've been given Object 10's dimensions (approximately 0.0959 x 0.0959) and Surface 0's bounds. Object 5 is positioned at (4.5, -0.3) with a size of 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           First, I need to understand the shape and effective size of Object 10. Given its nearly square shape, I know its effective size will vary depending on its rotation (theta). The maximum effective side will be 0.1356 (sqrt(2) times the side length), occurring at rotations of 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees. The minimum effective side will be 0.0959, at rotations of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
           
           Surface 0 is also nearly square and has relatively ample space. I'll need to calculate a safe placement area on the surface based on the effective size of Object 10 for each rotation.
           
           The core strategy is to iterate through potential rotations (using 10 angles spaced evenly between 0 and 2*pi), generate a grid of potential center points for Object 10 within the surface bounds, and check each placement for collision with the AABB of Object 5.
           
           I'm checking for collision using a standard AABB-vs-AABB intersection test: Two AABBs collide if their projections overlap on both the x and y axes. This will quickly determine if a placement is valid.
           
           For each rotation, I'll generate five candidate positions for Object 10's center: the center of the surface area, and then points biased towards the corners and edges of the area (approximately one quarter in from each side). I ensure diversity. The generation will favor five unique non-colliding placements for each angle. The code will generate a set of candidate placements by trying a diverse set of positions, until reaching 50 or running out of valid candidates.
