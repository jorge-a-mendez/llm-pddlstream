           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will prioritize positions that are clearly away from the fixed obstacles. The target point is (0.9125, -0.6625). I will try to place the robot in open areas, generally avoiding the central vertical wall and other smaller obstacles, while staying within the max range of 2 from the target.

Model:     The target point has changed to (-2.015366315841675, 2.0341968536376953). My previous attempts were based on the old target point and were largely invalid for the new target. The previous positions are not relevant for the new target.
           
           I need to find positions within 2 units of (-2.015366315841675, 2.0341968536376953). This region is in the upper-left quadrant, near the boundaries. Obstacles 8, 19, and 20 are in this general area. I will try to place the robot in open areas around the target, keeping in mind the boundaries and nearby obstacles.

Model:     The target point is now (-0.6971140503883362, 1.9355806112289429). This is in the upper-left quadrant, near the central vertical wall and other obstacles such as 9, 10, and 19. My previous attempts for the *previous* target are no longer relevant, as the target has moved. However, the last position for the *previous* target, (-2.015366315841675, 2.4341968536376952), failed due to collision with the top wall, which is consistent.
           
           For the current target, I need to find positions within 2 units. This area is quite constrained due to the central wall (obstacle 5) and the cluster of obstacles 9, 10, and 19. I will try to find positions directly in front of the target, and slightly to the sides, being careful not to place the robot too close to the obstacles.

Model:     The target point remains (-0.6971140503883362, 1.9355806112289429). All three positions from the previous attempt failed:
           - (-1.015366315841675, 2.0341968536376953) had no line of sight. This was a position I offered in the previous *previous* round for a *different* target. It was accidentally included in the failure list for the *current* target.
           - (-2.015366315841675, 0.0341968536376953) had no line of sight. This was also offered for the previous *previous* target.
           - (-2.015366315841675, 2.4341968536376952) collided with the top wall. This was also offered for the previous *previous* target.
           
           I need to re-evaluate for the *current* target (-0.6971140503883362, 1.9355806112289429) using the information from the *last* request.
           My three proposed positions from the *last* request were:
           1. (-0.6971140503883362 0.9355806112289429): This is directly below the target, but the central vertical wall (obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))) is to the right. The target is to the left of x=0, and this position is also to the left. This might be a good position.
           2. (0.3028859496116638 1.9355806112289429): This position is to the right of the central vertical wall (x=0). The target is to the left of the central vertical wall. This position will definitely have no line of sight due to obstacle 5. This was a bad choice.
           3. (-1.6971140503883362 1.9355806112289429): This is directly to the left of the target. Obstacles 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and 20 ((-2.0557544388112277, 1.9938087306681425), (-1.974978192872122, 2.074584976607248)) are in this general vicinity. This might be too close to them.
           
           I need to focus on positions to the left of the central wall (x=0), and avoid obstacles 8, 9, 10, 19, and 20.
           Let's recalculate positions for the target (-0.6971140503883362, 1.9355806112289429).
           Max range is 2.
           1. Try a position directly below the target, but not too far down to avoid other obstacles. My previous attempt was (-0.6971140503883362 0.9355806112289429). This is 1 unit below, well within range.
           2. Try a position further to the left, but make sure it avoids obstacle 8 and the left wall.
           3. Try a position slightly above and to the left, but below the top wall and avoiding obstacle 19.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.6971140503883362 0.9355806112289429)
           (-2.4 1.9355806112289429)
           (-0.9 2.4)
