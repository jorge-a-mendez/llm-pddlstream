           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievability with Limited Actions**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to reach the goal `new-axiom@0()`, given a specific PDDL domain and initial state.  The core of `new-axiom@0()` is the conjunction of two conditions: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. My initial assessment indicates that `?green` could be either `v8` or `v12`, as both possess the necessary type, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`.
           
           The challenge lies in satisfying the `on` predicate. I understand that `on(?green, v18)` entails both `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.  Examining the initial state, I note that while `type(v8, v17)` is true, `on(v8, v18)` is not. `atpose(v8, v9)` exists, but `supported(v8, v9, v18)` is absent.  However, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v8, #o2)` exists, meaning *if* `v8` could be "moved" to pose `#o2` and the `atpose` fact updated accordingly, `on(v8, v18)` would be true. Similar logic applies to `v12`. To achieve this, some form of manipulation (`pick` and `place` actions) would be required.
           
           However, a critical constraint emerges: I am strictly limited to using the single action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action, according to its definition, alters `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates, but it *does not* affect any predicates related to `atpose`, `supported`, or `type`. The effects of the action are: `atbconf(?q2)`,  `NegatedAtom atbconf(?q1)`, and `NegatedAtom canmove()`, where `?q1` and `?q2` are both `v3`.
           
           The core logic of my reasoning rests here:  Since the permissible action does not influence the necessary conditions of my goal, and since the goal is *not* satisfied in the initial state, the goal is unequivocally *unachievable* within these bounds. Neither `v8` nor `v12` is `on(object,v18)` in the initial state, and I have no actions that could modify the `atpose` and `supported` predicates that are needed to have `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.  I conclude that this plan cannot succeed and that the goal is unattainable with the provided action and the starting state.
