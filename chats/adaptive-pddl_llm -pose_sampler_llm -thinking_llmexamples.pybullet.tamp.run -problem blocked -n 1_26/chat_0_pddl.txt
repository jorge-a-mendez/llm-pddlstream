           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a small square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a defined rectangular surface (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since it's square, rotation doesn't change the object's effective dimensions. I'll stick with a rotation of 0 for simplicity, meaning I only need to consider x and y positions. The object must be fully within the surface, so I have to calculate the valid x and y ranges.
           
           Given the surface's dimensions and the object's size, the x-range is from 4.235 to 4.765, and the y-range is from -0.565 to -0.035. I'll generate a grid of points within these ranges to ensure even coverage.  I'm going with 8 points in the x direction and 7 in the y direction, giving me 56 points total. This will ensure I have more than the required 50 placements. I can calculate the x and y coordinates by using the lower/upper bounds and dividing them by the number of points minus one.
           I'll create the grid with those coordinates and create `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples. I'll be careful to not introduce any unnecessary rounding that could move a point outside of the constraints, so I'll output values with their precise calculations. I'll take the first 50 placements I generate using this method, making sure to select 7 complete rows, and then taking the first coordinate of the 8th row to have the 50th placement. This should guarantee 50 evenly-distributed, stable placements.
