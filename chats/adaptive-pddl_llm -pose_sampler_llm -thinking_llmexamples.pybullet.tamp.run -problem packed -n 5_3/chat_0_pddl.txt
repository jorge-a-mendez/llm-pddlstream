(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Near-Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The challenge is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. We've got a square surface and an object that's nearly a perfect square. My expert intuition tells me that means we can get away with some efficient approximations.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. The object's size and the surface bounds are the key factors. I'm thinking about the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the object when rotated. The object's AABB has to fit entirely within the surface bounds, so rotation matters.  For this specific case the AABB bounds for all rotations will be similar, due to the square like nature of the object.
           
           I need the equation to determine the valid placement locations to use. I know the rotated AABB is going to vary with `theta`, the rotation angle, but for an almost square object, this variation will be subtle.
           
           My plan: I'll use a set of `theta` values and for each `theta` I will calculate a set of valid `x` and `y` center positions.  I'm going to start with 10 values from 0 to 9*pi/10 (almost pi) radians for the rotation to cover the full range of possible valid rotations for a square.  Then I'll generate a grid of `(x, y)` points for each angle.  The goal is to get 50 placements in total.
           
           I need to calculate the bounding boxes for different angles, so I can ensure the object stays within the surface. So it's best to rotate the object and determine the resulting min/max bounds.
           
           I know I can get 50 diverse points by using those strategies. The square nature of the objects and surfaces will allow me to generate enough points.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 7 to Avoid Collision with Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 7, a square with dimensions 0.07287945942418683 x 0.07287945942418683, and I need to place it on surface 0, which is a square region defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The critical constraint:  Object ID 5, currently positioned at (0, 0) and also a square with dimensions 0.07294443809301274 x 0.07294443809301276, *must not* collide with object ID 7.
           
           Since I'm aiming for 50 stable placements, I will use my standard approach:  Angle and Position Diversity! I will generate several rotations for the new object and, for each rotation, I'll identify several, collision-free, positions for the object.
           
           I already know that Object 5's AABB is centered at (0, 0) with half-extents of approximately 0.0365 in both X and Y.  Therefore, to avoid collision, the center of Object 7 must remain outside of a square centered at (0, 0) which is slightly wider than the original Object 5 because of Object 7's AABB.
           
           The available space on surface 0 for object 7 is a square with an edge length of 0.27. So, for the center of object 7, the boundary of surface 0 has the valid ranges of `(-0.09856, 0.09856)`. To avoid collision, let's select angles spaced at `i * pi / 10`, `i=0..9`.
           I will generate those values for the rotations. The calculation of the `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` for the object, based on the dimensions and current rotation angle, is: `hw_rot = 0.5 * (obj7_x * abs(cos(theta)) + obj7_y * abs(sin(theta)))`  and `hh_rot = 0.5 * (obj7_x * abs(sin(theta)) + obj7_y * abs(cos(theta)))`. This means that `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` are the rotated half-extents. Object 7 has `obj_x = obj_y`, so those values are almost the same. So I'll compute those.
           
           I'll choose 5 positions around the "corner" and "edge" of the region. This is good because these locations, by definition, must be outside of the central collision zone that surrounds Object 5.
           I'll select the values as (for each `theta`):
           1.  `(x_max_center, y_max_center)`
           2.  `(x_min_center, y_min_center)`
           3.  `(x_max_center, y_min_center)`
           4.  `(x_min_center, y_max_center)`
           5.  `(x_max_center, 0.0)`
           The fifth item will be the right edge (y=0) and this will be outside the exclusion zone, since it's located at `x_max_center`
           
           I'll calculate the exclusion zone to verify that the positions are valid.
           The result of this approach should be fifty stable and non-colliding placements for object 7. I'll iterate through angles and generate the appropriate points.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got to find 50 stable positions for object ID 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into objects ID 5 and ID 7, which are already there. It's a bit tricky because object 4 is nearly square and pretty big compared to the space left.
           
           First, I looked at the surface, which is a square. I calculated the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates where I can place the object's center, considering how big it is. Then, I had to account for Object 5, which is at the center, and Object 7, which is tucked in a corner. I need to make sure the object's bounding box doesn't overlap with either of them for any possible rotation.
           
           Since the shape is roughly square, it's easiest to start with rotations of 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. But I also need to make a more dense grid of points, to reach the required number of unique placements.
           
           After carefully analyzing the collision conditions, I realized that I'm dealing with a very constrained space. To make sure there are at least 50 points I will have to pick a dense grid for the main angles.
           
           I then identified the valid zone for the object’s center position. Basically, I created a list of center coordinates which are valid (no collision) for object 4. Then, I considered 4 possible angles.
           
           Finally, I checked all candidates coordinates and the 50 valid placements.
