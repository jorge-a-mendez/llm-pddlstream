User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a central open area with some obstacles near the boundaries and also a few smaller obstacles scattered within the central region. The outer boundary is defined by AABBs 1, 2, 3, and 4, which form a square from (-2.55, -2.55) to (2.55, 2.55). There's also a long, thin obstacle (5) in the middle along the y-axis, from (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5), essentially blocking direct views across the x-axis at x=0. Other obstacles (6 to 20) are smaller and distributed.
           
           To find good positions, I will prioritize locations within the allowed [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] range that are close to the target but also appear to be in open spaces, away from the known obstacles. Since the robot's orientation is adjusted automatically, I mainly focus on finding good (x, y) coordinates. I will try to generate positions at different angles and distances from the target point to maximize diversity, always keeping the max_range=2 constraint in mind.
