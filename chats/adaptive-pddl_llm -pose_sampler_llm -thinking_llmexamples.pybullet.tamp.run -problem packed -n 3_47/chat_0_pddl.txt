(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing the Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is essentially a square with dimensions approximately 0.087 x 0.087, on surface 0, a square region centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27.  My goal is to fully contain the object within the surface for each placement.
           
           First, I recognized that the rotation of the object affects the size of its bounding box. For a square, this rotated bounding box is also a square, but its side length varies with the rotation angle (theta). The critical consideration here is the extent of the bounding box's edge relative to its center.
           
           To determine stable placement regions, I have to ensure the object's fully contained within the surface boundaries, considering its rotation. The amount of "give" I have on each axis depends on theta and must be carefully quantified to prevent the object's escape.
           
           After this examination, I planned to use 5 distinct angles for theta: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. For each angle, I will position the object at 10 different (x, y) coordinates within the allowed area. These placement coordinates are calculated based on the maximum allowed extent for the chosen theta, and the distribution of these coordinates within that area. A central point will be used as a base, with additional points distributed on axes, corners, and some more randomly, ensuring good coverage. The ultimate goal is to generate 50 distinct and stable placements to satisfy the original request.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, and now it's time to tackle object 5. This object is very similar in size and shape (a square) to object 4, but with the added constraint of collision avoidance. Object 4 is placed at the origin, with no rotation.
           
           The surface is defined and I know object 5's dimensions. My strategy remains the same: generate diverse placement candidates. However, I have to ensure object 5 doesn't overlap object 4. I know object 4's bounding box and I will use this to derive regions in which to place object 5.
           
           First, I recomputed the relevant object parameters. The bounding box of object 4 is approximately `(-0.0436, -0.0436)` to `(0.0436, 0.0436)`. Since object 5 is small relative to the surface and already has a placed object nearby, I anticipate that safe placement will involve placing object 5 to the edges.
           
           I considered all rotations and used the bounding box of object 5, which changes with the rotation. The surface and my collision constraint limits the number of possible placements that can be used. It turns out that at some rotations, such as `pi/4` and similar angles, the object is too wide to fit on the surface and avoid collision. At `pi/4`, there's no room for object 5 outside the bounding box of object 4.
           
           So, I’m left with just two possible orientations: 0 degrees and 90 degrees. These have the smallest bounding boxes.
           
           I had to ensure that the bounding boxes of object 4 and object 5 do not overlap. The collision check is simple: if the bounding boxes intersect, then the objects collide. For no collision, one object must be entirely to the left/right/above/below the other.
           
           I then considered that object 5 could only be to the left, right, top, or bottom. I have very narrow band regions along the edges of the surface for x and y placement.
           
           I decided to generate 25 placements at 0 degrees, and 25 at 90 degrees.
           To pick the positions, I defined regions where object 5's center could be located without causing a collision. This gave me 4 corner regions and several band regions.
           
           I then split the corners and bands up and used these to generate points.
           I will generate those points carefully and submit them.
