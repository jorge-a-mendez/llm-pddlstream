           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom with multiple conditions, including `receivedimage` for objectives v17, v18, v19, and `receivedanalysis` for type `v2` rocks (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` rocks (v5, v7, v8). We have two rovers, v12 and v14. Both rovers have a camera v10 that supports mode v11. Both rovers are free to store one sample in v16. Rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. Lander v9 is available for communication.
           
           Let's break down the goal `new-axiom@0()`:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Need to take an image of v17 with mode v11 and send it.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Need to take an image of v18 with mode v11 and send it.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Need to take an image of v19 with mode v11 and send it.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Need to analyze and send analysis for a rock of type v2. Rocks of type v2 are v1, v3, v4.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Need to analyze and send analysis for a rock of type v6. Rocks of type v6 are v5, v7, v8.
           
           We only have `move` and `drop_rock` actions available. `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are *not* available in the provided action instances, which means the goal is unreachable.
           
           Given the available action instances, only `move` and `drop_rock` are allowed. These actions are insufficient to achieve the goal of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, which require `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The problem explicitly states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Since none of the necessary actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are in the given list of allowed actions, it is impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, and thus the `new-axiom@0()` goal cannot be met.
