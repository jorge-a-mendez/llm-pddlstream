User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Optimal Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three good positions for the robot's base to view a target point. The target point is provided as `{target_point}`, which I'll assume for this demonstration is (0.1, 0.1). I've got a maximum range of 2 meters from the target, and I need to avoid any collisions with fixed obstacles, while also guaranteeing a clear line of sight to the target. I'm also limited to a workspace that spans x and y coordinates from -2.5 to 2.5.
           
           First, I looked at the obstacles. I recognized the first obstacle as essentially defining the workspace boundaries. The other obstacles were walls and smaller blocks within this space. The most significant obstacle is the central vertical wall (at x=0). Given that my target is just to the right of this wall, I need to make sure the robot's base positions are also on the right side of the wall for line-of-sight. This helps to avoid it being blocked by the wall.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate positions within a 2-meter radius around the target. To have line-of-sight to the target, the robot must be located at a point to the right of the central wall.  I've decided to position the robot at three places, all to the right of the central wall. I'm choosing a distance of 1.5 meters from the target, and I'll vary the angle.
           
           I started with the most straightforward approach, a position straight to the right of the target (alpha = 0). This gave me a position at (1.6, 0.1). I confirmed that it's within the workspace, that it's clear of obstacles (a point check), and that it has an unblocked line of sight to the target.
           
           Next, I tried a position at an angle of pi/4 (top-right). This gave me a position at (1.16, 1.16). Again, I verified that this location is within the workspace, collision-free, and has line-of-sight to the target.
           
           Finally, I considered an angle of -pi/4 (bottom-right), resulting in a base position at (1.16, -0.96). This position also satisfies all the criteria: within workspace, free of collisions, and a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           After this rigorous verification, my final three base positions are: (1.6, 0.1), (1.16, 1.16), and (1.16, -0.96). I've confirmed that these base positions are all within the bounds, are within the required distance from the target, do not collide with any obstacles, and have clear lines of sight to the provided target location.
