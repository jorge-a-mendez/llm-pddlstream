           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary goal is to determine if the plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` from the given initial state is possible.  I've thoroughly dissected the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, recognizing that it hinges on acquiring `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts, specifically for stones and soil.  My analysis indicates that many conditions within the axiom are already present in the initial state, such as the `atconf` and `free` predicates. However, several critical predicates are *not* present: `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           **Plan Development and Obstacles**
           
           To generate `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, I determined that the `send_image` action is essential, which requires the `take_image` action to generate the `haveimage` precondition. For `receivedanalysis`, the same logic holds, with `send_analysis` requiring the `sample_rock` action. My strategy involves analyzing the pre-conditions of the action to see what information must be acquired. I then searched for the actions that produced these prerequisites, which would be included in the plan.  I broke down the action, using the given example to find which values matched each of the parameters in the preconditions.
           
           **Configuration and Visibility Constraints**
           
           My focus shifted towards the visibility and configuration aspects, notably the role of continuous parameters denoted by "#".  The `take_image` and `send_image` actions, as well as the initial state, show a correlation of these parameters with the configuration of the objects in the world. I carefully analyzed how configurations (`atconf` predicates) relate to the "visibility" and "communication" configurations. `take_image` is only valid when the camera is at its appropriate location, and similarly, `send_image` has a configuration where information can be sent. I found that I would need to find configurations that satisfy a relation between the continuous parameters and the initial location of the objects. These continuous parameters, however, act as object identifiers, not numerical values to be filled. I am also hindered by the fact that the only allowable move actions don't have the desired effect on `atconf`, which means that it can only stay where it is. I identified that `atconf` values must match specific continuous values such as `#o0` or `#o3`, however there are no actions to move between continuous parameters in the world. This made `take_image` and `send_image` currently impossible.
           
           **Action Instances Limitations**
           
           I meticulously reviewed the provided list of permitted action instances.  I noticed that the list only included movements that have the same value for the *q* parameter (move to self), and the `drop_rock` action that would not be able to be performed as it did not have the corresponding `full` value. Given the limitations of the move actions, they could not change the configuration or achieve the necessary preconditions. Therefore, the available actions are insufficient to generate the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates and fulfill the goal.
           
           **Unreachability Conclusion**
           
           Based on this comprehensive analysis, I've concluded that the goal is currently unreachable. The allowed actions don't include the necessary `take_image`, `send_image`, or `sample_rock` actions needed to fulfill the preconditions for the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. Given the severe limitations on movement and the absence of actions to manipulate the configurations of objects and the lack of a suitable set of initial state conditions, the plan cannot be realized.
