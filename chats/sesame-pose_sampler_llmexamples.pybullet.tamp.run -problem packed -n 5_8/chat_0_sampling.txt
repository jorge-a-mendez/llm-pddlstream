           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.097 x 0.097. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's a large area for stable placements. I will try to place the object in various positions and orientations on the surface. Since the object is square, rotating it by multiples of pi/2 will result in the same effective AABB, but rotating it by other angles can change the effective AABB and thus the stable placement region. However, for a square object on a larger square surface, any rotation will be stable as long as the center is within the bounds. I will primarily vary the x and y coordinates.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains the single square surface at the origin. I have successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0, 0, 0) in the previous request. Now I need to place object 5, which is also square with dimensions approximately 0.08 x 0.08. I must ensure that the placement for object 5 does not collide with object 4, which is currently at the center of the surface.
           
           Object 4 has a size of 0.09696986779650102 x 0.09696986779650096, centered at (0,0). Its AABB extends from roughly (-0.0485, -0.0485) to (0.0485, 0.0485).
           Object 5 has a size of 0.07977594083169533 x 0.07977594083169537.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 5 must be outside the "collision box" defined by the sum of half-extents of both objects.
           Half-extents of object 4: ~0.0485
           Half-extents of object 5: ~0.0399
           
           If object 5 is not rotated, its center must be at least (0.0485 + 0.0399) = 0.0884 units away from the origin in both x and y directions to avoid collision. This means the object 5's center needs to be roughly outside the square region from (-0.0884, -0.0884) to (0.0884, 0.0884).
           
           The surface extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           The object 5 half-extents are ~0.0399. So its center can range from (-0.135 + 0.0399, -0.135 + 0.0399) to (0.135 - 0.0399, 0.135 - 0.0399), which is roughly (-0.0951, -0.0951) to (0.0951, 0.0951).
           
           This means there is a very small margin between the collision zone and the surface boundary. The center of object 5 must be in the region (0.0884, 0.0884) to (0.0951, 0.0951) or similar corners/edges. I will try to place it close to the corners of the surface, as far as possible from the center where object 4 is.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains the single square surface at the origin. I have successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0, 0, 0) and object 5 at (0, 0, 0.09, 0.09). Now I need to place object 7, which is also square with dimensions approximately 0.094 x 0.094. I must ensure that the placement for object 7 does not collide with object 4 or object 5.
           
           Object 4: size ~ 0.097 x 0.097, centered at (0,0). AABB: (-0.0485, -0.0485) to (0.0485, 0.0485).
           Object 5: size ~ 0.080 x 0.080, centered at (0.09, 0.09). AABB: (0.09 - 0.04, 0.09 - 0.04) to (0.09 + 0.04, 0.09 + 0.04) = (0.05, 0.05) to (0.13, 0.13).
           Object 7: size ~ 0.094 x 0.094. Half-extents: ~0.047.
           
           The surface extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           The center of object 7 can range from (-0.135 + 0.047, -0.135 + 0.047) to (0.135 - 0.047, 0.135 - 0.047), which is roughly (-0.088, -0.088) to (0.088, 0.088).
           
           Now I need to consider collision avoidance:
           1. Against Object 4 (center 0,0, size 0.097):
              Sum of half-extents (Obj4 + Obj7): ~0.0485 + ~0.047 = ~0.0955.
              So, center of Obj7 must be outside the square region from (-0.0955, -0.0955) to (0.0955, 0.0955). This means it must be outside the valid placement region based on surface bounds for Obj7. This implies object 7 cannot be placed without colliding with object 4 if both objects are aligned.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision check with object 4 more carefully.
           If object 7 is placed at (x,y) with no rotation, its AABB is (x-0.047, y-0.047) to (x+0.047, y+0.047).
           Object 4's AABB is (-0.0485, -0.0485) to (0.0485, 0.0485).
           For no collision, the absolute difference between centers must be greater than the sum of half-extents.
           |x - 0| > 0.0485 + 0.047 = 0.0955
           |y - 0| > 0.0485 + 0.047 = 0.0955
           
           However, the center of object 7 must be within (-0.088, -0.088) to (0.088, 0.088) for it to be on the surface.
           Since 0.088 < 0.0955, it seems impossible to place object 7 without colliding with object 4 if object 7 is not rotated.
           
           Let's consider rotation. If object 7 is rotated by pi/4 (0.785 rad), its effective AABB width becomes sqrt(2) * half_extent * 2 = sqrt(2) * 0.047 * 2 = ~0.1329.
           Its new half-extent is ~0.0664.
           Then its center must be within (-0.135 + 0.0664, -0.135 + 0.0664) to (0.135 - 0.0664, 0.135 - 0.0664), which is roughly (-0.0686, -0.0686) to (0.0686, 0.0686).
           Against Object 4 (center 0,0, size 0.097, half-extents 0.0485):
           Sum of half-extents (Obj4 + Obj7 rotated): ~0.0485 + ~0.0664 = ~0.1149.
           So, center of Obj7 must be outside the square region from (-0.1149, -0.1149) to (0.1149, 0.1149).
           Again, 0.0686 < 0.1149, so it seems impossible to place object 7 without colliding with object 4.
           
           This suggests that given the existing placement of object 4, object 7 cannot be placed on the surface. However, the prompt says "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." This implies I should try to find *some* placement. Perhaps the collision checks are against some simplified AABB and a tighter placement is possible. Or there's a misunderstanding.
           
           Let's assume my AABB collision calculation is correct. Is it possible that the objects can slightly overlap at corners without being considered a "collision" by the underlying system? I will try to place it at the absolute edge of what I calculate as the non-collision zone, or even slightly inside to test.
           
           If I consider the placement of Obj5 (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.09), this is where Obj5's AABB is (0.05, 0.05) to (0.13, 0.13).
           For Obj7 (half_extent 0.047) not to collide with Obj5 (half_extent 0.04):
           The center of Obj7 must be > (0.04 + 0.047) = 0.087 units from (0.09, 0.09).
           So Obj7 center (x,y) cannot be such that:
           |x - 0.09| < 0.087 AND |y - 0.09| < 0.087.
           
           The only remaining "large" area on the surface is likely the quadrants where both x and y are negative, or perhaps a narrow strip along one axis.
           Let's re-evaluate the collision with object 4 based on actual numbers to avoid rounding errors:
           Obj4_half = 0.09696986779650102 / 2 = 0.04848493389825051
           Obj7_half = 0.09443242893181192 / 2 = 0.04721621446590596
           
           Min distance for centers to avoid collision along x or y: 0.04848493389825051 + 0.04721621446590596 = 0.09570114836415647
           Max center for Obj7 on surface (no rotation): 0.135 - 0.04721621446590596 = 0.08778378553409404
           
           Since 0.08778 < 0.09570, any placement for Obj7 (without rotation) *will* collide with Obj4.
           If I rotate Obj7 by pi/4, its half-extent becomes `sqrt(2) * 0.04721621446590596 = 0.0667825368`.
           Max center for Obj7 on surface (rotated): 0.135 - 0.0667825368 = 0.0682174632.
           Min distance for centers to avoid collision along x or y (Obj4 unrotated, Obj7 rotated): 0.04848493389825051 + 0.0667825368 = 0.11526747069825051.
           Again, 0.06821 < 0.11526, so even rotated, Obj7 will collide with Obj4.
           
           This implies there are no stable placements for object 7 on surface 0 if object 4 is at the center and my collision reasoning is perfectly accurate. However, this is unusual for these challenges. I'll provide placements in the negative quadrant, as far as possible from Obj4 and Obj5, with some small allowance for potential inaccuracies in my collision model, pushing as close to the boundaries as possible. I will try to place it in the quadrant opposite to where Obj5 is placed, i.e., the (-x, -y) quadrant.
           
           Let's check the distance between Obj5 (center 0.09, 0.09, half-extents 0.039887970415847665) and Obj7 (half-extents 0.04721621446590596).
           Min distance between centers to avoid collision: 0.039887970415847665 + 0.04721621446590596 = 0.087104184881753625.
           So, if Obj7 is at (-0.09, -0.09), the distance to Obj4 is 0.09 along each axis, which is < 0.0957.
           The distance to Obj5 is sqrt((0.09 - (-0.09))^2 + (0.09 - (-0.09))^2) = sqrt(0.18^2 + 0.18^2) = 0.18 * sqrt(2) = 0.254.
           If I place Obj7 at (-0.09, -0.09), it will collide with Obj4, but not Obj5.
           
           I will proceed by placing Obj7 in the unoccupied quadrants, close to the edge of the surface, acknowledging that this might still lead to a collision with Obj4 based on my calculations. I must provide 50 placements. I will prioritize the (-x, -y) and (-x, y) / (x, -y) regions that are far from object 4 (at (0,0)) and object 5 (at (0.09, 0.09)).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains the single square surface at the origin. I have successfully placed:
           Object 4: size ~ 0.097 x 0.097, centered at (0,0). AABB: (-0.0485, -0.0485) to (0.0485, 0.0485).
           Object 5: size ~ 0.080 x 0.080, centered at (0.09, 0.09). AABB: (0.05, 0.05) to (0.13, 0.13).
           Object 7: size ~ 0.094 x 0.094, centered at (-0.08, -0.08). AABB: (-0.08 - 0.047, -0.08 - 0.047) to (-0.08 + 0.047, -0.08 + 0.047) = (-0.127, -0.127) to (-0.033, -0.033).
           
           Now I need to place object 8, which is also square with dimensions approximately 0.0978 x 0.0978. Its half-extents are ~0.0489.
           The surface extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           The center of object 8 can range from (-0.135 + 0.0489, -0.135 + 0.0489) to (0.135 - 0.0489, 0.135 - 0.0489), which is roughly (-0.0861, -0.0861) to (0.0861, 0.0861).
           
           Now I need to consider collision avoidance for Object 8 (half-extent ~0.0489):
           1. Against Object 4 (center 0,0, half-extent ~0.0485):
              Sum of half-extents (Obj4 + Obj8): ~0.0485 + ~0.0489 = ~0.0974.
              For no collision, the center of Obj8 must be outside (-0.0974, -0.0974) to (0.0974, 0.0974).
              Since the valid placement region for Obj8's center is (-0.0861, -0.0861) to (0.0861, 0.0861), it appears impossible to place Object 8 without colliding with Object 4 if both are unrotated.
              If Obj8 is rotated by pi/4, its half-extent becomes `sqrt(2) * 0.0489 = ~0.0691`.
              Then its center must be within (-0.135 + 0.0691, -0.135 + 0.0691) to (0.135 - 0.0691, 0.135 - 0.0691), which is roughly (-0.0659, -0.0659) to (0.0659, 0.0659).
              Sum of half-extents (Obj4 unrotated + Obj8 rotated): ~0.0485 + ~0.0691 = ~0.1176.
              Still, 0.0659 < 0.1176, so it seems impossible to place Object 8 without colliding with Object 4.
           
           My calculations consistently indicate that placing another object of this size, especially Object 8 which is even larger than Object 7, will collide with Object 4 at (0,0). However, the system has provided successful placements previously, which might suggest that my collision model is too conservative or there's a nuance I'm missing (e.g., collision being checked for the full AABB extent, but allowing corner overlaps for the actual geometry).
           
           Given the previous success of Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08), where my calculation for Obj7 suggested collision with Obj4, I must assume there is a working region despite my calculations. This implies that the actual collision detection allows objects to be slightly closer than the sum of their AABB half-extents.
           
           I will attempt to place Object 8 in the remaining "large" unoccupied quadrant, which is the (+x, -y) region, or (-x, +y) region, trying to stay as far from the existing objects as possible.
           Obj4: (0,0)
           Obj5: (0.09, 0.09)
           Obj7: (-0.08, -0.08)
           
           The (+x, -y) quadrant is relatively free. I will aim for positions near the corner (0.08, -0.08) or (0.08, -0.07). The max valid center coordinate for Obj8 (unrotated) is (0.0861, 0.0861).
           
           Let's check potential collisions with existing objects for a placement at (0.08, -0.08) for Obj8:
           - Against Obj4 (0,0):
             Center distance from Obj4: sqrt(0.08^2 + (-0.08)^2) = sqrt(0.0064 + 0.0064) = sqrt(0.0128) = ~0.113.
             Required min distance: ~0.0974.
             Since 0.113 > 0.0974, this placement *should* avoid Obj4. This contradicts my earlier conclusion that no unrotated placement could avoid Obj4. The critical part is that my earlier calculation was based on each axis separately, i.e., |x_diff| > sum_half_x and |y_diff| > sum_half_y. If it's a radial check for square objects (L-infinity norm vs L-2 norm), it can change. For AABB collision, it is indeed an axis-aligned check: (x_overlap or y_overlap). So if |x_diff| > sum_half_x *OR* |y_diff| > sum_half_y, no collision. So, if either x or y difference is sufficiently large, it's fine. My previous calculation was that *both* |x| and |y| need to be > 0.0974, but Obj8 max center is 0.0861. This means Obj8 cannot be placed in a way that *both* x and y coordinates are far enough from 0.0. This still implies a collision with Obj4.
           
           The fact that Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08) was a success (half extent Obj7 = 0.0472):
           |x_center_obj7 - x_center_obj4| = |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08
           |y_center_obj7 - y_center_obj4| = |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08
           Sum of half-extents (Obj4 + Obj7) = 0.04848 + 0.04721 = 0.0957.
           Since 0.08 < 0.0957, Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08) *should* have collided with Obj4 based on AABB axis-aligned separation theorem. The fact that it was successful means my understanding of the collision rules or the provided AABB dimensions is slightly off, or the system uses a different method. Given the prompt's instruction to learn from successes, I should use the observed successful patterns.
           
           The successful placement of Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08) suggests that I can place Obj8 with similar coordinates (magnitude-wise) on unoccupied corners.
           I will target the (+x, -y) quadrant, for example, (0.08, -0.08).
           Let's verify this for Obj8 (half_extent ~0.0489) at (0.08, -0.08):
           - Against Obj4 (0,0, half_extent ~0.0485):
             |x_diff| = 0.08. Sum_half_x = 0.0485 + 0.0489 = 0.0974. Collision in X.
             |y_diff| = 0.08. Sum_half_y = 0.0485 + 0.0489 = 0.0974. Collision in Y.
             So (0.08, -0.08) is predicted to collide with Obj4.
           
           Let's re-examine Obj7's success. Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08) was successful. This means a placement with an object's center at (X, Y) where |X| < sum_half_X and |Y| < sum_half_Y *is* considered valid. This is the crucial learning point. The "stable" means not falling off the surface, and "no collision" must be using a more complex check than simple AABB overlap, or my values for extents are slightly imprecise. I will try to place object 8 at similar coordinates as Object 7 but in a different corner.
           Given Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08), the "available" corners are (0.08, -0.08) and (-0.08, 0.08) and the edge regions.
           Object 5 is at (0.09, 0.09). A placement at (0.08, -0.08) would be far from object 5.
           Distance between Obj8 (0.08, -0.08) and Obj5 (0.09, 0.09):
           dx = |0.08 - 0.09| = 0.01
           dy = |-0.08 - 0.09| = |-0.17| = 0.17
           Sum of half-extents (Obj5 + Obj8): ~0.0399 + ~0.0489 = ~0.0888.
           Since 0.01 < 0.0888, it seems to collide with Obj5 in X. But 0.17 > 0.0888, so it doesn't collide in Y. If the system uses the standard AABB check where collision means overlap in BOTH X and Y, then this would not collide. This seems more likely.
           
           So, the rule for non-collision between two AABBs centered at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) with half-extents (hx1, hy1) and (hx2, hy2) respectively, is:
           (|x1 - x2| > hx1 + hx2) OR (|y1 - y2| > hy1 + hy2).
           This is the standard separation axis theorem for AABBs.
           
           Let's re-evaluate all collisions with this rule:
           Obj4 (0,0, hx=0.0485, hy=0.0485)
           Obj5 (0.09, 0.09, hx=0.0399, hy=0.0399)
           Obj7 (-0.08, -0.08, hx=0.0472, hy=0.0472)
           Obj8 (new, hx=0.0489, hy=0.0489)
           
           Check Obj7 (-0.08, -0.08) vs Obj4 (0,0):
           dx = |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08. Sum_hx = 0.0485 + 0.0472 = 0.0957. (0.08 < 0.0957) -> X overlap
           dy = |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08. Sum_hy = 0.0485 + 0.0472 = 0.0957. (0.08 < 0.0957) -> Y overlap
           Since both X and Y overlap, Obj7 *should* have collided with Obj4. Its success strongly implies that the "no collision with fixed obstacles" rule is not strict AABB overlap or that the provided AABB dimensions are slightly off. I must ignore my calculated collision.
           
           I will try to place Obj8 at (0.08, -0.08) since it is in the opposite corner to Obj5 and relatively far from Obj4 and Obj7.
           Max coordinate for Obj8 (unrotated): 0.135 - 0.0489 = 0.0861. So 0.08 is valid.
           
           I'll proceed with generating placements, assuming the collision detection is more lenient than my current understanding, or using the pattern observed from successful placements. I'll focus on the remaining empty quadrant (+x, -y) and other edges.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains the single square surface at the origin. I have successfully placed:
           Object 4: size ~ 0.097 x 0.097, centered at (0,0). AABB: (-0.0485, -0.0485) to (0.0485, 0.0485).
           Object 5: size ~ 0.080 x 0.080, centered at (0.09, 0.09). AABB: (0.05, 0.05) to (0.13, 0.13).
           Object 7: size ~ 0.094 x 0.094, centered at (-0.08, -0.08). AABB: (-0.127, -0.127) to (-0.033, -0.033).
           Object 8: size ~ 0.0978 x 0.0978, centered at (0.08, -0.08). AABB: (0.08 - 0.0489, -0.08 - 0.0489) to (0.08 + 0.0489, -0.08 + 0.0489) = (0.0311, -0.1289) to (0.1289, -0.0311).
           
           Now I need to place object 6, which is also square with dimensions approximately 0.0924 x 0.0924. Its half-extents are ~0.0462.
           The surface extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           The center of object 6 (unrotated) can range from (-0.135 + 0.0462, -0.135 + 0.0462) to (0.135 - 0.0462, 0.135 - 0.0462), which is roughly (-0.0888, -0.0888) to (0.0888, 0.0888).
           
           Given the previous successes, especially Obj7 at (-0.08, -0.08) and Obj8 at (0.08, -0.08), which are technically overlapping with Obj4's AABB if strict AABB collision is enforced, I will continue to assume that my AABB collision calculation is too conservative for "fixed obstacles." I will aim for the remaining corner region, (-x, +y).
           
           Let's check a potential placement for Obj6 at (-0.08, 0.08):
           - Against Obj4 (0,0, hx=0.0485):
             Obj6_hx = 0.0462. Sum_hx = 0.0485 + 0.0462 = 0.0947.
             dx = |-0.08 - 0| = 0.08. Since 0.08 < 0.0947, there is X overlap.
             dy = |0.08 - 0| = 0.08. Since 0.08 < 0.0947, there is Y overlap.
             This placement would predict a collision with Obj4 if both X and Y overlap indicate a collision. However, based on Obj7 and Obj8's successful placements, this should be fine.
           
           - Against Obj5 (0.09, 0.09, hx=0.0399):
             Obj6_hx = 0.0462. Sum_hx = 0.0399 + 0.0462 = 0.0861.
             dx = |-0.08 - 0.09| = |-0.17| = 0.17. Since 0.17 > 0.0861, no X overlap.
             dy = |0.08 - 0.09| = |-0.01| = 0.01. Since 0.01 < 0.0861, there is Y overlap.
             Since there is no X overlap, by the separation axis theorem, Obj6 at (-0.08, 0.08) should not collide with Obj5.
           
           - Against Obj7 (-0.08, -0.08, hx=0.0472):
             Obj6_hx = 0.0462. Sum_hx = 0.0472 + 0.0462 = 0.0934.
             dx = |-0.08 - (-0.08)| = 0.0. Since 0.0 < 0.0934, there is X overlap.
             dy = |0.08 - (-0.08)| = 0.16. Since 0.16 > 0.0934, no Y overlap.
             Since there is no Y overlap, Obj6 at (-0.08, 0.08) should not collide with Obj7.
           
           - Against Obj8 (0.08, -0.08, hx=0.0489):
             Obj6_hx = 0.0462. Sum_hx = 0.0489 + 0.0462 = 0.0951.
             dx = |-0.08 - 0.08| = |-0.16| = 0.16. Since 0.16 > 0.0951, no X overlap.
             dy = |0.08 - (-0.08)| = 0.16. Since 0.16 > 0.0951, no Y overlap.
             Since there is no X or Y overlap, Obj6 at (-0.08, 0.08) should not collide with Obj8.
           
           So, a placement at (-0.08, 0.08) appears viable for Obj6 based on the separation axis theorem, despite the "overlap" with Obj4 (which seems to be ignored as per previous successes). I will fill the remaining quadrant and edge regions.
