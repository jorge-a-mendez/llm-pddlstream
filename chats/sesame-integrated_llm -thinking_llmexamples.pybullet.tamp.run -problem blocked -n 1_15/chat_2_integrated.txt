           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, -0.335), (4.535, -0.265)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.555, 0.488), (-4.472, 0.571)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.513, 0.529, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.63, 0.776).

           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **My Planned Action Sequence to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the plan I've formulated. My primary objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition, which boils down to ensuring that an object of a particular type (`v17`) is situated *on* a specific surface (`v18`).
           
           My initial analysis reveals two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, that are of the correct type (`v17`). `v18` is a defined AABB, a surface. I need to get one of them on the surface.
           
           I'll proceed by manipulating `v8`. The initial configuration of this object is `v9`. I've identified through available `kin` facts that `v8` can be placed at pose `p3` which also has a `supported` fact for surface `v18`. Since `p3`'s location is within the AABB of `v18`, this seems feasible.
           
           The plan involves the following sequence of actions:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** I'll first move the robot's base to a configuration `#q0` where the arm `v4` can pick up `v8` from `v9`. This involves a `move_base` action.
           
           2.  **Pick Up Object:** Then, I'll execute a `pick` action to grasp `v8` from `v9` using the defined grasp `#g0` and arm `v4`.
           
           3.  **Move the Base (again):** The robot's base will then move to a configuration `#q1` suitable for placing `v8` on the target surface (`v18`). Again, a `move_base` action.
           
           4.  **Place Object:** Finally, I'll execute the `place` action, placing `v8` at pose `p3` using the same grasp and arm.
           
           The preconditions for each of these actions have been cross-referenced, and all checks out, and the effects will be as intended to lead to `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Given the initial state, the base can move, the arm is empty, and `v8` is in its specified location, and that all actions are permissible. I have no new, unprovided poses that need definition. All defined poses are valid and within the required bounds.
           
           *   *   *
           After this plan is executed, the following truths will be satisfied: `atpose(v8, p3)` and `supported(v8, p3, v18)`, which implies `on(v8, v18)`. Since `type(v8, v17)` is true in the initial state, `on(v8, v18) AND type(v8, v17)` is true, satisfying the axiom. I have confirmed there are no unsafe actions. The actions were all available and can be completed.
           
           I will not add any continuous pose values since no additional `#` pose is needed. The plan is verified and ready for execution.
