           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Geometrical Conundrum**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the conditions set by `new-axiom@0()`, but the inherent geometrical restrictions, combined with the limited movement capabilities of the rovers, make this task impossible. The primary challenge arises from the "imagevisible" predicate, which dictates that a rover must be within a maximum distance of 2 from the target object to capture an image.  Initial state facts state that `imagevisible` is true with various named configurations (`#o3`) and named configuration is tied to a rover that has no way to move to said configurations.
           
           Given that the rovers are fixed at their initial positions (`v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`) due to the available `move` actions, I am geometrically incapable of satisfying the `imagevisible` constraint and thus incapable of taking the required images to satisfy the goal predicate `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`. The distances to these targets exceed the permissible range.  Similarly, the constraints placed on sampling and analyzing rock/soil samples are all met, but if `receivedimage` predicates cannot be met, then the goal predicate is unreachable.
