           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical partition in the middle at x = 0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles throughout the room, some of which are very small. I will try to place the robot at different angles and distances around the target point, ensuring it's within the given x and y limits, and avoiding the large central partition. I will prioritize positions that are closer to the target point, and that offer a good line of sight.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous positions were rejected due to not being reachable or having no line of sight. The target point is at (-2.20, 1.97). This means it is in the top-left quadrant of the room, near the wall.
           Looking at the obstacles:
           - Obstacles 8, 10, 20 are in the top-left quadrant.
           - Obstacle 20 is at ((-2.24, 1.92), (-2.15, 2.02)), which is very close to the target point. This means positions very close to the target might be obstructed by obstacle 20 itself.
           - Obstacle 8 is at ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), which also surrounds the target.
           - Obstacle 10 is at ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), which is further away.
           - The previous positions (-1.31, 0.28) and (-0.81, 0.78) were rejected for being "not reachable". This implies that the path to these points from the target might be blocked by obstacles, or the points themselves might be inside an obstacle.
           - The position (-0.31, -0.28) was rejected for "no line of sight". This is likely due to the central partition (obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))).
           
           Given the target is in the top-left, I should focus on positions within a 2-unit radius from (-2.20, 1.97) and ensure they are not directly within or behind the identified obstacles. I need to be careful with the very small obstacles near the target. I will try positions that are very close to the target point, but slightly offset to avoid potential collisions with the small obstacles, and maintain line of sight.

Model:     My apologies, it seems I made a mistake in the previous response and continued to use the old target point. The *new* target point is (2.177877187728882, 1.8572051525115967). This is in the top-right quadrant of the room, near the wall.
           
           The failures for the *new* target point (2.17, 1.85) were:
           - Proposed position: (-2.0, 0.5) -- no line of sight to target
           - Proposed position: (-1.5, 1.5) -- no line of sight to target
           - Proposed position: (-2.0, 1.0) -- no line of sight to target
           
           These all make sense, as these positions are on the opposite side of the central partition (obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))) from the new target point.
           
           Considering the new target point (2.17, 1.85):
           - Obstacles in this area are: 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)), 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)), 19 ((2.12, 1.80), (2.22, 1.90)).
           - Obstacle 7 covers a significant area around the target.
           - Obstacle 19 is very close to the target point, almost directly overlapping.
           
           I need to find positions within a 2-unit radius from (2.17, 1.85), avoiding the central partition and the nearby obstacles 7 and 19. I will try positions that are very close to the target point but slightly offset to ensure line of sight and avoid collisions with these small obstacles. Since the target is near the upper right corner, I will try to place the robot in that quadrant.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.0)
           (1.5 0.5)
           (2.0 0.0)

Model:     I apologize again for the continued errors in my previous responses. It appears the target point in the feedback logs was different from the one I was actually processing. I must ensure I am using the most recent target point provided.
           
           The *current* target point is (0.24647343158721924, -1.8217300176620483). This point is in the bottom-right quadrant, close to the central partition.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the scene with this new target.
           - The target is at (0.24, -1.82).
           - Obstacle 5 is the central partition ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This partition runs vertically very close to the target point, essentially at x=0. Any position with x <= 0.05 will likely have line of sight issues.
           - Obstacle 17 is at ((1.28, -2.39), (1.40, -2.27)). This is further away, to the right and down.
           
           My previous suggested positions for the *old* target were:
           - (1.0, 1.0)
           - (1.5, 0.5)
           - (2.0, 0.0)
           
           Since these were given for a different target point, their validity for the current target is unknown. However, they are all on the right side of the central partition, which is consistent with the current target's location.
           
           For the current target (0.24, -1.82), I need to find positions within a 2-unit radius. I need to be careful with the central partition (x=0.0) and avoid placing the robot where its line of sight is blocked. I will focus on positions in the bottom-right quadrant, to the right of x=0.05. I'll try to get reasonably close to the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 -1.0)
           (1.5 -1.5)
           (0.5 -1.0)
