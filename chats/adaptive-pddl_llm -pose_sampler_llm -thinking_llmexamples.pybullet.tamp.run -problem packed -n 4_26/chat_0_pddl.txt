(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request: Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, square dimensions: 0.09354513499134054 x 0.09354513499134054) on a square surface (0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))). These placements are characterized by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), with the primary constraint that the object must be entirely within the surface.
           
           Since the object's dimensions are invariant to rotation (it's a square), the bounding box dimensions remain constant for all theta values. I've calculated the half-width and half-height as 0.04677256749567027. This constraint translates to the following valid range for the object's center: -0.08822743250432973 <= x <= 0.08822743250432973 and -0.08822743250432973 <= y <= 0.08822743250432973.
           
           To fulfill the request, I need to generate 50 unique placements. I can achieve this by varying the x, y, and theta parameters. Given the geometry, I'll use surface index 0 for all. To ensure an even spread, I'll establish a grid of 10 x 5 positions, paired with 50 unique angles.
           
           *   **x-coordinates**: I will generate 10 evenly spaced points between -0.08822743250432973 and 0.08822743250432973.
           *   **y-coordinates**: I'll create 5 evenly spaced points within the same range.
           *   **theta values**: I will generate 50 distinct angles evenly spaced from 0 to 2π, excluding 2π.
           
           The coordinates are calculated as follows:
           
           *   x\_min = -0.08822743250432973
           *   x\_max = 0.08822743250432973
           *   y\_min = -0.08822743250432973
           *   y\_max = 0.08822743250432973
           *   x\_coords = np.linspace(x\_min, x\_max, 10)
           *   y\_coords = np.linspace(y\_min, y\_max, 5)
           *   theta\_values = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 50, endpoint=False)
           
           This creates 10x5=50 unique (x, y) combinations. I will assign each pair a unique angle from the 50 angle values, thus achieving a diverse and complete set of placements. I'll construct the list of placements, (0, theta, x, y), and provide the full precision values calculated.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan for placing object ID 5 while avoiding collisions with object ID 6:**
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** We have object ID 5, a square with known dimensions, and we're placing it on surface 0, which also has known dimensions. Object ID 6 is already placed. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 that won't collide with object ID 6.
           
           2.  **Calculate Valid Placement Region:** First, I calculate the allowable region for object ID 5 on surface 0. Because it's a square, this is straightforward: the object's center must be within the surface boundaries, adjusted by the object's half-width. This defines an overall rectangular region.
           
           3.  **Define Collision Region:** Next, I determine where object ID 6's area lies, and then calculate what region object ID 5's center must avoid to prevent collision. Because object ID 5 is square, it is just a matter of keeping the centers separated.
           
           4.  **Isolate Non-Colliding Regions:** To do this I define a "forbidden region" and the overall rectangle is then split up into smaller regions that do not intersect this region. These will be regions that will allow placement that does not collide with the previously placed object.
           
           5.  **Placement Strategy:** I'll generate the placement region by breaking the rectangle into two. I have Region A on the right side. And Region B on the upper side.
           
           6.  **Coordinate Generation:** I then sample 25 points from Region A and 25 from Region B.
               For each valid point, I pair the location `(x, y)` from Region A or B with one rotation in a set of 50 equally spaced rotation.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable and collision-free locations for Object ID 4 on Surface 0.  I have to work around two existing objects, ID 6 and ID 5, already placed on this surface.
           
           **Step 1: Understanding the Playing Field**
           
           I've got Surface 0 defined by its boundaries: `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.  This is my entire valid space.
           
           **Step 2: Existing Obstacles**
           
           *   **Object ID 6:**  It's positioned at roughly `(-0.088, -0.088)` and is a square with a side length of approximately 0.0935. Therefore it takes space from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.041, -0.041)`.
           *   **Object ID 5:**  This square is around `(-0.003, -0.096)` and takes space from `(-0.041, -0.135)` to `(0.035, -0.058)`.
           
           **Step 3: Object ID 4's Characteristics**
           
           Object ID 4 is also a square, with sides of roughly 0.0902.  I need to ensure it's stable and within the bounds. To ensure stability, I'll need to define a stable AABB.
           
           **Step 4: Defining the Safe Zone**
           
           First, I calculate the boundaries for the *center* of Object ID 4. Considering the object's dimensions and the surface limits, Object ID 4's center must be within `[-0.089, 0.089] x [-0.089, 0.089]`.  Then I have to account for existing objects so that object ID 4 won't overlap.
           
           **Step 5: Collision Avoidance and Forbidden Regions**
           
           Here's the crucial part: I need to calculate the *forbidden regions*. These are areas where Object ID 4 *cannot* be placed because it would collide with Object 6 or Object 5.
           
           *   **Forbidden Region 1 (Object 6):**  Object 6's placement restricts object 4's center to outside the rectangle from -0.18 to 0.004 in both x and y. So, the safe region is to the top right of this region.
           *   **Forbidden Region 2 (Object 5):** The second object is placed to the bottom and right. The region where the center of object 4 can't be has x from -0.086 to 0.080 and y from -0.180 to -0.013.
           
           **Step 6: Creating the Valid Placement Space**
           
           Now, I combine all information. The original valid area is a square that has a square taken out from the bottom-left corner and a rectangle removed from the bottom.
           
           *   I figure that the top section is available for placement of object 4. So I generate a series of y, x coordinate pairs in that available area. This area ensures that all placements are valid.
           *   I use a grid spacing, where y starts a bit above 0.0036 and goes up to 0.0755, and x is from -0.089 to +0.089.  
           *   This also lets me create a 50 item space in this region. This is where I can finally place object 4, without collision and in a stable position.
