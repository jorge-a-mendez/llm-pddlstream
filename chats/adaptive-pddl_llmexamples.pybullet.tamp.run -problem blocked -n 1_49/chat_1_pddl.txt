           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true for some object `?green`. From the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So, `?green` can be `v8` or `v12`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. If `v8` or `v12` is at pose `#o2`, then the condition `on(?green, v18)` would be satisfied.
           
           However, the initial state currently has `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. This means that to achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`, we would need to pick up `v8` or `v12` and place it at pose `#o2`.
           
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any object (like `v8` or `v12`) in a way that would lead to `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Since no picking or placing actions are available, and the current `on` facts do not match `on(?green, v18)`, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     I apologize for the previous invalid plan. I understand that the goal `new-axiom@0()` was not achieved by the `move_base` action.
           
           Upon re-evaluating the initial state and the available actions, I can confirm that the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` to be true. As identified previously, `v8` and `v12` are objects of `type v17`. To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, either `v8` or `v12` would need to be at a pose on `v18`. From the initial state, we have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This means if `v8` is at `pose #o2`, then `on(v8, v18)` would be true. Similarly for `v12`.
           
           However, in the initial state, `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)` and `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)`. To move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2` (or `v12` from `v13` to `#o2`), `pick` and `place` actions would be required. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the base of the robot and does not affect the poses of objects or whether they are on a surface.
           
           Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances, it is impossible to change the state of `v8` or `v12` to `atpose(#o2)`. Therefore, the conditions `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` cannot be achieved, and consequently, the goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be satisfied. The goal is unreachable given the current set of available actions.
