           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects and their properties. We have arms `v4` and `v6`, both of which are `handempty`. There are three graspable and stackable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at pose `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and also supported by `v11`. `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that evaluates to true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true for some object `?green`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The `on(?o, ?r)` axiom requires `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           From the initial state, we have:
           - `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v8, #o2)`. If `v8` is at pose `#o2`, then `on(v8, v18)` would be true.
           - `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v12, #o2)`. If `v12` is at pose `#o2`, then `on(v12, v18)` would be true.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)` and `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)`. We need to change their poses. However, the only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not change the pose of any object. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, which are necessary to change an object's pose and consequently its support. Since we cannot move any object, we cannot satisfy the `on(?o, v18)` condition. Thus, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The initial state also contains `on(v8, v11)` and `on(v15, v11)` because `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)` are true, and `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)` are true. However, `v11` is not `v18`.
           
           There are no actions to move objects or to change their supported location, only to move the base. Without `pick` and `place` actions, the robot cannot manipulate any objects to satisfy the goal.
