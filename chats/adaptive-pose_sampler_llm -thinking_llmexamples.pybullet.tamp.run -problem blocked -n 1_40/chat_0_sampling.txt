(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, measuring 0.07 x 0.07, on surface 0, defined by the AABB `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  "Stable" means the object must fit entirely within the surface bounds.  Since this is the first request for this object ID, I don't need to consider any existing object placements for collision.
           
           First, I analyze the valid placement region. The surface's width is 0.6 and height is 0.6.  The object's maximum rotated dimension is 0.07 * sqrt(2) ≈ 0.099.  Given this large discrepancy in size, there's ample space for numerous placements.
           
           I'll generate placements with two distinct rotations:  0 radians (aligned with the axes) and π/4 radians (rotated 45 degrees).  This ensures a variety of actual object orientations.  For both rotations, I'll create a 5x5 grid of center points to ensure spread.
           
           For the 0-radian rotation, I calculate the valid x range as [4.235, 4.765] and the valid y range as [-0.565, -0.035].  The x and y coordinates are given by a `linspace` from min to max.
           
           For the π/4-radian rotation, the valid x range is [4.249497468305832, 4.750502531694168] and the valid y range is [-0.550502531694168, -0.04949746830583196]. The x and y coordinates are also generated using `linspace`.
           
           Finally, I combine both groups of coordinates with the corresponding rotations: the first 25 placements (a 5x5 grid) will be at 0 radians, and the next 25 (also a 5x5 grid) will be at π/4 radians.  This yields 50 stable and distinct placements.  The resulting list of placements will strictly adhere to the provided output format, ensuring the correct `surf_idx`, `theta`, `x`, and `y` values.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Placements for Object 10**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 10) on a given surface, while avoiding collisions with a previously placed object (ID 5). Object 10 has dimensions roughly equal to a 0.075 x 0.075 square, and surface 0 is a rectangle from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Object 5 is located at (4.235, -0.565), which means its AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) is the region from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.27, -0.53).
           
           To find these safe placements, I will create a grid on the surface and try placing object 10 at various grid points. I'll test for collision at each position by checking whether the objects' AABBs overlap. First, I will look at orientations of 0 and then π/4 (45 degrees).
           
           For a zero degree rotation (object not rotated), the x range of the center should be [4.2 + (0.075/2), 4.8 - (0.075/2)] = [4.237, 4.763], and the y range should be [-0.6 + (0.075/2), 0 - (0.075/2)] = [-0.563, -0.037]. I created a grid of 6 x 6 placement points. The collision zone with object 5 should be avoided, and thus for the 0 degree rotation, 5 placements (x-value < 4.307 and y in the second range). I can safely use many of the grid points.
           
           For π/4 rotation, the effective width and height are 0.106. The x and y ranges will be restricted a bit. The grid placement and collision logic remains similar to the 0 degree case. A total of 35 safe points each rotation. Combining the two rotation cases, I get 70 stable placements, so I select the first 50.
