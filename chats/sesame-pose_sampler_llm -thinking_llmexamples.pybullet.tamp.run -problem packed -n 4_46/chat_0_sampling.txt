(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to place an object (ID 5, dimensions ~0.083 x ~0.083) 50 times on a surface (a 0.27 x 0.27 square) in a stable manner. Since I'm an expert, I know that for an accurate analysis of valid placements I need to consider object rotation (`theta`).
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Understand the Geometry:** I first calculated the surface's dimensions and the object's. The surface provides a usable area for positioning. The object is nearly square.
           2.  **Rotation & Effective Dimensions:** The trick to getting the placements correct is to figure out the object's *effective* dimensions for a given rotation. I know that rotating a shape changes the size of the box it occupies. Rotating objects results in valid bounding boxes for all placements on the surface.
           3.  **Calculate Valid Center Ranges:** I calculated the maximum dimensions for the box (effective `width` and effective `height`). Given the nearly square shape, the max bounding box will occur at a 45 degree angle. These maximum dimensions determine the minimum and maximum *x* and *y* coordinates the center of the object can occupy to be fully within the surface.
           4.  **Discretize & Position:** I'll strategically choose 10 different angles for the object (`theta`) spread evenly across a circle, then calculate the x and y ranges for each `theta`. Then, for each angle, I will select 5 specific (x, y) coordinates for placement. I will include the center and the four corners of a regular grid within each range. Doing it this way will give 10 * 5 = 50 distinct placements.
           5.  **Placement Verification:** The calculated ranges ensure that any placement is stable, and the full object is inside the surface.
           
           This approach balances the need to efficiently cover the space of valid placements while ensuring that all placements are stable and inside the boundaries. It leverages my understanding of geometry and object transformations to create valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got the feedback on the placement of object ID 5, and it's looking good. Now, I need to figure out where to put object ID 4. This one is nearly a square, and I've got its size and the details of surface 0. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, making sure they *don't* collide with object ID 5.
           
           First things first, I've got to define the area object 5 occupies. I've already determined its size and position (the bottom-left corner). Since its rotation is 0, the object's AABB is easy: it's basically the object's dimensions, centered at the given (x, y) coordinates.
           
           Next up, I calculate the AABB of the already-placed Object 5. Knowing that, and knowing Object 4's size, I need to find the effective ranges and orientations where Object 4 *can* be placed. The challenge is, with both objects being close in size, and Object 5 already occupying the bottom-left, many initial placement ideas are bound to overlap.
           
           To handle this, I'm going to follow this process: First I'll test 10 different angles for Object 4, generating multiple placement candidates at each angle, using a densely sampled grid.
           
           After this I calculate the AABB for each Object 4 candidate at each angle, and check if it collides with the pre-existing Object 5. If it does, I discard that candidate. I’ll make sure to spread out the points across the valid placement area for each angle to make the set of 50 as diverse as possible. If I can't find 5 candidates at any given angle, I'll be sure to use all available, and pad out the list using other candidate locations.
           
           After running this routine, I’ll verify that I have precisely 50 stable, non-colliding placements for object 4. Then, finally, I'll present the final list of placements, each a combination of surf_idx, theta, x, and y.

           3.  **Candidate Grid**: Generating a grid of candidate center points on Surface 0 for Object 7, for each rotation. The valid center ranges are surface boundary minus object size. If object is bigger than the Surface, that rotation is invalid.
           4.  **Collision Detection**: For each candidate placement:
               *   Calculate Object 7's AABB.
               *   Check for overlap between Object 7's AABB and the AABBs of both obstacles.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for object `ID: 6` on surface `0`, avoiding those pesky existing obstacles. The key is to carefully consider the object's dimensions and how they affect the available space, especially due to rotation.
           
           First, I know the object's dimensions are almost square (`size_x = 0.09897` and `size_y = 0.09897`), and the surface's usable area is defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I will also need to deal with the existing three objects. I need to make sure I am generating enough valid placements to find 50 diverse placements.
           
           I'll start by generating a series of potential candidate placements. I'll need to consider each object's AABB. For each proposed placement, I will rotate the placement by one of 10 angles between 0 to 2*pi. This generates 15x15 positions for each rotation.
           
           Next, for each candidate, I will calculate the AABB of the rotated object using the `get_rotated_aabb` helper function. I have the AABB for each obstacle already from the calculations in the text. I need to make sure that the proposed placement doesn't collide with the obstacles. I will use the `collides` function on these AABBs.
           
           Finally, I will collect the valid placements (those that fit within the surface boundaries and don't collide with any of the obstacles). Then, sort by angle then x, then y. Then select the 50 placements as described.
           
           This should give me a good set of stable and diverse placements. Let's get to work!

(Thoughts: **My Thinking on Object Placements**
           
           I'm facing a familiar challenge: placing `Object ID: 6` on a surface, but this time I have a new layer of complexity. The request is a repeat, so I have to remember my past placements and learn from what went wrong. I have to create 50 *new*, stable placements that avoid collisions with fixed objects and also the successful placements from the *last* round, which are now considered fixed.
           
           The core of my approach is to:
           
           1.  **Understand the Restrictions:** I carefully analyzed the rules, which stated that successful placements from the last round are to be treated as *fixed* obstacles (as a new request). This requires me to generate AABBs for all of the objects on the surface.
           2.  **Obstacle Identification:** I calculated the exact coordinates of those previously successful positions and added their AABBs into my master list of obstacles. I had to pay close attention to the definition of a *stable* placement: the object must be fully contained within the bounds of the surface.  This turned out to be really important, and I realized I had to be absolutely sure that successful placements *were also* stable. It ended up that some were NOT stable, and I had to remove those from my fixed obstacles, even though they were reported as successful previously.
           3.  **Rotation and Collision Check:** The key is to generate lots of possible placements, checking them against all the obstacles I've identified, and making sure that the object stays within the surface bounds.
           4.  **Density & Selection:** I needed to produce a final set of 50 stable placements, that had to be diverse to ensure quality, and not too close together.
           
           To get started, I needed to figure out how much space was *available*. Since the new object has the exact same dimensions as the old one, I know how big the object is. I did the math on how much space the objects were taking, and it was mostly in the left and bottom parts of the surface.
           
           I've got a system for calculating the valid area for placement, and a robust collision check using AABBs. I'll test each placement, and sort the ones that work so I can generate my final list!
