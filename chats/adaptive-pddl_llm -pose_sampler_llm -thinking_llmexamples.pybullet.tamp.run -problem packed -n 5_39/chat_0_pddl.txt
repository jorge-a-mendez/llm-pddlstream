(Thoughts: **Understanding and Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on a given surface (surface 0).  The object is a square with dimensions 0.09136475477614203 x 0.09136475477614203.  Surface 0 is also a square, spanning from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The placements need to be stable, meaning the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) when rotated must be fully contained within surface 0's AABB.  Given the nature of the object as a square, this rotation considerations must be taken into account.
           
           First, I need to define the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) on the surface, keeping in mind that the bounding box size changes with rotation.  If the object is a real physical square, then rotating it will increase the AABB size. When rotated by 45 degrees, the object's bounding box size is increased by a factor of square root of 2. For the more conservative estimate, I assume the rotation will cause the bounding box size increases to its maximum value. I will calculate the conservative range and ensure that I generate placements within the boundaries.
           
           Given the surface boundaries of -0.135 and 0.135 for both x and y.  In order to ensure that the object is fully contained within the surface, x and y ranges are calculated.  
           
           I will discretize the valid range using a grid with 7 steps in both x and y. Then, calculate the placement step: 
           `step_size = (range / 6) = 0.023464886980224206`
             
             The 7 placements values are: 
           `-0.07039466094067262`, `-0.046929773960448414`, `-0.023464886980224208`, `0.0`, `0.023464886980224206`, `0.04692977396044841`, `0.07039466094067262`
           
           By combining these x and y values, 49 stable placements will be generated. The additional, 50th placement is generated using the center coordinates (0,0), and rotated by 45 degrees, with theta = `math.pi / 4`. 
           
           Final placement list: 
           All generated placement tuples are of the format: `(0, theta, x, y)`
           The values of x and y are the seven coordinate points generated above, and theta is 0, except for the 50th placement.
           The 50th placement is (0, math.pi / 4, 0, 0).

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square with side *s* = 0.09658542577059606, on surface 0.  I've already been given the dimensions of the surface, which is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Importantly, I need to make sure none of these placements collide with object ID 7, already placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.07039466094067262, -0.07039466094067262)` with `theta = 0`.
           
           First, I need to figure out the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object 4 for any rotation. Since it's a square, its bounding box's maximum side when rotated will be *s* * sqrt(2) which comes out to  0.1366116041123171.  So, the half-side of the AABB when considering all rotations is  0.06830580205615855.
           
           I've got the surface bounds, so I can start calculating the valid range for the center (x, y) of object 4. I know that the center can't be too close to any surface edge, and I can calculate it from those boundaries.
           
           Next, I need to account for collisions with the existing object ID 7. I've been given the information for object 7's AABB; I know it's a square (dimensions of `w7 = h7 = 0.09136475477614203`, centered on `(-0.07039466094067262, -0.07039466094067262)`. I've calculated its boundaries which help determine whether placements collide. The trick now is to avoid object 7.
           
           Since most of my placements will be at `theta = 0`, I can simplify the collision detection using AABBs. My approach is to generate a grid of potential positions for object 4 where `theta = 0` and check whether the placements collide with object 7. I'll get this grid on the space defined by the surface bounds. After calculating a few collision zones and valid boundaries, I can determine that any objects in the bottom-left of my given valid space will collide.
           
           By doing this I will find 49 positions in a grid.
           The remaining 1 must be at `theta = pi/4` to ensure I've got enough placements.
           I calculate the AABB of that final item.
           Then I find a suitable position.
           
           So, the plan is to use a strategy of AABB calculations and constraints.
           I believe this process allows me to find a set of 50 non-colliding placements for object ID 4.
