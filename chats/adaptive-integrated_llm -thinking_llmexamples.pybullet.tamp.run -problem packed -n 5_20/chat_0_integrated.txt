           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.048, 0.516, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.592, 0.806).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting several objects onto `v20`.  Simple enough, right?  The plan is to achieve:
           
           *   `on(v8, v20)`
           *   `on(v12, v20)`
           *   `on(v14, v20)`
           *   `on(v16, v20)`
           *   `on(v18, v20)`
           
           This requires each object to be `supported` by `v20` and to be `atpose` on `v20`.  Initially, all these objects are resting on `v11` and have their respective positions.  The robot has two empty arms, `v4` and `v6`, at their initial configurations, and a base configuration `v3`.
           
           Now, the available action, `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, is, frankly, useless. It just moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, a no-op that doesn't affect anything relevant to the task (object positions, arm configurations, or the ability to grasp/place objects).
           
           Let's look at the preconditions for the critical `pick` and `place` actions that I'd need. I need to fulfill these to move the objects:
           
           *   `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)` - This is the crucial missing link. I need a valid kinematic solution, which is basically an inverse kinematics solution (IK). This means my robot arm has to have a way of solving a joint angles solution to a specific pose.
           *   `atpose(?o, ?p)` - True for all objects to be moved
           *   `handempty(?a)` - True for v4 and v6
           *   `atbconf(?q)` - `atbconf(v3)` is true. So `?q` must be `v3`
           *   `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(?o, ?p, ?g)` - None
           *   `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(?t)` - None
           
           The `place` preconditions are similarly problematic, requiring `kin` and needing to know `atgrasp(?a, ?o, ?g)`, which isn't true at the start.
           
           **The Problem: No IK Solutions**
           
           The core issue? There are NO `kin` facts in the initial state, and my *only* action, `move_base`, can't generate them! No `kin` means no `pick`, no `place`, and therefore, no way to achieve the goal of moving the objects.
           
           I've carefully checked for any hidden assumptions or ways to derive `kin`. Types and predicates are correct, and axioms are absent for an IK solver. The action list explicitly *limits* me to the useless `move_base` action.
           
           So, it's clear:  **This goal is unreachable.** The given constraints (initial state and limited action set) make it impossible to move the objects as required.
