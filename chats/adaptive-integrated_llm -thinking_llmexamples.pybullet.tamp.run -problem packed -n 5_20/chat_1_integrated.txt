           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan for the strategic transfer of five distinct objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their initial positions to the designated surface v20.  The fundamental actions at my disposal are `pick` and `place`, which will be iteratively applied to each object. Although the `move_base` action is available, its application isn't strictly necessary as the start and end configurations are identical, resulting in no positional change and zero associated cost.
           
           The overarching goal, in logical terms, is the attainment of the `on(object, v20)` predicate for each object. This translates into the need for an `atpose(object, #p_object_v20)` and a `supported(object, #p_object_v20, v20)` state for each of the target objects. The current state of these objects is as follows: v8, v12, v14, v16 and v18 are supported and positioned on v11, and the objective is to reposition them to v20.
           
           I am operating with arm v4, given its available `kin` facts.  I must make use of grasping (#o1) with base configurations (#o3) and arm trajectories (#o4). Since the problem explicitly states that I must provide specific values for object poses, I'll define distinct poses, denoted by `#o2`, for each object on v20, ensuring collision-free placement.
           
           The plan will proceed in a straightforward manner: a repeated sequence of `pick` and `place` actions executed on arm v4 for each object. The `pick` will grasp the object from its original pose, using a grasp (#o1).  The base and trajectory are provided in the `kin` facts as #o3 and #o4. Then, the object is placed to a newly defined `#o2` pose on v20, using the same grasp for the `place` action.
           
           The key considerations for `#o2`, which represents the pose on v20, are:
           -  Each object requires a unique value for `#o2` on surface v20.  Collision avoidance is paramount.
           -  The target positions for each object on v20 are:
              - v8:  (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
              - v12: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781)
              - v14: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
              - v16: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781)
              - v18: (0, 0, 0.781)
           
           The predicted cost is 10, considering 5 `pick` and 5 `place` actions.  All preconditions for the actions are satisfied, and I've ensured a collision-free configuration on the target surface.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user presented a plan, but it's completely shot down because it includes invalid actions. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Seems pretty useless, right?
           
           Here's the problem: the objective is to get five objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` – onto the surface `v20`.  And, the initial state shows all the objects supported on `v11`.
           
           To achieve `on(?o, v20)`, the robot clearly needs to pick up these objects from their current locations using a `pick` action and then put them down on `v20` using a `place` action. That's the only way it can be done. However, `move_base` doesn't do any of that. It only moves the robot from one location to another.
           There is no plan using the specified actions that will produce a viable plan to reach the goal. It's a dead end. I'll need to inform the user that this task is impossible with the limited action space.
