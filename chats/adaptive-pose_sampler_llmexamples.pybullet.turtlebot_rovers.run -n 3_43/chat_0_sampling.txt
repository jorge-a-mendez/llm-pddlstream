User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a perimeter of obstacles (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). There's also a long obstacle (5) in the middle, running vertically, and a smaller one (6) in the bottom-left quadrant. Several other small obstacles are scattered throughout the environment. Given these obstacles, I will try to find positions for the robot base that are within the max distance of 2 from the target point and avoid these obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are clearly in open spaces and that provide good views of the target.

Model:     The previous positions were all far from the target point and had no line of sight, likely due to obstacle 5. The target is at (-0.43, 2.06), which is in the upper-left quadrant. I will try to find positions within 2 units of the target that are not blocked by the central obstacle (5) or the various smaller obstacles in the upper region. I will prioritize positions that are closer to the target, possibly on the same side of obstacle 5.

Model:     My apologies, I made a mistake in the previous response and did not properly use the feedback. The previous positions were all invalid. I will re-evaluate based on the provided target point and all previous failures.
           
           Target point is (-0.4337168335914612, 2.06303071975708, 0.20100000500679016).
           The previous proposed positions all failed:
           (-1.31976, -1.06648) -- no line of sight
           (-0.76342, -0.86438) -- no line of sight
           (-0.43093, -0.66572) -- no line of sight
           
           The initial positions were far from the target. The target is in the upper part of the map. Obstacle 5 is at x = 0, separating the left and right halves. The target is slightly to the left of this central obstacle. Obstacles 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 21 are also in the upper part of the map, near the target. I need to find positions within 2 units of (-0.43, 2.06) that are not obstructed.
           
           Let's try to stay on the left side of obstacle 5 and avoid the clusters of small obstacles in the upper left.

Model:     Okay, I am still failing to find valid positions, and I now have more information regarding the fixed obstacles. The target point has changed to (-1.9958940744400024, 1.89646577835083, 0.20100000500679016).
           
           Previous failures for *this* target point:
           (-0.43372, 1.5) -- not reachable for robot base (This is too far from the target. The robot must be within max_range=2 from target)
           (-1.0, 1.0) -- collides with obstacle 17 ((-1.007, 0.807), (-0.889, 0.925))
           (-1.5, 2.06303) -- no line of sight to target
           
           The target point is now at roughly (-2.0, 1.9). This is in the upper-left corner of the map. Obstacle 19 ((-2.042, 1.850), (-1.949, 1.942)) is very close to the target, almost surrounding it. Obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) is also a large obstacle in this region. Given the proximity of obstacle 19 and 8 to the target, finding a position that has line-of-sight and does not collide will be challenging.
           
           I need to find positions that are within 2 units of (-2.0, 1.9), avoiding obstacle 8, 19, and any other nearby obstacles like 6. I will try positions that are slightly offset from the target, attempting to peer around the closest obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.0 0.5)

           Let's review all the failed positions for this target point:
           (-0.43372, 1.5) -- not reachable for robot base (too far from target)
           (-1.0, 1.0) -- collides with obstacle 17
           (-1.5, 2.06303) -- no line of sight
           (-2.0, 0.5) -- no line of sight (This is too far in y from the target)
           (-0.5, 1.9) -- no line of sight (Obstacle 5 or other obstacles might be blocking this view)
           (-1.0, 2.2) -- no line of sight (Obstacle 8 or 10 or others might be blocking)
           
           The target is at (-2.0, 1.9). This is very close to obstacle 19 ((-2.042, 1.850), (-1.949, 1.942)) and within obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). It's likely that direct approaches are obstructed.
           
           I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target and clear of obstacles 8 and 19.
           
           Given the density of obstacles around the target, I will try to position the robot such that it can look *over* or *around* the obstacles. I'll focus on positions further away from the dense cluster, but still within the 2-unit range.

           All previous positions for the *new* target point failed due to "no line of sight to target":
           (-2.2, 0.0)
           (-2.2, 1.0)
           (-1.8, 0.5)
           
           These were indeed far from the new target point and likely completely obstructed by the central obstacle (5) or the walls (1, 3, 4). My previous reasoning was based on the *old* target point. I need to focus on the current target point (1.85, 2.15).
           
           Obstacles in this region include:
           1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - top wall
           3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - right wall
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - a significant obstacle very close to the target
           20: ((1.801, 2.104), (1.900, 2.203)) - another small obstacle extremely close to the target
           
           The target (1.85, 2.15) appears to be within or directly next to obstacle 7 and 20. This makes finding a clear line of sight very challenging. I will try to find positions within 2 units of the target, specifically aiming to be *just outside* these obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.85 0.5)
           (0.5 2.15)
