User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.103, 0.439), (0.197, 0.533)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.099, 0.266), (0.187, 0.354)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.196, -0.54), (0.274, -0.463)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.186, 0.478), (-0.102, 0.562)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.252, 0.179), (-0.159, 0.272)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.15, 0.486, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.52, 0.854).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.143, 0.31, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.988, -0.156).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.235, -0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.054).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.144, 0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.623, 0.782).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.206, 0.225, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.534, 0.845).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto `v20`. This requires five distinct pick-and-place operations.  I’ve identified that the PR2 robot's arm `v4` is the appropriate tool for the job, as all the necessary `kin` actions for this arm are available. I'll need to use poses denoted by `#o2` on `v20`. The initial state gives me a clear picture: the robot is stationary at base configuration `v3` with an empty hand, and the objects are currently supported by surface `v11` at various poses. Surface `v20` is our target.  My task boils down to defining a valid sequence of pick and place actions, ensuring each object is moved from its initial pose to a collision-free placement on `v20`.
           
           The key is devising the place actions.  I must select five distinct `x, y` coordinates within the bounds of `v20`, AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I will define `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12` etc. to keep track.  I've decided to arrange the objects in a 3x2 grid to make the most of the surface area. I'll create a 3x2 grid on `v20` with the objects placed at z=0.781 (the initial z value, given the `kin` and current location of objects and surfaces).
           
           I now have a clear plan: I will go through each object in a sequence of pick-and-place actions. The problem implies no movement of the base, so `v3` is our static starting point. Each pick will require an available kin action to grab the object from the starting position, and place it at one of the `#o2` locations.
           
           To summarise, the plan will use a total of 10 actions, resulting in a cost of 10. The plan will move objects one by one and is the minimum-cost solution given the predicates.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v8 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v12 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v14 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v16 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 v18 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Implausibility of the Current Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a pretty restrictive setup here. The user correctly pointed out that the only legal action I can take is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's... not exactly a plan.  Essentially, I can *move* my base from a point to the *exact same* point using a trajectory labeled `#o0`.  This immediately raises a red flag. My goal is to achieve `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`.  The `on` predicate is defined as both `supported` *and* `atpose` being true.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see that all the objects are currently *supported* at `v11`, not `v20`. The preconditions that are true right now:  `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. The goal is to get it to `v20`. The same is true for all other objects.  Essentially, all the objects are stacked on `v11` initially, and my objective is to move all the objects to `v20`.
           
           The problem? My only permitted action *doesn't change anything relevant*. It doesn't modify the state of any objects; it just does a meaningless base movement from a point to itself.  I need actions that can actually manipulate these objects, like picking them up and placing them down – actions that *affect* the `atpose` predicate.  However, my list of legal actions doesn't include *any* of those! This `move_base` action does not in any way lead to or enable the required manipulation.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of only being able to execute `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I'm forced to conclude that the goal state is *unachievable*. It's a dead end. I'm essentially stuck in a loop.
