           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.069, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.103).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.323, 0.027), (-4.24, 0.11)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Elaboration and Plan Formation**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with achieving a specific goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked. It boils down to getting an object, which I'll call `?green`, onto a surface, `v18`. To be precise, it means I need to make `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I know from the starting point that I have the objects `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates for `?green` because they have `type(?, v17)`.
           
           Now, let's explore how to get something "on" something else. The axiom for `on(?o, ?r)` expands to needing `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  So, for my case of getting either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`, I need a plan. 
           
           **Plan Candidate: Placing Object v8 on Surface v18**
           
           Let's assume `v8` is a viable `?green` candidate. It seems feasible with the starting predicates. I have a plan in mind:
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll need to reconfigure the base for the robot arm so that it's close enough for pick and place operations, using `move_base`.
           2.  **Pick:**  Then, I'll "pick" `v8` from its initial pose (we know from initial state it's located at `v9`) using an arm, `v4`.
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll "place" `v8` onto `v18` at a new target pose, `#o2`. I know `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` from initial state so, placing `v8` on pose `#o2` will make `on(v8, v18)` become true.
           
           **Geometric Considerations and AABB Containment**
           
           Now, I'm also informed that for `?o` to be on `?r`, the pose must be valid. This means that if pose `#o2` is provided, that I must check the geometric alignment of both objects. For this, I am provided with AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) definitions:
           
           -   `v8`: ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))
           -   `v18`: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))
           
           In order to be considered in a "stable placement", my final placement's AABB for `v8` must be fully within `v18`'s bounding box. 
           If this is the case, and I must adhere to strict AABB boundaries for stable placement, then my plan is not valid. The XY ranges between `v8` and `v18` do not overlap, so it's a no-go in this interpretation.
           
           However, if "stable" means something else - like a valid placement for the `supported` relationship - then I may be ok. In fact, if the `supported` relationship *is* valid, it implies that the robot may have some "pick up and place" action that is geometrically valid. So, I will be a bit more creative in my placement. I know that `stackable(v8,v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.
           For example, I could place `v8` centered on v18 in its x-range, and y-range *aligned to the top edge*.
           
           **Final Plan and Coordinate Determination**
           
           To resolve my issues in positioning, I'll refine this. Since I'm using the `supported` axiom, the key is to ensure the plan satisfies. I'll take all that into account, and define a pose `#o2` using the following:
           
           - X = 4.5, which will center `v8` within `v18`'s x-range
           - Y = -0.3 , the y value I've calculated is along the top edge of `v18`.
           - Z = 0.8  (based on `atpose` in the initial state)
           - Theta = 0.
           
           Based on these considerations, my pose is valid and allows me to conclude that  `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied, since `on(v8, v18)` is true. The steps are:
           1. `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`
           2.
