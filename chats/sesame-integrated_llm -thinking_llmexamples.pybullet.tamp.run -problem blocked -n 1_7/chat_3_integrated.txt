           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.069, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.103).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).

           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Simplification**
           
           My immediate goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but that's just a conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Luckily, I have `type(v12, v17)` already, meaning ?green has to be `v12`. Now I only need to get `v12` *on* `v18`.
           
           That "on" condition means I need to get the object into a supported and properly-posed state. From the initial state, I can see that this means I want to move `v12` to a place where `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true.
           
           **Action Planning and Precondition Checks**
           
           I'll need to use pick and place actions, and I need to check the preconditions for each. I know from the initial state that `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)` are true and need to change to `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           I have these action instances available:
           
           -   `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           -   `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           I can see from the available actions that I need a base configuration (`#o3`) for both the pick and place. Since the available `kin` predicates indicate the same `#o3` is usable in pick *and* place, it should be possible with a `move_base` action before either. This action has several variants, but I'll use the one to move the base from `v3` to a new pose `#o3`:
           
           -   `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`
           
           **Base Configuration Considerations**
           
           The key to the plan hinges on where I decide to place this base configuration, `#o3`. I'll need a way to reach the pick and place locations, in other words the arm has to be able to get to `v13` (where the object currently is) and `#o2` (where it needs to be). It's crucial that I can use a single `#o3` for both pick and place because that is the way the kin predicates are designed. This will minimize the cost of base motion (as well as overall plan cost). The ideal scenario is that I can place `#o3` close to `v3`, which is at `(2.5, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           **Final Action Sequence**
           
           My final plan looks like this:
           
           1.  `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`
           2.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           **Continuous Value Determination**
           
           The only pose I have to determine is for `#o2`, which describes where I want `v12` to be *placed*. Since `v18` AABB is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, I choose a central location, `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. The last number, `0.0`, is an orientation.
           I also have `#o0` (the base trajectory) to be specified. I will keep it simple and assume a straight-line. Finally, I assume `#o4` which is an arm trajectory, can be found.
           
           **Important Note**
           
           It appears I do not need to provide a continuous value for `#o3` (a base configuration) because it does not have an associated `pose(obj, #o3)` in the initial state. The plan cost will be the movement distance between `v3` and `#o3` plus 2 (the cost of `pick` and `place`).
