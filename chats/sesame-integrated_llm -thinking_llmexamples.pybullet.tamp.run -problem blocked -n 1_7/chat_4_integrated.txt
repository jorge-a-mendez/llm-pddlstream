           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.069, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.103).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.323, 0.027), (-4.24, 0.11)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Goal Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing to have object `v12` "on" surface `v18` and its type being `v17`. The initial state gives me that `v12` has type `v17`, so I just need to get `v12` on `v18`. Looking at the "on" axiom, that means I need to make sure `v12` is supported by `v18` and is at a specific pose. From the initial state, I can see that `v12` is *already* supported by `v18` at a pose `#p1`, so I just need to make `v12`'s current pose `#p1`. Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           **Planning the Actions**
           
           To get `v12` to `#p1`, I need to pick it from `v13` and place it at `#p1`. I need to figure out how to manipulate `v12` with an arm (`v4` is available) in order to do so.
           
           *   **Move Base to Pick:** First, I need to move the robot's base to a configuration (`#q2`) that's appropriate to pick up `v12`. I find an available `move_base` action. The preconditions state that the base needs to be able to move and to have a starting position.
           *   **Pick Up:** I see that the action `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t4)` will achieve picking up `v12` from its initial pose. I check the preconditions: the arm needs to be empty, `v12` needs to be in pose `v13`, and the robot base must be in `atbconf(#q2)`.
           *   **Move Base to Place:** After picking up `v12`, I need to move the robot base again to a suitable configuration (`#q3`) for placing it at `#p1`.
           *   **Place Object:** Finally, I find the action `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t6)` to place `v12` at the desired pose.
           
           **The Full Action Sequence**
           
           Therefore, my plan looks like this:
           
           1.  `move_base`: Move the robot base from `v3` to configuration `#q2`.
           2.  `pick`: Pick `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`.
           3.  `move_base`: Move the robot base from configuration `#q2` to configuration `#q3`.
           4.  `place`: Place `v12` at pose `#p1` using arm `v4`.
           
           **Addressing Continuous Parameters**
           
           I am told that `#p1` needs a continuous numerical value. Since the system has stated `pose(v12, #p1)` is in the initial state, and `v12` needs to be supported, I must select an appropriate pose.
           
           I will define the pose for `v12`'s placement on `v18`. From the scene, the best location is within the boundaries of `v18`, with some margin. I calculate a target location in the center of `v18` using a `z` value of `0.801`, as this is a table, I will assume it can be placed here. As a result, I define the pose as `(4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0)`.
           
           **Safety Checks & Optimizations**
           
           I have carefully assessed the problem and checked for potential collisions using the AABB. Both objects are sufficiently separated in their poses.
           
           The actions I have planned appear optimal given the constraints of the problem and the available information. Now, it is time to execute the plan.
