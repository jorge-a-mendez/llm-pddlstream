           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.069, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.103).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).

           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having the object `v12` placed "on" the object `v18` and ensuring `v12` is of type `v17`.**
           
           First, I recognized that `v12` must be placed on `v18`. I know from the initial state that `v12` is initially located at `v13`, and the robot's arm is empty.  My strategy will be to use the robot to pick up `v12` and place it on `v18`.
           
           Here's the detailed breakdown of the plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** The robot needs to be in a base configuration, which I'll denote as `#q2`, that allows the robot arm to pick up `v12` from its current pose `v13`. I'll issue a `move_base` command from the current base configuration `v3` to `#q2`.
           2.  **Pick Up:** Once the robot is at `#q2`, I'll use the `pick` action to pick up `v12` from `v13` with the robot arm `v4`.
           3.  **Move Base (Again):** After picking up the object, the robot needs to move to another base configuration, `#q3`, that allows the robot arm to place the object on the surface `v18`.
           4.  **Place:** Finally, I'll use the `place` action to place `v12` on `v18`, now at pose `#p1`. I need to ensure `#p1` provides a collision-free and stable placement for `v12` on the surface. Since I'm using an object `#` that already appears in the initial state as a `pose`, I must provide a continuous value, `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`, for this variable. This placement seems reasonable and stable.
           
           This plan achieves the desired `on` condition by placing `v12` at `pose(#p1)` which is supported by `v18`.  Given `type(v12, v17)` is already in the initial state, the plan satisfies the conditions for `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Given what I can deduce from the initial state (object sizes, pose information, and available actions), this plan appears to be sound and optimal, minimizing the number of actions. The exact positions for `#q2` and `#q3` are to be inferred by the planning system, but the *sequence* of actions, and the required `#p1` are fully determined.
