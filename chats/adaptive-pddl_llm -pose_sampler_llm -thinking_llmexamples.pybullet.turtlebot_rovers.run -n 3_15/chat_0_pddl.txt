           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down the problem and outlining the sequence of actions. As a domain expert, I'm making several key assumptions about how the configurations work within this planning context.**
           
           First, I need to achieve the following:
           
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v1)`)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v5)`)
           
           I'll use `v12` to handle image acquisition and `v14` for sample analysis and sending.
           
           **For images (`v12`):**
           
           I need a camera calibration step before taking each image, using the rover's initial configuration at `v13`. I'll assume that the continuous parameters (#o3, #o0) and `v13` (where `atconf(v12, v13)`) are the same or valid configurations, which is necessary, given that `imagevisible` and `comvisible` both use those variables. This also implies that `v13`, `#o3`, and `#o0` are equivalent, and if `v12` is at `v13`, it is already at the correct configurations for all relevant steps. Since there are no move actions provided to actually move the rover from `v13` to any other configuration, it's a reasonable assumption in this context.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           
           1.  `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           4.  `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5.  `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6.  `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           7.  `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v19, v10)`
           8.  `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           9.  `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           **For analysis and transmission (`v14`):**
           
           Similar to my image analysis, I'll need to assume `v15`, `#o5` and `#o0` are the same configurations for rover v14.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           
           1.  `sample_rock(v14, v15, v1, v16)`
           2.  `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v1)`
           3.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           4.  `sample_rock(v14, v15, v5, v16)`
           5.  `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v5)`
           6.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           I've carefully checked all preconditions, given those critical assumptions, and everything checks out. All the required predicates should be satisfied at the end of this sequence, satisfying `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v1 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 v15 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, the user flagged that I used invalid actions. Time to dig in. I need to carefully re-examine the problem statement and, specifically, the permitted actions. The list they gave me is incredibly restrictive. It's essentially:
           
           *   **Move:** These are self-loops; `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  They don't affect `atconf`, and they don't seem to be helping.
           *   **Drop Rock:** `(drop_rock v12 v16)` and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`. The catch is that these require `full(v12, v16)` or `full(v14, v16)` respectively, which are false in the initial state since the stores are *free*.
           
           Now, the goal. It's `new-axiom@0()`, which needs:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`  (True already)
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`  (True already)
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`  (True already)
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`  (True already)
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7.  `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9.  `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           To get those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, I'm going to need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, or even a `calibrate`.  But those *aren't* in the list of valid actions.
           
           So here's the problem: I have a goal that demands image and analysis receipt, but the *only* available actions are useless self-loops and impossible rock drops. It's a dead end. I'm going to have to tell the user that this goal is unachievable given the constraints.
