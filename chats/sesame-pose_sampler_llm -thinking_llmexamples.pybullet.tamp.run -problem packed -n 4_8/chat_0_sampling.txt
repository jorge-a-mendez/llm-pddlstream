(Thoughts: **Analysis of Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface.  The object's base size is 0.08765399884556513 units, and the surface is defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Essentially, I'm dealing with a smaller square on a larger square.
           
           I know stability means the entire object's bounding box must fit within the surface's boundaries.  The object is rotating, so the effective size changes with the rotation angle (theta). For a square, the effective size isn't a simple calculation as it depends on the absolute values of sine and cosine of theta. It is minimized at multiples of pi/2 and maximized at multiples of pi/4.
           
           To make this efficient, I calculated the effective size variations. The square's dimensions are greatest diagonally (at 0.123956 units), and this is well within the surface dimensions (0.27 units on a side). That means the object can always be placed.
           
           Now, the trick is to generate a diverse set of placements. I'll pick 10 different angles between 0 and pi (0 to 180 degrees) with steps of pi/10 (0.314159 rad) and for each of these angles, I'll generate five placements for x and y. These rotations will allow me to generate a broad coverage of the surface.
           Given that for a square object, the dimensions repeat with respect to angles and due to symmetry of both objects, I could have used fewer rotations, but it is important to explicitly generate 50 positions to avoid any ambiguity, even if some dimensions are the same.
           I can then calculate the valid range for x and y for each rotation.
           
           Let's make sure I'm getting the angles right, I need diversity.
           I will pick positions by placing them in the center of the surface, with offsets.
           Then I must iterate over the positions, and rotate the object.
           
           I've carefully calculated the limits of x and y for each of these 10 theta values. I need to make sure I don't go outside the box and ensure coverage for diverse placements.
           For each angle, I am picking a combination of offsets like `(-0.05, -0.05)`, `(0.05, 0.05)`, `(-0.05, 0.05)`, `(0.05, -0.05)`, and `(0, 0)` that will yield the required locations.  I've confirmed that these offsets fall within the boundaries I've established.
           
           I've generated 50 positions with a variety of angles, and the object's boundaries should never go outside the surface.  Since this is a new object with ID 4, I don't have to account for any existing collisions. The strategy is now validated and ready.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 7**
           
           Okay, so I've received successful feedback on object ID 4, specifically the placement at (0, 0.0, -0.05, -0.05).  I've confirmed that places it on surface 0, with a rotation of 0, and a center at (-0.05, -0.05). Its dimensions are roughly 0.087, and I've carefully calculated its x and y ranges. Now, I need to find 50 stable placements for a new object, ID 7, on the same surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with object 4.
           
           Object 7 is also a square with dimensions of about 0.075.  My plan is to iterate through various rotations (from 0 to pi/10) and test different center positions.  I've established a grid of potential center points for the new object: -0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, and 0.08 in both the x and y directions.
           
           For each potential placement, I'll calculate the new object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box).  I'll then perform two critical checks. First, I'll ensure that the object's AABB doesn't extend beyond the surface boundaries.  Second, I'll check for collision with Object 4. To check collision, I'll compare the AABBs using the standard intersection test. Overlap means there's a collision. I know the AABB of Object 4, which is approximately in the -0.09 to -0.006 range in both x and y.
           
           The AABB collision calculation will allow me to precisely check for overlaps. It will consider effective side length of a square. So, if my object's AABB overlaps Object 4's AABB, I know I need to eliminate this position.  I'll only keep placements that pass both the surface boundaries and collision tests. I expect that I should find over 50 placements that don't collide. By being careful about center positions, I can guarantee that. I am also calculating the effective side length based on the rotation.
           
           After checking for the collision with Object 4, for each x- and y-coord and each rotation, I'll have a list of valid (non-colliding) locations.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 5**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 5) on surface 0.  I need to make sure these placements avoid any collisions with previously placed square objects, ID 4 and ID 7, also on surface 0.
           
           My strategy involves analyzing the geometry and constraints.  The surface is a square of size `0.27` centered at (0,0), so valid center points for object 5 need to stay within this boundary considering its variable size based on its rotation, represented by `theta`. The effective size of object 5, `effective_size_5`, which dictates its AABB, changes with rotation. I know it ranges between `0.087317` and `0.12347`.  That means valid (x,y) coordinates for the center are roughly within  `[-0.073265, 0.073265]`.  
           
           I have to carefully evaluate the current AABBs of the already placed objects to make sure object 5 has no overlap. Object 4's AABB sits mostly in the bottom-left quadrant, and object 7's AABB is mostly in the bottom-right quadrant.  These two objects do not collide.
           
           To efficiently find valid placements, I'll strategically check for collision-free zones. I'll consider combinations of theta values (10), and  various x and y centers:  `[-0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07]`. This gives `250` possibilities. I will also check with a collision function.
           
           For efficiency, I'll focus on placing object 5 in the upper part of the surface where collisions are less likely because existing objects are situated on the bottom. In the analysis of placing y = `0.07` and varying x and thetas, I have observed that all of those possibilities are not colliding. Thus, any combinations of `x` and `theta` and `y = 0.07` is valid.
           
           Hence, I generate 50 valid placements simply using y = 0.07.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding 50 Stable Positions**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on a surface (Surface 0), while avoiding collisions with three other objects already placed there (IDs 4, 7, and 5).  My primary constraint is to keep the new object within the surface bounds, which are defined by an AABB of  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've calculated the dimensions and AABBs of all objects and the ranges for the new object. Object 6 is a square, and its effective size, and thus its AABB, changes with rotation. To be safe, I'm considering the largest possible AABB for Object 6, which occurs at a 45-degree angle. This means the allowed center for the new object is constrained within a smaller region.
           
           I determined that the valid center range for Object 6's AABB is approximately `[-0.066, 0.066]` for both x and y.
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll iterate through a grid of possible center points for Object 6, with varying orientations (theta), and check for AABB overlaps. I realized that picking simple quadrants isn't sufficient due to the object's size and rotations. The Python script will generate all the possible placements. I will select the x_coords and y_coords and loop through 10 thetas to find valid locations.
           
           I've pre-calculated AABBs for the existing objects and will use these values to check if there are overlaps.
           
           Based on the existing object locations and their sizes, there are several regions of free space. I focused on trying `x=0.06` and `y=0.06`. Since it is outside of the AABBs of Objects 4, 5, and 7, there won't be a collision. I will iterate through a loop of centers and angles to obtain the final placement configurations.
