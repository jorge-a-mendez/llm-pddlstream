(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 4**
           
           My primary goal is to provide 50 stable placements for the object with ID 4, which is essentially a square with dimensions (0.0978, 0.0978), on a square surface (0,0) with dimensions (0.27, 0.27) centered at (0,0) .  A stable placement requires the object to be entirely within the surface bounds.
           
           Given the square nature of both the object and the surface, and the fact that rotating the square object by multiples of 90 degrees doesn't change its bounding box, I'll optimize placement by using orientations of 0 and 45 degrees.  For 0 degrees rotation, the object's center has the largest valid range. For a 45-degree rotation the valid region will be smaller.
           
           Specifically, I'll place 49 of the objects with a rotation of 0.0 degrees across a 7x7 grid.  The center points of the objects should be at:

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placement Locations for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got the feedback on the placement of Object ID 4, which is great. Now, I need to figure out where to put Object ID 5, a square roughly 0.0948 units on each side. The only space available is a square table (Surface 0) that's 0.27 x 0.27 units, centered at the origin.
           
           First, I need to figure out the stable placements for Object ID 5 on the table, assuming no collisions. I've got the math for that, working out the valid ranges for the center coordinates (x and y) of Object ID 5, and it comes out to roughly -0.0876 to 0.0876 for both.
           
           Now the catch: Object ID 4 is already placed at (-0.086, -0.086). Its size and position make it occupy the bottom-left corner of the table. Object ID 4's AABB is approximately `[-0.135, -0.037] x [-0.135, -0.037]`. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 5 *without* any collisions.
           
           My strategy is to avoid placing Object ID 5 where Object ID 4 currently sits.  I need to generate a grid of potential placement locations and filter out the ones that overlap with Object ID 4's AABB. Since I already know the valid ranges for the x and y coordinates, it is sufficient to check for collisions with `obj4` and select 50 non-colliding locations. I plan to use 7x7 grid for each `angle` to ensure that 50 locations are available. 
           
           Here is my plan: I will create a grid of possible center points for Object ID 5 and then check if the AABB of that placement intersects with the AABB of Object ID 4. If they overlap, it's a no-go.  I will iterate through x and y locations on the grid and record the placements at `theta=0.0`. I will iterate to the next angle and if sufficient non-colliding points are not found, I can rotate and check the grid again. I am sure that by generating a good enough grid, I will get enough diverse placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 8) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I've analyzed the scene, which consists of a square surface with existing objects and their dimensions/positions.
           
           First, I need to determine the valid center range for Object 8 on the surface, considering the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries. Then, I generate an 8x8 grid of potential center points within this range. Using an AABB collision check, I determine which (x, y) coordinates for the object's center are valid, using both existing object's AABBs.
           
           After rigorously checking the grid, the analysis shows that the valid range is for x in `x: [-0.0947, 0.0947]` and for y in `[-0.0947, 0.0947]`, where collisions happen for any center point (x, y) where `y < 0.01354` for Obj 4 and y < 0.07659 or x in (-0.0765, 0.0181] for Obj5.
           
           I found 20 valid center placements after AABB collision tests with existing objects, where Object 8 is rotated at `theta = 0` radians. These will be added to valid placements, and I'll generate the remaining 30 placements by rotating the valid center placements with `pi/2`, `pi`, `3*pi/2` radians, and keep the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place Object ID 7 fifty times on Surface 0 without running into Object IDs 4, 5, and 8.  First, I've got the surface size, Object 7's dimensions (it's a square), and the AABBs of the objects already placed.  I need to use this information.
           
           I started by defining the playing field: Surface 0 is a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at (0,0).  Then I calculated half of Object 7's size for easier calculations later.  Now, the crucial step: I meticulously calculated the extents of the other objects (4, 5, 8), so I know where the 'danger zones' are.
           
           My strategy?  Create a grid on Surface 0 to find safe spots for Object 7.  The grid points will be generated, and then it is essential to filter for surface bounds violations and collisions with the objects 4,5 and 8.  I will start with a 7x7 grid and use 90-degree rotations (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) to create more placements.  The reason to pick the specific coordinates is that they fall in a corner that is unblocked and avoids the other obstacles.
           
           I'm starting with a baseline of 9 safe (x,y) locations, and then I will apply each of the 4 rotations (giving 36)
           From there, I want more so I will nudge each of those locations just a bit to find 2 more for each of the 9 base. This will meet the goal of 50.
