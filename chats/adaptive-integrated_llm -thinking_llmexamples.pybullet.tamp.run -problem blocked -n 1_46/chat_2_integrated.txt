           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.344, 0.553, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.202, 0.979).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.39, 0.507), (-4.298, 0.598)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of my thinking process to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           First, I expanded the axiom, which revealed that I needed to ensure an object of a specific type is placed *on* a surface. Given the initial state, I deduced that either `v8` or `v12` could be the object. I chose to focus on `v8` for now, targeting `v18` as the surface. The goal then became placing `v8` on `v18`.
           
           To do this, I needed to leverage the "on" axiom, which meant finding a support relationship between `v8` and `v18`, alongside the correct pose for `v8`. Analyzing the initial state, I found `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, indicating that if `v8` were at pose `#o2`, it would meet the criteria. This led me to develop a plan: pick up `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) using arm `v4`, and then place it at `#o2` on `v18` with the same arm.
           
           Before executing, I had to confirm preconditions. The `pick` action needed the arm to be at `atbconf(#o3)` and had to ensure that the robot's base was in a configuration that would allow it to safely execute the pick action. I noticed that the initial state contained `atbconf(v3)`, so I needed a move action to get the robot base to the safe configuration at `#o3`.
           
           I then carefully checked all the preconditions for the `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` actions, making sure each requirement was satisfied at each step. This process included checking `unsafeapproach` and `unsafeatraj` predicates, which, since they were not explicitly defined in the problem, I could assume were false. The `move_base` action would change the configuration of the robot and move it closer to the task.
           
           Next, I needed to determine the continuous values for the poses. The continuous parameter for `#o2`, associated with `pose(v8, #o2)`, needed careful calculation, requiring me to consider the dimensions and the center of `v8` in the coordinate frame and ensuring the object rests at `#o2`. With detailed calculations, I found a suitable location in the x and y axes. I decided that `#o2` would be  (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0) where the last number is the rotation, and I checked that this pose aligns with `v18`.
           
           Finally, after verifying all aspects, the plan was:
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` (move base to `#o3`)
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` (pick up `v8`)
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (place `v8` on `v18`).
           
           I then double-checked that this final plan achieved the desired goal. My thorough analysis of the preconditions and careful consideration of all the continuous values validated this plan.
