           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.344, 0.553, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.202, 0.979).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.39, 0.507), (-4.298, 0.598)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)

           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through Goal Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be "on" object `v18`. Looking at the initial state, objects `v8` and `v12` fit the type requirement.  To satisfy "on," I need an object, `?green`, to be at a pose, `?p`, such that `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` is true.
           
           From the initial state, both `v8` and `v12` are supported at pose `#o2` on `v18`. Therefore, the key is to place either `v8` or `v12` at `#o2`.
           
           However, my available actions are limited to `move_base`. This action only changes the robot's base configuration; it doesn't affect object poses like `atpose`.  I immediately see a problem: I need actions like `pick` and `place` to manipulate objects' positions, which I don't have.
           
           Let me verify: `move_base`'s only effects are to update the robot's configuration and restrict the robot's motion capabilities, which is irrelevant to object manipulation. The problem explicitly states that only the given action is allowed.
           
           Therefore, since I cannot modify the position of any object, I cannot satisfy the required `on(?green, v18)` condition.
           
           In conclusion, the goal is not achievable with the given action set.
