User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.344, 0.553, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.202, 0.979).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.39, 0.507), (-4.298, 0.598)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal: Place an object on a surface.**
           
           The user wants to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` *on* surface `v18` and of type `v17`. After considering the initial state and object types, the user determines that `?green` can be instantiated as `v8`, because its type is `v17`. The goal becomes, then, placing object `v8` on surface `v18`.
           
           To achieve this, the user expands the `on` axiom, which requires:
           
           1.  `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`: The system's *initial state* states that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true. Therefore, to place an object, the agent can use that support condition if it can achieve the necessary pose for the given object.
           2.  `atpose(v8, ?p)`: To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, the system needs to find a pose `?p`. The initial state provides the `supported` predicate with `#o2`.
           
           Because the object needs to transition to a new pose to be placed, the user calculates a plan. It will involve:
           
           1.  A *pick* action, with the arm `v4` to pick up `v8` from its current location, `v9`.
           2.  A *place* action, with the same arm to place the object `v8` on the surface `v18`, with pose `#o2`.
           
           The user then proceeds to examine each action for feasibility:
           
           *   The pick action requires `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, `¬unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)` and `¬unsafeatraj(#o4)`. These preconditions check if the robot can perform the move. They assume that `unsafeapproach` and `unsafeatraj` will be true. After the pick action, the system verifies `kin` predicates (that the robot's arm is capable of manipulating the object at its location, then at the new one), state predicates (`handempty`) and assumes no collision issues.
           *   The place action will be similar to pick, but the user must provide an X-Y location for the new pose of the object relative to `v18`.
           
           The user must calculate the dimensions and valid placement locations for each object and surface:
           
           The system notes that the object and surface sizes are defined by their bounding boxes. Object `v8` is a square of `0.07` side length, and must fit within `v18`, a surface of dimensions `0.6` by `0.6`. Valid locations for the center of the object (in the surface-aligned coordinate system) are calculated, and a pose for the object is selected. The robot will move from its current base to this new pose via kinematics.
           
           The plan must then provide the object pose to achieve the new predicate.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Failure and Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the previous plan, and it's immediately apparent that it's fundamentally flawed. The reason is simple: the proposed actions, namely `pick` and `place`, are not even *allowed* actions in this particular scenario. The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This basically means the robot can only move its base *to the exact same location*.  That trajectory, `#o0`, doesn't let us manipulate objects at all. It's a dead end.
           
           My goal, remember, is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. We've already narrowed down that `?green` should be `v8`. So, my actual target is to get `v8` to be `on(v18)`. Breaking this down, I understand that translates to `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Thankfully, the initial state *already* has `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.  So, I just need `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           The problem is the current state. Right now, I have `atpose(v8, v9)`.  To get from `v9` to `#o2`, I'd need a `pick` and `place` sequence. But, and this is the crux of the issue, those actions are *forbidden*.  The only tool I have is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which doesn't do anything useful to change the object's position. It's like trying to move a chess piece without being able to move it.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of the allowable actions, and considering what I know about the initial state, the goal `atpose(v8, #o2)` (and therefore the overall `on(v8, v18)`) is simply unreachable. The current plan cannot work. I'd need an update on the allowed actions to have a chance.
