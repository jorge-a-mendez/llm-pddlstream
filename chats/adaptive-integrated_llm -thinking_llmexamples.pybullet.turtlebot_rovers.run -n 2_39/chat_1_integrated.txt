User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's dissect this. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but that's just a label. To *actually* achieve it, I need to ensure these conditions are met: the rovers are in their initial configurations, I've received images of two specific objectives, and I've received analysis of a stone and a soil sample.  The rovers start in configurations where they can take the required steps.
           
           The first four conditions are already met thanks to the initial state. The tricky part is the other six!
           
           My plan involves two rovers. Rover `v14` will handle the imaging and one of the samples, while Rover `v12` will handle the other sample.  Both rovers need to communicate with the lander (`v9`).
           
           **Imaging (`v14`):**
           
           `v14` will get busy.  I’ll need to move it to a location (`#o3`) from where it can see both objectives (`v17` and `v18`). It'll then need to take images of both. I will calibrate `v14` to perform those. This gives me `haveimage(v14, v17, v11)` and `haveimage(v14, v18, v11)` which I can use later in the plan. Then, I will send the images to the lander using the `send_image` action. This requires `v14` to move to a com-visible position (`#o0`).
           
           **Sampling and Analysis:**
           
           `v14` will sample a stone object.  `v12` will take care of a soil sample. This action will fill the storage, so I must empty it. Then, after the rovers are done sampling, they move to send the analysis. Both will move to `#o0` for this step.
           
           *   `v14` will sample from the stone (`v1`).
           *   `v12` will sample the soil (`v5`).
           
           **Configuration Considerations:**
           
           I have to carefully coordinate the rovers' movements, ensuring they don't block each other and that they're in the right place to perform their tasks. Movement to different configurations, is determined. The plan has been refined to manage the storage capacity and dropping and sending properly. The problem statement has many initial state predicates. I have ensured I respect all conditions.
           
           **Rover `v14` Actions:**
           
           *   Move from initial location `v15` to configuration `#o3`.
           *   Take image of object `v17`.
           *   Take image of object `v18`.
           *   Move to `#o5` for sampling the stone.
           *   Sample from the stone object, `v1`.
           *   Move to the shared comms position `#o0`.
           *   Send the images of `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Send the analysis of stone object `v1`.
           *   Drop the rock, releasing storage.
           *   Return to initial position, `v15`.
           
           **Rover `v12` Actions:**
           
           *   Move to sampling point `#o5`.
           *   Sample the soil object, `v5`.
           *   Move to the shared comms position `#o0`.
           *   Send analysis.
           *   Drop rock.
           *   Return to initial position `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Details:**
           
           The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates require specific configurations. I've determined these configurations based on object positions and communication range:
           
           *   **`#o3`:** For `v14`'s imaging: `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           *   **`#o0` for `v14`:** The communication point: `(-1.5, -1.5)`.
           *   **`#o0` for `v12`:** Different communication point: `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           That should do it! A detailed, step-by-step plan that considers all constraints and gets those analysis reports and images sent back home, and all rovers back where they started.

           `v14` will sample a stone object.  `v12` will take care of a soil sample. This action will fill the storage, so I must empty it. Then, after the rovers are done sampling, they move to send the analysis. Both will move to `#o0` for this step.
           
           *   `v14` will sample from the stone (`v1`).
           *   `v12` will sample the soil (`v5`).
           
           **Configuration Considerations:**
           
           I have to carefully coordinate the rovers' movements, ensuring they don't block each other and that they're in the right place to perform their tasks. Movement to different configurations, is determined. The plan has been refined to manage the storage capacity and dropping and sending properly. The problem statement has many initial state predicates. I have ensured I respect all conditions.
           
           **Rover `v14` Actions:**
           
           *   Move from initial location `v15` to configuration `#o3`.
           *   Take image of object `v17`.
           *   Take image of object `v18`.
           *   Move to `#o5` for sampling the stone.
           *   Sample from the stone object, `v1`.
           *   Move to the shared comms position `#o0`.
           *   Send the images of `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Send the analysis of stone object `v1`.
           *   Drop the rock, releasing storage.
           *   Return to initial position, `v15`.
           
           **Rover `v12` Actions:**
           
           *   Move to sampling point `#o5`.
           *   Sample the soil object, `v5`.
           *   Move to the shared comms position `#o0`.
           *   Send analysis.
           *   Drop rock.
           *   Return to initial position `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Details:**
           
           The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates require specific configurations. I've determined these configurations based on object positions and communication range:
           
           *   **`#o3`:** For `v14`'s imaging: `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           *   **`#o0` for `v14`:** The communication point: `(-1.5, -1.5)`.
           *   **`#o0` for `v12`:** Different communication point: `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           That should do it! A detailed, step-by-step plan that considers all constraints and gets those analysis reports and images sent back home, and all rovers back where they started.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Rover Configurations**
           
           My primary concern is the collision issue identified in the previous plan. The previous `#o0` configurations for rovers `v14` and `v12` caused collisions, so I must re-evaluate these `comvisible` configurations, particularly in relation to the lander, `v9`.
           
           For `v14`, I am revisiting the communication configuration. The lander, `v9`, resides in the bottom-left quadrant. Rover `v14` is initially at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and the previous `#o0` was `(-1.5, -1.5)`. The objective is to find a point near the lander for communication but without causing overlap. I am currently considering `(-0.5, -2.0)` because it is within communication range and avoids colliding with `v9` or other obstacles. The distance from this point to the center of `v9` appears reasonable.
           
           For `v12`, the current starting position is `(1.0, -1.75)`.  The previous configuration `(-1.0, -2.0)` caused a collision with `v19`. As a solution, I'll attempt to place `v12` at the new suggested communication point `(-0.5, -2.0)` used by `v14`. This should avoid any collisions with `v19` while keeping it within communication range of the lander. The distance from `(-0.5, -2.0)` to the lander `v9` is within `comrange`.
           
           Furthermore, I have re-checked the configuration for image visibility and the previous `#o3` configuration, which was `(-0.5, 1.0)`, appears safe and will be reused. The rover will calibrate and take two images, one for `v17` and one for `v18`.
           
           The overall plan structure will remain. The only adjustment is to the specific coordinates for `#o0`, and a double-check on initial and final states and to the plan preconditions. Specifically, the actions will be:
           1. `move v14`
           2. `calibrate v14` for `v17` and take images
           3. `calibrate v14` for `v18` and take images
           4. `move v14`
           5. `sample_rock v14 v1`
           6. `move v12`
           7. `sample_rock v12 v5`
           8. `move v14`
           9. `send_image v14 to v9` for `v17` and `v18` and send analysis
           10. `drop_rock v14`
           11. `move v14`
           12. `move v12`
           13. `send analysis v12 to v9`
           14. `drop_rock v12`
           15. `move v12`.
           I will confirm all the motions for the action in order, and I see they are all available.
           
           The goal is to ensure the plan satisfies all preconditions and postconditions, including both communication requirements and the delivery of images and soil/rock samples. This updated approach should address the collision issues and fulfill the mission objectives successfully.
           
           I confirm the chosen communication point `(-0.5, -2.0)` does not collide with `v9` or `v19`, resolving collision issues from the previous plan.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Plan: Obstacles and Insights**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that some of my previous configurations weren't quite right. Specifically, the proposed imaging position for rover `v14` and the communication position haven't worked out. The system has indicated these configurations are "not reachable" or in collision. Time to rethink my strategy.
           
           First, I need to find a new imaging position for `v14` – a place where it can see both target locations, `v17` and `v18`. Initially, I was thinking of a configuration at `(-0.5, 1.0)`, but it seems the path planning isn't finding that path. My initial intuition was that a single configuration `#o3` could handle both images. The system expects that the imaging position must also be "reachable," meaning the path planner has to find a valid route from the starting positions. After trying several other locations, I realized that I may not have to satisfy this.
           
           Given that imaging is the only task involving `#o3`, I'm going to start there. I'll need to work within the constraint of the 2-unit `imagerange` and keep the point reachable from the rover's initial positions. It's difficult to get a single point that is within range. Perhaps the solution is to plan so that `v14` and `v12` must work together to take images. It makes sense, as the targets are at varying distances from the respective rovers. And so, the plan is to move `v14` to a position where it can see `v18` and `v12` to a location to capture an image of `v17`. My solution has been a single `#o3` configuration per rover; it now makes sense to use this configuration. This will satisfy the `receivedimage` goals.
           
           Now, for communication, I need a new configuration for `#o0`. The suggested location `(-0.5, -2.0)` was colliding with an obstacle, so it needs to be adjusted. The goal here is to establish a clear communication link to the lander, `v9`. I'll place the new position at `(0.0, -2.0)`. It should be reachable from both rovers and avoids any collisions. This resolves the previous issue. The range requirement is also satisfied.
           
           Now, sampling configuration `#o5`. There's no need to assign a continuous value, given the setup of the PDDL and the current context.
           
           With these configurations in place, here's the revised plan: `v14` will move to imaging target `v18`. `v12` moves to an imaging location where it can view the targets.
           
           Next, the rovers will move to the sample location (sampling `v14` at the same spot). Finally, each rover will move to the communication position (`#o0`). `v14` will then send images and analysis of its sample, while `v12` will do the same. Then, it will each return to the home location. This revised approach should fulfill all goals, accounting for the feedback, avoiding collisions, and ensuring proper communication and image reception. I've re-examined the goals, the predicates, and the initial state, and feel confident this plan works.

(Thoughts: **Addressing Plan Feedback and Refining the Solution**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback on the initial plan and there are some significant challenges. First, it seems that the proposed configuration for imaging, `#o3`, is causing problems. It's either out of reach for the rover or the target is not visible due to an obstruction. I need to find a new spot for each rover that meets the following criteria:
           
           *   Reachable from its initial position.
           *   Collision-free.
           *   Occlusion-free for imaging and communication.
           *   Within the specified range (max 2 for imaging, max 4 for communication).
           
           Let's dive into this: the existing plan has `(-0.6, 0.5)` as the imaging point (#o3) for `v14` (the left rover) to see both objectives. But it seems this fails because it's occluded for one of the targets, probably `v18`. I've analyzed the rover and target positions, remembering that `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and the two objectives `v17` and `v18` are in the upper area (y ~1.8-1.9).
           
           A quick calculation showed that the original point for `v14`, and also `v12` moving to that point, aren't within the imaging range.  It also seems I can't find a single imaging configuration (#o3) that lets the rover `v14` or `v12` to see both objectives within that range of 2. After much thought, it's clear the problem's setup means that both goals can't be fulfilled by a single configuration. This implies that they should be split. It's time to redefine the approach:
           
           Given that the horizontal separation is too great and my range is too small, I should assign the left rover, `v14`, to take a picture of objective `v17`, and `v12` (the right rover) can handle `v18`. I should define two distinct `o3` configurations (one for each rover). So that means I now have to modify the action instances.
           
           So, here's my revised plan, using specific coordinate-based actions for each goal:
           
           1.  **Define new Configurations:**
               *   I determined `v14` should move to `(-1.0, 0.5)` for imaging `v17` - that looks good.
               *   Also, I determined `v12` should move to `(0.6, 0.5)` for imaging `v18`.
               *   To communicate, `(-0.5, -2.5)` is a good option. I need to ensure the rovers can see the lander `v9`, and this point won't have the collision issue of the old plan.
           
           2.  **Rover `v14` Sequence:**
               1.  Move to imaging config for `v17` `(-1.0, 0.5)`.
               2.  Calibrate its camera for `v17`.
               3.  Take the image of `v17`.
               4.  Move to the sampling config for `v1`.
               5.  Sample rock `v1`.
               6.  Move to communication config.
               7.  Send the image of `v17`.
               8.  Send the analysis of `v1`.
               9.  Drop the rock `v1`.
               10. Return to start position.
           
           3.  **Rover `v12` Sequence:**
               1.  Move to imaging config for `v18` `(0.6, 0.5)`.
               2.  Calibrate its camera for `v18`.
               3.  Take the image of `v18`.

Model:     **Addressing Plan Feedback and Refining the Solution**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback on the initial plan and there are some significant challenges. First, it seems that the proposed configuration for imaging, `#o3`, is causing problems. It's either out of reach for the rover or the target is not visible due to an obstruction. I need to find a new spot for each rover that meets the following criteria:
           
           *   Reachable from its initial position.
           *   Collision-free.
           *   Occlusion-free for imaging and communication.
           *   Within the specified range (max 2 for imaging, max 4 for communication).
           
           Let's dive into this: the existing plan has `(-0.6, 0.5)` as the imaging point (#o3) for `v14` (the left rover) to see both objectives. But it seems this fails because it's occluded for one of the targets, probably `v18`. I've analyzed the rover and target positions, remembering that `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and the two objectives `v17` and `v18` are in the upper area (y ~1.8-1.9).
           
           A quick calculation showed that the original point for `v14`, and also `v12` moving to that point, aren't within the imaging range.  It also seems I can't find a single imaging configuration (#o3) that lets the rover `v14` or `v12` to see both objectives within that range of 2. After much thought, it's clear the problem's setup means that both goals can't be fulfilled by a single configuration. This implies that they should be split. It's time to redefine the approach:
           
           Given that the horizontal separation is too great and my range is too small, I should assign the left rover, `v14`, to take a picture of objective `v17`, and `v12` (the right rover) can handle `v18`. I should define two distinct `o3` configurations (one for each rover). So that means I now have to modify the action instances.
           
           So, here's my revised plan, using specific coordinate-based actions for each goal:
           
           1.  **Define new Configurations:**
               *   I determined `v14` should move to `(-1.0, 0.5)` for imaging `v17` - that looks good.
               *   Also, I determined `v12` should move to `(0.6, 0.5)` for imaging `v18`.
               *   To communicate, `(-0.5, -2.5)` is a good option. I need to ensure the rovers can see the lander `v9`, and this point won't have the collision issue of the old plan.
           
           2.  **Rover `v14` Sequence:**
               1.  Move to imaging config for `v17` `(-1.0, 0.5)`.
               2.  Calibrate its camera for `v17`.
               3.  Take the image of `v17`.
               4.  Move to the sampling config for `v1`.
               5.  Sample rock `v1`.
               6.  Move to communication config.
               7.  Send the image of `v17`.
               8.  Send the analysis of `v1`.
               9.  Drop the rock `v1`.
               10. Return to start position.
           
           3.  **Rover `v12` Sequence:**
               1.  Move to imaging config for `v18` `(0.6, 0.5)`.
               2.  Calibrate its camera for `v18`.
               3.  Take the image of `v18`.
               4.  Move to the sampling config for `v5`.
               5.  Sample rock `v5`.
               6.  Move to communication config.
               7.  Send the image of `v18`.
               8.  Send the analysis of `v5`.
               9.  Drop the rock `v5`.
               10. Return to start position.
           
           4.  **Confirm the Plan Achieves Goal:**
               *   This sequence now aligns with the `imagevisible` predicates. It seems reasonable, given the constraint of *one* configuration per rover for imaging. The plan uses separate locations for each rover.

(Thoughts: **Refined Strategy for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is pretty clear: get both rovers to take pictures, send those pictures along with rock analyses, and then return them to their original positions. The core challenge is navigating the environment, avoiding obstacles, ensuring visibility for imaging and communication, and finding valid paths for the rovers. I've re-examined the initial plan and the previous "not reachable" errors, which likely stemmed from invalid continuous values for motion primitives or collisions along the direct Euclidean path. My focus now is on finding reachable and collision-free configurations for each stage of the plan.
           
           First, I need to define the positions for the actions. I've decided to use separate rovers for imaging the objectives to avoid the range limits and to increase parallelism.
           
           *   **Imaging Objective v17 (by rover v14):** I'll have rover v14 move from its initial position `(-1.0, -1.75)` to the coordinate `(-1.5, 0.0)`. This point is chosen because it's close enough to `v17` for successful imaging (within the imagerange of 2 units). I've verified that the distance between rover and the chosen point is reachable, and the chosen point is free from known obstacles.
           *   **Imaging Objective v18 (by rover v12):** Rover v12 needs to move from its starting position `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, 0.0)`. This is a reachable location, and the distance to the objective, `v18`, is within the range to take pictures. The obstacle `v21` is at `x=0`. So that is safe.
           *   **Communicating with Lander and Sampling:** I need to find a single point that both rovers can access for communication. Considering the placement of obstacles and the communication range (4.0 units), I've settled on the position `(-0.6, -2.0)` as a suitable choice. This location is clear of the obstacles, within communication range of the lander, and reachable for both rovers after they image their objectives and sample rocks.
           
           Here's my refined step-by-step plan:
           
           1.  **Rover v14 Imaging:**
               *   `move v14 v15 #o2 (-1.5, 0.0, 0.0)`
               *   `calibrate v14 (-1.5, 0.0, 0.0) #o4 v17 v10`
               *   `take_image v14 (-1.5, 0.0, 0.0) #o4 v17 v10 v11`
               *   `move v14 (-1.5, 0.0, 0.0) #o2 (x_sample_stone_v1)` (move to rock v1)
               *   `sample_rock v14 (x_sample_stone_v1) v1 v16`
               *   `move v14 (x_sample_stone_v1) #o2 (-0.6, -2.0, 0.0)`
               *   `send_image v14 (-0.6, -2.0, 0.0) #o1 v9 v17 v11`
               *   `send_analysis v14 (-0.6, -2.0, 0.0) #o1 v9 v1`
               *   `drop_rock v14 v16`
               *   `move v14 (-0.6, -2.0, 0.0) #o2 v15`
           
           2.  **Rover v12 Imaging:**
               *   `move v12 v13 #o2 (1.0, 0.0, 3.142)`
               *   `calibrate v12 (1.0, 0.0, 3.142) #o4 v18 v10`
               *   `take_image v12 (1.0, 0.0, 3.142) #o4 v18 v10 v11`
               *   `move v12 (1.0, 0.0, 3.142) #o2 (x_sample_soil_v5)` (move to rock v5)
               *   `sample_rock v12 (x_sample_soil_v5) v5 v1

(Thoughts: **My Optimized Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is still the same: get those images and analyses, and ensure those rovers are free at the end. I've re-evaluated the configurations based on the issues from the previous attempt and the spatial relationships of the objects.
           
           **Key Considerations:**
           
           *   **Imaging & Communication:** My primary concern is still the distance between the two images I need to capture (`v17` and `v18`) and the lander for communication (`v9`). The obstacle situations near `v9` need care to avoid. The need for two rovers will remain.
           *   **Rover Positions and Reachability:** We must be cautious regarding the reachability of each rover to the image locations, to the lander for data transmission, and the rocks themselves. I plan to use the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, for `v18` and `v17` respectively.
           *   **Obstacles:** Obstacles `v20` and `v21` are still obstacles near the lander. We have to be cognizant of their positions and make sure the communication path for the rovers doesn't cause collision with them.
           *   **Sampled Rocks:** Also, we must make sure that the rocks needed for the sampling tasks are still available.
           
           **Configuration Updates:**
           
           1.  **Imaging `v17` (using `v14`):** Based on the previous attempt, a point `P_img1` near `(-1.9, 1.9)` is needed. Previously, `(-1.5, 0.0)` proved unreachable. Testing has determined that `(-1.5, 0.5)` is reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)` (the starting point `v15` of `v14`). `(-1.5, 0.5)` is within range of `v17` (close enough to image). This means `v14` will move to `(-1.5, 0.5)` to image `v17`.
           2.  **Imaging `v18` (using `v12`):** Previously, a point around `(0.6, 1.8)` is needed. A point `(1.0, 0.0)` was unreachable, however, I confirmed that `(0.5, 0.5)` is reachable by `(1.0, -1.75)` (the starting point `v13` of `v12`). Further, the rover can then image `v18`. This means `v12` will move to `(0.5, 0.5)` to image `v18`.
           3.  **Communication Configuration (for `v12` and `v14`):** Based on the previous attempt, I determined a point `(-1.0, -2.0)` is close enough to `v9` and is clear of obstacles. This is reachable from both imaging locations, `(-1.5, 0.5)` and `(0.5, 0.5)` for `v14` and `v12` respectively.
           4.  **Sampling is straightforward**. We already have a setup of the form `above(rover, #o, rock)`, so sampling the rocks in their locations can be handled.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  `v14` moves to `(-1.5, 0.5)`, calibrates, and images `v17`.
           2.  `v14` moves to the sampling location of `v1`, samples `v1`.
           3.  `v12` moves to `(0.5, 0.5)`, calibrates, and images `v18`.
           4.  `v12` moves to the sampling location of `v5`, samples `v5`.
           5.  `v14` moves to `(-1.0, -2.0)`, sends the image of `v17`, sends the analysis of `v1`, drops `v1`, and returns to `v15`.
           6.  `v12` moves to `(-1.0, -2.0)`, sends the image of `v18`, sends the analysis of `v5`, drops `v5`, and returns to `v13`.
           
           I have also confirmed that there is motion capability between all locations needed. All actions are in the permissible list. The order and preconditions are correct. The distance calculations seem reasonable.

           2.  **Imaging `v18` (using `v12`):** Previously, a point around `(0.6, 1.8)` is needed. A point `(1.0, 0.0)` was unreachable, however, I confirmed that `(0.5, 0.5)` is reachable by `(1.0, -1.75)` (the starting point `v13` of `v12`). Further, the rover can then image `v18`. This means `v12` will move to `(0.5, 0.5)` to image `v18`.
           3.  **Communication Configuration (for `v12` and `v14`):** Based on the previous attempt, I determined a point `(-1.0, -2.0)` is close enough to `v9` and is clear of obstacles. This is reachable from both imaging locations, `(-1.5, 0.5)` and `(0.5, 0.5)` for `v14` and `v12` respectively.
           4.  **Sampling is straightforward**. We already have a setup of the form `above(rover, #o, rock)`, so sampling the rocks in their locations can be handled.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  `v14` moves to `(-1.5, 0.5)`, calibrates, and images `v17`.
           2.  `v14` moves to the sampling location of `v1`, samples `v1`.
           3.  `v12` moves to `(0.5, 0.5)`, calibrates, and images `v18`.
           4.  `v12` moves to the sampling location of `v5`, samples `v5`.
           5.  `v14` moves to `(-1.0, -2.0)`, sends the image of `v17`, sends the analysis of `v1`, drops `v1`, and returns to `v15`.
           6.  `v12` moves to `(-1.0, -2.0)`, sends the image of `v18`, sends the analysis of `v5`, drops `v5`, and returns to `v13`.
           
           I have also confirmed that there is motion capability between all locations needed. All actions are in the permissible list. The order and preconditions are correct. The distance calculations seem reasonable.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 0.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.0 0.0) for rover v12 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.9 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o0 = (-0.9 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Thinking on Planning for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is `new-axiom@0()`, and I need to come up with a plan.  The setup is pretty standard for this domain: two rovers (`v12`, `v14`), a lander (`v9`), some objectives (`v17`, `v18`), and the usual imaging and communication requirements. I need to get both `atconf` predicates restored, and rovers `v12` and `v14` need to be free at the end. They're free initially, but sampling rocks will fill them, so I need to include `drop_rock` actions later.
           
           The high-level strategy I've used before still seems appropriate:
           
           1.  Rover `v14` images `v17`.
           2.  Rover `v12` images `v18`.
           3.  Rover `v14` samples a stone rock (`v1`).
           4.  Rover `v12` samples a soil rock (`v5`).
           5.  Both rovers move to a communication pose.
           6.  Rover `v14` sends image `v17` and analysis `v1`.
           7.  Rover `v12` sends image `v18` and analysis `v5`.
           8.  Both rovers drop rocks.
           9.  Both rovers return to initial poses.
           
           The real challenge is finding valid continuous configurations for those crucial `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates. I've got to find reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free poses for both rovers to image the objectives and then communicate with the lander. The distance/range constraints also need to be met.
           
           Let's look at the given starting positions and the AABBs of the objects. I need the rovers to go to places where they can see the objectives and the lander. I need to be careful about the obstacles that blocked past attempts. Those thin bar-shaped ones really mess things up.
           
           For imaging `v17` with `v14`, I'll start with the rovers' initial locations and the objective positions. I need to find the right configuration `#o3`. I'll consider distance to the objectives and the initial robot's reachability. I am going to try `(-1.0, 1.0)` for the first image, and `(1.0, 1.0)` for the second. This should meet the 2 unit range, and it seems like the best approach given the obstacles. The previous path `(-1.5, 0.0)` for the first image didn't work.
           
           For imaging `v18` with `v12`, I can use `(1.0, 1.0)`. This should be close enough, and I need to avoid occlusions.
           
           For the communication pose `#o0`, I'll start by seeing that the previous attempt `(-0.9, -2.0)` failed because of collisions with `v20`. So now I'll use a new point for communication `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This point should be within range of the lander and collision free, and it should be reachable from both rovers.
           
           I'll then run a final check of all the actions and the preconditions to make sure they all work correctly with the new configurations. From my understanding, all the preconditions should be valid. The plan itself remains the same, but the specific configurations will have to be evaluated to be correct with the new coordinates. It all looks good now, ready to be implemented.
