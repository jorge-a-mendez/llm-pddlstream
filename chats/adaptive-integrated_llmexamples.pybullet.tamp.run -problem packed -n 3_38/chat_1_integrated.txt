User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.013, 0.462), (0.082, 0.557)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.162, -0.33), (0.261, -0.231)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.034, 0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.508, 0.861).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.223, 0.278), (-0.132, 0.37)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.212, -0.28, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.919, -0.394).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.177, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.194).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, that need to be placed on the surface `v16`. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` at `v9`, `v12` is on `v11` at `v13`, and `v14` is on `v11` at `v15`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are empty. `v4` is at configuration `v5` and `v6` is at `v7`. The robot base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal is to move `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. This will involve a sequence of pick and place operations for each object. Since there's only one move_base action instance provided, and it's a self-loop `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, we can assume the robot's base will remain at `v3`.
           
           For each object, we need to:
           1. Pick the object from its current location.
           2. Place the object on `v16` at a new pose. The pose ` #o2` is provided for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` to be supported by `v16` (among others), so we'll use that. Since ` #o2` is a symbolic pose that needs a specific value for each object, we will provide specific poses for each object on `v16`.
           
           Let's break down the plan for each object:
           
           **Object `v8`**:
           *   `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`.
           *   We need to pick `v8` from `v9` using `arm v4` (the only arm with kin information). The provided kin fact is `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           *   Then we place `v8` on `v16` at a new pose, say `#o2_v8`. The provided kin fact is `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           **Object `v12`**:
           *   `v12` is at `v13` on `v11`.
           *   We need to pick `v12` from `v13` using `arm v4`. The provided kin fact is `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           *   Then we place `v12` on `v16` at a new pose, say `#o2_v12`. The provided kin fact is `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           **Object `v14`**:
           *   `v14` is at `v15` on `v11`.
           *   We need to pick `v14` from `v15` using `arm v4`. The provided kin fact is `kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           *   Then we place `v14` on `v16` at a new pose, say `#o2_v14`. The provided kin fact is `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           We also need to define values for ` #o2` for each object such that they are within the bounds of `v16`. `v16` has AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           `v8` has AABB `((-0.013, 0.462), (0.082, 0.557))`.
           `v12` has AABB `((-0.223, 0.278), (-0.132, 0.37))`.
           `v14` has AABB `((0.162, -0.33), (0.261, -0.231))`.
           
           Since `v8`, `v12` and `v14` are too large to fit on `v16` simultaneously given their AABB sizes, this implies that `#o2` must represent distinct physical poses, one for each object. We need to find valid placement for each object within the AABB of `v16`. The given AABBs for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are not for the object itself, but rather some property (likely the overall scene or a feature of the object). To calculate the placement, we assume the objects are small enough to fit within `v16` if placed near the center. We will use the z-coordinate from the initial poses (0.781) and adjust x and y within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           Let's assume a general height for placement on `v16` (0.781 + object height / 2). For simplicity, we'll place them slightly above the table. Since the objects' AABBs are given in a format that doesn't easily translate to their actual footprint on a surface, we'll pick distinct x, y coordinates within the bounds of `v16` for each object.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid action instances only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow for picking up or placing any objects, which is necessary to achieve the goal of moving objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Without `pick` and `place` actions, the goal is unreachable.
