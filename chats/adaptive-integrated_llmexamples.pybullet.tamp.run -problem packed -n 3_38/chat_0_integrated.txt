           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.177, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.194).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.034, 0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.508, 0.861).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.223, 0.278), (-0.132, 0.37)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.013, 0.462), (0.082, 0.557)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.212, -0.28, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.919, -0.394).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.162, -0.33), (0.261, -0.231)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v14) and three potential surfaces (v10, v11, v16). Objects v8, v12, and v14 are currently on surface v11. The goal is to move all three objects onto surface v16.
           
           The initial state provides `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`. This indicates that the robot is initially at base configuration v3 and will end up at v3 after the move, implying the robot's base will not move. However, the action `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)` is given as the only valid action instance. This action has a precondition of `canmove()`, which is true, and an effect of `NegatedAtom canmove()`. Since no other actions are provided, the robot cannot pick or place any objects if this move action is executed, as `canmove()` would become false, which is a precondition for pick/place actions. Furthermore, no pick or place actions are provided in the list of valid action instances.
           
           Since there are no pick or place actions available, the robot cannot move the objects from their current locations to v16. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
