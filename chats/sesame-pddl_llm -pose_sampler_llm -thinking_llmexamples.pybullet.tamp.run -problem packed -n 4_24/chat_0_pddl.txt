(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out how to place an object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.095x0.095) stably on a square surface (0.27x0.27). My goal is 50 distinct placements.
           
           First, I know that for an object to fit, its *rotated* bounding box must be within the surface.  Since this object is a square, its effective width/height changes with rotation.  The worst-case scenario (largest bounding box) happens when rotated 45 degrees. At that angle, the effective side length of the bounding box becomes  side * sqrt(2) which is about 0.1344.  Since this is less than the surface's side (0.27), I know the object *always* fits, regardless of rotation! That's a huge simplification.
           
           To place it stably, the object's center has to be within a certain range based on its orientation.  I calculated these valid placement areas for the edge cases: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. I realized that the safe area at 45 degrees is slightly tighter. To keep things simple, I'll use that smaller valid area for all rotations: `[-0.06, 0.06]` for both x and y.
           
           To achieve diversity, I'll use two rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. I'll create a grid of 5 x and 5 y coordinates within my safe region (`[-0.06, 0.06]`) for each rotation. That's 25 positions for each of the two angles.  This gives me the 50 placements I need.
           
           In short, I will systematically place the object 50 times using those distinct angle/position combinations on the specified surface and consider this stable.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, new request. I need to figure out 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 4) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with that existing object (ID 6). Let's break this down systematically.
           
           First, I've got the lay of the land.  Same square surface as before, centered at (0,0) with sides of 0.27. Object 4 is almost a square, dimensions of approximately 0.0914.  For simplicity, let's just use that side length of `s = 0.0914`.
           
           Remembering previous placement data, object 6 is located on the surface with its center at (-0.06, -0.06) with size 0.095. So its AABB is located at x,y = [-0.1075, -0.0125].
           
           Now to determine where object 4 can go safely.  I'm going to consider its effective width and height, depending on its rotation, `theta`. To efficiently find placements, I can divide the surface into a grid of x,y locations. This is where I'll apply collision detection.
           
           For the actual search, the surface bounds limit the center of object 4 to the range of `[-0.07036, 0.07036]`. If I assume a theta of `0`, I can extend the range to `[-0.089289, 0.089289]`.
           I will use a grid to look at candidate placements.
           
           Now I have to figure out if each candidate placement collides.  Here's the collision check: Calculate the AABB of object 4 at each candidate location. Then check if object 4's AABB overlaps object 6's AABB.  Simple.
           
           I'm keeping track of which x-y values cause a collision and will exclude them from my final list.
           
           I've decided to test object 4 with two different theta values.
           1. `theta = 0` - where object 4's AABB will be `s_x` by `s_y`.
           2. `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees) - where object 4 has the effective size 0.1292.
           
           From previous calculations, the AABB for object 6 is:
           x: `[-0.1075, -0.0125]`
           y: `[-0.1075, -0.0125]`
           
           For `theta = 0` (45 cases):
           Valid if `x > ox6_max_x` or `x < ox6_min_x` (for all x) OR
           `y > ox6_max_y` or `y < ox6_min_y` (for all y).
           In this case, the object can't intersect with the existing AABB's x,y dimension at all (not possible when x,y = [-0.1075, -0.0125])
           
           For `theta = pi/4` (5 cases):
           Valid if `x > ox6_max_x` or `x < ox6_min_x` OR `y > ox6_max_y` or `y < ox6_min_y`.
           
           I'll generate the possible x,y values and check against the AABB to determine if it's safe.
           
           I'm starting by generating grid points for `theta = 0` from -0.08 to 0.08, every 0.02. This will let me cover 9 * 9 = 81 spots.
           Then I'll repeat for `theta = pi/4`, but only test a few x,y combinations for 7 x 7 = 49 spots from -0.06 to 0.06, every 0.02. I need to make sure I get 50 without collision, so after I test this, I'll return the ones that pass the test.
           
           I'm ready to run this. Based on the logic from object 6's AABB I can get a pretty clear visual.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID 5)**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for a new, almost square object (ID 5) on Surface 0, avoiding two pre-existing objects (ID 6 and ID 4).
           
           First, I precisely calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for Object 6 and Object 4, which are the main obstacles. I then considered two main orientations for the new object: theta = 0 (aligned with the axes) and theta = pi/4 (rotated by 45 degrees).
           
           For theta = 0, I defined a grid of candidate center points within the surface boundaries, ensuring that I stayed away from the surface edges. I then calculated the AABBs for the new object at each grid point and performed collision checks against the AABBs of Object 6 and Object 4. Any potential position causing an overlap within the boundaries was disqualified. This process resulted in 72 possible placements.
           
           For theta = pi/4, I repeated the same process, adjusting the dimensions to account for the rotation. Because object 5 is nearly square, calculating the effective width/height after rotation were straightforward. The available area for placement was also more limited. A grid of potential placements were then checked and refined via similar collision checks, yielding 45 safe placements.
           
           To ensure diversity in the final set, I have decided to combine both orientations. I will select the first 25 valid placements for theta=0 and first 25 valid placements for theta=pi/4, resulting in a set of 50 stable and collision-free placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 7**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. I need to get 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 7) on Surface 0, while dodging the existing obstacles (IDs 6, 4, and 5). The surface is a square of 0.27 units on a side, centered at (0,0).  Object 7 is pretty close to a square with sides of about 0.08 units.
           
           **First**, I'll try Object 7 *without* any rotation.  I'll start by making a grid of possible x and y positions. Then I'll check each potential placement by calculating the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and verifying that it does not overlap with the AABBs of any of the existing obstacles. My intuition says the bottom-left of the surface is gonna be tough because of existing objects.  I'm expecting to find that `y` values must be at least 0.05 and `x` from the Grid of `[-0.09, ..., 0.09]`
           
           **Second**, I'll rotate Object 7 by 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  This will change its bounding box shape. I'll need to recalculate the effective dimensions and the allowable range of x and y, and then make a similar grid for rotated positions.  I'll still verify no overlaps.
           
           For the unrotated object, I'll limit `y` to `[0.05, 0.07, 0.09]` for all x-grid points and for the rotated object, `y = [0.03, 0.05, 0.07]`.
           
           Finally, to get my 50 placements, I'll use all 30 unrotated ones, and then choose a subset of the rotated locations (picking 20).
