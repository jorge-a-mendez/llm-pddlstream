(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to `on(?green, v18)` AND `type(?green, v17)`.  I've got the initial state, and I see a couple of objects that *could* be `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. I'll start by focusing on `v8`, since its initial pose `atpose(v8, v9)` seems relevant for manipulation.
           
           Since `type(v8, v17)` is already true, I only need to make `on(v8, v18)` true. The axiom for `on(?o, ?r)` tells me I need `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` AND `atpose(?o, ?p)`. Looking at the initial state, I already have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. That means I just need to get `v8` to pose `#o2`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)`. So, the plan is: move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`. This involves a standard pick-and-place operation.
           
           I have two options: `pick` and `place` actions, and the appropriate parameters. Since the base is at `v3`, I first have to move the base to `#o3`, where the arm's trajectory for the `pick` and `place` operations is defined. So, let's break the plan down into a few steps.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  Execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The `basemotion` precondition is satisfied, and this will update the `atbconf` predicate. `Canmove` will become false until after the next action.
           2.  **Pick:** Execute `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. This requires the base to be at `#o3`, which I just ensured. I'm assuming the negative preconditions, like `unsafeapproach`, are false for now, since I don't see any contradicting information.  This will result in `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` and update `canmove` to true again.
           3.  **Place:** Execute `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Again, the base must be at `#o3` (still true) and I'm assuming the negative preconditions are false. This will set `atpose(v8, #o2)`, which will get me to the `on` predicate, and `canmove` will be set to true.
           
           **Success!**
           
           After these steps, `atpose(v8, #o2)` is true. I also know `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true from the initial state, and `type(v8, v17)` is also true in the initial state. Therefore `on(v8, v18)` is true. So, `new-axiom@0()` is achieved with `?green = v8`.
           
           All actions and preconditions seem well defined, assuming those "negative" preconditions hold (or I assume they are implicitly true for the domain, as is typical with collision checking). My plan should work.
