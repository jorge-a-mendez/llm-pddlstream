(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object on a larger square surface. The object's side is `0.0989`, and the surface is `0.27 x 0.27`, centered at the origin. Stability means the object must fit entirely within the surface and not collide with any other objects (which don't yet exist).
           
           Since both the object and surface are squares, the primary challenge is determining the valid range for the object's center coordinates based on its rotation.  Rotating the object changes its effective bounding box. I need to calculate the bounding box for all possible rotations.
           
           I began by analyzing the object's size and the surface dimensions.  Rotating the object by `theta` affects its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) dimensions.  I determined that a rotated square's AABB is always another square.  The side length `S_rot` is:  `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` where `s` is the original side length.
           
           The smallest AABB occurs at 0 or 90 degrees rotation, `S_rot = s`. The largest AABB occurs at 45 degrees, where `S_rot` is `s * sqrt(2)`. The maximum `S_rot` for this object is approximately `0.14`.  Since this is less than the surface size of `0.27`, the object can fit in any orientation.
           
           To find valid center positions, I calculated the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates based on the object's AABB.  The general rule is the object center can range: surface_lower + half_S_rot <= x,y <= surface_upper - half_S_rot. Since the surface is centered and the object is a square, x and y have the same range. This range depends on `S_rot` which is affected by `theta`.
           
           I decided to create 5 sets of placements, each rotated at a different `theta`. I picked angles that cover the relevant symmetry of the square's rotation (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). For each `theta`, I found the allowed range of (x,y) centers. Then, within these ranges, I made 10 evenly-spaced positions using a 4x3 grid with `x` and `y` linear spaces using `numpy.linspace`. This spread provided a good variety of object placements across the surface for the 50 total configurations.
           
           Therefore, the output is a list of 50 placements as `(0, theta, x, y)` coordinates, where 0 is the surface index, `theta` is the rotation, and (x,y) is the object's center. No need to account for any previous objects or for collisions in the prompt.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down systematically. I've got object 5 to place, and I need to do it carefully, given the presence of object 4 already positioned. The primary constraint is no collision, so I'll be meticulously checking for overlaps.
           
           First things first, I've got the surface bounds defined – a square region. Object 5 itself is a near-square shape. The goal here is to find 50 stable and non-colliding placements for it. I will generate them by combining a well defined strategy: first, varying the orientation of object 5 via a set of angles, then for each, I'll generate a grid and filter out colliding placements to the best positions.
           
           Object 4 is occupying a spot in the bottom-left corner. My key here is collision avoidance - I need to ensure that the placement of object 5 never intersects the already placed object 4. I know that the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of object 4 is defined and I will use that for collision checks.
           
           I will start by setting the rotation to zero, and analyzing the valid area. Because object 4 is at the bottom left, the valid area is mainly the upper right corner of the surface. To obtain diversity, I am generating placements for a range of angles.
           
           To generate diverse placements, for each angle I will generate positions using a grid, and only keep the points that avoid collision with the AABB of object 4.
           I will generate 10 placements for each angle, for a total of 50 stable placements. I will generate points that are guaranteed not to be in collision, by creating regions of non-collision - the area not occupied by the AABB of object 4. By construction, I guarantee no overlap will happen.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for a New Object (ID 7)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, a square area of 0.27 x 0.27 centered at (0,0). I need to account for two pre-existing square objects, ID 4 and ID 5, already placed on this surface.
           
           **Environment Setup**
           *   **Surface 0:** Defined as a square region: \[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)\].
           *   **Object ID 4:** Square, side 0.0989, placed at (-0.0855, -0.0855) with no rotation (theta = 0). Its AABB occupies the region \[ -0.135, -0.0361 \] x \[ -0.135, -0.0361 \].
           *   **Object ID 5:** Square, side 0.099, placed at (-0.0855, 0.0285) with no rotation (theta = 0). Its AABB occupies the region \[ -0.135, -0.0360 \] x \[ -0.0210, 0.0780 \].
           *   **New Object ID 7:** Square with side 0.0729.
           
           **Strategy:**
           1.  **Containment:** The new object can be placed at any orientation (theta) and fit on the surface because the maximum rotated size is less than the surface size.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:** The key is avoiding collisions. I'll need to calculate the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each placement of ID 7 and ensure it doesn't overlap with the existing AABBs for ID 4 and ID 5.
           
           **Collision Check**
           *   Calculate a rotated size "S\_rot\_7" with angle "theta".
           *   Generate possible center points for ID 7 on the surface, making sure they do not overlap with pre-existing ones.
           *   For each proposed placement, compute its AABB.
           *   Check its AABB against the AABBs of ID 4 and ID 5 for an overlap.
           
           **Valid Placement Regions**
           *   The placement region for object ID7 will be constrained to the right of the existing two objects.
           *   I can't place it in the gap between the two objects.
           *   The general strategy: take a grid of valid points on the surface, and ensure it does not touch the existing ones.
           
           **Final Steps**
           I will generate a grid of potential placements, systematically calculating AABBs, and collision-checking to ensure 50 valid, collision-free placements. The resulting placements, represented as (surface ID, theta, x, y) coordinates, will be my solution.

(Thoughts: **My approach for finding 50 stable placements for the new object (ID 6) on surface 0 is detailed below.**  I need to carefully navigate the already occupied space by the existing objects, identified as IDs 4, 5, and 7.
           
           The surface is a square of `0.27 x 0.27`, and the existing objects are squares of varying sizes, positioned at known coordinates and rotation angles.  My first step involves calculating the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each existing object based on their sizes and positions. This is critical for collision detection.
           
           Object 4 occupies the bottom-left corner.  Object 5 sits above it, close together, and Object 7 is positioned to the right and slightly below these left-sided objects.  By examining their x and y coordinates, I note some critical gaps that might be large enough for the new square. The code focuses on the calculations of the edges of these objects.
           
           I've determined that the narrow gaps between the existing objects are too small for the new object, especially when considering rotations.  My strategy then involves placing the new object in areas where it *won't* collide. I analyze the AABBs to precisely define where these "safe" spaces are: the top-right and middle-right regions of the surface.
           
           I've crafted a method to calculate the valid placement zones based on the available space, the size of the new object, and rotation. It uses a grid to check each placement position and rotation. Then, the code generates candidate placements for various rotation angles. The code then eliminates placements that intersect with existing objects. If I'm short, I will generate more potential positions and re-check until I have 50. This strategy should quickly give me the necessary stable placements.
