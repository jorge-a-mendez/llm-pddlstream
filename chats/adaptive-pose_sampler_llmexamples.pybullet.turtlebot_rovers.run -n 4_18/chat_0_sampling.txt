           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a perimeter of obstacles (0-4). There is a central vertical obstacle (5) that runs through x=0. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene (6-22). I will focus on finding positions within the allowed range [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y, and within a distance of 2 from the target point. I will try to diversify the positions to explore different viewing angles and avoid potential collisions with the obstacles.

Model:     The previous attempts indicate that positions near the center and south of the target are problematic. The target is at (0.36, 1.84). The collision with (0.246, -0.324) confirms obstacle 18 is an issue. The "no line of sight" errors suggest that the central obstacle (5) at x=0, or other smaller obstacles, are blocking the view from further south. I should try positions that are closer to the target point, and more to the east or west to avoid the central vertical obstacle.

Model:     It seems I made a mistake in the previous attempt by not fully considering the target point for the second and third positions. For the target at (-2.18, 1.87), my proposed positions (0.36, 1.0), (1.36, 1.84), and (-0.63, 1.84) were too far, or collided with obstacles.
           
           Specifically, (0.36, 1.0) for target (-2.18, 1.87) collided with obstacle 13 ((0.36, 0.83), (0.49, 0.97)), which explains the collision. (1.36, 1.84) for the same target was too far and probably had line-of-sight issues with the central vertical obstacle (5). (-0.63, 1.84) for the same target collided with obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and 22 ((-0.56, 1.89), (-0.46, 1.99)).
           
           I need to be more careful about the specific target point provided in the request. The current target point is (-2.1898324489593506, 1.8731199502944946). This point is on the far left side of the scene, in the upper quadrant. Obstacles 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and 19 ((-2.23, 1.82), (-2.14, 1.92)) are very close to this target point. I need to be careful not to collide with them.
           
           I will try positions that are close to the target, moving slightly up/down/left/right to avoid immediate obstacles and find clear line of sight.

Model:     My previous attempts for the target (-2.189, 1.873) failed because the proposed positions (-2.0, 1.0), (-1.5, 1.5), and (-1.0, 1.0) were probably too far from the target or still suffered from line-of-sight issues due to obstacles (e.g., obstacle 6: ((-2.40, -2.34), (-1.39, -1.65)) or obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))).
           
           The current target point is (0.2464734360408544, -0.3246755866185852). This point is located in the central-southern part of the scene. I need to be careful with obstacle 18: ((0.148, -0.390), (0.276, -0.261)), which directly covers the target point and caused a collision in the first request for the position (0.2464734360408544, -0.3246755866185852). I must choose positions that are not within this obstacle. Obstacle 12 ((0.15, -1.50), (0.29, -1.36)) and obstacle 14 ((0.75, -0.16), (0.86, -0.05)) are also nearby.
           
           I will try positions that are slightly offset from the target point to avoid obstacle 18, and also consider different angles to ensure line of sight, while staying within the max_range=2.

Model:     My previous attempts for the target (-0.515, 1.943) all failed.
           (0.0, -0.5) collided with obstacle 5 (central vertical obstacle).
           (0.5, -0.5) and (0.246, 0.0) had no line of sight, likely due to obstacle 5, or other smaller obstacles. It seems placing the robot too far from the target or on the wrong side of the central obstacle (5) is a common issue for targets on the left side of the scene.
           
           The current target point is (0.2464734360408544, -0.3246755866185852). This is the same target as before. I previously tried (0.0, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5), and (0.2464734360408544, 0.0) and all of them failed for this target point too. Let's revisit the previous failures for this specific target:
           
           *   Proposed position: (0.2464734360408544, -0.3246755866185852) -- collides with obstacle 18: ((0.148, -0.390), (0.276, -0.261)). This is the target point itself, so it's directly on an obstacle. I should avoid placing the robot on the target.
           *   Proposed position: (0.0, -0.5) -- collides with obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
           *   Proposed position: (0.5, -0.5) -- no line of sight.
           *   Proposed position: (0.2464734360408544, 0.0) -- no line of sight.
           
           The target is inside obstacle 18, so I need to be careful with the exact location. Since the target itself is in an obstacle, I need to place the robot *near* the target, but not *on* it or directly in an obstacle. Obstacle 18 is a small box around the target point. I need to find clear space around it.
           
           I will try positions directly around the target, avoiding obstacle 18, and keeping the central obstacle (5) in mind.
           
           Positions:
           (0.0 -0.2)
           (0.5 -0.2)
           (0.2 -0.6)
