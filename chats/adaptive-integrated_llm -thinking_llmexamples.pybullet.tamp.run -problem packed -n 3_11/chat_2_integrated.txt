User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.015, 0.377), (0.105, 0.467)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.019, -0.353), (0.075, -0.259)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.06, 0.422, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.821, 0.571).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.15, 0.486), (-0.057, 0.579)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.028, -0.306, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.234).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.103, 0.533, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.221, 0.975).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to get v8, v12, and v14 onto v16.**  I'm focusing on getting all three objects stacked on v16, and the system tells me I have to use a specific pose definition for placement, so I'll be working with that constraint. I have two arms available, but the `kin` facts only work for `v4` for these objects, so that's what I'll be using.
           
           Right now, these objects are at different poses: v8 is at v9, v12 is at v13, and v14 is at v15. They're all supported by v11. I want to move them all to the shared pose on v16 which I will call `#o2`, although I will give each object its own distinct continuous value to satisfy problem constraint.  I've got a `move_base` action that moves me from my current base configuration, `v3`, to `#o3`. Then I can execute a series of actions like picking and placing for each object. The available kin facts indicate that I must use an base configuration of `#o3` and grasp `#o1` in order to execute the `pick` and `place` actions, which I must meet by first `move_base`.
           
           Here's the sequence I've worked out:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll use the `move_base` action to get my base from `v3` to `#o3` (using trajectory `#o0`). This is a necessary setup.
           2.  **Pick v8:** I'll pick up v8 from its current location, v9, using arm `v4` and the grasp `#o1`.
           3.  **Place v8:** I'll place v8 onto v16 at position `#o2_v8`, using `v4` and grasp `#o1`.
           4.  **Pick v12:** I'll then move on and pick up v12 from location v13.
           5.  **Place v12:**  I'll place v12 on v16 at pose `#o2_v12`, still using the same arm and grasp configuration.
           6.  **Pick v14:**  Now, I pick up v14 from location v15.
           7.  **Place v14:** Finally, I'll place v14 on v16 at `#o2_v14`.
           
           The key is that for the `#o2` pose, I need to provide separate definitions, even though the symbolic name is the same. I'll need to specify specific x, y, z, and angle (theta) values for each instance of placement.
           
           I'm confident because I checked the preconditions. The `move_base` action gives me the needed `atbconf` condition. The `handempty` precondition for `pick` will be true, and `atgrasp` preconditions will be satisfied before each `place` action.
           
           The surface v16 has an AABB defined so I will place the objects near the center to avoid collisions. I calculate coordinates:
           - v8: `(-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)` which puts it at a corner of the tray.
           - v12: `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)` also near a corner.
           - v14: `(0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0)`, near the center.
           
           Now, I will be ready to submit my plan.
