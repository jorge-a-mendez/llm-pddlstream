           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Identification**
           
           My analysis begins with a deep dive into the `new-axiom@0()` goal, meticulously examining its conditions against the provided initial state.  I recognize that achieving this goal hinges on acquiring images (`receivedimage`) and performing analyses (`receivedanalysis`).  However, the core issue quickly emerges: the limited set of "valid action instances" severely constrains my options. The allowed actions are solely "move" and "drop_rock." Critically, there are NO actions like "calibrate," "take_image," "send_image," "sample_rock," or "send_analysis." These omissions render the necessary preconditions for `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` impossible to satisfy.
           
           **Unreachable Subgoals and Strategic Dead End**
           
           I attempt to forge a plan, envisioning how I might leverage Rover v14 to gather images and perform analyses. I start by focusing on a sequence of calibration, image capture, and transmission using Rover v14, which is at `atconf(v14, v15)`. However, I quickly hit a wall. To take images, v14's camera v10 must be calibrated. Moreover, after taking an image, the camera is uncalibrated. This necessitates that the calibration be performed before each image, which is inefficient. This path, which relies on actions NOT included in the "valid actions instances" list, is a dead end.
           
           I proceed to explore ways to achieve `receivedanalysis`, recognizing the need for `analyzed` facts. I then propose sampling rocks using rover v14. To achieve this, I need `sample_rock`. However, the action `sample_rock` is NOT available. Similarly, the action `send_analysis`, required for `receivedanalysis`, is absent.
           
           **The Inevitable Conclusion: Goal Unachievable**
           
           The critical constraints imposed by the limited set of allowed actions become overwhelmingly apparent. The actions available are insufficient to achieve the stated goal, rendering it fundamentally unattainable. I am forced to conclude, with certainty, that the plan to reach `new-axiom@0()` is impossible given these constraints.
