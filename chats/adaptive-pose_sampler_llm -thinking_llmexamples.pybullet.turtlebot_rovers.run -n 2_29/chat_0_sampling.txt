User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Finding Optimal Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to figure out the 25 best (x, y) locations for the robot's base, given a specific target point and some tricky obstacles. I'm aiming for a diverse set of positions that are both safe (no collisions!) and within a reasonable distance from the target.
           
           First, I need to understand the environment. There's an outer boundary (the room's walls) and some fixed obstacles scattered around, like furniture. There's also a crucial central column that divides the space. This column is the main challenge. The target point, which will be given in the code, will inform what side of the column I will try to generate positions for first.
           
           My primary constraint is the central column, which I will not allow my generated locations to have. The target will either be in front, or behind, the column. The target should not be behind the wall. The robot can rotate on its base. This will be automatically set to face the target.
           
           I will use a set of rules.
           1. Make sure the location is within the general area (`[-2.5, 2.5]` in both x and y).
           2. Ensure the location is close enough to the target (within a 4-unit radius).
           3. Importantly, avoid collisions with all obstacles, especially that central column! That's a major blocker.
           
           To generate a variety of spots, I will attempt sampling locations on concentric circles around the target and check them. I will also make sure to check positions that might not be on the circle.
           
           Finally, I will generate them. If I can't find 25 positions with my initial circular sampling, I'll switch to a more systematic grid search to fill in any gaps. I'm focusing on finding a mix of spots that meet all these criteria: within the given area, within range of the target, and collision-free.
