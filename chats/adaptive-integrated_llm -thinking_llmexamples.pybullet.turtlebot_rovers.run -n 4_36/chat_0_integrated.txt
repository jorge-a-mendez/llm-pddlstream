           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Rovers Domain Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, but upon examining its definition, I realize it's a conjunction of several predicates: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`, and various type predicates. I begin by assessing the initial state of these predicates. The `atconf` and `free` predicates are already satisfied, which means the difficulty lies in achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd normally use the `send_image` action, which requires actions like `take_image` and `calibrate`. Similarly, `receivedanalysis` would need `send_analysis` after `sample_rock`. However, a crucial constraint emerges: the prompt explicitly limits my available actions to just `move` and `drop_rock`. 
           
           With this severe restriction, I immediately realize the task is impossible. None of the listed actions can satisfy the preconditions of `send_image` or `send_analysis`, thus making it impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.  Despite my expertise in planning, the absence of key actions like those needed for image processing and analysis leaves me with no path to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable given the restricted action set.
