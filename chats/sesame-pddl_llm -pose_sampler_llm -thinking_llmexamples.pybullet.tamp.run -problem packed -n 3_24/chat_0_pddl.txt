(Thoughts: **Placing an Object on a Surface**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface. The object is a rectangular prism with specific dimensions, and the surface is a square of a given size. A placement is defined by the surface index, a rotation angle, and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center. For a placement to be stable, the object's bounding box must be completely contained within the surface's bounding box.
           
           I have calculated the object's bounding box dimensions at various rotation angles. The object's AABB dimensions change with theta: `rotated_w = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))`, `rotated_h = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`. Given that the object is almost square, I focused on a range of angles that would result in varying AABB shapes. I know the (x, y) coordinates of the center must be within the surface's bounds, so I calculated the minimum and maximum ranges for those coordinates based on the object's rotated dimensions at each angle.
           
           I have chosen 5 distinct angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi) to achieve diversity in object orientations, and ensured 10 unique positions for each angle in the form of a 3x3 grid (corners, midpoints, center) of valid placements, including one slightly offset random point, covering a varied (x,y) range within the available area.

(Thoughts: **Generating Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The user wants me to place an object (ID 5) onto a surface (surface 0), making sure it doesn't bump into a previously placed object (ID 6).  I've got the dimensions and position of object 6, and I know the boundaries of surface 0. My task is to generate 50 valid placements for the new object (ID 5), each at a different angle, without any overlaps.
           
           First, I've got to figure out where object 6 *is*. I calculated its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) which is a simple rectangle that encloses it.  Since object 6 is already in the bottom-left corner of the surface, its AABB extends to the left and down from that corner.
           
           Then, I'll need to figure out object 5's dimensions. It's a square, and I know its side length. Rotation will change its effective size, because I'll need to account for the longest diagonal of the square to ensure there's enough space to place it.  At zero rotation, the AABB is just the square itself.
           
           Now comes the hard part: avoiding collisions.  Since I'm going to be placing the object at various angles, I need to account for that.  I've got to calculate the AABB for each rotated placement. I can do this by using the `rotated_w` and `rotated_h`. At the angles of `0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, `3*pi/4`, and `pi`, I can generate enough points and filter for the collision points.
           
           So, for each angle I'll:
           
           1.  Calculate rotated width and height of the object 5.
           2.  Then, I'll figure out where the *center* of object 5 can possibly go *without touching* object 6. Since I know object 6's AABB, it's just a matter of figuring out what region is *outside* of it. I'll need to generate a set of candidate points inside the bounds of the surface.
           3.  For this strategy, I'll consider a 5x5 grid of potential placements, as the starting set of points to analyze. I will also make some edge case scenarios, such as centering, etc.
           4.  I will iterate through the grid for points that do not collide with object 6.
           5.  If not enough points are found, I'll generate new points outside of object 6's space.
           
           That should do it! A bit of math and careful consideration of rotations and collision, and I'll have the list of 50 non-colliding placements that the user needs.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to place 50 stable instances of Object 4 onto Surface 0, taking into account existing objects (Object 6 and Object 5) to avoid any collisions.
           
           **Geometry and Constraints:**
           
           Surface 0 is a rectangular area bounded by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I am provided the size of the new object to be placed. The dimensions of Object 4, approximately 0.098 x 0.098. I must consider any possible orientation of the object.
           
           Object 6, with dimensions ~0.096 x 0.096, is positioned at `(0, 0, -0.087, -0.087)` and is at an orientation of `0`, and Object 5, with dimensions ~0.072 x 0.072, is located at `(0, 0, 0.099, 0.099)` with an orientation of `0`. These existing placements create spatial constraints.
           
           The bounding box (AABB) of Object 6 extends from `[-0.135, -0.0393]` in x and y coordinates, while the AABB of Object 5 covers `[0.0625, 0.135]` in both axes.
           
           **Placement Logic:**
           
           I will focus on placing the Object 4. It will be an iteration with the following steps.
           
           1. **Calculate Rotated Dimensions:** Depending on the rotation angle theta, I calculate the rotated width and height of the Object 4 AABB using its dimensions to find bounds of valid center coordinates to avoid being out of surface and into the other AABBs.
           2. **Surface Boundary Check:** The x, y center of object 4 is within the surface boundaries, after accounting for object 4's rotated size.
           3. **Collision Checks:**
              - I check if `x` and `y` center coordinates of Object 4 could collide with the established position and AABB of Object 6: if `x < 0.00977 AND y < 0.00977`.
              - Also check the AABB for a potential collision between Object 4 and Object 5: If `x > 0.013402 AND y > 0.013402`.
           4. **Placement Selection:** I iterate through rotation angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi). Using a grid of candidate points (10x10) to cover the possible center positions. For each combination of the center (x, y) coordinates and angles, I check for collision.
           5. **Selection and Termination:** I try to collect 10 valid placements for each of the 5 angles, resulting in 50 in total.
           
           I'm using a denser grid (10 x 10 = 100 points) to help ensure sufficient valid center coordinates are found to collect 10 for each angle. The filtering process will give me 50 correct results.
