           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking: the user wants to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  I started by unpacking the conditions of that axiom, which boils down to three core tasks: getting images sent (receivedimage) for specific objects with a certain mode, and getting analysis received (receivedanalysis) for at least one rock of type v2 and at least one rock of type v6.  I meticulously checked each condition in the initial state and realized most of the critical `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are initially false, so they needed to be achieved.
           
           To tackle the image goals, I identified that the `send_image` action would be key. It has preconditions I could potentially satisfy with a sequence of actions including `take_image` and `calibrate`. For the rock analysis I similarly found that `send_analysis`, which could be achieved through the `sample_rock` action, and would require sending analysis of the rock to the lander. I thought I could use `rover v14`, since it was initially at the right configuration, and can use its camera `v10` to get all of the required image and analysis samples.
           
           I tried to construct a detailed plan, ordering the actions needed to achieve those goals: calibration, taking images, sending them, sampling rocks, sending those analysis to the lander and dropping rocks to free the space in the rover.
           
           However, here's where things went sideways:  I then compared the plan to the list of permitted actions. *None* of the actions I need to *execute* the plan (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are in the permitted action list. The list is limited to `move` and `drop_rock` actions which don't help. I checked the initial state, axioms, and available actions against the goal requirements and found the goal *cannot* be reached. The only thing I can do is move rovers between locations and drop rocks. Given these actions do not affect the `receivedanalysis` or `receivedimage` predicates, I have to conclude that given the restricted set of actions, the user's goal of `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable in this problem setting.
