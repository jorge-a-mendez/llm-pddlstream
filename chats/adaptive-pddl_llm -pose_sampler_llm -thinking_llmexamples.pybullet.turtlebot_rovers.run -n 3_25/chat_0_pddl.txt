User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three good spots for the robot base. The key is this central vertical wall. The target is *just* to the left of it, so the robot *has* to be on the left side to see it clearly, or on the right side *beyond* the target, which would be blocked by the wall. I'm choosing to pick locations on the left. The positions must be within 2 units of the target point and in the valid environment zone. I need to steer clear of those pesky AABBs - the environment limits and those fixed obstacles.
           
           Since this is the first request, I'm just focusing on the target point and that annoying central wall. The target's `x` is about `-0.06`, so it's practically touching the central wall with AABB `x` coordinates -0.05 to +0.05. I've got to ensure the robot base's `x` is less than -0.05 to avoid line-of-sight issues and collisions.
           
           With that in mind, I'll generate the three candidate locations.
           
           First, I choose a position directly to the left, 2 units away at `-2.0635, 0.0805`. This is a guaranteed line of sight, meeting the `x < -0.05` requirement.
           
           Next, I choose a location closer, also on the horizontal. The base is now one unit from the target point at `-1.0635, 0.0805`. This also works.
           
           Lastly, I pick a point at `-1.5, 1.0` to provide a different view from the other horizontal locations. The base is closer than the max range and it works!
           
           Those three positions should work. I'm pretty confident they're collision-free and give the robot a clear line of sight.
