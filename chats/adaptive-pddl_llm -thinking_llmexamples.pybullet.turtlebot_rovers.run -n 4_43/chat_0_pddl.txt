           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but this looks like a puzzle. First, I analyzed the axiom's conditions. It's a conjunction of several `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `type`, and `receivedanalysis` atoms. I checked the initial state. The initial state satisfies the first four conditions regarding `atconf` and `free`. That's a good start.
           
           The remaining conditions, however, are problematic: `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. These imply I need to gather images and analysis of specific types of rocks (stone and soil).  To achieve this, the rover needs to take images, sample rocks, and send the data. I reviewed available actions but only find `move` and `drop_rock`. 
           
           Here's the rub: I *only* have those two action types. My understanding is that I cannot use any other actions. I've re-read the problem statement to confirm. It appears the only actions at my disposal are movements and dropping rocks.
           
           Since I don't see any available actions that help with `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, I believe it's impossible. These actions are crucial for satisfying the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` goals, and the given set of actions doesn't include them. The moves and rock-dropping actions won't help. The moves are self-loops and drop_rock would be useful if full was true (which is not in the initial state). This is a dead end. I cannot achieve the goal given these limitations, it is infeasible.
