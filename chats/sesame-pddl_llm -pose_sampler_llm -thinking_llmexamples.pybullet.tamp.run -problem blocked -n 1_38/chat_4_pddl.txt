           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Solving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type "on" another object.  Specifically, I need an object of type `v17` on `v18`.  Luckily, the initial state *already* tells me that `v12` is of type `v17`. My task, therefore, is to get `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see `v12` is *supported* at a pose `#o2` by `v18`, so it's a valid target.
           
           The basic strategy will be a standard pick-and-place operation. Since I know the required preconditions for both those actions, I can readily identify what I need to do. First, I need to get the base of the robot to `#o3`, as this is a bconf associated with the pick and place operation.  Then, I'll `pick v12` from its current pose `v13` and place it onto `v18` at pose `#o2`. I need to be sure that the pre conditions for `pick` are satisfied, and then I need to get the base to a bconf to execute `place`.
           
           I've carefully checked all the preconditions for `pick` and `place`, including the base configuration movement, and made sure all the requirements for `atgrasp` and `atpose` have been met. Specifically, I've had to consider that `move_base` action, and its associated `btraj`.
           
           *   **Move Base** needs to move from `v3` to `#o3`.
           *   Then **Pick** `v12` from `v13`.
           *   Finally, **Place** `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Given the initial state, the plan should work, and given that the pick and place preconditions are satisfied, I'm confident that these actions in sequence will achieve the desired goal of `on(v12, v18)`, and since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, the plan satisfies the requirements.
