           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, here's my plan for generating those placements, keeping in mind the object's dimensions (0.07 x 0.07), the surface's bounds ((4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)), and the stability criteria (fully contained, no collisions with existing or future obstacles).  I'll be generating placements in the form (surf\_idx, theta, x, y), where surf\_idx is always 0.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center (x, y). Given the surface's dimensions, object's size, and the need for the object to be *fully* contained, the center can't be right at the edge.  I've calculated the allowable x range to be from 4.235 to 4.765 and the y range to be from -0.565 to -0.035.
           
           Since the object is square and the problem doesn't mention orientation constraints, I'm going to set `theta = 0` for all placements.  While other rotations are valid (and would affect the AABB calculation slightly), a 0-degree rotation is enough to generate a good variety of positions.
           
           Given the surface area and object size, I'll generate a grid of positions.  I'll space objects apart by a step size of 0.05, slightly smaller than the object's dimension, to minimize overlap but still get a good spread.  I've pre-calculated valid x and y coordinates:  `x_coords = [4.235, 4.285, 4.335, 4.385, 4.435, 4.485, 4.535, 4.585, 4.635, 4.685, 4.735]` and  `y_coords = [-0.565, -0.515, -0.465, -0.415, -0.365, -0.315, -0.265, -0.215, -0.165, -0.115, -0.065]`.
           
           With these, I'll systematically create placements. I'll take a first x value, generate placements for all possible y values, then go to the second x value, and so on, until I reach 50 placements.  I've checked the calculations and verified they fit inside the bounds of the surface.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement for ID 10 with Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request: find 50 stable placements for `Object ID: 10` on `surf_idx = 0`.  I know from past experience that `surf_idx = 0` is defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` and that `theta` needs to be 0 for this. Also, `Object ID: 10` has dimensions of approximately `0.087933` x `0.087933`.  Let's call those `size_x_10` and `size_y_10` respectively, so `hx_10` and `hy_10 = 0.0439665`.
           
           Now, here's the twist: I need to avoid collisions with the previously successful placements of `Object ID: 5`. Those placements are a set of objects already fixed in the scene, and I need to generate placements that will avoid collision with those. I recall the successful placements for Object ID 5 and calculate the approximate area it occupies,  `BB_5_union = [4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.08]`.
           
           My first plan was to place the new object on a grid over the surface. The original valid x range for the new object on `surf_idx = 0` is `[4.2439665, 4.7560335]`.  The original valid y range on the same surface is `[-0.5560335, -0.0439665]`.  This would have been a fine plan, but then I considered the collision requirement.
           
           I realized I needed to carefully consider the position of Object ID 10 with respect to the `BB_5_union`. Since the valid `y` range on the surface is almost completely overlapping the y-range of BB_5_union, there's only one dimension to manipulate - the `x`. By moving the start point just *past* where Object ID 5's bounding box is (considering half-extents of Object ID 10), I would be able to avoid collision with every placed instance of Object 5.
           
           I recalculated the starting position to be safe; if `x_10`'s new value starts higher than `4.3139665`, there won't be any overlap.  So, I set a new starting point for the x coordinate at `4.314`, and I set `y_coordinates` to stay the same to preserve the overall available surface for valid placement.
           
           Now, instead of the original grid of `11 x 11` possible placements that did not consider the existing object in the scene, I have `9 x 11` possible placements, and I simply choose the first 50.
