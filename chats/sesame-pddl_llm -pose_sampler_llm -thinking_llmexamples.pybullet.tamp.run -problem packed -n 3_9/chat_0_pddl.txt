(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object on a larger square surface. The object is approximately 0.097425 units on each side, and the surface is 0.27 units on each side.  A placement is "stable" if the object is entirely contained within the surface.
           
           To achieve this, I'll need to consider both the object's position (x, y) and its orientation (theta). Since the object can rotate, its effective size on the surface changes, particularly its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) size. AABB calculations will be the key to ensuring the placements are stable.
           
           First, I'll calculate the valid ranges for (x, y) based on theta. At 0 and pi/2 radians (90 degrees), the AABB is simply the object's dimensions. At these orientations, the x and y ranges are relatively large because there is maximum space to maneuver. The most constrained orientations will be at pi/4 radians (45 degrees), where the object is rotated diagonally, and the AABB takes the maximum possible size.
           
           To find the 50 placements, I will use a combination of grid-based positioning at the x and y positions. I will use 4x4 grids at theta 0, pi/4, and pi/2 to obtain 16 placements at each angle. 
           
           The last two placements, at theta pi/8 and 3pi/8, will be at the center (0,0). I will use more accurate angle definitions to generate the output and keep the output concise.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 4 on Surface 0: A Systematic Approach**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've got to place a new square object (ID 4) on surface 0, and the goal is to find 50 stable placements while avoiding collision with another object (ID 5) that's already there. Object 5 is located at approximately the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 4 has a side length of approximately 0.0933, and it's also a square. I'll call half of that side `object4_half_side`. The surface itself is a rectangle, and I know its dimensions.
           
           I've got a good idea of how to handle this. I know that for a given center point of an object, it's AABB is determined by the `h_rot_4` value for the object's `theta`. So now, my approach is:
           
           1.  **Calculate the AABB of Object 5:** I'll determine the minimum and maximum X and Y values (AABB) of the existing object, accounting for its size and location.
           
           2.  **Define Collision-Free Regions:** Since object 5 is in the bottom-left, I need to define the areas *outside* of it.  I'll use the principle that if `x_c > X_THRESHOLD` OR `y_c > Y_THRESHOLD` for any given centerpoint, where `X_THRESHOLD` and `Y_THRESHOLD` are based on the object's size and orientation, I'm guaranteed to avoid a collision.
           
           3.  **Generate Placements with Different Rotations:** I'll systematically test common angles of rotation (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4, and finally, pi/8).  For each angle, I'll calculate the valid ranges for `x` and `y` coordinates.
           
           4.  **Create a Grid and Filter:** For theta = 0, pi/2 (h_rot_4 = 0.046632), the grid points `[-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]` works because x_c and y_c must be greater than 0.015332.
           
           5.  For `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4` (h_rot = 0.065949), use the grid `[-0.06, -0.02, 0.02, 0.06]` where valid placement is `x_c > 0.034649` OR `y_c > 0.034649`.
             
           6.  For `theta = pi/8`, I will use `[-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` (h_rot = 0.06093). Collision avoided where `x_c > 0.02963` OR `y_c > 0.02963`.
           
           7.  I will iterate through the grid for each angle and filter out the coordinates for which `x` and `y` are in the range to avoid collision with Object 5.
           
           This will give me 50 potential starting points.
           
           I've also double-checked my collision logic. In the test cases, the formula is working fine.
           
           By this method, I can create a list of valid placement points with their respective orientations, ready for the next stage of the simulation.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4) already present. Surface 0 is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at (0,0). Object 5, also square, is centered at (-0.08,-0.08) and Object 4, centered at (0.04,-0.08). The new object (ID 6) is also square.
           
           To tackle this, I'm first analyzing the geometric constraints: the surface boundaries and the occupied space by objects 4 and 5. I calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each existing object. Object 5 occupies an area in the bottom-left, while Object 4 occupies an area to the right, adjacent to it. I want to calculate the maximum extent in x and y coordinates that allows the new square to still fit inside the surface area. I also need to calculate the minimum value that y should have to not collide with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5, based on the rotation (theta). The new object has a side length of 0.08053926, which defines its *h_rot*, half its side length.
           
           Next, I'm developing a placement strategy. Given that Object 4 and Object 5 block the bottom-left and bottom-center areas, I'll prioritize placing Object 6 in the upper portion of the surface, or the narrow gaps.
           
           I have decided to pre-define coordinate grids in the surface to iterate through to look for placements. For `theta = 0, pi/2`, I will be using 2 grids: x and y, that are -0.09, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09. However, the `y` values have to be checked because of the existing obstructions. I created a check collision function that computes AABB and returns true or false, given all the inputs. 
           
           This approach will effectively guarantee non-overlapping placements. The generated placements will be tested to ensure there are no overlaps with previous objects. I have planned that this strategy should find 50 valid locations for Object 6.
