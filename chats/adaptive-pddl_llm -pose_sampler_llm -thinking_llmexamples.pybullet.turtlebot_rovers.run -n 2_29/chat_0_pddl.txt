User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Placement Strategy for a Given Target Point**
           
           My primary objective is to determine 25 feasible robot base positions (x, y) for a specified target point, denoted as `(tx, ty)`.  These base positions must satisfy a few critical constraints: they need to be within a maximum distance of `max_range = 4` from the target, confined within the workspace boundaries of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], and, crucially, free from collisions with any of the fixed obstacles described in the provided AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) format. The robot's orientation, `theta`, will be automatically adjusted to face the target.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the layout, which consists of a square room defined by walls at  (-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (-2.5, 2.5), effectively bounding our search space.  A key feature is a central vertical obstacle that effectively splits the room into two halves, potentially creating line-of-sight challenges if the robot is placed on one side and the target on the other.  The remaining obstacles are smaller, requiring careful collision checks.
           
           My strategy involves generating candidate base positions, starting with points near the target, and expanding outwards.  I'll ensure all candidate points are within the workspace boundary and that they don't collide with the static obstacles. I'm using a strict collision check (based on *strict* inequalities) for the obstacle AABBs since the robot is modeled as a point object. I've designed the algorithm so it will find solutions with diversity, as this is a first request and collision information isn't known. The generated points will also consider the main vertical obstacle.
           
           Given that the specific `target_point` is `(0.9, -1.8)`, I know that, based on my analysis of the main central wall obstacle and heuristic, that positions should be generated such that the robot position shares a similar horizontal side as the target.  This ensures good line-of-sight. The heuristic will be that if the target is on the left, the robot should be on the left.
           
           The core algorithm will generate candidate positions in a spiral pattern around the target point, supplemented by a grid-based search to ensure a sufficient number of diverse positions are identified.
