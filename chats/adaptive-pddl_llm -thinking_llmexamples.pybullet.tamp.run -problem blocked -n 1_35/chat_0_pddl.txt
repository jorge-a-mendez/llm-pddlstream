           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got the task laid out. I need to figure out a plan to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* a specific object. Specifically, I'm looking for something that is both `on v18` and has the `type v17`.
           
           I've checked the initial state and identified two possible candidates: `v8` and `v12`. Both are the correct type.  I can see that both are potentially *stackable* on `v18`.  Right now, `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.  So, the obvious strategy is to move either `v8` or `v12` to `v18`. Let's pick `v12`.
           
           To move `v12` to the correct pose, I'd need to `pick` it up from its current location, `v13`, and then `place` it on `v18`.  The preconditions for these actions are clear:  I need a free arm, the object needs to be at a pose, and there can't be unsafe configurations or trajectories.
           
           However, here's the rub: I am only allowed to use the action `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This is a huge problem.  `pick` and `place` are essential for this task, but they are *not* permitted.  I need to move an object to achieve the goal but the only action I can use won't allow me to pick it and place it.
           
           The move_base action won't change where `v12` is. The object will stay in the same pose, supported by the same things. It just won't be on the required item, which is `v18`.
           
           Given the constraint on allowed action instances, there is absolutely no way to move `v12`, or any object for that matter, onto `v18`. So, my conclusion: the goal is unachievable given the restrictions. The problem description explicitly states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
