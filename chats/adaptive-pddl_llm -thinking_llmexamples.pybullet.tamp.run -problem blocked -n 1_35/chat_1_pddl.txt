           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unachievable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true simultaneously.  I began by examining the initial state to identify potential candidates for `?green`.  Objects `v8` and `v12` both satisfy the `type(?, v17)` condition.
           
           To achieve `on(?green, v18)`, I must ensure two conditions: `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`. I explored the initial state for both `v8` and `v12`, recognizing their current supporting and pose relations. However, their current states do *not* satisfy the `on` predicate concerning `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was to devise a plan using `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate these objects.  I considered a plan to:
           1.  `pick` `v8` from its current pose.
           2.  `place` `v8` onto `v18`.
           By doing so, I should have `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and thus fulfill the goal.
           
           However, a critical review of the problem constraints reveals a crucial limitation.  The "list of valid action instances" explicitly *only* includes `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This is a significant roadblock.  While `pick` and `place` actions are *defined* as such, no instances are available. I cannot instantiate or employ them in my plan.
           
           Consequently, since I am restricted to the provided action (which doesn't affect object positions), I cannot modify the initial state in a way that would make `on(?green, v18)` true.  The goal is therefore, *unachievable* within the constraints given. I am forced to conclude that a valid plan does not exist, as the allowed action instance is not sufficient to satisfy the objective.
