           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of `type v17` placed on `v18`. I've analyzed the initial state, identifying two objects, `v12` and `v8`, as potential candidates since they are of `type v17` and stackable on `v18`. Currently, `v12` is on `v14` and `v8` is on `v11`. To reach the goal, I need to place one of these objects on `v18`.
           
           The standard approach would involve a `pick` and `place` action sequence. However, a critical constraint emerges: I'm restricted to using only the action instances explicitly provided in a list.  The available actions are extremely limited, with only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` present, which doesn't modify any relevant object states.
           
           Let's break down the logic: I analyzed the preconditions for `pick` and `place` for `v12`. I need to instantiate continuous parameters, specifically `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, and `#o4`, which are required to satisfy the `kin` constraints, namely `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  I need to ensure consistency between the trajectory parameters and poses, namely that picking from `v13` and placing at `#o2` utilize the same `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4`. If the parameters are appropriately chosen, a pick and place sequence should achieve the goal state.
           
           However, the provided list of actions is the obstacle. The necessary `pick` and `place` action instances (`pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`) are *not* present.  Since only actions explicitly listed can be used, the plan to reach `new-axiom@0()` is blocked. The sole `move_base` action available won't help. The conclusion is, despite a clear plan, the provided action space does not allow the target goal to be realized.
