           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable placements for object 10 on this surface. The surface is a rectangle from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0), which gives me dimensions of 0.6 x 0.6. The object is pretty much square (0.091 x 0.091). My understanding is that the object's AABB needs to be *fully contained* within the surface AABB for it to be a valid placement.
           
           First, I'll calculate the valid ranges for placing the object. When the object's AABB is aligned with the axes (theta = 0 or pi), I need to account for half its width and height to ensure it stays within the surface bounds. For theta = 0, this means valid center x-coordinates between 4.246 and 4.754, and y-coordinates between -0.554 and -0.046. The object dimensions will be obj_x and obj_y. For theta = pi/2, I would be swapping obj_x with obj_y (for the sake of completeness), but since they are almost equal, it doesn't make a huge difference in this case.
           
           I'm aiming for a diverse set of placements. Given the surface area and object size, I can probably fit about 6 objects along each dimension. So, I will generate placements using a 7x7 grid for theta=0, totaling 49 placements, covering the available space. Then, I'll add a 50th placement at the center with a pi/2 rotation. Since the object is nearly square, even with rotation, it should still easily fit. The AABB dimensions are mostly unchanged for the 90 degree rotation. Using theta=pi/2 allows to have some diversity. The center coordinates are (4.5, -0.3). These coordinates are within the surface bounds. This gives the set of placements as requested. I checked to make sure there are 50 placements.
