User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.188), (-0.2, 0.259)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.125, -0.398), (0.219, -0.305)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.549), (0.158, -0.455)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.072, -0.277, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.203, 0.979).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.235, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.711, 0.703).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.172, -0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.847, 0.532).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.111, -0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.975, -0.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.118, -0.323), (-0.026, -0.231)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to satisfy the goal:** I need to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto object `v18`. From the initial state, each object is on a table `v11` at a different initial pose, and my goal is to have them all on `v18`. Since `v18`'s pose isn't explicitly defined, I'll need to interpret it. The problem states that I have to work within the confines of the available actions.
           
           Since `v18` does not have an explicit pose, and the problem asks me to place the objects on `v18` while also following the dummy surface rule, I'm interpreting that `v18` is placed on the initial surface for all actions `v11`, a large table object. `v18` will serve as a surface for the placement targets.
           
           Since base configuration `#o3` is implicitly provided in the pick/place actions and needs to be set, I will need a `move_base` action from the initial base `v3` to `#o3`. Then, I'll use arm `v4` to pick up and place each object. Because I'm asked to satisfy the goal `on(obj, v18)`, I must also create and follow an implicit set of steps for the plan to satisfy this goal.
           
           Here's the planned sequence:
           
           1.  **(Move Base)** Move the robot's base from initial configuration `v3` to base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **(Pick)** Pick up object `v8` from its initial pose on `v11`, named `v9`.
           3.  **(Place)** Place `v8` onto `v18` at a specified pose, called `#o2`, which will be specified for all objects.
           4.  **(Pick)** Pick up object `v12` from its initial pose on `v11`, called `v13`.
           5.  **(Place)** Place `v12` onto `v18` at a specific pose, called `#o2`.
           6.  **(Pick)** Pick up object `v14` from its initial pose on `v11`, called `v15`.
           7.  **(Place)** Place `v14` onto `v18` at a specific pose, called `#o2`.
           8.  **(Pick)** Pick up object `v16` from its initial pose on `v11`, called `v17`.
           9.  **(Place)** Place `v16` onto `v18` at a specific pose, called `#o2`.
           
           Crucially, because each object has its own initial support fact, I will interpret the placements to happen *on* a *target object*. I need to account for this.
           
           For geometry, I must account for where objects will be placed on `v18` (I'm treating this as a block with dimensions as indicated by its AABB).  Assuming `v18` is centered at world coordinates (0, 0, 0) and the dimensions are such: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135], and a height of 0.1 meters, the final placement for the objects must lie within these dimensions. Therefore, for all objects, the `z` location will be 0.906. And to provide unique placements for all four objects, I chose offsets from the center (0, 0).
           The poses are:
           *   `v8`: (-0.06, -0.06, 0.906, 0.0)
           *   `v12`: (0.06, -0.06, 0.906, 0.0)
           *   `v14`: (-0.06, 0.06, 0.906, 0.0)
           *   `v16`: (0.06, 0.06, 0.906, 0.0)
