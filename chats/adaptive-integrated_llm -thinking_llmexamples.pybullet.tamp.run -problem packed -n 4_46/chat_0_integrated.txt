User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.188), (-0.2, 0.259)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.125, -0.398), (0.219, -0.305)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.549), (0.158, -0.455)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.072, -0.277, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.203, 0.979).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.235, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.711, 0.703).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.172, -0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.847, 0.532).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.111, -0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.975, -0.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.118, -0.323), (-0.026, -0.231)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto v18.  My initial assessment is straightforward: I need to pick each object from their current positions (which are all on v11) and place them onto v18.  That seems like a simple "pick and place" strategy.
           
           However, things quickly get complicated.  I have facts detailing the positions and supports of each object. I even know the valid grasps for each object. The parameters like `#o2` for poses, etc are all present. So I have everything I *need* to pick and place.
           
           But, the real constraint hits hard: I'm only allowed to use a *single* action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  No `pick`, no `place`, nothing else.  The rules are crystal clear: only *listed* actions are permitted. This is a crucial limitation.
           
           I've carefully reread the problem statement and the instructions. It's explicitly stated that any action not in the provided list is *forbidden*. This restriction means I can't even *attempt* a valid "pick and place" plan, even though I have all the necessary information and preconditions.
           
           Therefore, given the restrictive action set, I must conclude the goal is not achievable.  I cannot manipulate the objects to satisfy the target configuration with only `move_base`.  It's simply not possible.
