User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.188), (-0.2, 0.259)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.125, -0.398), (0.219, -0.305)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.549), (0.158, -0.455)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.072, -0.277, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.203, 0.979).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.235, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.711, 0.703).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.172, -0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.847, 0.532).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.111, -0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.975, -0.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.118, -0.323), (-0.026, -0.231)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan: Object Rearrangement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to relocate four objects, v8, v12, v14, and v16, from their initial positions on surface v11 to a new surface, v18. The challenge is that they all need to be placed at a shared symbolic pose, #o2. Since I can't physically place multiple objects at the same precise point, I need to assign *unique* spatial coordinates within the bounds of surface v18 to #o2 for *each* object.
           
           My primary tool is the robot's arm, v4. It's the only one with the necessary kinematics (expressed through the "kin" facts) to perform the pick and place operations. I'll be using the provided grasp (#o1) and a default base configuration (v3). Essentially, the plan will unfold as a series of pick-and-place actions, one for each object.
           
           Each object's path will be the same: first, pick it up from its current location using arm v4, then place it on v18 at its designated #o2 position. Since the base configuration cannot move, all pick and place operations will be performed in place.
           
           I will define the following plan:
           
           1.  **Object v8**: Pick up from its initial location, then place it at a specific pose on v18 with coordinates, (x: -0.06, y: 0.06, z: 0.801, theta: 0.0).  AABB range: x-range: [-0.106, -0.014], y-range: [0.014, 0.106]
           2.  **Object v12**: Pick up from its initial location, then place it at a different pose on v18 with coordinates (x: 0.06, y: 0.06, z: 0.801, theta: 0.0). AABB range: x-range: [0.0135, 0.1065], y-range: [0.013, 0.107]
           3.  **Object v14**: Pick up from its initial location, then place it at a specific pose on v18 with coordinates, (x: -0.06, y: -0.06, z: 0.801, theta: 0.0). AABB range: x-range: [-0.107, -0.013], y-range: [-0.1065, -0.0135]
           4.  **Object v16**: Pick up from its initial location, then place it at a different pose on v18 with coordinates (x: 0.06, y: -0.06, z: 0.801, theta: 0.0). AABB range: x-range: [0.0245, 0.0955], y-range: [-0.0955, -0.0245]
           
           The Z coordinate of 0.801 is selected to avoid overlap and maintain separation, above the surface (Z = 0.781) by 0.02, while considering the object dimensions and ensuring there is no collision.
           
           Each pick and place action will involve the same grasp and base configuration. The trajectories, arm and base motions are available in the "kin" facts provided, and the current base is already in the necessary configuration (v3).  The key is the precise positioning of each object relative to one another on surface v18, to meet the goal condition.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've carefully considered the user's critique and I see the problem. They're absolutely right; my initial plan was flawed. I completely missed the crucial detail about the *valid action instances*. We're *only* allowed to use `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it. No `pick` or `place` actions, even though they're defined in the PDDL domain. Those `kin` predicates in the initial state, well, they're just declarations of possible configurations, not actual moves we can make.
           
           The goal is to get those four objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all on `v18`.  We know `on(?o, ?r)` means both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` *and* `atpose(?o, ?p)`. We're given that all the objects are already supported by `v18`. The issue is the `atpose` predicate.  To achieve the goal, each object needs to be at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, the initial state shows all of these objects are at different poses: `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17`.  The *only* way to change `atpose` is with a `place` action, which itself requires a preceding `pick`. Since those two actions are explicitly *forbidden* by the allowed action instances, there's no way to manipulate those objects' poses. It's a dead end.
           
           Given the constraint that we can *only* use `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, this goal is demonstrably unachievable. We're stuck!
