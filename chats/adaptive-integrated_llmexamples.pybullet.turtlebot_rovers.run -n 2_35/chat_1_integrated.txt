           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, a lander `v9`, and several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`). Both rovers have a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11` and a store `v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already true).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already true).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` (rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`) and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` (rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - The rovers need to `calibrate` their camera `v10` at a configuration `q` where `imagevisible` to `v17` or `v18`.
           - Then `take_image` of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Finally, `send_image` from a configuration `q` where `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (e.g., `v4`, `v1`, `v3`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (e.g., `v7`, `v8`, `v5`):
           - The rovers need to `sample_rock` at a configuration `q` where `above` the rock.
           - Then `send_analysis` from a configuration `q` where `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           Since we need to receive analysis for rocks of type v2 and v6, we can sample one rock of each type. Let's pick `v4` (type `v2`) and `v7` (type `v6`).
           
           Rover `v14` can be used to sample `v4` and `v7`, and take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           Rover `v12` could also do this, but `v14` is already at `v15` which is near some of the target objects.
           It seems more efficient to use rover `v14` for all tasks, since it has the onboard camera `v10` and `free` store `v16`.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate `v14` for imaging `v17` using configuration `#o3`.
           2. Take image of `v17` from `#o3`.
           3. Calibrate `v14` for imaging `v18` using configuration `#o3`. (Re-calibrating is necessary as `take_image` uncalibrates the camera).
           4. Take image of `v18` from `#o3`.
           5. Move `v14` to a configuration `#o0` to send images.
           6. Send image of `v17` from `#o0`.
           7. Send image of `v18` from `#o0`.
           8. Move `v14` to a configuration `#o5` to sample rocks.
           9. Sample rock `v4` (type `v2`).
           10. Sample rock `v7` (type `v6`).
           11. Move `v14` back to configuration `#o0` to send analysis.
           12. Send analysis for `v4`.
           13. Send analysis for `v7`.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, a lander `v9`, and several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`). Both rovers have a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11` and a store `v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already true).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already true).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` (rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`) and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` (rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - The rovers need to `calibrate` their camera `v10` at a configuration `q` where `imagevisible` to `v17` or `v18`.
           - Then `take_image` of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Finally, `send_image` from a configuration `q` where `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (e.g., `v4`, `v1`, `v3`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (e.g., `v7`, `v8`, `v5`):
           - The rovers need to `sample_rock` at a configuration `q` where `above` the rock.
           - Then `send_analysis` from a configuration `q` where `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           Since we need to receive analysis for rocks of type v2 and v6, we can sample one rock of each type. Let's pick `v4` (type `v2`) and `v7` (type `v6`).
           
           Rover `v14` can be used to sample `v4` and `v7`, and take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           Rover `v12` could also do this, but `v14` is already at `v15` which is near some of the target objects.
           It seems more efficient to use rover `v14` for all tasks, since it has the onboard camera `v10` and `free` store `v16`.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate `v14` for imaging `v17` using configuration `#o3`.
           2. Take image of `v17` from `#o3`.
           3. Calibrate `v14` for imaging `v18` using configuration `#o3`. (Re-calibrating is necessary as `take_image` uncalibrates the camera).
           4. Take image of `v18` from `#o3`.
           5. Move `v14` to a configuration `#o0` to send images.
           6. Send image of `v17` from `#o0`.
           7. Send image of `v18` from `#o0`.
           8. Move `v14` to a configuration `#o5` to sample rocks.
           9. Sample rock `v4` (type `v2`).
           10. Sample rock `v7` (type `v6`).
           11. Move `v14` back to configuration `#o0` to send analysis.
           12. Send analysis for `v4`.
           13. Send analysis for `v7`.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already true).

           5. `type(?soil, v6)` (rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - The rovers need to `calibrate` their camera `v10` at a configuration `q` where `imagevisible` to `v17` or `v18`.
           - Then `take_image` of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Finally, `send_image` from a configuration `q` where `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (e.g., `v4`, `v1`, `v3`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (e.g., `v7`, `v8`, `v5`):
           - The rovers need to `sample_rock` at a configuration `q` where `above` the rock.
           - Then `send_analysis` from a configuration `q` where `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the reachability. Rover `v14` is at `v15` ((-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)).
           The targets for imaging `v17` ((-1.899, 1.782)) and `v18` ((0.459, 2.073)) are far.
           The targets for sampling `v4` ((-1.258, 0.524)) and `v7` ((-1.323, 1.981)) are also quite far from `v14`'s initial position.
           The lander `v9` ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) is also relatively far.
           
           Given the constraints, it's possible that `v14` might need to move to a different starting point or we might need to use `v12`. `v12` is at `v13` ((1.0, -1.75, 3.142)).
           
           Let's try to use `v14` for all operations, finding new reachable configurations.
           
           For `v14` to image `v17` ((-1.899, 1.782)), a config closer to `v17` would be better. Let's try `(-1.6, 1.7)` for `#o3`.
           For `v14` to image `v18` ((0.459, 2.073)), a config closer to `v18` would be better. Let's try `(0.4, 1.9)` for `#o3` but this is problematic because `#o3` needs to be one configuration.
           The existing problem setup implies `#o3` should be a single configuration from which both `v17` and `v18` are visible. This is unlikely given their disparate locations.
           
           Let's try using separate configurations for imaging each objective and for sampling each rock.
           So, we will need:
           - `conf(v14, #o3_v17)` for imaging `v17`.
           - `conf(v14, #o3_v18)` for imaging `v18`.
           - `conf(v14, #o5_v4)` for sampling `v4`.
           - `conf(v14, #o5_v7)` for sampling `v7`.
           - `conf(v14, #o0_v9_send_image)` for sending images.
           - `conf(v14, #o0_v9_send_analysis)` for sending analysis.
           
           However, the action instances only provide `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` as general configurations, not specific to targets. This means one configuration must work for all targets of a given type of visibility. This is a strong constraint.
           
           Given the initial state `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, it means that from a single configuration `#o3`, rover `v14` can see both `v17` and `v18`. This is very unlikely given their AABBs.
           `v17` is at `((-1.899, 1.782), (-1.8, 1.881))`
           `v18` is at `((0.459, 2.073), (0.537, 2.15))`
           These are quite far from each other in x, so a single configuration `#o3` being image visible to both is geometrically challenging. However, we have to respect the initial problem description.
           
           The `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` implies `#o0` allows communication with `v9`.
           The `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)` implies `#o5` allows sampling of multiple rocks.
           
           Let's try to find a configuration for `#o3` that is reachable from `v15` (rover `v14`'s initial position) and can see both `v17` and `v18`.
           `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17` is around `(-1.85, 1.83)`.
           `v18` is around `(0.5, 2.1)`.
           A configuration for `#o3` around `(-0.7, 1.9)` could potentially see both `v17` and `v18` if the view angle is wide enough, and it is within 2 units.
           Distance from `(-0.7, 1.9)` to `v17` center: `sqrt((-1.85 - (-0.7))^2 + (1.83 - 1.9)^2) = sqrt((-1.15)^2 + (-0.07)^2) = sqrt(1.3225 + 0.0049) = sqrt(1.3274) approx 1.15` (within 2)
           Distance from `(-0.7, 1.9)` to `v18` center: `sqrt((0.5 - (-0.7))^2 + (2.1 - 1.9)^2) = sqrt((1.2)^2 + (0.2)^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.04) = sqrt(1.48) approx 1.22` (within 2)
           This seems plausible for `#o3`.
           This `#o3` configuration is also reachable from `v15`.
           
           For `#o0` to communicate with `v9` (lander at `(-1.9, -2.0)`).
           `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           A configuration for `#o0` around `(-1.5, -2.0)` would be close to `v9` (within 4 units for comvisible) and reachable from `v15`.
           Distance from `(-1.5, -2.0)` to `v9` center: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + 0^2) = 0.4` (within 4).
           This seems plausible for `#o0`.
           
           For `#o5` to be above rocks `v4` ((-1.258, 0.524)) and `v7` ((-1.323, 1.981)), `v8` ((-1.346, 1.594)), etc.
           A configuration for `#o5` around `(-1.2, 1.0)` could be above `v4`, `v7`, `v8`, etc.
           Let's choose `(-1.25, 1.0)` for `#o5`. This is reachable from `v15`.
           Distance from `(-1.25, 1.0)` to `v4` center: `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.25))^2 + (0.57 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.05^2 + (-0.43)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 0.1849) = sqrt(0.1874) approx 0.43`
           Distance from `(-1.25, 1.0)` to `v7` center: `sqrt((-1.25 - (-1.25))^2 + (2.05 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 1.05^2) = 1.05`
           This is plausible.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, a lander `v9`, and several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`). Both rovers have a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11` and a store `v16`.

           The main challenge is finding reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free configurations that satisfy the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates. The problem implies single `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` configurations for multiple targets.
           
           Let's re-examine the given information and previous failures:
           - `v14` is at `v15` ((-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)).
           - `v12` is at `v13` ((1.0, -1.75, 3.142)).

           Previous `#o3` collision with `v19`: `(-0.7, 1.9)` is inside `v19`. We need to move `#o3` out of `v19`'s bounds while maintaining visibility to `v17` and `v18`.
           `v17` is around `(-1.85, 1.83)`. `v18` is around `(0.5, 2.1)`.
           Let's try moving `#o3` to `(-1.0, 1.6)`. This is outside `v19`.
           - Dist to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.85 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.83 - 1.6)^2) = sqrt((-0.85)^2 + (0.23)^2) = sqrt(0.7225 + 0.0529) = sqrt(0.7754) approx 0.88` (within 2)
           - Dist to `v18`: `sqrt((0.5 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.1 - 1.6)^2) = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.5) approx 1.58` (within 2)
           This seems like a better `#o3` candidate. It is also reachable from `v15`.
           
           Previous `#o0` collision with `v9`: `(-1.5, -2.0)` is inside `v9`. We need to move `#o0` out of `v9`'s bounds.
           `v9` is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Let's try `#o0` at `(-1.0, -1.8)`. This is very close to `v15` and outside `v9`.
           - Dist to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.0, -1.8)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.85) approx 0.92` (within 4 for comvisible)
           This is a good `#o0` candidate.
           
           Previous `#o5` not reachable. `v14` is at `v15` ((-1.0, -1.75)).
           We need `#o5` to be above `v4` (around `(-1.2, 0.57)`) and `v7` (around `(-1.25, 2.05)`).
           Let's try `#o5` around `(-1.2, 0.8)`. This is reachable from `v15`.
           - Dist to `v4` center `(-1.2, 0.57)` from `(-1.2, 0.8)`: `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.2))^2 + (0.57 - 0.8)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.23)^2) = 0.23`.
           - Dist to `v7` center `(-1.25, 2.05)` from `(-1.2, 0.8)`: `sqrt((-1.25 - (-1.2))^2 + (2.05 - 0.8)^2) = sqrt((-0.05)^2 + (1.25)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 1.5625) = sqrt(1.565) approx 1.25`.
           This seems plausible for `#o5`.
           
           It's crucial that the *ray* is not blocked. We are assuming the computed rays `#o1` and `#o4` are occlusion-free given these configurations.

Configuration #o5 = (-1.2 0.8) for rover v14 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, a lander `v9`, and several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`). Both rovers have a camera `v10` that supports mode `v11` and a store `v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (already true).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (already true).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` (rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`) and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` (rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           It appears that all attempts to find a suitable set of configurations for rover `v14` for all the required operations have failed due to reachability constraints. This suggests that the robot's base movement might be more restricted than initially assumed, or that the configurations for combined visibility are extremely tight. The initial positions of the rovers are `v15` for `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and `v13` for `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Let's consider using both rovers to achieve the goal if one cannot do everything.
           However, the available actions instances show that `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` are both true, meaning both rovers have the camera.
           But the store `v16` is also available to both (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`).
           The goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. It also requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           The key is that the images and analyses need to be *received*, not necessarily sent by the same rover.
           
           Let's try to split the tasks between the rovers, or try very close configurations to the initial positions.
           The initial `motion` predicates available for `v14` are:
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)` (stay put)
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, v15)`
           ... and similarly for `#o0` and `#o3`.
           
           If the new configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` are "not reachable for robot base" from `v15`, it means they are too far from `v15` for a direct move action or there are obstacles in the way of a path.
           
           Let's try to use the `v15` as `#o0` and see if `comvisible` to `v9` is possible.
           `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           The center of `v9` is approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Distance from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` is `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93`. This is well within the 4 unit range for `comvisible`.
           So, `v15` could be used as `#o0`. This means `v14` doesn't need to move for sending.
           
           Now for `#o3` (imaging `v17` and `v18`). `v17` is around `(-1.85, 1.83)`, `v18` is around `(0.5, 2.1)`.
           Since `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`, to image these, `v14` would need to move significantly. This is where the reachability issue consistently arises.
           
           Let's analyze the rover `v12` at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v18` is at `(0.459, 2.073)`.
           `v17` is at `(-1.899, 1.782)`.
           
           Maybe `v12` is better for `v18` and `v14` for `v17`. But the predicates only have one `#o3` that images both. This is a very strong constraint.
           
           Given the consistent "not reachable for robot base" errors, it implies that the available movement `motion` predicates for the rover `v14` are quite restrictive. The only valid motions for `v14` starting from `v15` are:
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` (stay at `v15`)
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 #o0`
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 #o3`
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 #o5`
           
           And similar for `v12` from `v13`.
           This means `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *must* be directly reachable from the initial configuration `v15` (for `v14`) or `v13` (for `v12`).
           
           Let's try to make `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` very close to `v15` for `v14` and check if they can satisfy the visibility/above predicates. This is probably why the original configurations didn't start with '#' for these.
           This is likely the problem, as the prompt specifies, "If the plan you select uses a configuration that does not begin with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists."
           
           However, all of `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *do* begin with '#', which means *I* need to provide values. The issue is that the provided action instances use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` in `motion` predicates. This means these are *named configurations* that have specific continuous values which are *not* provided in the initial state as `conf(rover, <config>)`. Instead, I am forced to define them.
           
           Given the continuous rejections for reachability, it strongly suggests that no single configuration `#o3` can provide line-of-sight to both `v17` and `v18` from a reachable point for either `v12` or `v14`, and similarly for `#o5` being above all rocks and `#o0` for communication.
           
           Let's assume the problem formulation means that *if* I provide a value for `#o3`, it must be a valid, reachable, collision-free configuration that enables `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. Since previous attempts were rejected, and given the geometry of `v17` and `v18`, finding such a single point for `#o3` from which both are visible within range (2 units) and a clear ray is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Similarly for `#o5` and `#o0`.
           
           If a single `#o3` configuration needs to see both `v17` and `v18`, its x-coordinate would need to be roughly between `v17`'s x (`-1.8`) and `v18`'s x (`0.5`), while being close enough (within 2 units) to both. Its y-coordinate would need to be slightly below or at the level of their y-coordinates (`1.8` to `2.1`).
           
           Let's try a configuration for `#o3` for `v14` very close to `v18` and `v17`.
           Suppose we try `#o3` as `(-0.5, 1.8)`.
           Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `sqrt((-1.85 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.83 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((-1.35)^2 + (0.03)^2) = sqrt(1.8225 + 0.0009) = sqrt(1.8234) approx 1.35` (within 2)
           Dist to `v18` (`0.5, 2.1`): `sqrt((0.5 - (-0.5))^2 + (2.1 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((1.0)^2 + (0.3)^2) = sqrt(1.0 + 0.09) = sqrt(1.09) approx 1.04` (within 2)
           This `#o3` configuration is out of `v19` collision.
           Is `(-0.5, 1.8)` reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`? Yes, it's about 3.6 units away.
           
           For `#o0` to communicate with `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           Let's try `#o0` as `(-1.5, -1.9)`.
           Dist to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.9))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-0.1)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.17) approx 0.41`. (within 4)
           This configuration is also out of `v9`'s collision box.
           Is `(-1.5, -1.9)` reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`? Yes, it's about 0.5 units away.
           
           For `#o5` to be above `v4` (`-1.2, 0.57`) and `v7` (`-1.25, 2.05`).
           Let's try `#o5` as `(-1.2, 1.0)`. This was rejected as not reachable before. What if the issue is the path?
           Maybe `(-1.2, 1.0)` is valid but the continuous planner could not find a path from current `v14` config `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.2, 1.0)`?
           The distance is `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.2)^2 + (2.75)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.6025) approx 2.75`. This is a reasonable distance.
           Let's try a different location for `#o5` for `v14`. What if `#o5` is very close to `v4` and `v7` is sampled by `v12`? The problem states `above(v14, #o5, v7)` and `above(v14, #o5, v4)`. So `v14` must be above both.
           A config like `(-1.2, 1.3)` could work.
           Dist to `v4`: `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.2))^2 + (0.57 - 1.3)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.73)^2) = 0.73`.
           Dist to `v7`: `sqrt((-1.25 - (-1.2))^2 + (2.05 - 1.3)^2) = sqrt((-0.05)^2 + (0.75)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 0.5625) = sqrt(0.565) approx 0.75`.
           This seems good.
           
           Let's try these new configurations for `v14`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem continues to highlight issues with collision and reachability for the proposed continuous configurations. It seems the environment is quite constrained. The repeated rejections suggest a deeper incompatibility between the required visibility/placement for multiple targets from single parameterized configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) and the geometric constraints (obstacles, reachability from initial positions, limited range).
           
           Let's re-examine the core challenge:
           1.  **`#o3` (Image Visibility to `v17` and `v18`):** `v17` is at `((-1.899, 1.782), (-1.8, 1.881))` and `v18` is at `((0.459, 2.073), (0.537, 2.15))`. Obstacle `v19` is at `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`.
               The previous attempt `(-0.5, 1.8)` for `#o3` collided with `v19` because `x = -0.5` is within `(-0.75, -0.25)` and `y = 1.8` is within `(1.75, 2.25)`.
               To avoid `v19`, `#o3` must be outside `x` range `(-0.75, -0.25)` OR outside `y` range `(1.75, 2.25)`.
               A configuration to the left of `v19`, e.g., `(-1.0, 1.9)`, was previously tried and rejected for reachability.
               A configuration to the right of `v19`, e.g., `(0.0, 1.9)`, still keeps the x between `v17` and `v18`.
               Let's try `#o3` at `(0.0, 1.6)`. This is outside `v19`.
               -   Dist to `v17` (center `(-1.85, 1.83)`): `sqrt((-1.85 - 0.0)^2 + (1.83 - 1.6)^2) = sqrt((-1.85)^2 + (0.23)^2) = sqrt(3.4225 + 0.0529) = sqrt(3.4754) approx 1.86` (within 2, but very close to limit).
               -   Dist to `v18` (center `(0.5, 2.1)`): `sqrt((0.5 - 0.0)^2 + (2.1 - 1.6)^2) = sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) approx 0.707` (within 2).
               This location `(0.0, 1.6)` for `#o3` for `v14` (from `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) has a distance of `sqrt((0.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.6 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 3.35^2) = sqrt(1 + 11.2225) = sqrt(12.2225) approx 3.49`. This is a significant move, and given past rejections on reachability, it might still fail.
           
           2.  **`#o0` (Communication with `v9`):** `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
               The previous attempt `(-1.5, -1.9)` for `#o0` collided with `v9`. We need to move `#o0` out of `v9`.
               The rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9`'s bounding box has `x` from `-2.4` to `-1.39` and `y` from `-2.34` to `-1.65`.
               Let's try `(-1.2, -1.5)`. This is outside `v9`'s bounds (y-value is too high).
               -   Dist to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.2, -1.5)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.2))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.7)^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.74) approx 0.86` (within 4).
               This `#o0` configuration is reachable from `v15` (dist `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.2)^2 + (0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.1025) approx 0.32`). This is very close to `v15`, making it highly reachable.
           
           3.  **`#o5` (Above Rocks `v4` and `v7`):** `v4` at `((-1.258, 0.524), (-1.166, 0.616))`, `v7` at `((-1.323, 1.981), (-1.182, 2.122))`.
               The previous attempt `(-1.2, 1.3)` for `#o5` was rejected for reachability. Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               Distance from `v15` to `(-1.2, 1.3)` is `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.3 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.2)^2 + (3.05)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 9.3025) = sqrt(9.3425) approx 3.05`. This is a significant move.
               Given the repeated rejections, it's possible the reachability checker is very strict or there are unstated obstacles.
           
           Let's try a split strategy where `v14` handles tasks closer to its side of the world, and `v12` handles tasks closer to its side.
           `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` (v15). `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` (v13).
           `v17` is at `((-1.899, 1.782))` (left side). `v18` is at `((0.459, 2.073))` (right side).
           `v4` is at `((-1.258, 0.524))` (left side). `v7` is at `((-1.323, 1.981))` (left side).
           `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346))` (far left and back).
           
           This plan implies that both rovers are required. However, the problem statement provides only single `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for *any* rover. This means if rover `v12` uses `#o3`, it still needs to be image visible to *both* `v17` and `v18`. This single configuration constraint for multiple targets appears to be the most difficult to satisfy geometrically.
           
           If it's impossible for one configuration (`#o3`) to see both `v17` and `v18`, then no plan can be generated following the given action instances, because the `imagevisible` predicates are stated as `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` AND `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. The same applies for `v12`. This is the fundamental constraint.
           
           Let's re-read the axiom:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The goal specifically requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. The provided initial state also has `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, indicating that such a `#o3` exists for `v14`. Similarly for `v12`. I *must* use these.
           
           Perhaps the previous configurations were only slightly outside the valid range.
           Let's try a very small perturbation to the previous `#o3` to avoid `v19`.
           `v19` is `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. The previous `#o3` was `(-0.5, 1.8)`, which is within `v19`.
           We need to move it out. Let's try `(-0.8, 1.8)` (to the left of `v19`).
           - Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `sqrt((-1.85 - (-0.8))^2 + (1.83 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((-1.05)^2 + (0.03)^2) = sqrt(1.1025 + 0.0009) = sqrt(1.1034) approx 1.05` (within 2)
           - Dist to `v18` (`0.5, 2.1`): `sqrt((0.5 - (-0.8))^2 + (2.1 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((1.3)^2 + (0.3)^2) = sqrt(1.69 + 0.09) = sqrt(1.78) approx 1.33` (within 2)
           This position `(-0.8, 1.8)` is reachable from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((-0.8 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((0.2)^2 + (3.55)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 12.6025) = sqrt(12.6425) approx 3.55`. This is still a long move, but we must try.
           
           For `#o0`, previous `(-1.5, -1.9)` collided with `v9`.
           `v9` is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Let's try `#o0` at `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This should be outside `v9` and very close to `v15`.
           - Dist to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.0, -1.5)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.06) approx 1.03` (within 4).
           This is reachable from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.5 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (0.25)^2) = 0.25`. This is very good for reachability.
           
           For `#o5` for sampling, the previous `(-1.2, 1.3)` for `v14` was not reachable.
           `v4` at `((-1.258, 0.524), (-1.166, 0.616))`.
           `v7` at `((-1.323, 1.981), (-1.182, 2.122))`.
           Perhaps a configuration closer to `v15` that can still be above the rocks. This is unlikely given the rock locations are far.
           Let's choose `(-1.2, 0.7)` for `#o5`.
           - Dist to `v4` center `(-1.2, 0.57)` from `(-1.2, 0.7)`: `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.2))^2 + (0.57 - 0.7)^2) = 0.13`.
           - Dist to `v7` center `(-1.25, 2.05)` from `(-1.2, 0.7)`: `sqrt((-1.25 - (-1.2))^2 + (2.05 - 0.7)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 1.35^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 1.8225) = sqrt(1.825) approx 1.35`. This is geometrically "above" in the sense of x/y, but "above" probably implies a closer proximity. However, the problem asks for `above` predicate, so relative x/y is what matters.
           This position `(-1.2, 0.7)` is reachable from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.7 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.2)^2 + (2.45)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 6.0025) = sqrt(6.0425) approx 2.45`. This is still a substantial move.
           
           Given the geometric constraints and previous failures, it is becoming very difficult to find a single point for `#o3` that is reachable for `v14` *and* sees both `v17` and `v18` *and* avoids `v19`. The same for `#o5` and rocks. It's possible the problem is designed to be unsolvable with one rover if the continuous values are chosen poorly, but I must find a plan.
           
           Let's check the alternative options in the initial state: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`. Rover `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           For `v12`, to image `v17` and `v18`. From `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17` is at `(-1.899, 1.782)`. `v18` is at `(0.459, 2.073)`. `v19` is `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`.
           A configuration for `#o3` for `v12` could be `(0.0, 1.6)` as proposed before.
           Dist from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.0, 1.6)`: `sqrt((0.0 - 1.0)^2 + (1.6 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (3.35)^2) = sqrt(1 + 11.2225) = sqrt(12.2225) approx 3.49`. Still a long distance.
           
           Let's assume there is *some* valid configuration that the underlying continuous planner can find, and focus on the logical sequence. I'm providing coordinates that are geometrically plausible given the constraints I'm aware of (AABBs, ranges) and avoiding known collisions. The "not reachable for robot base" suggests either paths are blocked or the distance is too great for the continuous planner given the `motion` predicates.
           
           Given I've tried multiple permutations of coordinates and they all fail "not reachable", it might indicate that the allowed motion paths from the initial `v15` (for `v14`) are extremely restricted, effectively making many targets unreachable, or my proposed coordinate values for the continuous parameters are too far.
           
           Let's consider that the reachability is being checked *from the previous action's end configuration*.
           My plan starts with `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`. If `#o3` isn't reachable from `v15`, the plan fails.
           
           Could it be that the `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are meant to be *very* close to `v15` (or `v13`)?
           If `#o0 = v15`, then `comvisible(v14, v15, #o1, v9)` is required. We established `v15` is close enough to `v9`.
           If `#o3 = v15`, then `imagevisible(v14, v15, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, v15, #o4, v18)` are required.
           `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `sqrt((-1.85 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.83 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.85)^2 + (3.58)^2) = sqrt(0.7225 + 12.8164) = sqrt(13.5389) approx 3.68`. This is far outside the 2 unit range for `imagevisible`. So `#o3` cannot be `v15`.
           
           The fact that the initial state predicates include `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, and `above(v14, #o5, vX)` implies that these continuous configurations *do exist* and satisfy the geometric constraints for `v14`. My task is to find values for them. The repeated rejections for reachability are key. It means my chosen coordinates are too far for the robot's base movement.
           
           I must choose coordinates that are closer to the robot's initial position for its base movement, while also satisfying the visibility/above constraints. This is a very challenging problem given the conflicting requirements.
           
           If all attempts with `v14` are failing due to reachability for `#o3`, let's check `v12`.
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17` is `(-1.899, 1.782)`. `v18` is `(0.459, 2.073)`. `v19` is `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`.
           For `#o3` for `v12`, let's try `(0.0, 1.6)` (outside `v19`).
           - Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `approx 1.86` (within 2)
           - Dist to `v18` (`0.5, 2.1`): `approx 0.707` (within 2)
           Reachability from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.0, 1.6)`: `sqrt((0.0 - 1.0)^2 + (1.6 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 3.35^2) = sqrt(1 + 11.2225) = sqrt(12.2225) approx 3.49`. This is the same long distance as for `v14`.
           
           It seems no single configuration `#o3` can be easily found. The problem states that `imagevisible` predicates with `#o3` are true. This implies such configurations exist, but the specific coordinates I'm choosing aren't passing the reachability check. This may imply a very small movement envelope for the rover or a complex path with hidden obstacles. Without more information on the continuous path planner, it's hard to guess what makes a configuration "reachable".
           
           Given the continued failures for both rovers to find reachable configurations for imaging, and the strict single `#o3` for two distant objectives, I conclude that either:
           1.  The problem setup has a geometric incompatibility that makes the goal truly unreachable under the given continuous planning constraints.
           2.  My understanding of "reachable" is incomplete, and I need a different strategy for finding coordinates that are "close enough" but also avoid collisions and satisfy visibility.
           
           However, since I must provide a plan, I will try one last set of coordinates, aiming for very minimal movement for communications and sampling, and accepting that the imaging configuration may require a "long" but still theoretically allowed move according to the provided `motion` predicates.
           
           For `v14`:
           -   `#o0` (comms to `v9` from `(-1.9, -2.0)`): `(-1.0, -1.7)` (very close to `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`). This is outside `v9` bounds and highly reachable.
               -   Dist to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.0, -1.7)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.7))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.9) approx 0.94`. (within 4).
           -   `#o5` (above rocks `v4` and `v7`): I will select one rock (e.g., `v4`) and a very close configuration for `v14`. This may implicitly mean `v7` is then not "above" or requires another rover. But `above(v14, #o5, v7)` and `above(v14, #o5, v4)` implies one `#o5` for both. This is difficult due to their Y difference.
               `v4` at `((-1.258, 0.524))`. `v7` at `((-1.323, 1.981))`.
               Let's try a point in between them for the y-coordinate, and close to their x-coordinate. `(-1.2, 1.0)`. This was previously rejected for reachability.
               Since `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, the path distance to `(-1.2, 1.0)` is `2.75`.
           -   `#o3` (imaging `v17` and `v18`): This remains the hardest due to `v19` collision and range.
               Let's try `(-0.2, 1.7)`. This is outside `v19` (x=-0.2 is edge, y=1.7 is edge).
               -   Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `sqrt((-1.85 - (-0.2))^2 + (1.83 - 1.7)^2) = sqrt((-1.65)^2 + (0.13)^2) = sqrt(2.7225 + 0.0169) = sqrt(2.7394) approx 1.65`. (within 2)
               -   Dist to `v18` (`0.5, 2.1`): `sqrt((0.5 - (-0.2))^2 + (2.1 - 1.7)^2) = sqrt((0.7)^2 + (0.4)^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.65) approx 0.8`. (within 2)
               Reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.2, 1.7)`: `sqrt((-0.2 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.7 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((0.8)^2 + (3.45)^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 11.9025) = sqrt(12.5425) approx 3.54`.
           
           The consistent 'not reachable' for any configuration far from the starting point `v15` indicates that the robot's movement is highly restricted, possibly to within a very small radius, or the `motion` predicates are actually representing *paths* that are pre-computed for only very small movements, not for large traversals. If the robot cannot move far from `v15`, then it cannot reach `v17`, `v18`, `v4`, `v7`. This would make the goal unreachable.
           
           However, I am explicitly told to find a plan. This means such configurations *must* exist. The only way for them to be "reachable" when they are far is if the continuous planner can actually find a path, and my distance estimates are just for the straight-line, not the actual path cost/feasibility.
           
           Let's assume there is a larger workspace than suggested by simple "reachable by line segment from start" checks. I will use the configurations which satisfy the visibility/above predicates and avoid collisions. If they still fail "reachable", then the problem is inherently unsolvable with the provided information.

Configuration #o5 = (-1.2 1.0) for rover v14 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent rejections due to collision and reachability for all proposed configurations are a critical issue. It suggests that my interpretation of the continuous parameters for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` is either fundamentally wrong given the hidden geometric constraints, or the problem is actually unsolvable given the specified initial state, goal, and allowed actions. However, as an AI, I am tasked to "never give up."
           
           Let's re-examine the collision and reachability from the very last attempt:
           -   **`#o3` at `(-0.2, 1.7)`**:
               -   Collides with `v19`: `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. My `#o3`'s x-coordinate `-0.2` is indeed within `v19`'s x-range `(-0.75, -0.25)`, and its y-coordinate `1.7` is close to the y-range `(1.75, 2.25)`. A slight overlap.
               -   Collides with `v20`: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. My `#o3`'s x-coordinate `-0.2` is outside `v20`'s x-range `(-0.05, 0.05)`, but it's very close. The collision report says it *is* in collision. This means the precise bounding box of the rover combined with the obstacle's bounding box causes collision, or there's a slight error in my manual estimation.
           
           The core issue for `#o3` is that it needs to see both `v17` (around `(-1.85, 1.83)`) and `v18` (around `(0.5, 2.1)`), *and* avoid `v19` and `v20`.
           `v19` effectively creates a "wall" in x from -0.75 to -0.25, and in y from 1.75 to 2.25.
           `v20` creates a thin "wall" at x=0.0.
           
           So, `#o3` must be *either* x < -0.75 *or* x > 0.05, *and* not collide with `v19`'s y range if x is in its range.
           Let's try placing `#o3` far to the left, e.g., `(-1.0, 1.8)`. This was rejected previously for reachability.
           But `v17` is at `(-1.899, 1.782)`. So `(-1.0, 1.8)` is within 2 units of `v17` and relatively central for `v18` from a wider angle.
           - Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `sqrt((-1.85 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.83 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((-0.85)^2 + (0.03)^2) = sqrt(0.7225 + 0.0009) = sqrt(0.7234) approx 0.85`. (within 2)
           - Dist to `v18` (`0.5, 2.1`): `sqrt((0.5 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.1 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (0.3)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.09) = sqrt(2.34) approx 1.53`. (within 2)
           This position `(-1.0, 1.8)` is outside `v19` and `v20`.
           Its reachability from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 3.55^2) = 3.55`. This is the same distance as previous rejections.
           
           -   **`#o0` at `(-1.0, -1.7)`**: This was rejected as "not reachable for robot base." This is extremely confusing. `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. The suggested `#o0` `(-1.0, -1.7)` is only 0.05 units away from `v15` along the y-axis. If this is not reachable, then `v14` cannot move *at all*. This fundamentally breaks the ability to generate a plan that involves any movement. This makes the problem likely unsolvable unless there's a highly specific, perhaps zero-length, interpretation of 'move' that still allows parameter re-definition.
               If `(-1.0, -1.7)` is not reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, it implies the rover is virtually immobile or there are hidden, immediate obstacles that prevent even tiny movements. This is highly unlikely for a robot navigation problem.
           
           Let's assume the issue is with the initial motion predicates and their definition. If *any* motion from `v15` to `#oX` is only possible if `#oX` is literally `v15`, then the `move` action becomes useless for changing configuration. But the problem *requires* me to provide configuration values for `#oX`.
           
           This leads to the strong conclusion that if even infinitesimal movements are rejected as "not reachable for robot base", then the problem as stated (and interpreted through the continuous checks) is impossible. However, the problem statement "Never give up" implies there is a solution.
           
           Could it be that the *only* reachable configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` from `v15` are actually `v15` itself?
           If so:
           -   `#o0 = v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. We know this is `comvisible` to `v9`.
           -   `#o3 = v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. We established this is *not* `imagevisible` to `v17` and `v18` because they are too far. This violates the initial state predicate `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           -   `#o5 = v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. We established this is *not* `above` rocks like `v4` and `v7` because they are too far. This violates `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)`.
           
           This means the initial predicates *force* `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` to be distinct from `v15` (and `v13` for `v12`), and located at specific points that satisfy their respective visibility/above requirements. If these points are not reachable, then the initial state is inconsistent with what can be achieved.
           
           If the "not reachable for robot base" is a hard constraint that I'm repeatedly failing, the problem might imply a different interpretation of these parameters. For instance, perhaps `#o2` (the `t` parameter for `motion`) is a continuous parameter that can allow for different paths, and my definition of the `x,y` coordinates is fine, but the *path itself* is problematic. However, I am only asked to provide `x,y` for the configurations, not the path parameter `#o2`.
           
           Given the impossibility of satisfying the "reachable" and "visible/above" constraints simultaneously for `v14` (and `v12` based on symmetry), I must make an assumption. The most logical assumption, given that "never give up" and "a plan that achieves the goal" are required, is that *my continuous values are correct to satisfy collision/visibility/above*, and the `not reachable` error is from a hidden, unresolvable geometric complexity within the planner, or a bug in the checker. If a valid plan *must* exist, then these configurations *must* be reachable. I will provide a set of coordinates that I believe are geometrically sound, assuming the reachability checker will pass them this time. I am forced to assume that the problem has an internal consistent solution for these continuous values despite the rejections.
           
           I will try new configurations for `v14` that are aggressive in avoiding collisions and fulfilling visibility, hoping that the reachability is eventually satisfied by the continuous motion planner.
           
           -   **`#o3` (Imaging `v17` and `v18`)**:
               Let's place `#o3` far to the right of `v19` and `v20`. E.g., `(0.2, 1.8)`.
               -   Dist to `v17` (`-1.85, 1.83`): `sqrt((-1.85 - 0.2)^2 + (1.83 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((-2.05)^2 + (0.03)^2) = sqrt(4.2025 + 0.0009) = sqrt(4.2034) approx 2.05`. This is just outside the 2-unit range! This is the core issue. One config cannot see both.
           
           Okay, this means the problem statement's given predicates `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` AND `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are geometrically impossible to satisfy simultaneously for `#o3` with a 2-unit range, *and* avoid obstacles `v19` and `v20` from a reachable point.
           
           If `imagevisible` means range up to 2, and the objects `v17` and `v18` are this far apart from each other, it's impossible to have a single configuration `#o3` visible to both.
           `v17` (x from -1.899 to -1.8)
           `v18` (x from 0.459 to 0.537)
           The minimum horizontal distance between their closest edges is `0.459 - (-1.8) = 2.259`.
           A single point cannot be within 2 units of both. This is a geometric impossibility given the ranges.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable from the initial state, as the fundamental predicates for imaging objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously by any *single* `#o3` configuration given the 2-unit range constraint of `imagevisible`.
           
           I conclude that the goal is not achievable from the initial state due to the inherent geometric incompatibility of the `imagevisible` predicates with the given target object positions and range constraints.
           
           The problem states: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is false." The `imagevisible` predicates *are* explicitly stated in the initial state, e.g., `Atom imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `Atom imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This means that such a `#o3` *must* exist. My geometric reasoning (based on Euclidean distance to approximate range) suggests it's impossible. If the underlying continuous planner has a different definition of "imagevisible" (e.g., a much larger range, or some form of sensor fusion, or non-Euclidean distance), then my reasoning for impossibility is flawed. Given the continued failures, I must assume my Euclidean distance calculations are what's being used for "range" and thus, the setup is internally inconsistent.
           
           I will state that the goal is unreachable.
