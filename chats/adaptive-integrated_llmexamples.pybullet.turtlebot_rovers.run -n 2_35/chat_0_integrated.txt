           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down `new-axiom@0()` into its components:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is true for rocks v4, v3, v1 in the initial state.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This needs to be achieved for a rock of type `v2`. For example, `receivedanalysis(v4)` would satisfy this if `type(v4, v2)`.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is true for rocks v7, v8, v5 in the initial state.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This needs to be achieved for a rock of type `v6`. For example, `receivedanalysis(v7)` would satisfy this if `type(v7, v6)`.
           
           We need to make sure that `receivedimage` for `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` are achieved, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6` are achieved.
           
           Let's consider the available actions and how they can help us achieve these goals:
           
           *   **`move`**: This action changes the rover's configuration. We have `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are essentially no-op moves for now, as they move the rover from a config to the same config.
           *   **`take_image`**: This action allows a rover to take an image of an objective. It requires the camera to be calibrated.
           *   **`calibrate`**: This action calibrates a camera.
           *   **`send_image`**: This action sends a previously taken image to the lander.
           *   **`sample_rock`**: This action allows a rover to sample a rock. It makes the `analyzed` predicate true for the sampled rock and fills one of the rover's stores.
           *   **`send_analysis`**: This action sends the analysis of a rock to the lander.
           *   **`drop_rock`**: This action frees up a store on the rover.
           
           From the initial state, we have two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both are `atconf` their respective base configurations `v13` and `v15`. Both have `free` stores `v16`. `v10` is a camera and `onboard` both `v12` and `v14`, and `supports` mode `v11`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           We need to `take_image` of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`, then `send_image`.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates:
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           This means rover `v14` (or `v12`) can see both `v17` and `v18` from configuration `#o3`.
           So, for example, for `v14`:
           1.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)` (assuming `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `haveimage(v14, v18, v11)` are true)
           We also need to ensure that `#o3` and `#o0` are collision-free.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a type `v2` rock and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a type `v6` rock:
           We need to `sample_rock` for a rock of each type, then `send_analysis`.
           Rocks of type `v2`: `v4`, `v3`, `v1`.
           Rocks of type `v6`: `v7`, `v8`, `v5`.
           We have `above` predicates for rover `v14` and `v12` at configuration `#o5`:
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v3)` (type v2)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v7)` (type v6)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v1)` (type v2)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v8)` (type v6)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v4)` (type v2)
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v5)` (type v6)
               *   Similar for `v12` at `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick rover `v14` to do all the tasks, as it's sufficient.
           
           To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           1.  Calibrate camera `v10` for rover `v14` to observe `v18` at config `#o3`.
           2.  Take image of `v18` using `v10` with mode `v11` at config `#o3`.
           3.  Calibrate camera `v10` for rover `v14` to observe `v17` at config `#o3` (re-calibration is needed because `take_image` uncalibrates).
           4.  Take image of `v17` using `v10` with mode `v11` at config `#o3`.
           5.  Send image of `v18` from rover `v14` at config `#o0` to lander `v9`.
           6.  Send image of `v17` from rover `v14` at config `#o0` to lander `v9`.
           
           To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6`:
           We need to sample one rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`. Let's pick `v4` (type `v2`) and `v7` (type `v6`).
           1.  Sample rock `v4` (type `v2`) by `v14` at config `#o5` using store `v16`. This will make `analyzed(v14, v4)` true.
           2.  Send analysis of `v4` from rover `v14` at config `#o0` to lander `v9`.
           3.  Sample rock `v7` (type `v6`) by `v14` at config `#o5` using store `v16`. Note that `sample_rock` fills `v16`, so we need to `drop_rock` after sampling `v4` before sampling `v7`.
               *   Wait, the goal only requires `receivedanalysis(?r)` where `type(?r, v2)` and `type(?r, v6)`. It does not require `analyzed(?v, ?r)` to persist on the rover. So, we can sample, send analysis, then drop, and repeat.
               *   Alternatively, the goal is `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. This means we need one analysis of type `v2` rock and one analysis of type `v6` rock to be received. We don't need to retain the analyzed state of rocks on the rover itself.
           
           Let's refine the plan for sampling and sending analysis:
           1.  Sample `v4` (type `v2`) by `v14` at `#o5`. (`free(v14, v16)` becomes `full(v14, v16)`)
           2.  Send analysis of `v4` by `v14` at `#o0`. (`receivedanalysis(v4)` becomes true).
           3.  Drop rock from store `v16` of `v14`. (`full(v14, v16)` becomes `free(v14, v16)`)
           4.  Sample `v7` (type `v6`) by `v14` at `#o5`. (`free(v14, v16)` becomes `full(v14, v16)`)
           5.  Send analysis of `v7` by `v14` at `#o0`. (`receivedanalysis(v7)` becomes true).
           
           All preconditions seem to be met or can be met.
           The order of actions: it's better to group actions by rover and then by location if possible to reduce unnecessary moves, but in this case, the `move` actions are no-ops from the initial configurations to the same configurations. The key is to satisfy the preconditions for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.
           
           Using rover `v14`:
           Initial state: `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `onboard(v10, v14)`, `supports(v10, v11)`.
           Objectives `v17` and `v18`.
           Rocks `v4` (type `v2`) and `v7` (type `v6`).
           
           Plan:
           1.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` to observe `v18`.
           2.  Take image of `v18` with `v14` at `#o3` using `v10` in mode `v11`.
           3.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` to observe `v17`. (re-calibration needed after `take_image`)
           4.  Take image of `v17` with `v14` at `#o3` using `v10` in mode `v11`.
           5.  Send image of `v18` from `v14` at `#o0` to `v9`.
           6.  Send image of `v17` from `v14` at `#o0` to `v9`.
           7.  Sample rock `v4` (type `v2`) with `v14` at `#o5` using store `v16`.
           8.  Send analysis of `v4` from `v14` at `#o0` to `v9`.
           9.  Drop rock from `v14`'s store `v16`.
           10. Sample rock `v7` (type `v6`) with `v14` at `#o5` using store `v16`.
           11. Send analysis of `v7` from `v14` at `#o0` to `v9`.
           
           The configurations to provide values for are `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`.
           *   `#o0` is used for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` (rover v14, target v9) and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` (rover v12, target v9). We only need to provide for v14 as v12 isn't used for communication in this plan.
           *   `#o3` is used for `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` (rover v14, target v18) and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` (rover v14, target v17).
           *   `#o5` is used for `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, etc. (rover v14, target rock).
           
           For `#o3`, the `imagevisible` predicates are for `v18` and `v17`. We can pick a single configuration `#o3` that allows viewing both.
           For `#o5`, the `above` predicates are for rocks `v3`, `v7`, `v1`, `v8`, `v4`, `v5`. We need `#o5` to be above *some* rocks of type v2 and *some* rocks of type v6.
           
           Let's estimate configuration values:
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.
           Lander `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Objectives `v17` is at `((-1.899, 1.782), (-1.8, 1.881))`, `v18` is at `((0.459, 2.073), (0.537, 2.15))`.
           Rocks: `v4` at `((-1.258, 0.524), (-1.166, 0.616))`, `v7` at `((-1.323, 1.981), (-1.182, 2.122))`.
           
           For `#o0` (comms for `v14` to `v9`):
           Rover `v14`'s x is around -1.0. Lander `v9`'s x is around -1.9. Y for rover is -1.75. Y for lander is around -2.0.
           A point like `(-1.0, -2.0)` or `(-1.5, -2.0)` for `#o0` would be good. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           For `#o3` (image for `v14` to `v17` and `v18`):
           Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17` is at `(-1.85, 1.83)`. `v18` is at `(0.49, 2.11)`.
           These targets are in different directions and far from the rover. A configuration closer to the targets would be better.
           Perhaps closer to `v17` and `v18` but still reachable.
           Let's try a point that allows seeing both, for example, `(0.0, 0.0)`. This point is equidistant from both objectives, but the maximum range is 2. `v17` is at `(-1.85, 1.83)`, `v18` is at `(0.49, 2.11)`. The distance from `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v17` is `sqrt((-1.85)^2 + (1.83)^2) = sqrt(3.42 + 3.34) = sqrt(6.76) = 2.6`. This is greater than 2, so `(0.0, 0.0)` won't work for `v17`.
           We need to pick a configuration `#o3` such that `v14` can see `v17` and `v18`. Since `v17` and `v18` are far apart, it's possible that a single configuration cannot see both within range 2.
           Let's assume the problem allows a single `#o3` that is `imagevisible` for both, and that the planner takes care of the exact location.
           If `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` are given, it means such a configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4` exists for both. The geometry for `v18` is `((0.459, 2.073), (0.537, 2.15))`. A point like `(0.5, 0.5)` could see `v18`. Distance from `(0.5, 0.5)` to `v18` (center `(0.498, 2.111)`) is `sqrt((0.498-0.5)^2 + (2.111-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.000004 + 2.595) approx 1.6`. This is within range.
           For `v17` at `(-1.85, 1.83)`. A point like `(-1.0, 1.0)` could see `v17`. Distance `sqrt((-1.85 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.83-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.85)^2 + (0.83)^2) = sqrt(0.72 + 0.68) = sqrt(1.4) approx 1.18`. This is within range.
           Since we have `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` from the initial state using the *same* `#o3` and `#o4`, we must use that single `#o3` value. Let's find a point within 2 units of both. This implies the two objects must be within about 4 units of each other.
           `v17` center: `(-1.85, 1.83)`, `v18` center: `(0.49, 2.11)`.
           Distance between `v17` and `v18`: `sqrt((0.49 - (-1.85))^2 + (2.11 - 1.83)^2) = sqrt(2.34^2 + 0.28^2) = sqrt(5.47 + 0.078) = sqrt(5.55) approx 2.35`.
           Since the distance is about 2.35, it's possible for a single point to be within 2 units of both. Let's try the midpoint `((-1.85+0.49)/2, (1.83+2.11)/2) = (-1.36/2, 3.94/2) = (-0.68, 1.97)`.
           Distance from `(-0.68, 1.97)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.85 - (-0.68))^2 + (1.83 - 1.97)^2) = sqrt((-1.17)^2 + (-0.14)^2) = sqrt(1.36 + 0.0196) = sqrt(1.3796) approx 1.17`.
           Distance from `(-0.68, 1.97)` to `v18`: `sqrt((0.49 - (-0.68))^2 + (2.11 - 1.97)^2) = sqrt(1.17^2 + 0.14^2) = sqrt(1.36 + 0.0196) = sqrt(1.3796) approx 1.17`.
           This point `(-0.68, 1.97)` works for `#o3`.
           
           For `#o5` (above rocks for `v14`):
           Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Rocks `v4` at `((-1.258, 0.524), (-1.166, 0.616))`, `v7` at `((-1.323, 1.981), (-1.182, 2.122))`.
           To be "above", the rover's configuration should be directly above the rock. A configuration with the same x,y coordinates as the rock (or slightly offset for the robot's base) is needed.
           Since `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, etc. are provided, there is a single `#o5` for all these rocks. This implies all these rocks are clustered, or a single `#o5` allows access to them. The rocks are `v3: (0.7, 0.2)`, `v7: (-1.25, 2.05)`, `v1: (0.97, 1.22)`, `v8: (-1.27, 1.66)`, `v4: (-1.21, 0.57)`, `v5: (1.47, -1.24)`. These rocks are very spread out. This means my interpretation of `above` for continuous values might be too strict or the PDDL abstract geometry differs from physical geometry. However, given that these `above` predicates are true for the *same* `#o5`, I'll assume that `#o5` is a location that allows the robot to reach all of these, e.g., a central location or a specific pose where it can extend an arm. Let's use `(-1.0, 0.0)` as a candidate location, close to some rocks and somewhat central.
           
           Let's assume the provided initial state means that a single point `#o5` can be used to sample all the relevant rocks. Let's use `(-1.0, 0.0)`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v4) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The list of valid actions provided is extremely limited:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which needs:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: True for `v4`, `v3`, `v1`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Needs to be achieved for a type `v2` rock (e.g., `v4`).
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: True for `v7`, `v8`, `v5`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Needs to be achieved for a type `v6` rock (e.g., `v7`).
           
           The valid actions only allow for no-op moves for rovers and dropping rocks. There are no actions available for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`.
           Without these actions, it is impossible to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of valid actions.
