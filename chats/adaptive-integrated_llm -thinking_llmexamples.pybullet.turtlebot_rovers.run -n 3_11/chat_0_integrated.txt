           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I'm tasked with devising a plan to satisfy a complex goal, `new-axiom@0()`.  This goal boils down to ensuring several conditions hold true:  confirming the initial states of rover positions, the store availability, proving the existence of different rock types, and most importantly, receiving both images and analyses.  To succeed, I need the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to gather and transmit information. The specifics dictate that I need to capture images of objectives  `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using mode `v11` and also analyze two types of rock, `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil), and transmit those findings too.
           
           **Action Examination**
           
           Next, I examined the available actions I could utilize to reach my end goal. These actions span moving the rovers, taking and transmitting images, analyzing and transmitting rock samples, and dropping the rocks. I found a few problems:
           *   The only move action instances available for the rovers are to stay at the same places in which they are in the beginning. So, `v14` is permanently at `v15` and `v12` permanently at `v13`.
           *   To take an image, calibrate the camera, or send an image, a rover must be at configurations such as `#o3` or `#o0`, respectively.
           *   To sample rocks a rover needs to be at a configuration such as `#o5`.
           *   Because the rovers are fixed to their initial configurations, they can not take any of the necessary actions to progress and achieve our ultimate goal.
           
           **Configuration Analysis and Constraints**
           
           The critical constraint involves the configurations.  The goal explicitly leverages configurations that aren't the starting ones. My preliminary assessment revealed a disconnect. The actions requiring configurations like `#o0` (comms) and `#o3` (imaging) are necessary for successful image transmission and analysis transmission, as well as sampling. Yet, the available *move* actions are self-referential: the rovers are stuck! My examination of the `move` preconditions reinforced this:  the rovers' `atconf` states can not be changed given that they start in `v15` and `v13`.
           
           **Plan Unfeasibility and Conclusion**
           
           The situation is dire. Given the rigid limitations imposed by the `move` action set, and the need to be at configurations other than the starting ones, I can't construct a valid plan. Achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` components of the goal is fundamentally impossible because I can't make the rovers arrive at the necessary configurations. As such, the comprehensive goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
