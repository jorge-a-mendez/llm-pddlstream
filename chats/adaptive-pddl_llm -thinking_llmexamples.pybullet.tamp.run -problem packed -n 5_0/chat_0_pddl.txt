               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My task is to create a plan to achieve the goal: all objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 'on' object v20. This means each object needs to be at a pose that is supported by v20.  I analyzed the initial state, noting that each target object currently rests on v11 and has a known 'pose(#o2)' that is supported by v20.  My immediate thought was that a series of *pick* and *place* actions would be the direct solution: pick up each object from its initial pose on v11 and place it on v20 at the pose #o2.
           
           However, the key constraint here is the *list of valid action instances*. I have received *only one* action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This seems like a no-op, as the base's configuration remains unchanged, and it crucially consumes the `canmove()` predicate. This completely blocks me from executing any *pick* or *place* actions, which are *necessary* to manipulate the objects and achieve the goal. No other action instances, like picking, placing, or any kind of grasping are allowed.
           
           My analysis reveals that to achieve the *on* predicate, both the *supported* and *atpose* predicates must be true.  While the *supported* predicate is already satisfied (each object has `supported(o, #o2, v20)` in the initial state), the *atpose* predicate needs to change through *pick* and *place* actions.  Since these actions are strictly prohibited due to the list of invalid action instances, the goal state cannot be reached. Therefore, the task is *unachievable* given the provided limited action instances.
