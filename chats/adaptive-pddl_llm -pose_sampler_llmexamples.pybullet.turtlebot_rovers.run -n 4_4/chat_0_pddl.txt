User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical obstacle along x=0. The scene also contains several smaller obstacles, some of which are clustered near the corners and some are scattered in the open spaces. I'm aiming to find diverse positions around the target point that avoid the known obstacles and are within the allowed range. I will prioritize positions that are clearly in open spaces.
