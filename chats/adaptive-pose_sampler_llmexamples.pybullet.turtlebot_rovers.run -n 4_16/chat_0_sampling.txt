           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a vertical wall (obstacle 5) running along x=0, effectively dividing the room into two halves. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the edges and some more centrally located.
           
           My strategy will be to consider positions that are within the max_range=2 from the target point. I will try to prioritize positions that are not directly behind known obstacles, and I will try to spread out the chosen positions to increase the chances of finding valid placements.

Model:     My previous attempt was unsuccessful, as all three proposed positions failed. The target point is at (-1.8468083143234253, 1.9893226623535156). The first position failed due to collision with obstacle 5, which is the wall at x=0. This makes sense as the proposed x-coordinate was 0.17. The other two failed due to no line of sight, which suggests that the wall at x=0 is blocking the view from the negative y-coordinates. I need to ensure that the proposed x-coordinate is on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target, or if on the other side, that there is an opening. Given the target's x-coordinate is -1.84, I should prioritize negative x values for the base position. Also, the target's y-coordinate is positive (1.98), so I should look for positions with positive y-coordinates to avoid potential occlusions by the wall at x=0 and other obstacles.

Model:     The previous attempts were for two different target points, which makes the feedback a bit confusing. I need to focus on the *current* target point which is (0.39525777101516724, 1.869476318359375).
           
           For this target point, the proposed positions:
           1. (-1.8468083143234253, 0.9893226623535156) collided with obstacle 14: ((-2.0715038457918253, 0.800929399390212), (-1.938999923129073, 0.9334333220529643)). This means the x-coordinate was too far left and the y too low.
           2. (-0.8468083143234253, 1.9893226623535156) collided with obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)). This means the x-coordinate was too far left and the y-coordinate was within an obstacle.
           3. (-1.8468083143234253, 1.5) had no line of sight. This likely means obstacles between the proposed position and the target are blocking the view, potentially the wall at x=0 or some of the obstacles in the negative x, positive y quadrant.
           
           The target point is (0.39525777101516724, 1.869476318359375). It is in the upper-right quadrant (positive x, positive y).
           Obstacles in this vicinity include:
           - 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) - This obstacle is very close to the target point.
           - 11: ((0.49422005334279107, 0.6541287056483941), (0.6354438909015937, 0.7953525432071967))
           - 20: ((0.35871520633428144, 1.8329337536784893), (0.43180033569605303, 1.9060188830402607)) - This obstacle is *right on* the target point, or at least encompassing it. This means I need to be careful to place the robot such that this obstacle doesn't block the view. The target is inside obstacle 20.
           - 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - the wall at x=0.
           
           Given that the target is within obstacle 20, I should try to place the robot close to the target, on either side of obstacle 20, but making sure to avoid it. I should also avoid the wall at x=0 if the target is on the positive x side, but that depends on the exact x-coordinate of the target relative to the wall. The target's x-coordinate is 0.395, which is on the positive side of x=0. The x-range of obstacle 20 is (0.358, 0.431), so the target is indeed inside it.
           
           I will try to place positions to the right, below, and above the target, all within the max range of 2. Given the target is at (0.395, 1.869), and close to obstacle 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)), I need to consider it as well. Obstacle 20 is also very close to the target.
