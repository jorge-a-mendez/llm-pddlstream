User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.391, 0.199), (-4.295, 0.295)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.343, 0.247, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.966, -0.259).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` are true. This means that either `v8` or `v12` can be the `?green` object.
           
           The initial state also contains `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, which means `on(v8, v11)`. It also contains `supported(v15, v16, v11)`, `atpose(v15, v16)`, which means `on(v15, v11)`. Finally, `supported(v12, v13, v14)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, which means `on(v12, v14)`.
           
           The goal requires `on(?green, v18)`. This means we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Since `v18` is a dummy surface (no continuous value provided), we can place it on any other surface. Since `v11` has a known bounding box, we will place it on `v11`. There is no pick or place action available, which makes this problem unsolvable unless the goal is already satisfied.
           
           However, an axiom is a derived fact, not something that can be achieved through actions. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state:
           - `type(v8, v17)` is true.
           - `type(v12, v17)` is true.
           - `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true.
           - `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` is true. For `on(v8, v18)` to be true, we need `atpose(v8, ?p)` and `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`.
           We have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. If `v8` can be placed at `#o2`, then `on(v8, v18)` would be true. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available for this, and the only available action is `move_base`. Therefore, we cannot move `v8` to `v18`.
           
           Given the current state and the available actions, the only action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action does not change the state of `on` or `type` predicates. Since no `pick` or `place` actions are available, the robot cannot manipulate any objects to satisfy the `on(?green, v18)` condition if it is not already true.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           Currently, `on(v8, v11)` and `on(v12, v14)`. We need `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           The initial state explicitly states `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This means there exist poses for `v8` and `v12` on `v18`. However, `atpose` for these objects is not set to these `#o2` poses.
           Since `type(v8, v17)` is true, if we could get `on(v8, v18)`, the goal would be satisfied.
           Since `type(v12, v17)` is true, if we could get `on(v12, v18)`, the goal would be satisfied.
           However, there are no actions to change the `on` predicate. The only available action is `move_base`, which doesn't affect `on` or `type` predicates.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that evaluates to true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` is true.
           From the initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` are true.
           For `on(?green, v18)` to be true, we would need an object of type `v17` to be currently on `v18`.
           Currently, we have:
           `on(v8, v11)` because `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`.
           `on(v12, v14)` because `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`.
           `on(v15, v11)` because `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)`.
           None of these objects are currently on `v18`.
           
           The available action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action only changes base configuration and does not affect the `on` predicate or object types. Therefore, the robot cannot achieve the goal with the given actions.
