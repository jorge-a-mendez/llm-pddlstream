User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (2.19 -0.06).
           The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5.
           There's a vertical wall along x=0.
           Several small obstacles are scattered throughout the environment, particularly around the corners and along the y-axis in the positive quadrant.
           
           Given the target point (2.19, -0.06), which is on the right side of the x=0 wall, I will focus on finding positions to the right of this wall (x > 0). The wall at x=0 (obstacle 5) is a major constraint.
           I should prioritize positions close to the target point and try to circle around it.
           I'll try to find positions within the allowed x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5] range.
           The maximum range from the target is 4.

           It seems like previous attempts have issues with line of sight, implying there are unseen obstacles or the fixed obstacles are blocking.
           Let's try positions further away from the obstacles and target, and try to get a better view. I will try to stay away from the y=0 line as well, as some obstacles are around there.
           I'll try to find positions within the allowed x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5] range.
