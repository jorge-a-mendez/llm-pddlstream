User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.268, 0.317), (-0.18, 0.405)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.191, 0.176), (0.274, 0.26)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.113, 0.342), (-0.014, 0.441)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.224, 0.361, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.808, 0.589).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.233, 0.218, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.108, 0.994).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.064, 0.391, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.936, 0.352).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects (v8, v12, v14) currently supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. There are continuous parameters to be determined for object poses (#o2 for v12, v8, v14 on v10 or v16), grasp (#o1 for v8, v12, v14), a base configuration (#o3) and an arm trajectory (#o4). However, the initial state also provides specific poses and grasps that can be used directly. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies that the robot's base is already in the correct configuration and does not need to move. The arm actions are the ones that will be used.
           
           The strategy will be to pick each object from its current location (on v11) and place it on v16. Since there are three objects and two arms (v4 and v6), we need to check if both arms can be used. The initial state shows `ataconf(v4, v5)` and `ataconf(v6, v7)`, and both arms are `handempty`. The provided `kin` facts only involve arm `v4`, so we'll exclusively use `v4` for picking and placing. We also need to compute the specific poses on v16 for each object.
           
           For v8: currently at v9 on v11. We need to pick it and place it on v16.
           For v12: currently at v13 on v11. We need to pick it and place it on v16.
           For v14: currently at v15 on v11. We need to pick it and place it on v16.
           
           Since the goal requires objects to be `on` v16, we need to find suitable poses (#o2) for each object on v16.
           Since no motion of the base is allowed, the robot's base will remain at v3. The `kin` facts also involve #o3, the base configuration, which we will set to v3. The grasp parameter #o1 can be used for all picks and places.
           
           We must define distinct poses for each object on v16 that are collision-free.
           v8 and v16 AABB: ((-0.268, 0.317), (-0.18, 0.405)) and ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           v12 and v16 AABB: ((-0.113, 0.342), (-0.014, 0.441)) and ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           v14 and v16 AABB: ((0.191, 0.176), (0.274, 0.26)) and ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The goal is to place objects on `v16`. Since `v16` is a small object, the objects must be placed carefully.
           Let's define pose #o2 for v8 on v16, pose #o5 for v12 on v16 and pose #o6 for v14 on v16.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o5 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o6 #o1 v3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v16): (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           (#o5 v12 v16): (0.0 -0.05 0.781 0.0)
           (#o6 v14 v16): (0.0 0.05 0.781 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o5 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o6 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid action instances only includes `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This means that the robot can only perform a trivial base movement (moving from v3 to v3). All pick and place actions, which are necessary to achieve the goal of placing objects on `v16`, are not available in the given list of valid actions. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions.
