           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Analysis of a Planning Problem Involving Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a task: move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current surface (v11) to another surface (v20). Sounds straightforward, right?  The plan is to use the 'pick' and 'place' actions, utilizing the robot arm (v4), a specific grasp (#o1), a base configuration (#o3), and an arm trajectory (#o4). The initial base configuration is v3.  The problem provides all the required information in the facts.
           
           The core of the problem is knowing where to place each object on the target surface, v20, without collisions. There's a rule that I need to be careful of: the AABBs defined in the problem refer to the actual shape of the object.  I've got this axiom that checks for collisions, it uses a 'cfree' check to make sure the poses aren't overlapping. I need to make sure the target poses don't intersect.
           
           Initially, I looked at the setup, objects and how they're supported in the environment. And I need to use the available predicates in my plan.
           
           My initial thought was that a sequence of pick-and-place actions would do the trick.  Pick from the current location, and place on the target surface, repeat.  Easy peasy.
           
           I then did a breakdown of each object: The problem gave me some info: each object has its own origin in its `atpose` facts. These represent the center of the bounding boxes defined by the problems.
           
           I figured I'd just place the objects on a grid and get to work.
           
           However, things got tricky fast.  The key turned out to be how the object's `AABB`s and `pose` coordinates were interpreted. The *local* `AABB` is the *actual* dimensions of the object, which I have to transform with the `pose` for its *global* location.
           
           Then came the realization:  the available space on the target surface (v20) is small compared to the size of the objects. It's a tight fit. The objects are roughly 0.1m x 0.1m each, and I have 5 of them, but they need to fit into the `v20` square, which has dimensions of approximately 0.27m x 0.27m.
           
           Because each object will be placed at a pose that is a local reference. Its coordinates will make the transformed bounding box and make everything overlap. 
           
           This became a real spatial puzzle.  I had to ensure that the objects, when placed, wouldn't overlap.  This required carefully choosing the x and y coordinates of their poses.  But it turned out to be *impossible* to make the arrangements non-colliding. The *global* bounding boxes (the actual space the objects take up) needed to be distinct.  But due to the object's shapes, and the limited space, every arrangement I tried led to inevitable overlap.
           
           The AABBs of the objects and the target surface made this hard.
           
           After all that, I have to conclude that given the geometric constraints, the goal is not reachable. There is no plan that can move all the objects without a collision. The configuration is impossible to achieve given the geometry.
