           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:

           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t7', 'v12', 'p5')->()`, which impeded executing the action place('v4', 'v14', 'p6', '#g0', '#q5', '#t7').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Reflecting on the Plan to Move Objects onto v20**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get all these objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – onto v20.  They're all currently supported by v11, that large surface, and also have some initial poses on v10 and v20 itself. The goal is straightforward: each object on v20, specifically at its designated pose, which we can infer from the supported relationships in the initial state.
           
           The previous plan, according to the feedback, ran into trouble with the `test-cfree-traj-pose` check when placing v14 at p6.  The system indicated a collision between the trajectory for placing v14 and v12 already being at p5. Hmm, that suggests the object placement order or the trajectories themselves are the problem.
           
           Let’s see. The plan had some issues, and I believe that the problem lied in object pose names. The target pose for placing these objects is `p5`, `p6`, `p7`, `p8`, and `p9`. There is a contradiction between `p5` and `p7`, in that, I am to place `v12` at `p5` and `v16` at `p7` but `p5` and `p7` have the same coordinates. This is not possible, as two objects cannot occupy the same space. I must determine if `p5` or `p7` is meant to use `#o2` or if both must.
           
           After pondering, I think I am going to choose `#o2` for one. It can be for any one of the objects. It seems like the best thing to do is to place an item at position `#o2`.
           
           The instructions state that for `#`, I must provide a pose. I need to make sure there are no other items around the surface that are going to be in the way. I believe that since only `v16` will use this placeholder, then I can easily determine the location that it should have.
           
           So, for now, let’s reorder the targets to see if it fixes the trajectory problems. For the plan, it might be better to start off with a `v14` action. It could prevent `v12` from getting in the way. I need to get the order correct. It could also be that the path is an issue. Since the problem gave a fail on the plan previously, that might mean I need to find a new action. 
           
           The previous problem had a collision, I believe. The placement, however, might fix it. The best thing is to place the object at the farthest location first, then move inward from there. The problem is that there aren’t really any positions, and I need to make some assumptions here.
           
           To keep it simple, I'll go with the given pose information and just place the object in the order that will minimize any potential collisions. This will mean starting with the placement of v8, v18, v16, v14 and finally v12. I'll define `#o2` for `v16` and ensure it's a collision-free placement. This should prevent the collision that occurred earlier and allow me to find a plan for this.
           
           So, in short, I'm going to redefine the placement pose for an item, change the order in which the plan is executed, and re-run to make sure it functions as expected. I need to keep the process in order so that nothing interferes. This might be a tough process.

Model:     **Reflecting on the Plan to Move Objects onto v20**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get all these objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – onto v20.  They're all currently supported by v11, that large surface, and also have some initial poses on v10 and v20 itself. The goal is straightforward: each object on v20, specifically at its designated pose, which we can infer from the supported relationships in the initial state.
           
           The previous plan, according to the feedback, ran into trouble with the `test-cfree-traj-pose` check when placing v14 at p6.  The system indicated a collision between the trajectory for placing v14 and v12 already being at p5. Hmm, that suggests the object placement order or the trajectories themselves are the problem.
           
           Let’s see. The plan had some issues, and I believe that the problem lied in object pose names. The target pose for placing these objects is `p5`, `p6`, `p7`, `p8`, and `p9`. There is a contradiction between `p5` and `p7`, in that, I am to place `v12` at `p5` and `v16` at `p7` but `p5` and `p7` have the same coordinates. This is not possible, as two objects cannot occupy the same space. I must determine if `p5` or `p7` is meant to use `#o2` or if both must.
           
           After pondering, I think I am going to choose `#o2` for one. It can be for any one of the objects. It seems like the best thing to do is to place an item at position `#o2`.
           
           The instructions state that for `#`, I must provide a pose. I need to make sure there are no other items around the surface that are going to be in the way. I believe that since only `v16` will use this placeholder, then I can easily determine the location that it should have.
           
           So, for now, let’s reorder the targets to see if it fixes the trajectory problems. For the plan, it might be better to start off with a `v14` action. It could prevent `v12` from getting in the way. I need to get the order correct. It could also be that the path is an issue. Since the problem gave a fail on the plan previously, that might mean I need to find a new action.
