               Atom on(v12, v16)

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto the surface `v16`. This requires achieving the conditions `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The 'on' predicate signifies that the respective objects must be supported by `v16` at their designated poses.
           
           From the initial state, I've gathered pertinent information: I've identified graspable and stackable objects and established the existing support relations. Crucially, the target surface `v16` and the required poses (`#o2`) are known. I also have the `kin` information. The key challenge lies in realizing that moving these objects necessitates actions, specifically `pick` and `place` actions, to change their poses.
           
           The problem, however, introduces a severe constraint: I am permitted to utilize only one specific action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move_base action doesn't modify the `atpose` of my targets. This is where I start to realize the goal is not reachable. This effectively limits me to base motion only, leaving me with no means to manipulate the target objects' positions.
           
           The fundamental operation needed to fulfill the goal requires `pick` and `place` actions that I can't use. To achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, I must manipulate the objects' `atpose` values to `atpose(v8, #o2)`, `atpose(v12, #o2)`, and `atpose(v14, #o2)`. This inevitably means that `pick` and `place` must be applied, which are forbidden.
           
           I now conclude that the goal is unattainable under the imposed restrictions. The availability of just `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` creates a critical bottleneck. There's no possible way to execute the operations that directly manipulate objects and meet the required target conditions.
