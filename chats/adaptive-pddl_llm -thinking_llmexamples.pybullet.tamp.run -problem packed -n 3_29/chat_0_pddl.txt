           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this problem is about achieving these `on` predicates: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. In essence, I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on top of `v16`. I start with these objects supported by `v11`.
           
           Now, the crucial part is the *actions* available to me. I've got this single `move_base` action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the base... from and to the *same* location. It's effectively a no-op as far as my goal is concerned. The `canmove()` flag gets consumed and then, oddly, gets re-set.
           
           Let's look at what I *need*. I need to move these objects. That demands `pick` and `place` actions. However, those actions are conspicuously *missing* from the list of valid action instances. Worse yet, that means I can't interact with those objects.
           
           It is clear that the lack of any `pick` and `place` action instances is the deal-breaker here. These actions are fundamental for achieving the goal as they provide the required functionality. Without them, I can't modify the `on` predicates, meaning the objects will never be moved as required by the goal. The single `move_base` instance is useless for this.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, this goal is unreachable.
