(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a 0.07x0.07 object, on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface's boundaries. Since the object is square-like, I can ignore rotation for this initial attempt, and set `theta` to 0.
           
           First, I calculate the allowable ranges for the object's center coordinates (cx, cy). The surface's x range is [4.2, 4.8], and y range is [-0.6, 0.0]. The object's effective half-width and half-height are 0.035 each. For full containment, I need to ensure that the bounding box of the object remains within the surface boundary. That gives me:
           
           *   `4.2 + 0.035 <= cx <= 4.8 - 0.035`  =>  `4.235 <= cx <= 4.765`
           *   `-0.6 + 0.035 <= cy <= 0.0 - 0.035`  =>  `-0.565 <= cy <= -0.035`
           
           Now, I want to create a grid of cx and cy values within these ranges. I decided on a grid with a spacing of 0.05 between the coordinates. I'm choosing a spacing of 0.05 for both `cx` and `cy`.
           
           For `cx`, this gives me the values: `4.235, 4.285, 4.335, 4.385, 4.435, 4.485, 4.535, 4.585, 4.635, 4.685, 4.735`.
           
           For `cy`, I have: `-0.565, -0.515, -0.465, -0.415, -0.365`.
           
           By combining these values, I can generate a set of placements. Since I need exactly 50 placements, I'll take the first 50 values. I'll simply generate them in a loop, assigning `theta = 0` for each. I'll assign the surface index to 0 for each of the placement. The full solution will consist of these coordinates, surface index and a rotation. I have verified that all placements meet the bounds.

(Thoughts: **Planning Object Placement: ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, let's get to work on placing object ID 10. Based on the previous feedback, I know surface 0 seems relatively clear of fixed obstacles, at least in the areas where I successfully placed object ID 5. Now, I have the dimensions for object 10: approximately 0.0973 x 0.0973.  This is basically a square, so its bounding box won't change with rotation.
           
           The surface bounds for placement are ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  I've already calculated that for a stable placement (cx, cy) I need to make sure:
           `4.24865 <= cx <= 4.75135` and `-0.55135 <= cy <= -0.04865`.
           
           The key here is that I need to generate 50 stable placements, and according to the problem statement, I don't necessarily have to avoid object ID 5 *this* time.  The rules about avoiding collisions only apply *after* an object has been successfully placed. Right now, I'm just placing a new object.  So, I can focus on finding stable positions for object 10 on surface 0 without concerning myself with the placement of object 5.
           
           For efficient generation, I'll use my established grid-based approach with a step size of 0.05. I've worked out the values.
           
           *   `cx` values: 4.24865, 4.29865, 4.34865, 4.39865, 4.44865, 4.49865, 4.54865, 4.59865, 4.64865, 4.69865, 4.74865.
           *   `cy` values: -0.55135, -0.50135, -0.45135, -0.40135, -0.35135, -0.30135, -0.25135, -0.20135, -0.15135, -0.10135, -0.05135.
           
           This grid provides 121 possible stable placements. Since I only need 50, I'll select the first 50 positions iterating through `cy` then `cx` and set all rotation angles (`theta`) to 0.0. I'll make sure to double check that all placements satisfy the requirements for stability.
