               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My initial assessment is that the provided goal, achieving `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`, is **unachievable** with the given constraints. The key lies in understanding the `on` predicate, which requires an object to be *at a specific pose* and *supported* by another object.  The initial state provides the supported relationship; however, the crucial element is the *pose* of each object.
           
           Analyzing the problem, I know that all four objects are initially supported by `v11` at their individual poses. The goal demands these objects be on `v18`.  `on(?o, ?r)` expands to `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I can see that `supported(?o, #o2, v18)` holds in the initial state, indicating #o2 as the target pose.
           
           However, a critical restriction arises from the permissible actions. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action manipulates the robot's base but doesn't modify object poses.  To achieve `atpose(?o, #o2)`, I would need `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* permitted.  I need to pick each object from their initial location and place them on `v18` at pose #o2.  Without the ability to move objects, the goal of `on(v8,v18)`, `on(v12,v18)`, `on(v14,v18)`, and `on(v16,v18)` is unattainable.  The restriction on using specific action instances directly translates to an unachievable state.
