(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to achieve the following: to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. I have to rely on the current state. The initial state provides crucial information. The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are graspable and currently supported on surface `v11` at their respective poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17`). They're also supported on `v18` at pose `#o2`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and the base configuration is `v3`.
           
           The core concept here is the `on` axiom: `on(?o, ?r)` is true if an object `?o` is at pose `?p` and supported on `?r`.  I have to move each of these objects from being `on(..., v11)` to `on(..., v18)`. Since all objects are currently on `v11`, my plan revolves around picking each object from `v11` and placing it on `v18`.
           
           The actions available are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Cleaning and cooking are irrelevant. The only move_base action sets a property `canmove` to false, then back to true. My robot's initial configuration is `v3`.
           
           I will be using arm `v4` because it's handempty. I'll pick an object from `v11`, and then place it on `v18`. Since the base configuration is stable at `v3` and the robot base doesn't need to move between picks and places, I have to pick-place-pick-place for each object, and the move-base action isn't needed.
           
           My strategy involves picking each object and placing it, one at a time. The problem specifies specific facts about *supported* and *atpose*.
           
           The plan is:
           
           1.  **For `v8`**:
               *   `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Pick `v8` from pose `v9`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
               *   `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Place `v8` at pose `#o2`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           2.  **For `v12`**:
               *   `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Pick `v12` from pose `v13`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
               *   `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Place `v12` at pose `#o2`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           3.  **For `v14`**:
               *   `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Pick `v14` from pose `v15`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
               *   `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Place `v14` at pose `#o2`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           4.  **For `v16`**:
               *   `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Pick `v16` from pose `v17`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
               *   `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Place `v16` at pose `#o2`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           The assumption is that the preconditions for each action will be met based on the given facts. The provided information strongly supports this reasoning, and it's essential for picking and placing

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a tough constraint. The user rightly pointed out that my previous plan was flawed because it relied on `pick` and `place` actions, which aren't in the list of valid actions.  My thinking here is that this is a critical problem, a showstopper.
           
           Let's break down the situation. The core goal is to have several objects, specifically those currently on `v11`, placed onto `v18`.  These objects' state in relation to their location is tracked with the predicates `atpose` and `supported`, and ultimately, `on`.  They are initially `on` `v11`.
           
           But here's the rub: the *only* allowed action is `move_base`. This action does precisely what the name suggests, it simply *moves* the base. It doesn't modify the `atpose` of objects, nor the `supported` relationship between objects and surfaces. It doesn't change what is `on` what.
           
           Given the initial state and the limited action space, and with the assumption that `move_base` doesn't alter the `on` relationship, it's immediately obvious. Without the ability to manipulate objects (pick them up and place them down), there's no way to change their position, specifically their `on` predicate. My original goal is just plain impossible. The objects will remain locked `on` `v11`. It’s a dead end.
