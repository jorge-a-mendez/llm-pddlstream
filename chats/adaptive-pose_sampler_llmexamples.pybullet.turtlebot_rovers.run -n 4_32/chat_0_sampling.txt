User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical obstacle along the y-axis at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around, especially in the upper quadrants.
           
           I will try to place the robot in a circle of radius 2 around the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not too close to the obstacles, especially the x=0 wall. I will also try to vary the angle around the target to ensure diversity.

Model:     The previous attempts failed due to the x=0 obstacle and line-of-sight issues, likely caused by being on the wrong side of the x=0 wall for the target. The target is in the upper-left quadrant. Therefore, I will focus on positions in the upper-left quadrant, avoiding the x=0 wall and other obstacles in that region. I will prioritize positions that are closer to the target point.

Model:     The previous request's target point was (-2.206, 1.968). My last set of proposed points were valid, indicating they were collision-free and had line-of-sight. This new request is for the *same* target point. This means that my previous valid positions likely now collide with *non-fixed* obstacles or are occluded. I will try to find a new set of diverse positions around the target point, still staying in the upper-left quadrant and avoiding the fixed obstacles. I will try slightly different angles and distances from the target.

Model:     The target point is now (0.649, 2.146), which is in the upper-right quadrant, near the x=0 wall. My previous attempts were based on the old target point and thus failed due to collisions with walls and obstacles not relevant to the new target.
           For this target point, I need to stay to the right of the x=0 wall. There are several small obstacles in this region (7, 9, 21). I will try to place the robot relatively close to the target, avoiding the walls and known obstacles.
