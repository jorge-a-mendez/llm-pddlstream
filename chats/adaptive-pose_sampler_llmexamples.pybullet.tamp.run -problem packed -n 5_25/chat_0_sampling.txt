           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.09266578653343757, 0.0926657865334376)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0927 x 0.0927. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there are many possible stable placements. I will generate a diverse set of placements, varying both position and orientation. I will primarily place the object in the center of the surface, but also explore positions near the edges. Since the object is square, rotating it by multiples of pi/2 will result in the same bounding box, but I will include a variety of rotations for diversity, including some non-cardinal angles. The object must be fully contained within the surface, so I will ensure that the object's extents, when rotated, do not exceed the surface's boundaries.
           
           The half-extents of the surface are 0.135 along both x and y.
           The half-extents of the object are approximately 0.04633 along both x and y.
           
           For an unrotated square object, the valid range for its center (x, y) on the surface is:
           x: [-0.135 + 0.04633, 0.135 - 0.04633] = [-0.08867, 0.08867]
           y: [-0.135 + 0.04633, 0.135 - 0.04633] = [-0.08867, 0.08867]
           
           When rotated, the effective size of the bounding box of a square object of side 's' rotated by an angle 'theta' is given by:
           effective_size_x = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / sqrt(2)
           effective_size_y = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / sqrt(2)
           For a square object, this simplifies. The maximum dimension of the rotated bounding box occurs at pi/4 (45 degrees), where the diagonal becomes the effective side.
           The diagonal of the object is sqrt(2) * 0.09266578653343757 = 0.13105.
           The maximum half-extent for the rotated square is 0.13105 / 2 = 0.065525.
           The valid range for the center of a maximally rotated object (e.g., theta = pi/4) on the surface is:
           x: [-0.135 + 0.065525, 0.135 - 0.065525] = [-0.069475, 0.069475]
           y: [-0.135 + 0.065525, 0.135 - 0.065525] = [-0.069475, 0.069475]
           All these ranges are well within the surface boundaries.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0935 x 0.0935, which is very similar in size to the previous object (ID: 4). The previous successful placement for object 4 was at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 is now at the center of the surface.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 7 on surface 0, ensuring that object 7 does not collide with the already placed object 4.
           Object 4 has half-extents of approximately 0.09266578653343757 / 2 = 0.04633. Its AABB on the surface is approximately x: [-0.04633, 0.04633], y: [-0.04633, 0.04633], centered at (0,0).
           
           Object 7 has half-extents of approximately 0.09353623240310144 / 2 = 0.04677.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 7 must be at least 0.04633 + 0.04677 = 0.0931 units away from the center of object 4 (0,0) in either the x or y direction, when both are unrotated.
           If object 7 is rotated by theta, its effective half-extents will change. The maximum effective half-extent for object 7 (when rotated by 45 degrees) is sqrt(2) * 0.093536 / 2 = 0.06613.
           The maximum effective half-extent for object 4 (when rotated by 45 degrees) is sqrt(2) * 0.092665 / 2 = 0.06552.
           So, the minimum distance between centers in the worst-case rotated scenario (both rotated 45 degrees) would be 0.06613 + 0.06552 = 0.13165.
           
           The surface half-extents are 0.135.
           The maximum half-extent of object 7 is 0.06613.
           So the maximum allowed center position for object 7 is 0.135 - 0.06613 = 0.06887.
           The minimum distance from object 4 in the worst case (diagonal) is 0.13165. Since the max allowed center position is 0.06887, it means there are no positions for object 7 that avoid object 4 if both are rotated to their maximum effective size and object 4 is at the center.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The previous placement (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) means object 4 is not rotated, so its AABB is fixed at its extents.
           Object 4's AABB: x in [-0.04633, 0.04633], y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           
           For object 7 to avoid collision with object 4, its AABB (which depends on its rotation) must not overlap with object 4's AABB.
           Let object 7's half-extents be h7x, h7y (depending on rotation).
           Let object 4's half-extents be h4x, h4y (fixed at 0.04633).
           
           Collision occurs if:
           abs(center7_x - center4_x) < (h7x + h4x) AND abs(center7_y - center4_y) < (h7y + h4y)
           
           Since center4_x = 0 and center4_y = 0:
           Collision occurs if:
           abs(center7_x) < (h7x + h4x) AND abs(center7_y) < (h7y + h4y)
           
           We need to ensure that the center of object 7 is outside this region.
           The surface boundaries are [-0.135, 0.135] in x and y.
           The valid placement range for object 7's center (cx, cy) on the surface, considering its half-extents h7x, h7y:
           cx in [-0.135 + h7x, 0.135 - h7x]
           cy in [-0.135 + h7y, 0.135 - h7y]
           
           When object 7 is unrotated, h7x = h7y = 0.04677.
           The valid placement range for unrotated object 7 is:
           cx in [-0.135 + 0.04677, 0.135 - 0.04677] = [-0.08823, 0.08823]
           cy in [-0.135 + 0.04677, 0.135 - 0.04677] = [-0.08823, 0.08823]
           
           To avoid collision with unrotated object 4 (h4x=h4y=0.04633):
           abs(center7_x) must be >= (0.04677 + 0.04633) = 0.0931
           abs(center7_y) must be >= (0.04677 + 0.04633) = 0.0931
           
           Combining these, we need center7_x or center7_y to be outside the range [-0.0931, 0.0931].
           However, the maximum allowed center position is 0.08823.
           This means for unrotated object 7, there are NO stable placements that avoid collision with unrotated object 4 if object 4 is at the origin and both are placed unrotated.
           This suggests I need to rethink the collision avoidance. The collision detection function typically checks if the bounding boxes overlap.
           
           Let's re-examine the collision logic when objects are not axis-aligned. The problem statement implies I only know the AABB extents of the object and the surface. The feedback will tell me if there's a collision. I will assume that the 'size_x' and 'size_y' provided for the object refer to the dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box when it is unrotated (theta = 0). When rotated, its effective AABB can grow.
           
           The previous success (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for object 4 means its AABB is x in [-0.04633, 0.04633] and y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           
           For object 7, with size_x = size_y = 0.093536:
           Its half-extents, when unrotated, are 0.046768.
           The maximum half-extent when rotated (at 45 degrees) is 0.093536 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06613.
           
           The surface half-extent is 0.135.
           Maximum valid center position for object 7 (considering rotation) = 0.135 - 0.06613 = 0.06887.
           
           If object 4 is at (0,0) and unrotated, its AABB is fixed.
           If object 7 is placed with its center at (cx, cy) and rotated by theta, its AABB extents (h7_x_rot, h7_y_rot) will be:
           h7_x_rot = 0.5 * (0.093536 * abs(cos(theta)) + 0.093536 * abs(sin(theta)))
           h7_y_rot = 0.5 * (0.093536 * abs(cos(theta)) + 0.093536 * abs(sin(theta)))
           
           So, h7_x_rot = h7_y_rot = 0.046768 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))).
           The smallest this value can be is 0.046768 (at 0 or pi/2). The largest is 0.046768 * sqrt(2) = 0.06613 (at pi/4).
           
           Let's consider placement of object 7 at the edge of surface 0.
           If object 7 is unrotated, its half-extents are 0.046768.
           Its center can be at (0.08823, 0.0) or (0.0, 0.08823) or other corners.
           Let's try (0.08823, 0.0). Object 7's AABB would be x in [0.08823 - 0.046768, 0.08823 + 0.046768] = [0.041462, 0.135] and y in [-0.046768, 0.046768].
           Object 4's AABB is x in [-0.04633, 0.04633], y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           There is no overlap in x-axis ranges (0.041462 > 0.04633 is false, but 0.041462 is greater than the upper x-bound of object 4 by definition - which is not true, 0.041462 is less than 0.04633 so they still overlap)
           Okay, let's properly check AABB overlap for unrotated objects:
           Object 4 center (0,0), half-extents (h4, h4) = (0.04633, 0.04633)
           Object 7 center (cx, cy), half-extents (h7, h7) = (0.04677, 0.04677)
           
           No collision if:
           abs(cx - 0) >= (h4 + h7) OR abs(cy - 0) >= (h4 + h7)
           abs(cx) >= 0.04633 + 0.04677 = 0.0931 OR abs(cy) >= 0.0931
           
           The valid range for cx and cy for object 7 is [-0.08823, 0.08823].
           This means no unrotated placement for object 7 is possible if collision is checked via AABB overlap with object 4 (unrotated at origin). This is an important insight.
           
           This indicates that either:
           1. My understanding of AABB collision for multiple objects is flawed for this problem context.
           2. The problem assumes that the object's specific geometry (e.g., a square) is used for collision, not just its AABB, especially when one is rotated.
           3. The "stable placement" means only collision with *fixed* obstacles (surfaces), not necessarily other placed objects in the *first* attempt. Subsequent requests for the *same* object type will give me feedback about collisions. The prompt says "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This implies I need to avoid it.
           
           If I can't place unrotated object 7 without collision, I should try rotated object 7.
           If object 7 is rotated by pi/4, its effective half-extents are 0.06613.
           Valid range for center (cx, cy) is [-0.135 + 0.06613, 0.135 - 0.06613] = [-0.06887, 0.06887].
           Object 4 is unrotated, half-extents 0.04633.
           Collision if:
           abs(cx) < (0.06613 + 0.04633) = 0.11246 AND abs(cy) < (0.06613 + 0.04633) = 0.11246.
           Again, the valid range for cx is [-0.06887, 0.06887], which is entirely contained within [-0.11246, 0.11246].
           This means that an AABB collision will occur regardless of placement, if object 4 is at (0,0) and object 7 is on the same surface.
           
           This is a critical point. If AABB collision is indeed the criterion, no placement is possible for object 7 if object 4 is at the center of the surface.
           However, the problem statement: "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement."
           This implies that there *must* be placements.
           
           This means my assumption about AABB collision for *objects* is likely too conservative, or I should prioritize object-surface containment first.
           "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface"
           "avoid collision between objects i and j"
           
           The only way this is possible is if the specific geometry (square) and actual overlap is considered, not just the AABBs.
           If actual square geometry is used for collision, then placing object 7 such that it barely touches the edge of object 4 would work.
           Let's reconsider the stable placement of object 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 is a square of side 0.09266 centered at (0,0).
           Object 7 is a square of side 0.093536.
           For square-on-square collision, if they are both axis-aligned, they would collide if the distance between their centers is less than (side1+side2)/2 in both x and y. Here, (0.09266+0.093536)/2 = 0.0931.
           Since the maximum center position for object 7 is 0.08823, no placement exists if both are axis-aligned.
           
           What if object 7 is rotated by 45 degrees? Its corners are aligned with the axes.
           Distance from center to corner = 0.093536 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06613.
           Object 4 (unrotated) has corners at (+/-0.04633, +/-0.04633).
           The closest object 7 can get without geometric collision (not AABB) when rotated by pi/4 and centered at (0.06, 0.06) for example.
           Its corners would be (0.06 +/- 0.06613, 0.06 +/- 0.06613) relative to its center. No, its corners would be (0.06, 0.06 + 0.06613), (0.06, 0.06 - 0.06613), etc. after translation.
           The shape is important.
           
           I will assume that the internal geometry of the squares is what matters for object-object collision.
           Object 4: A square from [-0.04633, 0.04633] in x and y.
           Object 7: A square of side 0.093536.
           
           Let's try placing object 7 near the surface boundary, avoiding the central region occupied by object 4.
           For example, center object 7 at (x, y) = (0.08, 0.0).
           If object 7 is unrotated, its x range is [0.08 - 0.04677, 0.08 + 0.04677] = [0.03323, 0.12677].
           Its y range is [-0.04677, 0.04677].
           Object 4's x range is [-0.04633, 0.04633]. Object 4's y range is [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           For X, [0.03323, 0.12677] and [-0.04633, 0.04633]. These *do* overlap since 0.03323 < 0.04633.
           For Y, [-0.04677, 0.04677] and [-0.04633, 0.04633]. These *do* overlap.
           So if "avoid collision" means AABB collision, then no unrotated object 7 can be placed.
           
           This is highly problematic. I will assume "avoid collision between objects i and j" implies geometric collision between the actual square shapes, NOT their AABBs, since AABBs are too large to allow placement. The surface containment, however, will still use AABBs.
           
           If I place object 7 such that its left edge is at the right edge of object 4, the center of object 7 would be:
           0.04633 (half-side of obj 4) + 0.04677 (half-side of obj 7) = 0.0931.
           So, if I place object 7 at (0.0931, 0.0) with theta=0.
           Its x-range would be [0.0931 - 0.04677, 0.0931 + 0.04677] = [0.04633, 0.13987].
           This placement would be out of bounds of the surface, since 0.13987 > 0.135.
           
           This is a very difficult constraint.
           Let's try to place object 7 such that it barely fits along one of the sides.
           For unrotated object 7, the maximum valid center is 0.08823.
           This means its rightmost edge is at 0.08823 + 0.04677 = 0.135 (exactly at boundary).
           Its leftmost edge is at 0.08823 - 0.04677 = 0.04146.
           This placement (0.08823, 0.0) with theta=0, results in an AABB of [0.04146, 0.135] x [-0.04677, 0.04677].
           This AABB still overlaps with object 4's AABB: [-0.04633, 0.04633] x [-0.04633, 0.04633] since 0.04146 < 0.04633.
           
           The only way I can generate placements is if the problem is not using AABB for object-object collision, or if my interpretation of "avoid collision" for objects is wrong.
           I will generate placements that are as far as possible from the center, hoping that the exact geometry collision logic of the simulator will allow them. These will effectively be "edge" placements for object 7. I'll pick centers as close to the surface boundary as possible without violating surface containment.
           
           Let's assume the collision detection is based on the actual square geometries.
           Object 4: square centered at (0,0), half-side 0.04633.
           Object 7: square of half-side 'h7'. When rotated by 'theta', its bounding box half-extents are (h7_x_rot, h7_y_rot).
           Surface half-extent is 0.135.
           Valid center for object 7: cx in [-0.135 + h7_x_rot, 0.135 - h7_x_rot], cy in [-0.135 + h7_y_rot, 0.135 - h7_y_rot].
           
           I'll use centers that are at the maximum allowed distance from the origin given the surface boundaries.
           For theta=0: h7_x_rot = h7_y_rot = 0.04677. Max center = 0.135 - 0.04677 = 0.08823.
           So, try (0.08823, 0.0), (-0.08823, 0.0), (0.0, 0.08823), (0.0, -0.08823). And diagonals like (0.08823*0.707, 0.08823*0.707).
           
           For theta=pi/4: h7_x_rot = h7_y_rot = 0.06613. Max center = 0.135 - 0.06613 = 0.06887.
           So, try (0.06887, 0.0), (-0.06887, 0.0), etc.
           
           This approach will push object 7 as far as possible from object 4, which is at the origin. If even these fail, then it is truly impossible with the current state.
           I will generate placements using these edge values and a variety of rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has one surface at ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           We now have two objects already placed:
           1. Object 4 (square, side 0.09266): (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its AABB is approximately x in [-0.04633, 0.04633], y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           2. Object 7 (square, side 0.093536): (0, 0.0, 0.08823, 0.0). Its AABB (unrotated) is x in [0.08823 - 0.046768, 0.08823 + 0.046768] = [0.041462, 0.135] and y in [-0.046768, 0.046768].
           
           The new object, ID 5, is also a square with side 0.09313657. Its unrotated half-extents are approximately 0.046568.
           The maximum half-extent for object 5 when rotated (at 45 degrees) is 0.09313657 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06584.
           
           My previous reasoning regarding AABB collision between objects was too conservative. Since placements for object 7 were successful even when their AABBs overlapped based on my calculations, it implies that the simulator uses the actual geometry of the objects for collision detection (square vs square), not just their AABBs.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the free space.
           Object 4 occupies: x in [-0.04633, 0.04633], y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           Object 7 occupies: x in [0.041462, 0.135], y in [-0.046768, 0.046768].
           
           These two objects are distinct. Object 4 is centered, and Object 7 is to its right, almost touching the right edge of the surface.
           The combined occupied region along the x-axis, considering geometric collision for unrotated squares:
           Object 4: [-0.04633, 0.04633]
           Object 7: [0.041462, 0.135]
           Notice that 0.041462 is less than 0.04633, meaning they are slightly overlapping along the x-axis. This confirms my previous AABB overlap calculation was correct, but that the simulator allows for this geometric overlap (which means their actual square bodies might not be overlapping, or the overlap is minimal and allowed). This is crucial.
           
           Given the success of (0, 0.0, 0.08823, 0.0) for object 7, it means that (x = 0.08823) is a valid center for an unrotated object.
           The unrotated object 5 has half-extents of 0.046568.
           The surface range for its center is x in [-0.135 + 0.046568, 0.135 - 0.046568] = [-0.088432, 0.088432].
           Similarly for y.
           
           Now I need to place object 5 to avoid collision with both object 4 and object 7.
           Object 4 is centered. Object 7 is mostly to the right of object 4.
           The area to the left of object 4, or above/below both objects, might be free.
           
           Let's try placing object 5 to the left of object 4.
           If object 5 is unrotated (half-extents 0.046568), its center 'cx' must be such that its right edge (cx + 0.046568) is less than or equal to the left edge of object 4 (-0.04633).
           So, cx + 0.046568 <= -0.04633
           cx <= -0.04633 - 0.046568 = -0.092898.
           This is within the valid center range [-0.088432, 0.088432] if -0.092898 is within it, which is not. My check should be `abs(cx) + h5 <= abs(-0.04633)`. No, it is `cx + h5 <= -h4` or `cx - h5 >= h4`.
           Let h4 = 0.04633, h7 = 0.046768, h5 = 0.046568.
           Object 4: [-h4, h4] x [-h4, h4]
           Object 7: [0.08823 - h7, 0.08823 + h7] x [-h7, h7] = [0.041462, 0.135] x [-h7, h7]
           
           To place object 5 to the left of object 4 without overlap (assuming actual square geometry):
           Center of obj 5 (cx5, cy5).
           Its right edge (cx5 + h5) must be <= -h4. So cx5 <= -h4 - h5 = -0.04633 - 0.046568 = -0.092898.
           The surface boundary constraint for cx5 is [-0.088432, 0.088432].
           Since -0.092898 < -0.088432, there is no place to the immediate left of object 4 without overlap, if the condition is strict non-overlap.
           
           However, the placement for object 7 had its left edge at 0.041462, which is less than 0.04633 (right edge of object 4). This means there is some tolerance for overlap, or the internal logic is more complex than simple AABB or strict square non-overlap. I will generate placements that are at the edges of the surface, similar to object 7's successful placement, but in other directions.
           This means I should aim for 'cx' values around 0.088432 or -0.088432, and 'cy' values around 0.088432 or -0.088432.
           
           Let's place object 5 at (-0.088432, 0.0) with theta=0.
           Its AABB: x in [-0.088432 - 0.046568, -0.088432 + 0.046568] = [-0.135, -0.041864].
           y in [-0.046568, 0.046568].
           Does this collide with object 4?
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.04633, 0.04633] x [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           Object 5 AABB: [-0.135, -0.041864] x [-0.046568, 0.046568].
           X-overlap: Yes, since -0.041864 > -0.04633.
           Y-overlap: Yes, since -0.046568 < -0.04633 and 0.046568 > 0.04633.
           So, AABB's overlap. But this is exactly what happened with object 7 and object 4, and it was a success. So I will proceed with this strategy.
           
           I'll place object 5 to the left, top, bottom, and corners of object 4, using the maximum allowed displacement from the center of the surface, and various rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           We now have three objects already placed:
           1. Object 4 (square, side 0.09266): (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its AABB is approximately x in [-0.04633, 0.04633], y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           2. Object 7 (square, side 0.093536): (0, 0.0, 0.08823, 0.0). Its AABB is approximately x in [0.041462, 0.135], y in [-0.046768, 0.046768].
           3. Object 5 (square, side 0.09313657): (0, 0.0, -0.088432, 0.0). Its AABB is approximately x in [-0.135, -0.041864], y in [-0.046568, 0.046568].
           
           The new object, ID 8, is also a square with side 0.09089635. Its unrotated half-extents are approximately 0.045448.
           The maximum half-extent for object 8 when rotated (at 45 degrees) is 0.09089635 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06427.
           
           The successes from previous requests confirm that geometric overlap between square objects is allowed up to a certain point, or that the collision detection for objects uses a more sophisticated approach than simple AABB overlap.
           Specifically, object 4 and object 7 are overlapping on the x-axis (0.04633 (R_4) > 0.041462 (L_7)).
           And object 4 and object 5 are overlapping on the x-axis (-0.04633 (L_4) < -0.041864 (R_5)).
           
           This means there's a "strip" occupied by objects 4, 7, and 5 along the x-axis, centered around y=0.
           The effective occupied x-range is approximately [-0.135, 0.135].
           The effective occupied y-range (considering the y-extents of all three objects when unrotated, roughly max(-0.04633, -0.046768, -0.046568) to max(0.04633, 0.046768, 0.046568)) is approximately [-0.046768, 0.046768].
           
           So, the region x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.046768, 0.046768] is likely to cause a collision.
           The unoccupied regions are predominantly above and below this strip.
           
           Let's try to place object 8 in the upper or lower part of the surface.
           Unrotated object 8 half-extents: 0.045448.
           Max center position for unrotated object 8: 0.135 - 0.045448 = 0.089552.
           So for placing in the upper region, try center (0.0, 0.089552).
           Object 8's AABB would be x in [-0.045448, 0.045448], y in [0.089552 - 0.045448, 0.089552 + 0.045448] = [0.044104, 0.135].
           This AABB does not overlap on the y-axis with any of the placed objects' AABBs (all are roughly centered around y=0). This should be a safe placement.
           
           I will generate placements in the upper and lower regions, with various rotations, at the maximum possible distance from the central strip.
           
           Max center position for rotated object 8 (theta=pi/4, half-extents 0.06427): 0.135 - 0.06427 = 0.07073.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           We now have four objects already placed:
           1. Object 4 (square, side 0.09266): (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). AABB: x in [-0.04633, 0.04633], y in [-0.04633, 0.04633].
           2. Object 7 (square, side 0.093536): (0, 0.0, 0.08823, 0.0). AABB: x in [0.041462, 0.135], y in [-0.046768, 0.046768].
           3. Object 5 (square, side 0.09313657): (0, 0.0, -0.088432, 0.0). AABB: x in [-0.135, -0.041864], y in [-0.046568, 0.046568].
           4. Object 8 (square, side 0.09089635): (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.089552). AABB: x in [-0.045448, 0.045448], y in [0.044104, 0.135].
           
           The new object, ID 6, is also a square with side 0.093696526. Its unrotated half-extents are approximately 0.046848.
           The maximum half-extent for object 6 when rotated (at 45 degrees) is 0.093696526 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06624.
           
           Current occupied space summary (based on unrotated AABBs for simplicity, given the observed allowance for minor overlaps):
           - Object 4: center (0,0), x-range [-0.04633, 0.04633], y-range [-0.04633, 0.04633]
           - Object 7: center (0.08823, 0), x-range [0.041462, 0.135], y-range [-0.046768, 0.046768]
           - Object 5: center (-0.088432, 0), x-range [-0.135, -0.041864], y-range [-0.046568, 0.046568]
           - Object 8: center (0, 0.089552), x-range [-0.045448, 0.045448], y-range [0.044104, 0.135]
           
           The combined occupied regions:
           Along x-axis, the region from approximately -0.135 to 0.135 seems to have objects (Object 5 on left, Object 4 in center, Object 7 on right).
           Along y-axis, the region from approximately -0.046768 to 0.046768 seems occupied by objects 4, 5, 7.
           Object 8 occupies the upper part of the surface, overlapping with the x-range of object 4.
           
           The remaining unoccupied space is mostly the bottom part of the surface, i.e., negative y-values below the first three objects and to the right/left of the x-range of object 8.
           More precisely, a region like x in [-0.135, 0.135] and y in [-0.135, -0.046768) is mostly free.
           
           Let's place object 6 in the lower part of the surface.
           Unrotated object 6 half-extents: 0.046848.
           Max center position for unrotated object 6: 0.135 - 0.046848 = 0.088152.
           So for placing in the lower region, try center (0.0, -0.088152).
           Object 6's AABB would be x in [-0.046848, 0.046848], y in [-0.088152 - 0.046848, -0.088152 + 0.046848] = [-0.135, -0.041304].
           This placement's AABB does not overlap significantly on the y-axis with any of the placed objects. This should be a safe placement.
           
           Max center position for rotated object 6 (theta=pi/4, half-extents 0.06624): 0.135 - 0.06624 = 0.06876.
