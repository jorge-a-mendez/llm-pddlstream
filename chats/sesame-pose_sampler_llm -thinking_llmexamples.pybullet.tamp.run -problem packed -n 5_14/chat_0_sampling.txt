(Thoughts: **The Approach to Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object on a surface.  The key to stability here is ensuring the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface's boundaries.  Given the object's nearly square shape and the surface's shape, I'm focusing on a strategic approach for maximum coverage.
           
           Since the surface is a simple AABB, and the object's dimensions are known, the math is straightforward. The challenge lies in efficiently generating a diverse set of valid configurations within the constraints.  The surface's dimensions give the maximum possible placement area. The goal is to maximize the area and ensure the placements cover it as much as possible, for which varying theta is essential.
           
           I'll start by generating a grid-like pattern for the x and y coordinates by setting the value of theta to 0. Since the object is nearly square, this is very important. I will then ensure the placement is stable by picking a single different theta placement.
           
           First, I calculate the allowable x and y ranges for the object's center based on the object's size. By placing objects in a grid structure, the stability criteria is met and I generate most of the diverse placements. With this, I will add an extra point with a different theta value. I will consider the range of `[-0.096, 0.096]` to generate 49 stable placements with theta 0. Then, I pick a theta of pi/2 and the placement to `(0, 0)` is stable and diverse.  This ensures the stability of all placements.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 8**
           
           Okay, so I've got to place Object 8 now, and the tricky part is avoiding a collision with the previously placed Object 5.  Object 5 is sitting at (0, 0.0, -0.096, -0.096).  I've already calculated the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for Object 5 based on its dimensions (approximately 0.0775 x 0.0775) and placement.  This AABB tells me the area Object 5 is occupying, and I *must* avoid overlapping that.
           
           Object 8 is a nearly square object too (0.0968 x 0.0968). I need to determine the valid placement region for Object 8 on the surface, which is a square: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). To start, I'll calculate the valid area for Object 8 *without* considering Object 5. Basically, the center of Object 8 has to be inside the surface bounds, taking into account half of its dimensions.
           
           I've determined a grid of potential center points for Object 8. Since object 8 is almost square and I am given dimensions for AABB, I'll stick with placing it with `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`.  My main goal is not to "give up" and to provide diversity in positions, but also to minimize computational effort: if `theta=0` provides solutions, then I don't need `theta != 0` until I really need it.
           
           Now, the collision check.  I've set up my collision detection. I will ensure that the bounding boxes do not overlap: `(x_8 - half_x_8 < obj5_max_x)` AND `(x_8 + half_x_8 > obj5_min_x)` AND `(y_8 - half_y_8 < obj5_max_y)` AND `(y_8 + half_y_8 > obj5_min_y)`.
           If any point satisfies the following condition:
           `(x_8 + half_x_8 > x5_min) and (x_8 - half_x_8 < x5_max) and (y_8 + half_y_8 > y5_min) and (y_8 - half_y_8 < y5_max)`, then a collision will occur.
           Since object 5 is near the bottom-left corner, I'll avoid this collision by calculating an area within which to place object 8. This is implemented in the grid, where object 8 can't have its center at a `x` and `y` where collision occurs.
           The forbidden collision region for object 8 is `x < -0.00885` and `y < -0.00885`.
           
           Finally, to fulfill the request for 50 placements, I'll create a 10x10 grid of points for the center of object 8 and then filter the grid. This gives me a set of placements. I'll filter out the colliding grid points and then add some with `theta = pi/2` for diversity.
           
           I will iterate and try new points until I find 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 4) on `surface 0`. I have to be careful here because I need to avoid collisions with the objects already on the surface: Object 5 and Object 8.
           
           First, I define the space I'm working with: `surface 0` which is a rectangle from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The new object (ID 4) is basically square.
           
           To check for collisions, I need to know the bounding box of each object. For ID 4, I calculate the half-dimensions, so I can figure out the range of positions for the center point while making sure it stays inside the surface.
           
           To check for collisions, I created a collision check function to check overlapping x and y coordinates.
           
           Next, I'm setting up a grid of potential locations using the available surface area. I'm going to iterate through the points on this grid, and I will check for collisions with Objects 5 and 8.
           
           I will start using `theta = 0` and every 5th placement I will alternate with `theta = pi/2` to add some diversity in the results. I am going to return the first 50 possible locations that do not collide with any other object on the surface.
           
           After generating, I get `75` valid positions for ID 4 on surface 0 without overlap. I then take the first 50 positions to return the results.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0 (ID 7)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 7) on surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with the existing objects (ID 5, ID 8, and ID 4). The surface is defined as a 0.27-meter square centered at the origin, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 meters in both x and y dimensions.
           
           Object 7 is nearly square, measuring approximately 0.076 meters on each side.  This simplifies the collision detection, because the rotation of object 7, 0 or 90 degrees, has little impact on the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB).
           
           I'll start by determining the allowable area for the center of object 7. Due to its size and the surface boundaries, the object's center must lie within the range of -0.09687798987990908 to 0.09687798987990908 meters in both x and y.
           
           To find the placements, I'll create a 10x10 grid of potential center points within the valid region. For each grid point, I'll calculate the AABB of object 7 and check for collisions against the AABBs of the existing objects.
           
           To create diversity, I'll alternate the rotation between 0 and π/2 radians (90 degrees).
           
           Once I find 50 placements that don't collide, I'll output them. I'll prioritize filling from the bottom left to top right.
           
           The available space, given the other objects, seems restricted to the positive x and y quadrants.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object 6 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing objects 5, 8, 4, and 7.  First, I need to know the bounds of Surface 0, which is a square.  Then, I'll calculate the allowed region where I can place Object 6, taking into account its dimensions and those of the existing objects.
           
           Since Object 6 is a square, its orientation doesn't change its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) size, which simplifies things.  I'll start with a 10x10 grid of potential center points for Object 6 within the surface's boundaries. I'll need to check for collisions at each grid point, alternating the rotation between 0 and 90 degrees. This creates 100 center points.
           
           To check for collisions, I'll calculate the AABB for Object 6 at each potential center point and compare it to the AABBs of the other objects. The AABB of Object 6 is simply the center point plus or minus half its dimensions in each axis.  I will then iterate through the potential centers and determine if they collide with any other placed objects.  The collision check will be: Does the AABB for object 6's X and Y ranges intersect with the x and y ranges of another object's AABB? If they do, then it's a collision.
           
           Since I need to place 50 objects and there are only 100 possible center points in the grid, I'll need to make sure I get a variety of orientations (0 and pi/2 radians).  If the first pass doesn't yield enough non-colliding placements, I may need to be more strategic and use the free space in the corners, top-right, and so on. Also, the bottom-left is definitely out due to collisions with Object 5 and Object 7, so let's try the top and bottom.
