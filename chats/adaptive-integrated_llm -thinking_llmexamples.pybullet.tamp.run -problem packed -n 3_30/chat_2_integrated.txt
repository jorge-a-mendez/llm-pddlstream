User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.11, -0.385), (0.207, -0.288)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.061, -0.385), (0.037, -0.286)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.296, 0.493), (-0.197, 0.591)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.158, -0.337, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.469, 0.883).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.012, -0.336, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.426, 0.905).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.246, 0.542, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.938, 0.347).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           I've been tasked with devising a plan to arrange three objects, namely v8, v12, and v14, onto a surface, v16, ensuring that each object rests on v16. My initial assessment reveals that all three objects are presently situated on surface v11. The robot at my disposal possesses two arms, with v4 being the designated arm for this operation, and both arms are currently unoccupied (handempty). The robot's base configuration is currently set at v3.
           
           To achieve the desired configuration, the robot needs to move each object from their initial poses on surface v11 to the target surface, v16. Three poses are pre-defined for these objects on surface v16: v8, v12, and v14 on #o2.
           
           The key to this plan lies in using the provided actions: `pick` and `place`. The core strategy will involve these steps:
           
           1.  Relocate the robot's base configuration from its present state, v3, to a suitable configuration represented as #o3.
           2.  Select and grasp the first object, v8, from its initial pose on v11 using arm v4.
           3.  Place the object, v8, onto the target surface, v16, and into its pre-defined pose #o2, using arm v4.
           4.  Repeat the two prior steps for the remaining objects: v14 and v12.
           
           The `kin` predicates for each action instance is given for the arm v4, grasp #o1, base configuration #o3, and trajectory #o4. Therefore, the order is crucial. The initial step for any plan instance needs to be the robot's base moving from v3 to the base configuration #o3. The `basemotion` action will be the first action in the plan. Then, for each object, `pick` followed by `place` actions will be used.
           
           For the object placement, the poses are:
           
           *   v8 at #o2: (0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v14 at #o2: (0.0, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v12 at #o2: (0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these steps and the pre-defined target poses, the plan is expected to be successful.
