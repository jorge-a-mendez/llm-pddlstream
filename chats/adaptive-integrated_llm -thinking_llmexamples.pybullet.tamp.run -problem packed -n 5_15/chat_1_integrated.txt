           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Arrange Objects on a Surface**
           
           My objective is to create a plan that places objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto the surface `v20`. The initial state describes the current positions of these objects, all resting on surface `v11`, and the configuration of the robot, which includes its base at `v3` and two arms `v4` and `v6` (both initially empty-handed). It is noted that the only surface the goal refers to is surface `v20`. The `on(?o, ?r)` goal conditions require that the robot places each object `?o` (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) on surface `?r` (`v20`). This task is accomplished using two available actions: `pick` and `place`. `pick` action must be performed at pose `p_current` of a stackable object, in its current state, from its current support `v11`. Then, `place` action takes these stackable objects, places them at new pose `#o2`, and stacks it on the goal support surface `v20`. The initial state gives the relations `kin`, `atpose`, `supported` and the negative conditions like `~unsafeapproach`, `~unsafepose`, `~unsafeatraj`. All conditions must be true, or negative preconditions must be negated, as a necessary pre-requisite for either of these actions.
           
           The strategy involves picking each object from its current location on `v11` and placing it on `v20`. To ensure collision-free movement, I must determine appropriate placement locations on `v20` using the available surface coordinates. Since the goal requires distinct poses, I will generate distinct coordinates within the bounds of `v20` to place each object. These are defined by the object-specific continuous parameter `#o2`.
           
           The initial plan is to use arm `v4`, which is currently hand empty and therefore suitable. The base does not need to move; thus, the robot's base configuration remains `v3`. The general plan structure is:
           1.  **Pick object**: pick a graspable object from its current pose, supported on v11, by a corresponding `kin` fact, using arm `v4`.
           2.  **Place object**: place the grasped object at a new, collision-free pose on `v20`. The poses are set at z = 0.781. The continuous parameter that defines placement is denoted by `#o2`.
           
           For this plan to work, all negative conditions about safe trajectories, approaches, or poses must be assumed to be true in the initial state. The plan generates these `p_on_v20` values and uses them to place the relevant object on surface `v20`. I need to ensure that the chosen new poses are collision-free. I will define a set of distinct, collision-free locations for each object on `v20`.
           
           The cost of this plan is equal to the number of pick and place actions, 10 in total. This represents the minimum cost given the available operations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 v20 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: A Constraint-Based Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user's critique is spot-on. I reviewed the plan, and it's fundamentally flawed. The only permissible action, as far as I can tell, is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's a bit of a head-scratcher. Essentially, it's a no-op, a move-the-robot-to-where-it-already-is action. Totally useless in this scenario.
           
           The objective, as I understand it, is to get those objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) all situated on surface v20. Looking at the initial state, they're currently supported on v11 at different poses.  That screams "pick and place" actions to me. Classic manipulation planning.
           
           Here's the problem: there's no way to perform a 'pick' or 'place' action in this plan. The valid action list is just that redundant `move_base` call.  Given the constraints, I can't construct a sequence of valid moves that achieves the goal of having the objects on v20. It's a dead end, a paradox. The goal is provably unachievable within the confines of the provided valid actions.  This needs a complete rethink.
