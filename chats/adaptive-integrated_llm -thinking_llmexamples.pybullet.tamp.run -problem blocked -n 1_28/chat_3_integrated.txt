           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning for Goal Achievement**
           
           My primary objective is to create a plan that successfully satisfies the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object, `?green`, onto a specified surface, `v18`. From the initial state and given information, I recognize that either `v8` or `v12` can fulfill the role of `?green`. The goal further refines to ensuring `?green` is both supported by and at a specific pose on `v18`.
           
           My initial analysis of the world state reveals that neither `v8` nor `v12` is initially positioned on `v18`. Given the available options, I will initially focus on manipulating `v8`. This decision stems from the presence of pose-related facts in the initial state. Specifically, the fact that there is `pose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. The pose `v9` supports a stable place to start moving the object.
           
           To achieve my goal, I need to pick up `v8` and subsequently place it onto `v18`. I formulate the initial actions:
           1.  **Move the robot to a base configuration to pick:** I need to prepare the robot by moving the base to a suitable location.
           2.  **Pick `v8` from its initial pose:** This action requires me to select the arm and arm configuration to pick `v8`.
           3.  **Move the robot to a base configuration to place:**  The robot needs to move the base configuration to reach the pose that will allow placing `v8` on `v18`.
           4.  **Place `v8` on `v18`:** This final step will involve placing the object into the correct pose on the target surface.
           
           **Action Decomposition and Precondition Validation**
           
           The first step requires a `move_base` action. The available base location is `v3` and the goal pose for the base is `#q0`. This action needs to meet the precondition `basemotion(v3, #o0, #q0)` and `atbconf(v3)`. I note that after movement, the robot is in `atbconf(#q0)`.
           
           For the picking action, `(pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0)`, I must verify if the preconditions: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, `!unsafeapproach`, and `!unsafeatraj` are met.  All conditions seem to hold true or are assumed, based on the initial state. An important observation is that after the `pick` action, the `canmove()` flag returns to `true`, implying the robot can move.
           
           I then evaluate the `move_base` action again, now to move from `#q0` to `#q1` for placing the object on the surface. Similarly to the first base move, this action needs to satisfy the appropriate preconditions such as `basemotion` and `atbconf`. After moving, the action will set the state to `atbconf(#q1)`.
           
           The final action, `(place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2)` requires similar preconditions. Of particular importance is `atgrasp` from the prior step, as well as `!unsafepose`, `!unsafeapproach`, `!unsafeatraj`, and  `kin(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t2)`.
           
           **Pose Determination and Safety Checks**
           
           I need to determine a suitable continuous value for `#p0` -- the final pose for `v8` on `v18`. To prevent collisions, I will use a central point on the surface `v18` and ensure the X, Y, and Z values are stable. The height will be taken from existing `z` poses of other objects like `v9` and `v16`, which appear to be set at `0.8`. The pose proposed is (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), which I verify to be within the bounds of `v18` and clear of any collisions with other objects like `v15` or `v12`.
           
           **Revised Plan with Continuous Values and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Based on the preceding analysis, the final sequence of actions, with the continuous pose for `#p0`, becomes:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #q0 #o0)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0)`
           3.  `(move_base #q0 #q1 #o0)`
           4.  `(place v4 v

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revising and Verifying the Plan**
           
           Okay, I've identified the error in my initial plan: the incorrect trajectory parameter in the `move_base` action.  I was using `#o0`, but the valid action list shows I should be using `#t1`. The corrected first step is now `(move_base v3 #q0 #t1)`.  Let's walk through the entire revised plan, step-by-step to be sure.
           
           1.  **Move to pick pose:**  The robot starts at `v3`. The objective is to pick object `v8` which is located at `v9`, requiring base configuration `#q0`.
               *   Previously invalid action: `(move_base v3 #q0 #o0)`.
               *   Corrected action (from the given valid action instances): `(move_base v3 #q0 #t1)`. The preconditions are `atbconf(v3)` (which is true), `basemotion(v3, #t1, #q0)` which I find in the initial state, and `canmove()` (also true). The effects are `atbconf(#q0)`, `negated atbconf(v3)`, and `negated canmove()`.
           2.  **Pick `v8`:**
               *   Action: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0)`
               *   Preconditions: `kin(v4, v8, v9, #g0, #q0, #t0)` (true), `atpose(v8, v9)` (true), `handempty(v4)` (true), and `atbconf(#q0)` is achieved by the previous `move_base`. Also, I assume  `Negated unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #g0)` and `Negated unsafeatraj(#t0)` are true.
               *   Effects:  `atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)`, `canmove()`, `negated atpose(v8, v9)`, and `negated handempty(v4)`.
           3.  **Move to place pose:**  The robot is at `#q0`. I need to place `v8` at `#p0`, which requires base configuration `#q1`.
               *   Action: `(move_base #q0 #q1 #o0)`.  This was in my previous plan. I check the provided list of valid actions.
               *   I see `((move_base #q0 #q1 #o0))` is present. Thus, the action is valid.
               *   Preconditions: `atbconf(#q0)` is true, `basemotion(#q0, #o0, #q1)` is given in initial state, and `canmove()` is true due to the previous `pick` action.
               *   Effects:  `atbconf(#q1)`, `negated atbconf(#q0)`, and `negated canmove()`.
           4.  **Place `v8`:**
               *   Action: `(place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2)`.
               *   Preconditions: `kin(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t2)` (true), `atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)` is achieved by `pick`, `atbconf(#q1)` is achieved by the previous `move_base`. Further, I assume `Negated unsafepose(v8, #p0)`, `Negated unsafeapproach(v8, #p0, #g0)`, and `Negated unsafeatraj(#t2)` are true.
               *   Effects: `atpose(v8, #p0)`, `handempty(v4)`, `canmove()`, and `negated atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)`.
           
           The continuous value `#p0` is still computed and falls within the bound of `v18` and avoids other objects. So the plan still seems logically sound. Let me verify that the goal is met.
           Goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`
           The relevant axiom is `Conjunction (Atom on(?green, v18)) (Atom type(?green, v17))`. We know `v8` is  `?green` since  `type(v8, v17)` is in the initial state. The final state requires `on(v8, v18)`. Now the axiom defining `on`: `Conjunction (Atom supported(?o, ?p,
