           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.735, -0.376), (-4.647, -0.288)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.691, -0.332, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.809, 0.587).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of my thinking process to solve this problem:**
           
           1.  **Understand the Goal:** I began by dissecting the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of a specific type (v17) "on" another object (v18).  I identified `v8` as a possible object to use, as it has the correct type.
           
           2.  **Analyze the Initial State:** I examined the given facts about the initial state, which include the positions of `v8` and `v12`, as well as which objects were "stackable". Both were available to stack.
           
           3.  **Plan the Steps:** I devised the core steps: 1) pick up `v8` from its current location, 2) place `v8` on the desired surface `v18`.
           
           4.  **Identify Sub-Steps and Preconditions:** I broke down the "pick" and "place" actions, understanding their preconditions. This included arm configuration (kinematics), base configuration (atbconf), hand state (handempty, atgrasp), and safety constraints (unsafeapproach, unsafeatraj, unsafepose).
           
           5.  **Address Base Configuration:**  I identified the need to move the robot's base to a suitable location (`#o3`) before performing the "pick" and "place" actions, since `atbconf(#o3)` is a precondition.  I formulated a "move\_base" action to accomplish this.
           
           6.  **Verify Preconditions are Met:** For each action, I meticulously checked if all the preconditions were met or could be achieved through prior steps.  This involved reasoning about the robot's state and possible moves.
           
           7.  **Choose a Continuous Value for the Pose:** I had to determine a continuous value for the position on `v18` (`#o2`). Using the AABBs and knowing the robot's height I decided on a safe location on the surface.
           
           8.  **Complete Plan and Verify Goal:**  I assembled the complete plan: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`. I confirmed that following this sequence would achieve the desired goal, `on(v8, v18)` which satisfied `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           9.  **Consider Object Properties for a Final Check:** Re-read the objects and the structure to look for any missing facts. Double-checked poses and requirements. Everything appears correct.
           
           10. **Refine Plan and Provide Values:** I checked the logic of the solution and considered a possible robot start, and possible values for #o2 as `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           11. **Evaluate Plan and Axiom**: I assessed that all actions satisfied the requirements and ensured a valid plan, and that the axiom would be satisfied.
