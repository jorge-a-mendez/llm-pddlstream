User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.735, -0.376), (-4.647, -0.288)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.691, -0.332, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.809, 0.587).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out how to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object of type `v17` onto location `v18`. After looking at the axiom, I see I need to ensure the truth of two atoms: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Pretty straightforward, but the devil's in the details.
           
           My initial analysis reveals two possible candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. They both satisfy the `type` requirement.  Initially, `v8` is perched on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.  To meet the goal, either `v8` or `v12` has to end up on `v18`.
           
           I start to dig deeper, exploring my options.  If I choose `v8`, I'm aiming for `on(v8, v18)`. If I go with `v12`, it's `on(v12, v18)`.  The plan is simple – move the appropriate object onto the correct location.  But here's where things get tricky...
           
           I look at the available actions, hoping for a `pick` and `place` sequence.  Unfortunately, the *only* action allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It's a `move_base` action that... doesn't move. It keeps the robot in place. This move doesn't allow me to change an `on` predicate. I am explicitly told to only use actions provided. There is no other actions to move or manipulate the objects to solve the `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Given the constraint that *only* the single `move_base` action is available, I realize I'm stuck. It's impossible to manipulate any object in this initial state. The necessary actions to change object locations (pick and place) are simply not available to me. I've reviewed the initial state and all the `on` predicates and the only object type satisfying the axiom (i.e. `v17`) cannot be placed on `v18`.
           
           So, despite the clear goal, it's unreachable. The available tools, the action `move_base`, do not possess the capacity to change the initial `on` statements. The axiom cannot be satisfied. Thus, I must conclude that the goal is unattainable with the given resources.
