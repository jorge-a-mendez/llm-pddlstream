           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.735, -0.376), (-4.647, -0.288)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.691, -0.332, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.809, 0.587).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to New-Axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means placing an object, let's call it `?green`, of a certain type (`v17`) onto a surface (`v18`).  My initial thought is, "Okay, let's figure out what objects fit the bill and where they are."
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see two candidates: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`.  Now, where are they? `v8` is on `v9` which is supported on `v11`, and `v12` is on `v13` which is supported on `v14`. My immediate instinct is to check if it's possible for either `v8` or `v12` to be moved directly onto `v18`.
           
           Here's where things get interesting. I've got two robot arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently empty.  Now I need to see what I can do with `v8` first. The available actions involve picking up `v8` and placing it.  However, the "place" action needs `v8` on a pose that is supported by surface `v18`. From the initial state, this is already satisfied. So, theoretically, it can use the  `place` action to place on `v18`.
           
           So, it seems that placing the object on surface `v18` with the correct type should be a valid plan. Now, it's time to build the step-by-step instructions.
           
           Let's assume a plan:
           1. Move the base.
           2. Pick the object with the hand.
           3. Move the base.
           4. Place the object on `v18`.
           
           Let's check `move_base`: I see `basemotion(v3, #t1, #q0)`. Yes, this looks valid, let's move the base.
           The `pick` action has constraints, I must check the predicates. It requires `atpose(v8, v9)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(#q0)`, which is achieved.  I'll assume no collisions.
           The `move_base` action, base is moved.
           Finally, `place` must require that the robot arm has a `kin` and robot base needs to be configured. The action `place` has `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` in initial state. So, place action has valid preconditions.
           After `place`,  the goal will be achieved and `new-axiom@0()` will be true.
           
           Now, my mind goes to the continuous values that need to be provided for poses.
           
           It is possible to place `v8` on `v18`. I re-read the geometry constraints.
           
           I check `v12` and determine the best approach. My initial analysis was flawed. The given information states placement must be stable. I will need to consider the AABB constraints and see if `v8` is suitable.
           The goal statement indicates "fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           
           However, I re-analyze based on the understanding of the given "AABBs" are to specify the extent of an object relative to its origin (not the world). In this case, `v8` should be placeable.
           Let's see if  `v12` is an option as well.
           
           I will need to provide values for a target pose for `v12`, with the center of `v18`. `v13` for `v12` in current state has position `(-4.691, -0.332, 0.801)` where the z is the height. The surface has z of zero, so the target height of `v12` will remain at `0.801`.
           Now let's choose coordinates for `v12` placed on `v18` with x at `4.5` and y at `-0.3`.
           I then generate the pose with `(4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 1.882)`.
           
           So, the optimal `v12` plan:
           1. Move from base at `v3`
           2. Pick `v12` using a hand.
           3. Move from base at `v3`.
           4. Place `v12` on `v18`.
           
           This plan satisfies the goal. Both actions of `pick` and `place` must be considered.
           Finally, all preconditions are

           Let's check `move_base`: I see `basemotion(v3, #t1, #q0)`. Yes, this looks valid, let's move the base.
           The `pick` action has constraints, I must check the predicates. It requires `atpose(v8, v9)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(#q0)`, which is achieved.  I'll assume no collisions.
           The `move_base` action, base is moved.
           Finally, `place` must require that the robot arm has a `kin` and robot base needs to be configured. The action `place` has `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` in initial state. So, place action has valid preconditions.
           After `place`,  the goal will be achieved and `new-axiom@0()` will be true.

           So, the optimal `v12` plan:
           1. Move from base at `v3`
           2. Pick `v12` using a hand.
           3. Move from base at `v3`.
           4. Place `v12` on `v18`.
           
           This plan satisfies the goal. Both actions of `pick` and `place` must be considered.
