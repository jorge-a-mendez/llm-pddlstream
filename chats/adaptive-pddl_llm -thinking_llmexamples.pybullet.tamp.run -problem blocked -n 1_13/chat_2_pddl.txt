           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to having some object, let's call it `?green`, both *on* `v18` and of a particular *type* (`v17`).  I immediately see that `?green` could be either `v12` or `v8` based on their declared types. Since I need to get one of them *on* `v18`, I focused on the predicate `on(?o: object, ?r: object)`. It needs `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` to be true.  Both objects, `v12` and `v8` are initially supported on `v18`, but neither is at the proper pose (`#o2`).
           
           My current thought is to go with `v12`, and so the initial analysis focused on it. I determined I need to manipulate `v12` to satisfy this. Since `v12` is not currently at the correct pose, my first instinct is to manipulate the environment. I'll need the robot arm, `v4`, and its current state as `handempty(v4)`. To manipulate `v12`, I need to execute `pick` and `place` actions. The `pick` action requires picking the object from pose `v13` and place the object at the target pose `#o2`.
           
           **Here's the plan I've formulated:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I need to position the robot's base configuration to be compatible with object manipulation, which seems to require `atbconf(#o3)`. I'll issue a `move_base` command from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick Up:** Then, I'll use the `pick` action to grasp `v12` from its current location, `v13`.
           3.  **Place Object:** Finally, I'll use the `place` action to set `v12` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           With those actions in sequence, assuming the absence of negative constraints like `unsafe` conditions, I should be able to achieve the desired state and satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. I've checked and double-checked the preconditions and effects of these actions, ensuring they fit together logically. I've also verified that the necessary configuration, kinematic, and support information is present in the initial state, setting the stage for smooth plan execution.  I feel confident this plan is sound.
