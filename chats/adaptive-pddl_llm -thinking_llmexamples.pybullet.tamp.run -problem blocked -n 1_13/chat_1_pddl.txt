           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` *on* object `v18` and of type `v17`.  I'll start by checking what objects currently have the type `v17`.  Both `v12` and `v8` fit the bill.
           
           Now, I need to figure out how to get either `v12` or `v8` *on* `v18`.  The `on` predicate is satisfied if an object is *supported* by `v18` at a specific *pose*.  From the initial state, it's clear that neither `v12` nor `v8` are *currently* on `v18`.
           
           My strategy will be to move either `v12` or `v8` to the correct *pose*. Let's try `v12` first. I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions of a robot arm (`v4` in this case). The arm must be `handempty` to pick an object.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to pick `v12` up. This action has several preconditions that need to be true.  The arm has to be *kinematically* capable of picking up `v12`, which is given as a `kin` fact. The `atbconf` needs to be true as well, which is given by the initial `atbconf(v3)`. I'm going to assume that the configuration, represented by `#o3`, is in fact `v3`. It makes the most sense because `#o3` isn't changing. This lets me use the initial base state. The other preconditions have to do with collision avoidance which I will assume are false given the problem statement.
           2.  **Place:** After picking up `v12`, the `place` action will be used to move `v12` to its final *pose* on top of `v18`.  The preconditions are much like `pick`. I'll assume they are true.
           
           After placing, the goal should be met.
           
           Now, there is the `move_base` action, but it's not needed. `move_base` changes the configuration of the arm. It doesn't contribute to achieving the final goal. The `pick` and `place` action are sufficient to achieve the overall goal.
           
           This two-action sequence should result in `v12` being `on` `v18`, satisfying the goal. The actions for `v8` would be identical. I choose `v12`. I am confident that my plan is the most effective.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new goal: `(on(?green, v18) AND type(?green, v17))`.  Essentially, I need to get an object of a certain type onto a specific location, `v18`.  The catch, as always, is the action set.  I'm limited to just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           First, let's figure out what objects fit the bill for `?green`.  I've got two candidates: `v12` and `v8`, both of type `v17`.  Now I need to check their current states.  To be "on" something, they need to be both supported by that thing and at a specific pose (position).
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v12` is *on* `v14`, and `v8` is *on* `v11`. Neither is initially *on* `v18`. So I need to move one of them.
           
           Now, let's analyze my only tool: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  It seems harmless, it has all the prerequisites, but the effects are essentially a no-op! It keeps the robot in the same base configuration and also invalidates the `canmove()` predicate. This won't help me manipulate any objects or, move, clean, or cook anything.  It's effectively a useless action.
           
           Given that I need to change the *state* of either `v12` or `v8` to satisfy the goal, and I'm only allowed to *move_base*, this is a dead end. I *need* actions like `pick` and `place` to get `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`. Without those actions, this goal is utterly unreachable. It's a fundamental problem of not having the right tools for the job.
