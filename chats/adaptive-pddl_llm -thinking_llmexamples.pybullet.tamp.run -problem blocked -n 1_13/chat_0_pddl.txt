           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to establish `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring that some object, `?green`, is both of type `v17` and located "on" another object, `v18`. From the initial state, I know that `v12` and `v8` are both of type `v17`. My task, therefore, is to place either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           The "on" relation is defined through support and pose. Specifically, `on(?o, ?r)` requires that object `?o` is supported at a specific pose by object `?r`.  Currently, both `v12` and `v8` are supported by other objects and are *not* located "on" `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the available facts, I see that for `v12` to be "on" `v18`, it needs to be at a pose `#o2`, which is supported by `v18`. Similarly, `v8` must be at pose `#o2` as well. The initial state doesn't reflect this.
           
           The crucial constraint is that I can only use the action `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. While this action can move the base, it cannot change the poses of any objects. To achieve the goal, I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* allowed.
           
           Since I am restricted to the base movement action, the poses of the objects, including `v12` and `v8`, cannot be altered. Thus, neither object can be placed "on" `v18`, as neither can attain the necessary pose `#o2`.
           
           Consequently, as the initial state contradicts the goal state, and the only permitted action is incapable of making a state transition that leads to a solution, the overall goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It is impossible to make `v12` or `v8` be on `v18` with the actions available.
