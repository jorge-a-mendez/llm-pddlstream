           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal `new-axiom@0()` that boils down to a conjunction of several conditions. My immediate thought is to break this down and figure out a plan. The crucial pieces are: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To get `receivedimage`, I'd need to use `send_image`. This requires having the image (`haveimage`) which in turn means I have to `take_image` first.  The catch is that I need the camera calibrated (`calibrated`) before I can even *take* the images.
           
           Now, checking the initial state, I see that I *do* have two rovers, a camera, and a lander.  But, here's the kicker: I'm only allowed to use four actions: two no-op moves and two drops. This is a red flag. These actions don't allow me to calibrate a camera, take images, or send anything.
           
           I've examined the preconditions of these allowed actions and compared them to the initial state. The preconditions related to `take_image` and `send_image` are clearly not satisfied (most importantly - calibrated and sendimage-required comvisible/haveimage). Also, the action `drop_rock` cannot be used since the stores are free initially.
           
           In essence, I can't take or transmit any images. I can't analyze samples either. With only the allowed actions, it's impossible to reach the goal. My conclusion is that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable* based on the given allowed actions.
