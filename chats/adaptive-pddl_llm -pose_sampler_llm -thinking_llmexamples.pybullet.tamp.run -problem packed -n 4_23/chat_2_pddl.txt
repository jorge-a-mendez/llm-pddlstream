           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is to arrange four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) on top of a table (`v18`) in the `pr2-tamp` domain. To achieve this, I need to understand that being "on" something means an object is supported at a specific pose. Therefore, for each object, I'll identify a suitable pose on `v18` and then plan how to place that object there.
           
           Let's begin by noting the current positions and support relationships. All four objects are currently situated on top of another object, `v11`. However, my goal state requires each object to rest on `v18`. Luckily, the problem setup includes alternative poses (`#o2`) for each object where they *can* be supported by `v18`. This is promising.
           
           Now, let's establish a plan. It will revolve around the "pick and place" paradigm. First, I have to ensure the robot's base is positioned correctly, as its current location might be suboptimal. There's a specified base configuration I need to reach (`#o3`). A simple `move_base` action will handle this. The robot's arm, specifically arm `v4`, will perform the "pick" and "place" actions.
           
           For each object, the process will be:
           1.  Move the robot's base to the target configuration (`#o3`).
           2.  Pick the object using the arm at its current location.
           3.  Place the object at the designated pose (`#o2`) on `v18`.
           
           I'll execute this sequence for each object, in the order specified in the problem, though the order likely won't affect the solution's validity. I'll need to check the initial positions and grasp/support relations for each object, and I need to make sure the kinematic facts are correct. Fortunately, all the relevant `kin` facts and grasp points are readily available.
           
           I've carefully examined the preconditions and effects of each action to ensure that the plan's actions remain valid throughout the entire sequence. The pick operation requires that the arm is hand-empty, and the object is at its designated pose.  The place operation requires that the robot is holding the object and is in the correct base configuration. I'll ensure that there are no negative predicates that make those assumptions fail. The final check confirms that all goal conditions, i.e., each object being 'on' `v18`, are achieved after executing the entire plan.
