(Thoughts: **The Challenge: Crafting a Plan to Achieve a New Axiom**
           
           My task is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, a core concept in this planning domain.  This boils down to ensuring an object of a particular type is placed "on" another. I've broken this down: `on(?green, v18)` requires an object, `?green`, of a specific type (which, in the starting setup, could be either `v8` or `v12`) to be placed *on* `v18`.
           
           My initial examination revealed the supporting and stacking relationships amongst the objects:  `v8` and `v12` can be stacked on `v18`.  The essential "on" axiom dictates a supportive pose for an object.  Therefore, my strategy is clear: I need to choose either `v8` or `v12`, find an available "supported" pose, and place it *on* `v18`.
           
           Looking at the initial conditions, it's clear `v8` and `v12` have their initial poses assigned. I've decided to initially focus on `v8`, knowing from existing facts that I've available, `v8` is `supported` on a pose `#p0`.
           
           So, the plan unfolds: I intend to use the robot's arm, denoted `v4`, to pick up `v8` (from its original position) and place it on pose `#p0` on `v18`.  Crucially, I also need to ensure the robot base moves to proper configurations.
           
           The *pick* and *place* actions are core to this. Each has specific preconditions. Before *pick* can happen, the robot must be in the right base configuration to access `v8`, and the arm must be empty.  Similarly, before *place*, I must ensure the robot can maneuver its base and is grasping the chosen object.  I've checked the state against the preconditions:
           
           To start, the `move_base` action is necessary to configure robot. This needs `canmove()`. It will take the robot from configuration `v3` to `#q1`.  The crucial point is that this makes `canmove()` *false*.  The subsequent `pick` action has `canmove()` *true* as an effect.
           
           In the second step, the arm `v4` picks `v8` from its initial pose to enable a move to a suitable placement. The crucial consequence of this action is that the arm grabs `v8`, `canmove` becomes true again, and the state of `v8` being `atpose` the initial pose becomes false.  I intend to have the base move to configuration `#q0` where object is to be place.
           
           The third action re-introduces `move_base`. The robot will move from `#q1` to `#q0`. Now, `canmove()` becomes false again.
           
           Finally, the `place` action. I will now place `v8` at the appropriate pose.   With this step, the predicate `on(v8, v18)` becomes true, and so does the `new_axiom@0()` goal. The placed action, in contrast to the move, does not need canmove as a precondition, and the `canmove()` flag becomes true again.
           
           The plan is therefore:
           
           1.  **move_base v3 #q1 #t3** (moving the robot to be able to access the object).
           2.  **pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q1 #t1** (picking up the object).
           3.  **move_base #q1 #q0 #o0** (moving the robot to proper pose).
           4.  **place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q0 #t0** (placing the object).
           
           This sequence of actions should achieve the objective and make the goal satisfied.  The plan has been reviewed and seems correct.
