           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which has an AABB of ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object's rotated AABB fits entirely within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object is a square, determining the bounding box of the rotated object is straightforward. The bounding box's half-width/height, `h_eff`,  is calculated using `0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This formula accounts for any rotation `theta` and varies between 0.035 and 0.035 * sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.0495.
           
           To ensure stability, the center of the object must be placed within a specific range:  `surf_lower + h_eff <= center <= surf_upper - h_eff` for both the x and y dimensions.
           
           I've taken a straightforward approach: I selected 5 distinct angles for theta: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, and pi. I then generated a 5x2 grid for each angle's valid x and y range, resulting in 50 stable placements. I will make sure the floating point precisions are set such that the results are of good quality.
