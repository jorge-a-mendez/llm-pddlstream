           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've constructed to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.**
           
           My initial assessment focused on breaking down the conjunctive conditions of `new-axiom@0()`. The first four conditions were already satisfied in the initial state, relating to rover configurations and available storage. The core of the problem lies in the remaining eight conditions: four `receivedimage` predicates and two sets of `type` and `receivedanalysis` predicates related to rocks and soil.
           
           I recognized that the image conditions necessitated using the `send_image` action, which requires obtaining the images using `take_image` and ensuring the camera `calibrated`. Similarly, the `receivedanalysis` predicates involved using the `sample_rock` action and then using the `send_analysis` action.
           
           To create an effective and efficient plan, I checked image visibility and camera availability. The initial state analysis showed both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, could theoretically perform the image gathering and communication. However, the `take_image` action uncalibrates the camera, requiring calibration before each image. So, I devised a plan to use only one rover `v12` to handle the imaging tasks, which is most efficient.
           
           For the images, I would calibrate, then take the image, and then send the image. Repeating for each image. The `sample_rock` actions also affect the store, requiring a `drop_rock` action to free the storage before sampling again.
           
           The initial analysis showed the rovers are already configured to communicate and image the required objects, which leads me to deduce that the specific configuration continuous parameters can be assumed to be equivalent to the current known rover location when planning. The rovers are able to successfully take images, perform sampling and drop actions because all configurations are assumed compatible.
           
           **The plan:**
           1.  **Image v17**
               *   calibrate
               *   take image
               *   send image
           2.  **Image v18**
               *   calibrate
               *   take image
               *   send image
           3.  **Image v19**
               *   calibrate
               *   take image
               *   send image
           4.  **Image v20**
               *   calibrate
               *   take image
               *   send image
           5.  **Sample and send analysis for rock**
               *   sample
               *   send
               *   drop
           6.  **Sample and send analysis for soil**
               *   sample
               *   send
               *   drop
           
           This plan will allow the initial goal and therefore the axiom to be considered achieved.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: This Problem is Fundamentally Unsolvable**
           
           Okay, I've got a bit of a pickle here. The user provided me with a list of actions I can use, and it seems my initial plan was leaning on actions that aren't even permitted. So, I'm restricted to `move` actions, which are essentially useless, and `drop_rock` actions.
           
           Let's break down the goal `new-axiom@0()` again. We're looking at a bunch of predicates, some are true initially, which is fine, but crucially, we need to get `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. Those are the key ones that the user is interested in.
           
           Now, looking at the available actions: the `move` actions won't change any of the key state variables, so they're a dead end. The `drop_rock` action could be useful, but there's a problem: it needs the storage location to be `full`, but the initial state tells us that `v12` and `v14` are both `free`. I need to sample rock or soil to make them full, but I don't have access to those actions!
           
           And finally, to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, I'd need to use `send_image` and `send_analysis`, respectively, but they're not even in the allowed action set! That's a huge blocker.
           
           The bottom line is that the set of allowed actions simply doesn't contain the necessary tools to reach the desired state. I can't fill the storage and I can't receive image or analysis. This goal, with these actions, is fundamentally impossible to achieve.
