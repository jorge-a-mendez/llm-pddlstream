           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about generating the 50 stable placements:**
           
           I've been asked to place a square object (ID 5) with side length ~0.091 meters on a square surface (Surface 0) that's 0.27 meters across. Since the surface and object are squares, the orientation (theta) matters less in terms of the object's AABB extents, but it can still impact how stable it is in a physical simulation. I'll need to consider this.
           
           First, I need to make sure the object is fully *contained* within Surface 0. To do this, I need to figure out the valid range for the center (x, y) of the object for different orientations. With theta = 0, the maximum valid x and y range can go more into positive/negative direction than at theta = pi/4 because of less "rotation overlap" with the boundaries of the surface.
           
           I've calculated the boundaries. I've chosen to err on the side of caution and use the most restrictive bounds, which corresponds to the placement where the object's AABB is the largest - the `theta = pi/4` case. If I use this rule - any theta will be safe. So I plan to place the object's center at coordinates in the smaller region to guarantee it's always contained.
           
           My strategy will be simple:
           1.  **Create a grid**: I'll create a grid of points within the safe area. I'll use `x = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` and `y = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`. This gives me 25 unique (x, y) combinations.
           2.  **Vary Theta**: I will then use these same 25 combinations two times. The first using `theta = 0` to make sure there are some placed at this degree. The second using `theta = pi/4` for the rest.
           
           This will give me the 50 placements as requested. This will give me good coverage of the surface.

(Thoughts: **The Placement Challenge: Avoiding Collisions and Surface Boundaries**
           
           I'm tasked with placing object ID 4 (a square, side length roughly 0.076) onto a surface already occupied by object ID 5.  Object 5 is at `surf_idx=0`, `theta=0.0`, `x=-0.06`, `y=-0.06`, and I now have to generate 50 valid placements for object ID 4.  The main constraint: avoid collisions with object 5! The surface itself is a rectangle, `x = [-0.135, 0.135]`, and `y = [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           First, I calculated the safe region on the surface to ensure that I contained every possible rotation. To that end I calculated the object's AABB's given its rotation `theta`. I had to keep these bounding boxes in mind as I had to ensure that the bounding boxes for object 4 did not collide with the bounding box for object 5, which sits at `-0.06, -0.06`.
           
           *   I know object 5 has a bounding box of roughly `[-0.1055, -0.0145]` in both `x` and `y`.
           *   My key challenge is that object 4's bounding box changes with rotation.  I need to compute the half-width and half-height for object 4's bounding box for each rotation (`theta`).
           *   To avoid collision in the x direction I need to have my x coordinate greater than -0.0145 + half-width, or less than -0.1055 - half-width
           *   To avoid collision in the y direction I need to have my y coordinate greater than -0.0145 + half-width, or less than -0.1055 - half-width
           
           Using this logic I had a systematic approach:
           
           1.  **Define Safe Zone:** I found that, to guarantee containment within the surface boundaries, the center of object 4 *must* be within `[-0.081, 0.081]` in both x and y, and I did the calculations to prove this.
           2.  **AABB Collision Check:** I need to check for overlaps of object ID 4's AABB with object ID 5's.  I realized that it's all about whether those bounds overlap.
           3.  **Generate Candidates:** First I had the idea that I can reuse the previous grid approach `x_coords = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` and `y_coords = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` and test each position with rotations of 0 and `pi/4`. This gave me 50 potential placements.
           
           However, I soon found a problem:
           
           *   **Collisions Abound:** My initial grid *did* contain too many collisions with object 5, especially if I have rotations.
           *   The placement I'd put for object ID 5 was a significant problem, it prevented most x and y placements.
           *   My original strategy resulted in only 25 valid placements. I knew this was because of a *large collision zone* around object 5's AABB.
           
           **A Refined Strategy:  Zone Targeting**
           
           I needed to be more strategic and *focus on where object 4 *could* be placed*. I had to generate placements for object 4 whose AABB does not overlap with `OBJ5_AABB_X` and `OBJ5_AABB_Y`. This led me to a new approach:
           
           1.  **Collision-Free Zones:**  I calculated precise "no-go" zones for the center of object 4, factoring in rotation, to ensure I avoid object 5.
           2.  **Targeted Placement:** The safest zone is `x` and `y` between `0.0393` and `0.0813` (The top-right quadrant).
           3.  I had to place object 4's center in this zone `[0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08] * [0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08]` and use both 0 and pi/4 rotation.
               This guarantees 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **My Primary Objective: Secure 50 Stable Placements for a New Object (ID: 6) on Surface 0, While Avoiding Collisions with Pre-Existing Obstacles (ID: 5 and ID: 4).**
           
           I've got a square surface, 0.135 meters on each side centered at (0,0). Object 5, also a square, is fixed at (-0.06, -0.06), and Object 4, another square, is at (0.04, 0.04).  The new object is, conveniently, also a square. My challenge is to place the new object 50 times without any collisions and ensuring each placement is stable.
           
           **Analyzing the Scene and the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Surface:** Limited space. The object's center must stay inside a square:  `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           *   **Object 5:**  Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is approximately `[-0.1055, -0.0145] x [-0.1055, -0.0145]`.
           *   **Object 4:** Its AABB is approximately `[0.0021, 0.0779] x [0.0021, 0.0779]`.
           *   **New Object (ID: 6):**  The side length is about 0.098.  This means its bounding box can get quite large if rotated (especially when at pi/4).
           *   *Key Insight:* The most expansive AABB of object 6 (pi/4 rotation) has a half-width of roughly 0.07. This limits its center position on surface to `[-0.065, 0.065] x [-0.065, 0.065]`.
           
           **Initial Approach: Avoiding Collisions & Leveraging Surface Bounds**
           
           I need to find valid areas for the center of object 6 to be positioned. I'll use the AABBs to calculate the areas *outside* collision zones, but *inside* the surface.
           
           *   To avoid Object 5, I need to place the center so the bounding boxes don't intersect.
           *   To avoid Object 4, same logic.
           
           **Critical Problem with Rotation:**
           
           If I rotate Object 6 by `pi/4`, its AABB is so large that it *will* always collide with Object 4, regardless of the center's location within the valid surface bounds.  This makes pi/4 rotation *untenable* in the current configuration.
           
           **Simplified Approach: Fixing Object 6 to `theta = 0`**
           
           To avoid impossible collision scenarios, I decide to only consider placing the object with `theta=0`. This reduces the AABB size for calculations.
           
           *   The safe surface bounds for the center: I recalculate, and the center can be anywhere in `[-0.085, 0.085]` for both x and y.
           
           **Identifying Valid Safe Zones**
           
           With the fixed rotation, I can create the rules for non-collision:
           
           1.  To avoid Obj5, the center must be *above OR to the right*.
           2.  To avoid Obj4, the center must be *below OR to the left*.
           
           I use these rules and surface boundaries, to calculate *safe zones*.
           
           **Determining the Precise Region**
           
           Through careful calculations, I find two viable, non-overlapping regions for the center's location:
           
           1.  **Region 1 (Top-Left):** x is between -0.08 and -0.05 and y is between 0.04 and 0.08.
           2.  **Region 2 (Bottom-Right):** x is between 0.04 and 0.08, y is between -0.08 and -0.05.
           
           **The Solution: A 5x5 Grid for each Region**
           
           I create a 5x5 grid of points inside of each safe region.
           
           This will be a set of 25 placements in the top-left, and 25 placements in the bottom-right.
           
           **Final Result:**
           This systematic placement strategy guarantees *50 valid, collision-free, and stable configurations* for the new object on Surface 0, with *theta=0*.

Model:     **My Primary Objective: Secure 50 Stable Placements for a New Object (ID: 6) on Surface 0, While Avoiding Collisions with Pre-Existing Obstacles (ID: 5 and ID: 4).**
           
           I've got a square surface, 0.135 meters on each side centered at (0,0). Object 5, also a square, is fixed at (-0.06, -0.06), and Object 4, another square, is at (0.04, 0.04).  The new object is, conveniently, also a square. My challenge is to place the new object 50 times without any collisions and ensuring each placement is stable.
           
           **Analyzing the Scene and the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Surface:** Limited space. The object's center must stay inside a square:  `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           *   **Object 5:**  Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is approximately `[-0.1055, -0.0145] x [-0.1055, -0.0145]`.
           *   **Object 4:** Its AABB is approximately `[0.0021, 0.0779] x [0.0021, 0.0779]`.
           *   **New Object (ID: 6):**  The side length is about 0.098.  This means its bounding box can get quite large if rotated (especially when at pi/4).
           *   *Key Insight:* The most expansive AABB of object 6 (pi/4 rotation) has a half-width of roughly 0.07. This limits its center position on surface to `[-0.065, 0.065] x [-0.065, 0.065]`.
           
           **Initial Approach: Avoiding Collisions & Leveraging Surface Bounds**
           
           I need to find valid areas for the center of object 6 to be positioned. I'll use the AABBs to calculate the areas *outside* collision zones, but *inside* the surface.
           
           *   To avoid Object 5, I need to place the center so the bounding boxes don't intersect.
           *   To avoid Object 4, same logic.
           
           **Critical Problem with Rotation:**
           
           If I rotate Object 6 by `pi/4`, its AABB is so large that it *will* always collide with Object 4, regardless of the center's location within the valid surface bounds.  This makes pi/4 rotation *untenable* in the current configuration.
           
           **Simplified Approach: Fixing Object 6 to `theta = 0`**
           
           To avoid impossible collision scenarios, I decide to only consider placing the object with `theta=0`. This reduces the AABB size for calculations.
           
           *   The safe surface bounds for the center: I recalculate, and the center can be anywhere in `[-0.085, 0.085]` for both x and y.
           
           **Identifying Valid Safe Zones**
           
           With the fixed rotation, I can create the rules for non-collision:
           
           1.  To avoid Obj5, the center must be *above OR to the right*.
           2.  To avoid Obj4, the center must be *below OR to the left*.
           
           I use these rules and surface boundaries, to calculate *safe zones*.
           
           **Determining the Precise Region**
           
           Through careful calculations, I find two viable, non-overlapping regions for the center's location:
           
           1.  **Region 1 (Top-Left):** x is between -0.08 and -0.05 and y is between 0.04 and 0.08.
           2.  **Region 2 (Bottom-Right):** x is between 0.04 and 0.08, y is between -0.08 and -0.05.
           
           **The Solution: A 5x5 Grid for each Region**
           
           I create a 5x5 grid of points inside of each safe region.
           
           This will be a set of 25 placements in the top-left, and 25 placements in the bottom-right.
           
           **Final Result:**
           This systematic placement strategy guarantees *50 valid, collision-free, and stable configurations* for the new object on Surface 0, with *theta=0*.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing 50 units of Object 7 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Objects 5, 4, and 6.  This is tricky because Object 7 is a square, and the other objects have specific placements.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Surface 0 is a square, 0.27 meters on each side, centered at (0,0). Objects 5, 4, and 6 are already fixed in place, and I have their sizes and positions. To avoid collisions, I'll use Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to represent each object and calculate the minimum safe distance between them. I'll need to check the placements.
           
           Object 7 itself is a square with side length ~0.088 meters. This means a diagonal orientation (45 degrees, pi/4 radians) will be the most restrictive, because the diagonal AABB will be larger.  I have to ensure the center of Object 7 is within the bounds of the surface for *both* orientations.
           
           So, for now, let’s go with the horizontal orientation, theta=0. Then I'll plan for theta=pi/4 if necessary.
           
           The basic approach is to identify regions where the center of Object 7 can be safely placed without overlapping any of the other objects' AABBs. It's not a simple case of blocking out the space.
           
           **For `theta=0`, the steps are:**
           1.  **Calculate the AABB for each object:**  I have the center coordinates and sizes for each object.  From these I calculate the AABB for a range of center points.
           2.  **Determine surface constraints:** I make sure the placement points are within Surface 0.
           3.  **Check for Overlap:** I define the range of the AABB for object 7 that avoid obstacles for a placement at position `x_center`. A collision happens when there is the overlap of two objects along both X-axis and Y-axis. The opposite ensures no collision.
           
           **Now, let's determine the placement of object 7:**
           The goal is to determine safe placements, avoiding existing objects. The existing three have specific placements and sizes.
           
           *   **Obstacles are:  (-0.105, -0.014) x [-0.105, -0.014], [0.002, 0.078] x [0.002, 0.078], and [-0.134, -0.035] x [-0.009, 0.089].**
           
           The placement is easier to plan for `theta=0`. After all the computations, it's clear:
           The safe positions for `theta=0` are roughly at `x_coords = [0.035, 0.045, 0.055, 0.065, 0.075]` and `y_coords = [-0.085, -0.075, -0.065, -0.055, -0.045]`. This creates a 5x5 grid of 25 placements in the bottom-right corner.
           I would like more options.
           
           Let's use theta = pi/4 to get 25 more placements.
           `x_coords = [0.05, 0.055, 0.06, 0.065, 0.07]` and `y_coords = [-0.072, -0.070, -0.068, -0.066, -0.064]`.
           
           **In summary, to place the 50 objects:**
           *   For positions 1-25, place at `theta=0`.
           *   For positions 26-50, place at `theta=pi/4`.
