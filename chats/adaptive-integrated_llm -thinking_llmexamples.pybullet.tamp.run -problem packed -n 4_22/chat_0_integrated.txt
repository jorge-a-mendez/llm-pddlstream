User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.144, 0.257), (0.243, 0.356)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, 0.219), (-0.194, 0.317)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.113, -0.545), (0.196, -0.461)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.193, 0.306, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.43, 0.903).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.096, 0.202), (-0.004, 0.294)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.242, 0.268, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.951, 0.31).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.155, -0.503, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.108).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.05, 0.248, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.551, 0.835).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal State**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on` `v18`.  Currently, they're all sitting on `v11`. To be `on` something, they need to be both supported by that thing and at a specific pose relative to it.
           
           The immediate problem is the severely limited actions I'm allowed to use. I only have `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This does absolutely nothing; it moves the robot's base to *its current position*, which is essentially a no-op.  This is a huge constraint.
           
           To achieve my goal, I need *pick* and *place* actions.  These actions are the fundamental tools for manipulating objects in this kind of planning domain.  I'd need to be able to:
           *   `pick` up each object
           *   `place` each object on `v18`.
           
           However, the provided action list doesn't include any `pick` or `place` actions.  Therefore, I'm completely unable to change the *supported* relationships, which are the fundamental state variables that are necessary to achieve the goal state.
           
           In the initial state, I know that each object has a defined *atpose* and is *supported* by `v11`. To satisfy the goal, all objects would need to be in a position where they are *supported* by and *atpose* to `v18`. Without the ability to actually move the objects, this is impossible.
           
           Consequently, given only the available action, I can’t change any object’s position or its supported state. I can’t transform the current state where the objects are supported by `v11` to the desired state, where they are supported by `v18`.  I can't reach the goal state because the required actions are unavailable.  A plan cannot be generated because the goal is not reachable with the provided action.
