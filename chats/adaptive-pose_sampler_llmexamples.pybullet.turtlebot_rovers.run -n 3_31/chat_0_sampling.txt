User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters of boxes in the top-left, top-right, and a few isolated boxes elsewhere. My goal is to find 3 robot base positions that are within 2 units of the target point, avoiding these obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight. I will try to space out the candidate positions to provide diverse options.
           
           Target point: (0.0, 0.0)
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.0)
           (-1.5 0.0)
           (0.0 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempts failed. For the target (0.69, 1.79), (1.5, 0.0) had no line of sight, (-1.5, 0.0) collided with obstacle 18, and (0.0, 1.5) collided with the central wall (obstacle 5). This indicates that there are significant occlusions or narrow passages around the target. I need to be more careful with the central wall at x=0 and the wall at x=-1.5, y=0. I should also consider positions closer to the target point to ensure line of sight.
