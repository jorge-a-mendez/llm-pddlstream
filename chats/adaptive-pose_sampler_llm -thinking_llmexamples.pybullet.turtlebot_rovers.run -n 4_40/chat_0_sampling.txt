User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Robot Base Placement for Target Acquisition**
           
           My objective is to determine three optimal (x, y) robot base positions to effectively observe a target point, specifically (0.1, 0.1), within a constrained environment. The primary constraints are that the base positions must be within a 2-meter radius of the target, and lie within the operational space of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y. Furthermore, the robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the layout, which consists of a central vertical wall and a number of blocks in the upper quadrants, and some scattered blocks in the bottom quadrants. Critical to this analysis is the central wall, which is at x=0. Since the target is positioned slightly to the right of this wall, any base positioned on the left side (x < -0.05) would be entirely blocked from the target. Thus, any viable position *must* be on the right side of the x=0 wall, requiring x > 0.05.
           
           Given this key constraint and the spatial arrangement, I propose the following three robot base positions to maximize target visibility and minimize the risk of collisions:
           
           1.  **(1.6, 0.1):** This position is directly to the right of the target at a distance of 1.5. It provides a clear line of sight, well clear of any obstacles.
           
           2.  **(1.16, 1.16):** Located at a 45-degree angle (1.5 units from the target), this position offers a viewing angle from the upper-right. It's carefully selected to avoid existing obstacles.
           
           3.  **(1.16, -0.96):** This point is 1.5 units from the target at a -45 degree angle. This vantage point provides a clear view from the lower right, again without any obstacle issues.
           
           These three points represent a diversity of vantage points that fulfill the stated requirements. They are all within the required range (<= 2 units from the target), meet the necessary (x > 0.05) constraint to avoid occlusion by the central wall, lie within the spatial limits of the environment, and demonstrate an obstacle-free line of sight to the target point. This provides robust planning to achieve target acquisition.
