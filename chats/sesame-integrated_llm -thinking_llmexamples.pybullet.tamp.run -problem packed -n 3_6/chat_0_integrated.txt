           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.005, -0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.988, -0.157).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.071, 0.3), (0.007, 0.378)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.186, 0.343), (0.285, 0.442)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.039, -0.551), (0.049, -0.463)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.032, 0.339, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.057, 0.998).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.236, 0.393, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.912, 0.411).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: place three objects, v8, v12, and v14, onto a surface, v16. I'm given the initial conditions, so let's break this down. v4 is the robot arm, currently empty. The three objects are stacked on v11, supported by it. v16 is where they need to go. My understanding is that placing these requires an arm pick and place, with the possibility of a base motion for arm positioning.
           
           I see a clear sequence forming: First, pick each object from its initial location. Then, place it onto v16. However, there may be an essential base motion to perform first, as the robot base is at v3, but the kinematically specified objects work with a config #o3. I will need to use a `move_base` action if v3 and #o3 are *not* the same.
           
           Before I can plan the placing, I must consider collisions. The initial pose coordinates indicate object positions, and the goal pose suggests an arrangement on surface v16. The surface area of v16 is small. I need to space the objects on the surface without any overlap.
           
           Given the object sizes, and the surface area of v16, I've determined a suitable arrangement:
           
           -   Place v8 near (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781).
           -   Place v12 near (0.08, 0.08, 0.781).
           -   Place v14 near (0.0, -0.08, 0.781).
           
           These positions are centered approximately inside the space for v16. These coordinate positions will result in non-overlapping objects.
           
           If the base configuration differs in PDDL between `v3` and `#o3`, then the sequence will be the following:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8` and place at surface coordinate (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           3.  `pick v4 v12` and place at surface coordinate (0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           4.  `pick v4 v14` and place at surface coordinate (0.0, -0.08, 0.781)
           
           If the base configurations are the same, the plan is shorter, and the `move_base` action would be a no-op that will incur zero cost to reach #o3 from itself. This makes the plan easier:
           1.  `move_base v3 v3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8` and place at surface coordinate (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           3.  `pick v4 v12` and place at surface coordinate (0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           4.  `pick v4 v14` and place at surface coordinate (0.0, -0.08, 0.781)
           
)
