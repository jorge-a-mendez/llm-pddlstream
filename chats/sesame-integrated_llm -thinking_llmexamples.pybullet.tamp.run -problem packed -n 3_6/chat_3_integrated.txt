           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q3', '#t8'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q3', '#t5'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q4', '#t12'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g2', '#q4', '#t6'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q0', '#t9'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q2', '#t11'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g0', '#q2', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q1', '#t13'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g1', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q5', '#t10'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g1', '#q5', '#t7'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t7', 'v12', 'p4')->()`, which impeded executing the action place('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g1', '#q5', '#t7').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The scene consists of three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently at poses v9, v13, and v15, respectively, supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on v16. There are pre-defined poses p3, p4, and p5 on v16 and v10 that can be used. The robot's arm v4 is currently at configuration v5, and its base is at v3. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing v14 at p5 resulted in a collision with v12 at p4. This indicates that p4 and p5 might be too close for two objects of the given size. I need to find new valid poses for the objects such that they do not collide.
           
           Given the goal to place v8, v12, and v14 on v16, and the issue with p4 and p5 being too close, I will try to use the parameterized pose #o2 for placing some of the objects, or adjust the order of placement. Since there are three objects and three specific poses (p3, p4, p5) provided that are supported by v16, and also a shared parameterized pose #o2 supported by v16, I will try to use p3, p4, and p5 first. The objects are roughly similar in size. Let's re-evaluate their relative positions to avoid collisions.
           
           The AABBs of the objects are:
           v8: ((-0.071, 0.3), (0.007, 0.378))
           v12: ((-0.039, -0.551), (0.049, -0.463))
           v14: ((0.186, 0.343), (0.285, 0.442))
           
           The given poses on v16 are:
           p3: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           p4: (0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           p5: (0.0, -0.08, 0.782)
           
           The previous collision was between v12 at p4 and v14 at p5. Let's look at the x, y coordinates of these poses:
           p4: (0.08, 0.08)
           p5: (0.0, -0.08)
           The distance between them is sqrt((0.08-0.0)^2 + (0.08 - (-0.08))^2) = sqrt(0.08^2 + 0.16^2) = sqrt(0.0064 + 0.0256) = sqrt(0.032) approx 0.178.
           The objects are relatively small, but placing two objects so close might cause collisions.
           
           Let's use the parameterized pose #o2. Since multiple objects can be placed at #o2, I will need to define a unique collision-free placement for each object at that pose. I will try to place them on v16.
           Given that the AABB of v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), this surface is quite small.
           I will place v8 at p3, v12 at p4, and v14 at #o2. To avoid collision between v12 and v14, I need to choose #o2 such that it's far from p4. The origin of the object's local frame is typically the center of the bounding box. The given poses p3, p4, p5 are relative to the center of the surface.
           
           Let's try to place:
           v8 at p3: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           v12 at p4: (0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           v14 at #o2. I need to find a new pose for #o2 on v16 that doesn't collide with p3 or p4.
           The surface v16 has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           p3 is at (-0.08, 0.08).
           p4 is at (0.08, 0.08).
           Both are near the top edge of the surface. I can try placing v14 towards the bottom or middle.
           Let's try to place v14 at #o2 with coordinates (0.0, -0.08, 0.782) on v16, which is identical to p5. The previous plan tried to place v14 at p5 while v12 was at p4. This suggests that p4 and p5 are too close.
           
           Instead, let's try to use the fixed poses for v8 and v12, and use #o2 for v14 at a new collision-free location.
           I'll try placing v8 at p3 and v12 at p4. Then for v14, I need a new location on v16. Let's try to place it at the far end of the surface v16, e.g., (-0.08, -0.08, 0.782). This should be far enough from p4 (0.08, 0.08) and p3 (-0.08, 0.08).
           
           Plan:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 at p3 on v16.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 at p4 on v16.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 at #o2 on v16. (Need to provide coordinates for #o2 for v14 on v16).
           
           Let's check the objects and poses again.
           v8 current pose v9: (-0.032, 0.339, 0.781)
           v12 current pose v13: (0.005, -0.507, 0.781)
           v14 current pose v15: (0.236, 0.393, 0.781)
           
           All pick and place actions use arm v4, grasp #o1, bconf #o3, and atraj #o4.
           The base motion parameters are also common: #o3, v3, #o0.
           
           So the plan would involve:
           - pick v8 from v9 (kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4))
           - place v8 at p3 (kin(v4, v8, p3, #o1, #o3, #o4))
           - pick v12 from v13 (kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4))
           - place v12 at p4 (kin(v4, v12, p4, #o1, #o3, #o4))
           - pick v14 from v15 (kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4))
           - place v14 at #o2 on v16 (kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4))
           
           I need to compute the coordinate for #o2 for v14 on v16.
           Given v16 AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           p3 is (-0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           p4 is (0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           
           Let's place #o2 for v14 on v16 at a point that is sufficiently separated from p3 and p4.
           I will place v14 at (0.0, -0.08, 0.782) - this is p5. The previous plan tried this and failed due to collision with v12 at p4. This is a problem. The surface v16 is small and placing 3 objects might be tricky.
           
           The available poses on v16 are p3, p4, p5, and #o2.
           Let's try:
           v8 at p3
           v12 at p5
           v14 at #o2
           
           p3: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           p5: (0.0, -0.08, 0.782)
           The distance between them is sqrt((-0.08-0.0)^2 + (0.08 - (-0.08))^2) = sqrt(0.08^2 + 0.16^2) = sqrt(0.032) approx 0.178. Still the same distance as p4 and p5.
           
           Let's assume the order of placement matters. If placing v12 at p4 and then v14 at p5 caused a collision, perhaps placing them at p3 and p5 and leaving p4 empty would also cause a collision.
           
           I will define the pose for #o2 to be (0.0, 0.0, 0.782) on v16. This is the center of the surface.
           Let's assign the objects as follows:
           v8 at p3: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           v12 at p4: (0.08, 0.08, 0.782)
           v14 at #o2: (0.0, 0.0, 0.782)
           
           The AABB of v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           p3 is at x=-0.08, y=0.08.
           p4 is at x=0.08, y=0.08.
           #o2 is at x=0.0, y=0.0.
           These seem to be distinct enough. The previous collision with `test-cfree-traj-pose` was during the `place` action for `v14` at `p5`, when `v12` was at `p4`. This implied that the trajectory of the robot arm or the object itself during placement collided with `v12` at `p4`.
           
           The strategy for continuous values of #o1, #o3, #o4 will be filled by the system. My focus is on the poses.
           For #o2 for v14 on v16, I will use (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0).
           
           Let's ensure the full plan:
           1. `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` (v8 is at v9, robot picks it)
           2. `place v4 v8 p3 #o1 #o3 #o4` (v8 is placed at p3 on v16)
           3. `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` (v12 is at v13, robot picks it)
           4. `place v4 v12 p4 #o1 #o3 #o4` (v12 is placed at p4 on v16)
           5. `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4` (v14 is at v15, robot picks it)
           6. `place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (v14 is placed at #o2 on v16)
           
           All kin relations are specified. All objects are supported on v11 currently and goal is to be supported on v16.
           The object #o0 is a `btraj` and associated with `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`. This implies that the robot base can move to #o3 and back to v3, and stay at v3 or #o3. Since there are no `move_base` actions that specify a different end base config, I can assume the robot stays at v3 (or whatever #o3 is resolved to) for all pick and place operations without moving the base. The base configuration #o3 is used in all pick/place actions. The problem statement says `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`. This implies that `v3` is the base configuration to use for the pick and place actions, and the robot might not need to move. However, `kin` predicates use `#o3` for the base configuration. This needs to be consistent. Let's assume #o3 can be resolved to v3, or that `move_base` actions will be inserted as needed by the planner to reach #o3 if it's different. Given the available actions only having `move_base #o3 #o3 #o0` etc, it seems the robot might start at v3 and move to #o3 (if different) once. The initial state says `atbconf(v3)`. So, if pick/place actions require #o3, I need to make sure the robot moves to #o3 if #o3 is not v3.
           
           Let's assume #o3 resolves to v3 for now. If this causes an issue, I'll need to reconsider. The available `kin` predicates explicitly use `#o3`. Also, there are `move_base` actions with `#o3`.
           `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           `kin(v4, v8, p3, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           ...
           This means that for the pick and place actions, the robot must be at base configuration `#o3`. The initial state has `atbconf(v3)`. So, the robot must move from `v3` to `#o3`.
           The available `move_base` actions are:
           `((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base #o3 v3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`
           
           So, I need to start with `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. Then all pick/place actions can proceed using `#o3`.
           The `move_base` cost is distance. If `v3` and `#o3` are the same, the cost is 0. If they are different, there's a cost.
           
           Let's specify the base config #o3 as v3, to minimize cost for `move_base`. So `atbconf(v3)` will satisfy `atbconf(#o3)`. This implies that the action `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` will result in `atbconf(v3)`, effectively having a cost of 0 if #o3 is the same as v3.
           Then I don't need `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` explicitly if I define #o3 as v3. However, if #o3 is truly an uncomputed continuous value, I need to resolve it. The problem states "if your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose". It does not explicitly state this for base configurations. Given `bconf(#o3)` is in the initial state, #o3 is an unknown base configuration. I must define it.
           The initial `atbconf(v3)` suggests the robot starts there. The `kin` relations use `#o3`. If #o3 is different from v3, I need to move. The goal doesn't require a specific final base configuration. I'll define #o3 to be equal to v3.
           
           Let's define:
           #o3 (base config): (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0) (same as v3)
           This makes the initial `atbconf(v3)` satisfy the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition. So, no `move_base` action is needed if I define #o3 as v3. This keeps the cost minimal.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revisiting the Plan: A More Direct Approach**
           
           The prior plan failed due to a crucial mismatch between the base configurations used in the initial `kin` predicates and those implicitly assumed by the plan. Specifically, the system flagged a missing precondition: `atbconf(v35)`.  My investigation revealed that the existing `kin` predicates involving `v35` (e.g., `kin(v32, v33, p3, v34, v35, v36)`) were not directly relevant. The current plan uses the `v4` arm and focuses on the correct base configuration `#o3` used in the `kin` facts related to `v4`. The `kin` facts are `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v8, p3, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, etc.
           
           My initial assumption that I could bypass providing a base configuration by the planner's automatic handling has been proven incorrect. Given the error message, the planner *did* attempt to use `v35`, perhaps because of an internal interpretation or misunderstanding of the continuous parameter matching. The available action instances for `pick` and `place` explicitly define the base config as `#o3`.
           
           To resolve this, I'm introducing a `move_base` action as the first step: `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This action is necessary because initially, the robot's base is at `v3`, but the `kin` facts require the base to be at `#o3`.  This move ensures that the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition will be met prior to performing the pick and place actions.
           
           The strategy is:
           1. `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`: Moves the base from initial `v3` position to  `#o3`.
           2. Following by the pick and place actions using the arm `v4`, object, grasps, pose, and the correct base configuration `#o3`.
           
           Based on the rules provided, the parameter `#o3` needs to be provided a value or the planner might default. To avoid ambiguity, I'm setting a value for `#o3` different than the initial base at `v3`.
           The `basemotion` state, such as `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` that's available in the state, confirms this is possible. A small shift, moving from `(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)` to `(-1.0, 0.1, 0.0)` for `#o3`, should suffice.
           The previous error from the trajectory check also suggests there was a conflict when placing the object. I will provide a distinct value for the pose parameters too.
           This revised plan explicitly handles the base configuration and should correctly satisfy all preconditions. The final error: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t7', 'v12', 'p4')->()` was for `place('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g1', '#q5', '#t7')`. The new plan will place `v14` using `#o2`. This change addresses the collision and target pose problem as well as the initial `move_base`.
