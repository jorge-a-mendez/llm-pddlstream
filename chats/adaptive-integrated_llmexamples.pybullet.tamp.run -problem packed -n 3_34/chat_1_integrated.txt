User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.136, -0.435, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.131, 0.991).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.187, 0.286), (-0.089, 0.384)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.266, 0.508), (-0.191, 0.584)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.138, 0.335, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.31, 0.951).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.093, -0.478), (0.179, -0.392)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.229, 0.546, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.679, 0.734).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. There are two arms, v4 and v6, both are handempty and at their respective home configurations, v5 and v7. The robot base is at v3. The provided action instances show that the robot can move its base from v3 to v3 using trajectory #o0, which means the robot doesn't need to move its base to achieve the goal.
           
           To achieve the goal, each object needs to be picked from its current location and placed onto v16. Since there's only one arm (v4) for which kinematically feasible pick/place actions are provided, and no actions for arm v6 are available, we will only consider using arm v4. Also, since there are no `place` actions provided in the list of available actions, the problem is unsolvable.
           
           The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action doesn't change the state of the objects, only the base configuration, and in this case, it moves the base from v3 to v3, effectively doing nothing. Since the goal requires placing objects (`on` predicate), and no `pick` or `place` actions are available, the goal is unachievable.
