           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Strategic Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           My primary goal is to fulfill the conditions of the new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`. This involves several interconnected steps: acquiring images, performing analyses, and maintaining specific configurations.  The key to success lies in understanding the initial state and leveraging it to achieve the necessary preconditions for each action.
           
           Firstly, I must ensure that both `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are achieved.  This necessitates using rover `v14` to capture images of objectives `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`. To accomplish this, I must employ the `take_image` and `send_image` actions in sequence.
           
           I must move rover `v14` from its initial position `(v15)` to a position `(#o3)` where it can access both objectives with visibility. However,  due to the constraint that I need the same `#o3` configuration for both, I must try to position `#o3` at a location within a 2-unit distance of both targets, which is problematic. To satisfy the given initial conditions `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, I must specify a viable configuration.
           
           After capturing the images, rover `v14` will then move to a designated communication location (#o0) to transmit the pictures. Simultaneously, I must also ensure that the `receivedanalysis` conditions are met for rocks of type `v2` (such as `v1`) and type `v6` (like `v7`). For this, I will use the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions, making sure that rover `v14` can access those rocks from another configuration (#o5). A critical step will be utilizing the `drop_rock` action when `v14` has a full store, so it can sample the second rock.
           
           Throughout this process, I must continually ensure that `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true at the end. Thus, the final move will be rover `v14` returning to `v15` for compliance with the new axiom.
           
           In summary, my plan involves a carefully choreographed sequence of moves, image captures, rock sampling, and transmissions, all executed to fulfill the complex conditions outlined in `new-axiom@0()`. The correct execution of my plan depends on correctly interpreting the continuous parameters given by the program, such as `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5`. I have determined each value based on the given constraints.
           
           Therefore, the main steps are:
           
           1.  **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Calibrate** the imaging system.
           3.  **Take** images of objectives `v17` and `v18`.
           4.  **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `#o0`.
           5.  **Send** the captured images.
           6.  **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `#o5`.
           7.  **Sample** rocks `v1` and `v7`.
           8.  **Move** rover `v14` back to configuration `#o0`.
           9.  **Send** the analysis of the rock samples.
           10. **Drop** rocks
           11. **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `v15`.
           
           The continuous parameters, which are central to this plan and the achievement of the new axiom, are:
           
           *   `#o3`:  Location (1.95, 1.85)
           *   `#o0`:  Location (-1.5, -2.0)
           *   `#o5`: Location (-1.8, -1.3)
)

           1.  **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Calibrate** the imaging system.
           3.  **Take** images of objectives `v17` and `v18`.
           4.  **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `#o0`.
           5.  **Send** the captured images.
           6.  **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `#o5`.
           7.  **Sample** rocks `v1` and `v7`.
           8.  **Move** rover `v14` back to configuration `#o0`.
           9.  **Send** the analysis of the rock samples.
           10. **Drop** rocks
           11. **Move** rover `v14` to configuration `v15`.
           
           The continuous parameters, which are central to this plan and the achievement of the new axiom, are:
           
           *   `#o3`:  Location (1.95, 1.85)
           *   `#o0`:  Location (-1.5, -2.0)
           *   `#o5`: Location (-1.8, -1.3)

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Rover Plan with Continuous Parameters**
           
           My analysis begins by examining a provided plan and the continuous parameters involved. The previous plan failed due to conflicting configurations, specifically for objects `#o3` and `#o0`.  I must re-evaluate these configurations, taking into account the provided obstacles.
           
           The goal is to move rover `v14` to a series of specific locations to complete the required tasks. The initial state gives specific positions for two rovers (`v12`, `v14`) and two 'store' locations (`v15` and `v16`). The goal is to obtain images of objects `v17` and `v18`, perform analysis of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil), and transmit the analysis. I have the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, with rays (represented as continuous parameters) `ray(#o4)` and `ray(#o1)` respectively.
           
           The key challenge is determining valid configurations, `conf`, for the rover to perform its tasks. The previous plan's flaws involved these configurations being in collision. The initial plan tried configurations that the geometry made impossible. I will simplify by using rover `v14` for all tasks.
           
           To achieve goal 1, I need to find a collision-free location for rover `v14` at `#o3` so that `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` both hold.  These facts imply a unique vantage point for the rover. Geometric constraints seem to make this impossible, however, I must trust the PDDL engine. This is because the problem says that *if* `imagevisible` or `comvisible` is the *second argument* of a `conf` predicate, then a continuous value must be given for it (the position). Since I was given a starting `conf` and a starting `imagevisible` with the same `#o3`, I'll interpret this as meaning the line-of-sight is possible if the `imagevisible` is true. Since `#o3` also has the initial `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` and other actions using this configuration, I *must* give a configuration. Also, the problem says, "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". Given these constraints, a good starting point is `(1.5, 1.5)` for `#o3`.  This position avoids the obstacles near `v17` and should be within the range required for `imagevisible`.  I then need to ensure that the ray for `#o4` and `v18` does not cause a collision (I assume the engine will handle checking line of sight for me). This has the added benefit of being near the first object.
           
           For Goal 2, I need a position for `#o0` such that `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. The previous plan put the configuration inside the lander. The position is `(-1.3, -2.0)`, a position outside of `v9`. Distance calculations confirms this is within range of the communications target.
           
           Goal 3 and 4 involve `sample_rock` actions. The `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)` facts, with the initial state fact of `conf(v14, #o5)`, and the prompt mentioning a value must be given when this is the case, suggest I *must* set a value for `#o5`. This value represents a point at which the rover is above a sample. This *requires* a position, given the PDDL initial state facts. Given the distance between the two rocks, `v1` and `v7`, it is impossible to be *truly* above both. I interpret the `above` predicate, given the PDDL facts, as a state that will enable the rover to *later* be able to move for sampling (by the PDDL engine), or the "sampling zone". So, since I have to provide a single position, I will choose `(-1.87, -1.3)` as a starting point. This puts the rover over the first rock. I assume the planner will properly plan moves to sample the

(Thoughts: **Addressing Configuration Issues and Refining the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous configurations for `#o3` and `#o0` are invalid.  I need to find new, valid continuous values for these configurations, while keeping the overall plan structure the same as it correctly addresses the PDDL goal. Let's see...
           
           I'm starting by re-evaluating the object bounding boxes and connectivity for `v14`. This rover starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0), and my goal is to find reachable and collision-free configurations.
           
           **Revisiting #o3:** The challenge is to find an `#o3` configuration that is both `imagevisible` to `v17` and `v18`. Those PDDL facts are explicit, regardless of the geometry. I'm focusing on "reachable," as the previous attempt (1.5, 1.5) was rejected. Given the `imagerange` is 2, and the rover's AABB is approximately 0.36m, I need to find a coordinate.  Considering the rover's initial position and the locations of `v17` and `v18`, I'm looking for a place to put the rover.
           
           My initial thought was maybe the issue was more about the path. So, I need to reconsider the positions of `v17` and `v18`.  `v17` is roughly (2.0, 1.8), while `v18` is (-2.2, 2.1). The `motion` predicate implies a valid path exists from `v15` to `#o3`.
           
           Based on the problem statement, a configuration must be *reachable*. I have to ensure the rover can get there.  The previous (1.5, 1.5) was "not reachable," so a displacement of (2.5, 3.25) from the starting position (-1.0, -1.75). That must mean path planning failure.
           
           Since, `v17` and `v18` are in opposite corners of the map, my choices are constrained.  Let's consider that the geometry requires `imagevisible` to mean it needs a clear view of both at once, and so it's a matter of where to put `#o3`. I'm going to pick a single `#o3` that has the best chance to hit them both.
           
           I have to find a spot that's not blocked. Based on the map I'm going to assume the failure is a direct collision that must be avoided. So, I will retest based on the map.  So, I will retest `#o3` near `v17`.  
           
           Okay, so I think `(1.6, 1.5)` should be in a clear path.
           
           *   **v14 at (1.6, 1.5)**, looks like this configuration is feasible with no collision. And this has a reasonable displacement with reasonable line of sight to `v17`, so, I think I'm good to test it.
               
           **Revisiting #o0:** Now, for the communication relay (`#o0`). The previous (-1.3, -2.0) was in collision with `v9`. I need a collision-free position. `v9` is (-2.40, -2.34), to (-1.39, -1.65). The new one will be outside this object to avoid collision. Let's try (-1.0, -2.0). Its AABB is `[-1.18, -0.82]`. No overlap, so this is collision-free. The distance to `v9` is well within the 4-meter `comrange`, and it's also close to my rover's starting position. So I think I've solved this.
           
           **Revisiting #o5:** For the final sample point, I will keep `(-1.87, -1.3)`. It isn't colliding with the rocks (v1 or v7). 
           
           So, I think I have the coordinates:
           
           *   **#o3: (1.6, 1.5)**
           *   **#o0: (-1.0, -2.0)**
           *   **#o5: (-1.87, -1.3)**
           
           Now I am going to re-evaluate the plan structure. The goal implies moving, image capture, communication, and rock sampling and dropping are all in the correct order. The continuous solver, will handle for the collision-free checks for `#o4` and `#

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Initial State Assessment and Strategic Goal Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a complex problem. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but it requires several subgoals involving imaging, analysis, and communication, all while navigating a terrain with obstacles and maintaining continuous configuration parameters. The challenge, as always, lies in satisfying these constraints while ensuring the rover's movements are collision-free, occlusion-free, and most importantly, reachable. I've got to revisit those previous failed attempts and identify the key points of failure.
           
           The main objective is to move the rover (`v14`) through a series of carefully planned actions. The initial state `atconf(v12, v13)` is already satisfied, but I need to ensure `atconf(v14, v15)` is met, meaning `v14` needs to end up at `v15`. `free(v12, v16)` is also already satisfied. This boils down to taking care of the following:
           
           *   Taking and sending images of `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Analyzing `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil) and sending the analyses.
           
           **Detailed Action Plan and Parameter Selection**
           
           First, for the images, I have to figure out where to position the rover (`v14`) to get good pictures. This involves finding `collision-free`, `occlusion-free`, and `reachable` configurations. The problem lies in identifying `imagevisible` and `comvisible` points (`#o3` and `#o0`).
           
           *   **Imaging:** For the images, I'll need to move `v14` to a pose from where both images are visible. Then I'll have to take those pictures and send them.
           *   **Analysis:** I'll have to pick up the rocks and send the samples.
           *   **Final Destination:** After I'm done with the analysis and communications, I have to take the rover back to the starting point.
           
           **Overcoming Geometrical Challenges & Inconsistencies**
           
           The previous errors were due to collision and reachability issues. The "not reachable" errors are a nuisance, but solvable. The most concerning issues are geometrical; for example, the `imagevisible` constraint, where the rover has to see objects `v17` and `v18` from one vantage point (`#o3`). It seems virtually impossible with the objects being on opposite sides of the scene. The "single object, multi-target" issue is a problem, because it requires I somehow make `#o3` work. After a careful reading of the prompt, I realized that I can use different continuous values for `#o3` with `v17` and with `v18`.
           
           **Configuration Refinements**
           
           Based on this, I'll update my approach:
           
           *   **For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`:** I'll find a configuration *near* `v17` and another configuration *near* `v18` and call them `#o3` because in this situation the PDDL uses the same symbol to denote the imaging positions, but it also allows me to use *different* configurations when the *targets* for a given predicate pair are different.
               *   For `v17`, I'll use `(1.8, 1.4)`. I've verified that this pose is both collision-free and occlusion-free. The ray from `v17` to `(1.8, 1.4)` avoids obstacles `v19` and `v20`.
               *   For `v18`, I'll use `(-1.8, 2.0)`. This should also be collision-free and within range.
           *   **For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`:** I'll place the rover close to the lander `v9` and pick `(-0.9, -1.7)` for `#o0`. This should also be reachable and collision-free.
           *   **For `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)`:**  Based on the problem definition, it is implied that there is a singular `above` configuration value `#o5`, rather than separate ones. I'll pick `(-1.87, -1.39)` as `#o5`, since this point is right above `v1`, but the rover also needs to sample `v7` at this point. In

Model:     **Initial State Assessment and Strategic Goal Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a complex problem. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but it requires several subgoals involving imaging, analysis, and communication, all while navigating a terrain with obstacles and maintaining continuous configuration parameters. The challenge, as always, lies in satisfying these constraints while ensuring the rover's movements are collision-free, occlusion-free, and most importantly, reachable. I've got to revisit those previous failed attempts and identify the key points of failure.
           
           The main objective is to move the rover (`v14`) through a series of carefully planned actions. The initial state `atconf(v12, v13)` is already satisfied, but I need to ensure `atconf(v14, v15)` is met, meaning `v14` needs to end up at `v15`. `free(v12, v16)` is also already satisfied. This boils down to taking care of the following:
           
           *   Taking and sending images of `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Analyzing `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil) and sending the analyses.
           
           **Detailed Action Plan and Parameter Selection**
           
           First, for the images, I have to figure out where to position the rover (`v14`) to get good pictures. This involves finding `collision-free`, `occlusion-free`, and `reachable` configurations. The problem lies in identifying `imagevisible` and `comvisible` points (`#o3` and `#o0`).
           
           *   **Imaging:** For the images, I'll need to move `v14` to a pose from where both images are visible. Then I'll have to take those pictures and send them.
           *   **Analysis:** I'll have to pick up the rocks and send the samples.
           *   **Final Destination:** After I'm done with the analysis and communications, I have to take the rover back to the starting point.
           
           **Overcoming Geometrical Challenges & Inconsistencies**
           
           The previous errors were due to collision and reachability issues. The "not reachable" errors are a nuisance, but solvable. The most concerning issues are geometrical; for example, the `imagevisible` constraint, where the rover has to see objects `v17` and `v18` from one vantage point (`#o3`). It seems virtually impossible with the objects being on opposite sides of the scene. The "single object, multi-target" issue is a problem, because it requires I somehow make `#o3` work. After a careful reading of the prompt, I realized that I can use different continuous values for `#o3` with `v17` and with `v18`.
           
           **Configuration Refinements**
           
           Based on this, I'll update my approach:
           
           *   **For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`:** I'll find a configuration *near* `v17` and another configuration *near* `v18` and call them `#o3` because in this situation the PDDL uses the same symbol to denote the imaging positions, but it also allows me to use *different* configurations when the *targets* for a given predicate pair are different.
               *   For `v17`, I'll use `(1.8, 1.4)`. I've verified that this pose is both collision-free and occlusion-free. The ray from `v17` to `(1.8, 1.4)` avoids obstacles `v19` and `v20`.
               *   For `v18`, I'll use `(-1.8, 2.0)`. This should also be collision-free and within range.
           *   **For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`:** I'll place the rover close to the lander `v9` and pick `(-0.9, -1.7)` for `#o0`. This should also be reachable and collision-free.
           *   **For `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)`:**  Based on the problem definition, it is implied that there is a singular `above` configuration value `#o5`, rather than separate ones. I'll pick `(-1.87, -1.39)` as `#o5`, since this point is right above `v1`, but the rover also needs to sample `v7` at this point. In

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.8 1.4) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.8 2.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v21: AABB(lower=(-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o0 = (-0.9 -1.7) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising and Refining the Plan**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but the "not reachable" errors on specific configuration points are a major hurdle. I'm focusing on these problematic aspects:
           
           *   **Reachability:** The core challenge seems to be the rover's ability to reach certain coordinates. I'm assuming that the problem's interpretation of "not reachable" applies to the specific coordinate and not that *any* location is universally blocked. I'll need to select locations to image the rocks `v17` and `v18` with respect to the initial position of `v14` (which starts at  `(-1.0, -1.75)`) so that `v14` can image these rocks.
           
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** Configuration points must be collision-free. I have to avoid collisions with objects such as `v19`, `v20`, and `v21` to make the path successful.
           
           *   **Distinct Configurations:** The PDDL expects a *single*, unique set of physical coordinates for specific `#o` configurations (e.g. #o3), and I need to select coordinates that respect that rule, even though I've seen indications that the geometry engine might allow multiple coordinates for the same `#o` object.
           
           Here's my revised strategy:
           
           1.  **Split the Tasks:** I'll divide the plan between two rovers: `v14` and `v12`.
           
           2.  **Rover `v14` Plan:**
           
               *   `(-1.0, -1.75)` is its starting point. It will handle the imaging of `v18` and take images and send analysis of stone and soil.
               *   I'll designate a single `(-2.4, 2.0)` position for imaging `v18`. This is located near and visible to `v18`, but clear of any collisions.
               *   For the `#o5` for sampling, I will designate `(-1.87, -1.39)` as it is near both of `v1` and `v7`.
               *   `(-1.0, -1.75)` (the starting point `v15`) will serve as `v14`'s communication point for sending the images and analyses.
           
           3.  **Rover `v12` Plan:**
           
               *   `(1.0, -1.75)` is its start. `v12` will take an image and then send it to the system.
               *   I'll designate `(1.8, 1.3)` for imaging `v17`. This should be near and visible, but clear of collisions.
               *   The `(1.0, -1.75)` position serves as the communication point.
           
           4.  **Careful Configuration Selection:**
           
               *   I will select locations for the various configurations that are near their respective targets, collision-free, and most crucially, *reachable*.
               *   For `v14`, this means a set coordinate for imaging `v18` and for the sampling point `v1` and `v7`, with the starting point `v15` as the communication point.
               *   For `v12`, it entails a point to take the picture of `v17` and use the starting point as the communication point.
           
           I anticipate that these selections will lead to a successful result, as I've chosen points that are collision-free and most importantly, reachable for their corresponding rover.
