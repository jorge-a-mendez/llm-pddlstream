           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Based on the given initial state and available actions in the `rovers` domain, I've concluded that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*.  My reasoning is centered on the strict constraints imposed by the limited `move` actions and the resulting inability to reach crucial configurations for necessary actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands several conditions, notably achieving `receivedimage` (acquiring images) and `receivedanalysis` (analyzing samples).  To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to use actions like `take_image` and `send_image`, but these actions rely on the rovers being at certain configurations (e.g., `#o0` or `#o3`). Similarly, `receivedanalysis` hinges on `send_analysis`, which requires the rover to be at specific locations like `#o0`.
           
           Here's the problem: the only allowed `move` actions available are effectively no-ops, keeping the rovers perpetually at their initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`). Since I'm restricted to only using the given actions, the rovers cannot change their position to satisfy the location requirements of the essential actions mentioned earlier.
           
           Without the ability to move rovers to the necessary configurations, I'm essentially locked out of using actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  Consequently, the core conditions of `new-axiom@0()` cannot be met, rendering the entire goal unattainable. The only actions available do not enable any necessary preconditions for the goal.
