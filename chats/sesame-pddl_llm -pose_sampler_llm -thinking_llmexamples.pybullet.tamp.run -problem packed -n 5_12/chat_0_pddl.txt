(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's nail down these 50 stable placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0. The object is pretty close to a square (dimensions about 0.093 x 0.093), and the surface is a square AABB from -0.135 to 0.135.  My plan is to vary the position (x, y) and the rotation angle (theta) to get a diverse set of placements.
           
           First, I need to figure out the safe area within the surface for placing the object.  I've calculated the object's half-extents (about 0.046) in both x and y. Since the object is nearly square, even a 90-degree rotation doesn't change much. I'll take the slightly larger half-extent to calculate the safe bounds (x and y can go from -0.088 to 0.088).
           
           To get those diverse positions, I'm going to set up a 5x5 grid across the safe surface area with even spacing. This gives me 25 different (x, y) coordinates. Then, for each (x, y) pair, I'll use two rotation angles: 0 degrees and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians).  This ensures the object is placed on a grid centered in the AABB of the surface.  This should give me 50 good placements, avoiding any overlap between objects.  The whole process ensures the objects are fully contained on the surface.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's the plan for placing object ID 6, considering the successful placement of object ID 4.  We know object ID 4 is nestled in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  This means object 6 must be placed in a way that *avoids* a collision.
           
           First, I've got to define the valid placement region.  Object 6 is square, so its bounding box dimensions won't change with rotation.  I need to ensure that the center of object 6 stays within the surface boundaries.  After accounting for the object's size and the surface bounds, I determined the permissible *x* and *y* coordinates for the center of object 6.  Based on surface 0's bounds, I know I must place the center such that its *x* and *y* coordinates are within the range  `-0.08666287382989401` to `0.08666287382989401`.
           
           Now the collision avoidance. Object 4's AABB is determined. For object 6, the center coordinates needs to satisfy the constraints, and that its AABB shouldn't overlap with that of object 4. Since object 4 is in the bottom left, the easiest way to avoid collision is to place object 6 to the *right* of object 4. This means I need object 6's AABB's left edge to be greater than object 4's right edge. This will work in both x and y.
           
           So, I calculated the bounds. The permissible range for x is from `0.00607421808802471` to `0.08666287382989401` and from `0.0060742180880246995` to `0.08666287382989401` for y.
           
           With those ranges established, I will place object 6 by constructing a grid of points within the feasible region. To create diverse placements (required by the prompt), I will construct a 7x7 grid within this safe zone. This yields 49 potential placement points where I'll place the object in each location using a rotation angle of 0. For the final placement (the 50th), I'll set a central coordinate within that region, and assign a rotation of pi/4.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Alright, my goal is to find 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 5) on surface 0, making sure I avoid any collisions with the objects already there (ID 4 and ID 6). It's a bit of a spatial puzzle, but I've got this.
           
           **The Lay of the Land:**
           
           Surface 0 is defined as the rectangle:  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           *   **Object 4:** It's positioned at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x_4=-0.08863145404104064, y_4=-0.08863145404104064)`. It has an almost-square footprint with size x and y of around 0.09. Its AABB is approximately `[-0.135, -0.04226] x [-0.135, -0.04226]`.
           *   **Object 6:**  It sits at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x_6=0.00607421808802471, y_6=0.0060742180880246995)`.  It's also a square object, about the same size as object 4. Its AABB is approximately `[-0.04226, 0.0544] x [-0.04226, 0.0544]`.
           
           **The Newcomer: Object 5**
           
           This object is also nearly square (size approx 0.09). To ensure safe placements, I will use half the largest dimension `max_half_extent_5 = 0.0450151500461948` to construct the AABB around each placement candidate.
           
           **The Rules of Engagement:**
           
           1.  **Stay Within Bounds:** Object 5's center must stay inside the safe zone of surface 0,  defined as  `[-0.08998, 0.08998] x [-0.08998, 0.08998]`.  I'm using the surface bounds and max extent of 0.045 to build the zone.
           2.  **No Collisions:**  Object 5's AABB (considering its size and max rotation) should not overlap the AABBs of objects 4 and 6. For simplicity, let's treat object 5's effective half-extents as `max_half_extent_5` in the collision calculations.
           
           **Finding Safe Havens**
           
           I need to determine where Object 5 can go without bumping into anything. This involves calculating forbidden and safe regions based on the existing AABBs.
           
           *   To avoid collision with Object 4: `(x_5 + hx <= o4_min_x)` OR `(x_5 - hx >= o4_max_x)` OR  `(y_5 + hx <= o4_min_y)` OR `(y_5 - hx >= o4_max_y)`.
           *   To avoid collision with Object 6: `(x_5 + hx <= o6_min_x)` OR `(x_5 - hx >= o6_max_x)` OR  `(y_5 + hx <= o6_min_y)` OR `(y_5 - hx >= o6_max_y)`.
           
           This boils down to finding where the center of object 5 can be placed such that the AABB does not overlap with existing objects. Since collision requires `(x_center, y_center)` to be in the region `(x_range x y_range) - (F4 UNION F6)` where `F4` and `F6` are the forbidden regions due to objects 4 and 6, respectively.
           
           After carefully analyzing the AABBs and avoiding areas, I've identified two safe placement regions:
           
           1.  **Bottom-Right Strip:** A narrow horizontal strip where I can place 25 objects:
               *   `x` goes from `0.002752` to `0.08998`,
               *   `y` goes from `-0.08998` to `-0.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Plan for ID: 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for the new object, ID 7, on Surface 0, while ensuring no collisions with existing objects (IDs 4, 6, and 5) and that ID 7 remains entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I've defined Surface 0's dimensions: -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y.  I also calculated the size and half-extents of ID 7, which are essential for AABB calculations and will use the maximum half-extent to determine safe placement regions regardless of rotation.  I then calculated the AABBs of the existing objects using their provided extents and placements, which is a key step.
           
           To ensure ID 7 fits, I've defined a "safe" region on Surface 0 by subtracting ID 7's maximum half-extent from the surface edges. Next, I need to pinpoint the collision-free areas for ID 7 by avoiding overlap with those same AABBs. My analysis showed that using the AABBs of current objects creates 'forbidden regions' where the center of ID 7 cannot reside to avoid overlap.
           
           After crunching the numbers,  it looks like the only reliable *safe* region for non-overlapping placement is a small, top-right square corner: `[0.089507, 0.0999] x [0.089507, 0.0999]`.
           
           The current placement methodology only allows for 49 objects in total (7x7 grid) using an `x_step` of approximately 0.0017 and a `y_step` also approximately 0.0017 in each axis. 
           For 50 object placements, I'll place the 49 objects and then place the final object to the center of the grid and rotate by `pi/2`.
           
           Let's double-check all calculations to make certain this small space is, in fact, the only viable solution, even with different object orientations.
