               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Frustrating Dead End**
           
           Okay, so the task is clear: I need to get v8, v12, v14, and v16 all positioned on top of v18. Simple enough, right?  My initial thought process is to just stack them – move each object from its current location onto v18. 
           
           Looking at the starting state, I see they're all currently resting on v11.  Good to know. So, the direct approach is to pick up each object and then place it onto v18. Straightforward... in theory.
           
           But here's the rub.  I meticulously checked my available actions, and all I see is  `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it. This action... well, it changes absolutely nothing in relation to `on` and `atpose` predicates.  It's just the robot moving around. Useless for this!
           
           I need `pick` and `place` actions.  They're absent. Completely missing.  And without those, there's no way to manipulate the objects.  No picking up from v11 and no placing them onto v18.  I've hit a wall. 
           
           Therefore,  I can only conclude that, given the extremely limited set of available action instances, this goal is currently *unachievable*.  My expertise tells me that this state is unsolvable with the provided tools.  A disappointing dead end.
