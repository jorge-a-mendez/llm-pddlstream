           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including having images received for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses received for two rocks, one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           
           Currently, we have two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a base configuration (v13 and v15, respectively). Both rovers have a camera (v10) and a store (v16) which is initially free.
           
           The task can be broken down into:
           1. Calibrate a camera.
           2. Take images of objectives v17 and v18.
           3. Send these images to the lander (v9).
           4. Sample two rocks, one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           5. Send the analysis of these two rocks to the lander (v9).
           
           We have multiple options for rocks to sample and rovers to use. Let's look at the rocks:
           - Type v2 (stone): v1, v3, v4
           - Type v6 (soil): v5, v7, v8
           
           Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) and Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           For taking and sending images, both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates defined for configurations #o3 and #o0 respectively, targeting v17, v18 and v9. The camera v10 supports mode v11.
           
           For sampling rocks, both rovers have `above` predicates defined for configuration #o5 over all rocks.
           
           Let's plan to use rover v12 to take and send images, and rover v14 to sample and send analysis for rocks. We'll pick rocks v3 (type v2) and v5 (type v6).
           
           Steps:
           1. Rover v12 needs to calibrate its camera at a pose where it can see an objective. We can use #o3 for this purpose, with v17 as the objective.
           2. Once calibrated, rover v12 can take images of v17 and v18.
           3. Then, rover v12 needs to move to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander v9, which is #o0.
           4. Rover v12 can then send the images of v17 and v18.
           5. Rover v14 needs to move to a configuration where it can sample rocks, which is #o5.
           6. Rover v14 can sample rock v3 (type v2).
           7. Rover v14 can sample rock v5 (type v6). Since the store can only hold one sample, it needs to drop the first sample before taking the second.
           8. After sampling rock v3, rover v14 will drop it. Then it samples v5 and sends analysis for it. No, this won't work. The goal requires *receivedanalysis* for two rocks, not two samples in the rover's store. So, the rover should sample one rock, send its analysis, then sample the second rock and send its analysis.
           9. Rover v14 moves to #o0 to send analysis.
           10. Send analysis for v3.
           11. Rover v14 moves back to #o5 to sample another rock.
           12. Sample rock v5.
           13. Rover v14 moves back to #o0.
           14. Send analysis for v5.
           
           Let's refine the rock sampling part:
           - Rover v14 moves to #o5.
           - Sample rock v3 (type v2).
           - Move v14 to #o0 to send analysis.
           - Send analysis for v3.
           - Move v14 back to #o5.
           - Sample rock v5 (type v6).
           - Move v14 to #o0 to send analysis.
           - Send analysis for v5.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including having images received for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses received for two rocks, one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           
           Currently, we have two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a base configuration (v13 and v15, respectively). Both rovers have a camera (v10) and a store (v16) which is initially free.
           
           The task can be broken down into:
           1. Calibrate a camera.
           2. Take images of objectives v17 and v18.
           3. Send these images to the lander (v9).
           4. Sample two rocks, one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           5. Send the analysis of these two rocks to the lander (v9).
           
           We have multiple options for rocks to sample and rovers to use. Let's look at the rocks:
           - Type v2 (stone): v1, v3, v4
           - Type v6 (soil): v5, v7, v8
           
           Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) and Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           For taking and sending images, both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates defined for configurations #o3 and #o0 respectively, targeting v17, v18 and v9. The camera v10 supports mode v11.
           
           For sampling rocks, both rovers have `above` predicates defined for configuration #o5 over all rocks.
           
           Let's plan to use rover v12 to take and send images, and rover v14 to sample and send analysis for rocks. We'll pick rocks v3 (type v2) and v5 (type v6).
           
           Steps:
           1. Rover v12 needs to calibrate its camera at a pose where it can see an objective. We can use #o3 for this purpose, with v17 as the objective.
           2. Once calibrated, rover v12 can take images of v17 and v18.
           3. Then, rover v12 needs to move to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander v9, which is #o0.
           4. Rover v12 can then send the images of v17 and v18.
           5. Rover v14 needs to move to a configuration where it can sample rocks, which is #o5.
           6. Rover v14 can sample rock v3 (type v2).
           7. Rover v14 can sample rock v5 (type v6). Since the store can only hold one sample, it needs to drop the first sample before taking the second.
           8. After sampling rock v3, rover v14 will drop it. Then it samples v5 and sends analysis for it. No, this won't work. The goal requires *receivedanalysis* for two rocks, not two samples in the rover's store. So, the rover should sample one rock, send its analysis, then sample the second rock and send its analysis.
           9. Rover v14 moves to #o0 to send analysis.
           10. Send analysis for v3.
           11. Rover v14 moves back to #o5 to sample another rock.
           12. Sample rock v5.
           13. Rover v14 moves back to #o0.
           14. Send analysis for v5.
           
           Let's refine the rock sampling part:
           - Rover v14 moves to #o5.
           - Sample rock v3 (type v2).
           - Move v14 to #o0 to send analysis.
           - Send analysis for v3.
           - Move v14 back to #o5.
           - Drop the rock (v3) to free the store.
           - Sample rock v5 (type v6).
           - Move v14 to #o0 to send analysis.
           - Send analysis for v5.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations based on the collision and reachability feedback.
           
           **Problematic Configurations:**
           - `#o3` for `v12` to view `v17` (imagevisible) is in collision with `v19`. We need a new configuration for `v12` to view `v17` and `v18`.
           - `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9` (comvisible) is not reachable. We need a new configuration for `v12` to communicate with `v9`.
           
           The problem description provides that `#o3` and `#o0` are configurations associated with both `v12` and `v14`. We can try to use `v14` for image and communication tasks if the current configurations for `v12` are problematic.
           
           Let's try to use `v14` for image and communication, as its default position `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0). This might give it a better perspective for `v17` ((-0.607, 1.983), (-0.533, 2.057)) and `v18` ((2.102, 1.769), (2.195, 1.861)), as well as `v9` ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           
           **Plan using v14 for imaging and communication, and v12 for sampling and analysis:**
           
           **Part 1: Images for v17 and v18, sent to v9 (using Rover v14)**
           1.  Rover v14 is at `v15`.
           2.  Calibrate `v10` using `v14` at `#o3` to view `v17`. We need a collision-free and occlusion-free `#o3` for `v14` for `v17`. Since `v17` is at `(-0.607, 1.983)`, a configuration around `(-0.5, 0.0)` might work for `v14` (which is near `x=-1.0`).
               - Let's try `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3` for `v14` to view `v17`.
           3.  Take image of `v17` and `v18` from `#o3`.
           4.  Move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o0` to communicate with `v9`. `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)`. From `v15` (x=-1.0), it seems possible to find a communication pose like `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           5.  Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           
           **Part 2: Sample and Analyze Rocks (using Rover v12)**
           1.  Rover v12 is at `v13`.
           2.  Move `v12` from `v13` to `#o5` to sample rocks. `v13` is at (1.0, -1.75). The rocks are generally around the center or other areas.
               - `v3` (type v2, stone): `(1.686, -1.595)`
               - `v5` (type v6, soil): `(-1.401, -0.491)`
               - `v1` (type v2, stone): `(1.319, -0.23)`
               - `v4` (type v2, stone): `(-0.5, -2.115)`
               - `v7` (type v6, soil): `(2.078, -1.786)`
               - `v8` (type v6, soil): `(-1.818, -0.779)`
               We need one type v2 and one type v6. Let's choose `v3` (stone) and `v7` (soil) as they are close to `v12`'s initial position.
               - A good `#o5` for `v12` to be above `v3` and `v7` could be around `(1.5, -1.75)`.
           3.  Sample `v3` (type v2).
           4.  Move `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0` to send analysis to `v9`. `v9` is far from `v12`'s initial position. A communication pose for `v12` to `v9` might need to be carefully chosen.
               - Since `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, a communication pose could be `(0.0, -2.0)`.
           5.  Send analysis of `v3`.
           6.  Move `v12` from `#o0` back to `#o5`.
           7.  Drop `v3` from `v16`.
           8.  Sample `v7` (type v6).
           9.  Move `v12` from `#o5` back to `#o0`.
           10. Send analysis of `v7`.
           
           Let's define the new continuous parameters.
           
           **For v14 (images and communication):**
           -   `#o3` (imagevisible v14, v17): `v17` is at `(-0.607, 1.983)`. `v14` is at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`. To avoid `v19` (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25), `v14` needs to be positioned carefully. A good spot for `v14` to see `v17` could be `(-0.5, 0.5)`. This is about 1.5 units from `v17`.
           -   `#o0` (comvisible v14, v9): `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)`. `v14` is at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`. A good communication spot could be `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This is within 4 units range.
           
           **For v12 (sampling and analysis):**
           -   `#o5` (above v12, v3 and v7): `v3` is at `(1.686, -1.595)`, `v7` is at `(2.078, -1.786)`. `v12` is at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`. A good sampling spot could be `(1.5, -1.75)`.
           -   `#o0'` (comvisible v12, v9 - for analysis): `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)`. `v12` is at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`. A communication spot could be `(0.0, -2.0)`.
           
           Let's update the plan with these new configurations. We will need to use different #oN for different rover/target pairs if the previous one was found to be invalid or too far. So let's use the provided #o0, #o3, #o5 but ensure their values are collision/occlusion free and reachable.

           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations based on the collision and reachability feedback.
           
           **Problematic Configurations:**
           - `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9` is in collision with `v9` itself. This means the proposed communication pose was too close to the lander.
           - `#o5` for `v12` to be above `v3` and `v7` is not reachable.
           - `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9` is in collision with `v20`.
           
           This means all the previously suggested continuous configurations have issues. Let's try to find new configurations that are collision-free and reachable.
           
           **Rover v14 (Images and Communication):**
           - **Objective v17:** AABB((-0.607, 1.983), (-0.533, 2.057)). `v19` (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25). Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               - `#o3` (imagevisible v14, v17): `(-0.5, 0.5)` was proposed and was accepted as collision-free in the previous iteration. So we can keep it.
           - **Objective v18:** AABB((2.102, 1.769), (2.195, 1.861)).
               - The same `#o3` can be used for `v18`. From `(-0.5, 0.5)`, `v14` can see `v18`.
           - **Lander v9:** AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               - `#o0` (comvisible v14, v9): `(-1.5, -2.0)` was in collision with `v9`. We need to be further away from `v9`. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)`. No, this is too close to its base. How about `(-1.0, -2.0)`. It is further from `v9` than `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
               - Let's try a different configuration. Since `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, a communication pose slightly to the side and further back from `v9`'s bounding box `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))` would be appropriate.
               - Let's try `(-0.8, -2.0)`. This point is reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)` and is outside `v9`'s AABB.
           
           **Rover v12 (Sampling and Analysis):**
           - **Rocks to sample:** `v3` (type v2, stone): `(1.686, -1.595)`. `v7` (type v6, soil): `(2.078, -1.786)`. Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               - `#o5` (above v12, v3 and v7): `(1.5, -1.75)` was not reachable. This is surprising given the rover's initial position. Perhaps it was too close to an obstacle or required a difficult maneuver. Let's try `(1.7, -1.75)` for `v3` and `(2.0, -1.75)` for `v7`. Since we need one `#o5` for both, let's try `(1.8, -1.75)`. This is closer to `v7` but still should be above `v3`.
           - **Lander v9:** AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v20`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
               - `#o0'` (comvisible v12, v9): `(0.0, -2.0)` was in collision with `v20`. `v20` is a thin obstacle along the y-axis at x=0. We need to avoid x=0.
               - Let's try `(0.2, -2.0)`. This should be clear of `v20` and reachable from `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. It is also within communication range of `v9`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           All previously suggested continuous configurations were problematic. We need to find new configurations that are collision-free and reachable for all required actions. This suggests a more systematic approach to finding reachable and collision-free points.
           
           Let's re-examine the current state of objects:
           - **Rover v14** (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):
               - **Imaging:** Objectives v17 ((-0.607, 1.983)) and v18 ((2.102, 1.769)). Obstacle v19 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
                   - To see v17, from v14's position, we need to move towards x=-0.6 and y=1.9. A point like `(-0.8, 0.0)` seems like a reasonable candidate for `#o3`. It's roughly 2 units from `v17` and relatively close to `v14`'s start.
               - **Communication:** Lander v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
                   - From `v14`'s position, `(-0.8, -2.0)` was suggested and was not reachable. A good communication point should be within 4 units of `v9` and not colliding. `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is mostly to the left and down. Perhaps a point at `(-1.0, -0.75)` or `(-0.5, -2.0)` would be better. Let's try `(-0.5, -2.0)` for `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. It is further from the bounding box of `v9` but still within communication range of `v9`.
           - **Rover v12** (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):
               - **Sampling:** Rocks v3 (type v2) at (1.686, -1.595) and v7 (type v6) at (2.078, -1.786).
                   - `(1.8, -1.75)` was not reachable for `#o5`. This is very close to `v12`'s current position. Let's try `(1.5, -1.5)`. This should allow `v12` to be above both rocks. It's closer to `v3` and `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               - **Communication:** Lander v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Obstacle v20 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
                   - `(0.2, -2.0)` was in collision with `v20`. `v20` is a thin strip around x=0. So we need to move further away from x=0. Let's try `(0.5, -2.0)` for `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. This is further to the right of `v20` and within communication range of `v9`.
           
           Let's apply these new configurations and re-check the plan.
           
           --Plan--:
           (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)

           (#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-0.5 -2.0)
           (#o5 v12 #o4 v3): (1.5 -1.5)
           (#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (0.5 -2.0)

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.8 0.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (1.5 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (0.5 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           It appears all the configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` for both rovers are consistently reported as "not reachable for robot base". This implies that the problem might be with the relative positions of the rovers to their intended targets, or that the path planning between these positions is generally difficult for this specific robot model and environment. Given the large number of continuous objects and the limited fixed obstacles mentioned in the earlier feedback, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for reachability failures without more detailed geometry or motion model information.
           
           However, I must assume that a solution exists using the provided valid action instances. The initial state also provides a rich set of `motion` predicates, implying that movement between various configurations (including the `#oN` ones) is possible. The repeated "not reachable" suggests that my chosen coordinates for the `#oN` configurations are consistently problematic, possibly due to a very constrained movement model or an implicit obstacle map not fully revealed by the AABBs.
           
           Let's try to stick closer to the initial rover positions for the `#oN` configurations, and make minimal movements. This might increase the chance of reachability.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 ((-0.607, 1.983)) & v18 ((2.102, 1.769))):** Obstacle v19 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
               - Let's try to pick a configuration `#o3` for `v14` very close to its starting position `v15`, but with line-of-sight to `v17` and `v18`. This might be difficult due to `v19`.
               - `v17` is at `x=-0.6`. `v14` is at `x=-1.0`. `v19` is at `x=0.25` to `0.75`.
               - To avoid `v19` for `v17` and `v18`, `v14` needs to be either far left, far right, or low enough. `v14` is currently low at `y=-1.75`.
               - Let's try to stay at `y=-1.75` for `#o3` for `v14`. To see `v17` and `v18`, a position like `(-0.5, -1.75)` might work. `v17` is far from `v14` at `y=1.9`. This seems unlikely to work without a significant y-movement.
               - Given the difficulty, perhaps we should prioritize reachability and assume the robot can pivot. Let's try `#o3` very close to `v15` itself, e.g. `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is a very small move, so hopefully reachable. For the imaging, we rely on the robot's ability to turn its camera/body.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):**
               - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is primarily to the left and below `v14`.
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v14` to be `(-1.2, -1.8)`. This is a minimal movement from `v15`, aiming for high reachability. It is very close to `v9`'s bounding box and might collide, but let's try. The "not reachable" might indicate that even small movements are problematic.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Sampling (v3 (1.686, -1.595) & v7 (2.078, -1.786)):**
               - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Rocks are to the right of `v12`.
               - Let's try `#o5` for `v12` to be `(1.2, -1.7)`. This is a small movement from `v13`, and should be above `v3` and `v7` if the robot arm has a good reach.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** Obstacle v20 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
               - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is far to the left of `v12`.
               - To avoid `v20` (x=0) and be reachable, let's try `#o0` for `v12` at `(0.8, -2.0)`. This is still to the right of `v20` and reachable from `v13`.
           
           If these small adjustments still result in "not reachable", then the issue is more fundamental to how continuous configurations are being evaluated in this specific problem instance. It might imply that a plan might need to use other pre-defined, non-'#' configurations for movement if they exist, or the problem is not solvable with the current setup. However, the problem statement says "If there are sufficient configurations without '#' to solve the problem, you should use those configurations instead of any with '#'.". Here, we don't have enough non-'#' configurations for all `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values are still the missing piece.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The continuous configurations that I have been proposing are consistently deemed "not reachable for robot base." This is a strong indicator that either the problem definition implies a very restricted movement space for the rovers, or there are unstated kinematic constraints making seemingly small movements problematic. Given the consistent feedback, it's highly unlikely that simply adjusting coordinates slightly will resolve the reachability issue without more detailed information about the rover's kinematics or the underlying map of obstacles.
           
           However, I must continue to attempt to find a valid plan. Since all the previous attempts at assigning values to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for both rovers have failed due to reachability, I will try a different strategy. Perhaps the rovers have extremely limited movement capabilities, or they need to utilize the pre-defined base configurations (`v13`, `v15`) as much as possible, only moving to `#oN` configurations that are extremely close or represent simple rotations.
           
           Let's assume the "not reachable" indicates that the linear translation between the current and target coordinates is problematic. Perhaps the motion model is very sensitive, or there are implicit obstacles.
           
           Instead of trying to move the rover for `imagevisible` or `comvisible` to distinct `#oN` points, what if the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` can be achieved from the rover's *current base configuration* (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) by simply rotating the camera or the rover itself? The PDDL predicates `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)` and `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)` use `?q` as a configuration, not necessarily a new *position*. If `conf(?v, ?q)` is in the initial state, it's a valid configuration. So `v13` and `v15` are valid configurations.
           
           However, the initial state explicitly provides `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, etc., which means the plan *must* use these `#oN` configurations. The problem specifies "If your plan uses some object #<name>... then you must provide a continuous value...". So, simply using `v13` or `v15` for these actions is not allowed if the problem explicitly provides `#oN` for them.
           
           This leaves me in a difficult situation where all proposed `(#oN x y)` coordinates are being rejected for reachability. This implies a need for very specific coordinates, or a different interpretation of "reachable".
           
           Given that simple coordinate adjustments are not working, I will try to use the most extreme valid motion available. However, the motion predicates are defined as `motion(v, q1, #o2, q2)`. The `#o2` implies a continuous trajectory. This makes finding reachable configurations even harder without more information about the environment's topology.
           
           Let's rethink the strategy completely and assume the issue is with the coordinates I am picking, not the existence of a solution. I need to be more strategic about the (x,y) pairs.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 ((-0.607, 1.983)) & v18 ((2.102, 1.769))):** Obstacle v19 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
               - For `v17` and `v18`, `v14` needs to be able to see "over" or "around" obstacles, and cover a wide range. `v14` is starting at `y=-1.75`. `v17` and `v18` are at `y=~2.0`. This requires significant movement in `y`.
               - Let's try `#o3` for `v14` at `(-0.2, 0.0)`. This position is roughly centered between the objectives and should provide good visibility. It's a significant move from `v15` but might be reachable if there's a clear path.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):**
               - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is mostly to the left and below `v14`.
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This is a move upwards, and is outside `v9`'s bounding box. Still within 4m range.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Sampling (v3 (1.686, -1.595) & v7 (2.078, -1.786)):**
               - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Rocks are to the right of `v12`.
               - Let's try `#o5` for `v12` at `(1.8, -1.0)`. This is a slight move to the right and up, which might be above the rocks.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** Obstacle v20 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
               - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is far to the left.
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v12` at `(1.0, -0.5)`. This moves `v12` upwards, away from `v20` (x=0) and should give a clear line of sight to `v9` with a long range.
           
           This is a trial-and-error approach given the lack of specific geometric constraints on the rover's movement or environment beyond AABBs for static objects.

Configuration #o0 = (1.0 -0.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The continuous configurations continue to be problematic, with "not reachable" errors dominating, and occasional collisions. This indicates a very constrained environment or robot kinematics. The `v20: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))` (a thin vertical strip along x=0) seems to be a common collision point.
           
           Let's try to be even more conservative with movements, and make sure to explicitly avoid the `x=0` strip for any configuration that might pass through it or be near it. The "not reachable" error is the most difficult to address without more information on the robot's movement model.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 ((-0.607, 1.983)) & v18 ((2.102, 1.769))):** Obstacle v19 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)). Obstacle v20 (x=0 strip).
               - `#o3` for `v14` at `(-0.2, 0.0)` was in collision with `v20`. This means `v14` cannot cross `x=0` if `v20` spans that area vertically.
               - `v14` is starting at `x=-1.0`. To view `v17` (x=-0.6) and `v18` (x=2.1), `v14` would likely need to cross `x=0` or be very far to the right. Since crossing `x=0` seems problematic, `v14` should stay on its side (negative x).
               - If `v14` must stay at negative x, it's very difficult to see `v18`. It's possible `v14` cannot see `v18` from the negative x side due to range or other obstacles.
               - Let's reconsider the objectives. Both `v17` and `v18` are quite far north. `v17` is at `x=-0.6`, `v18` is at `x=2.1`.
               - If `v14` needs to image both, it needs a configuration where it can see both, and it cannot cross `x=0`. This seems contradictory given the x-coordinates.
               - **Crucial Re-evaluation:** The problem statement says `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` AND `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This implies a single configuration `#o3` must work for both `v17` and `v18`. Given `v17` is at `x=-0.6` and `v18` is at `x=2.1`, and `v14` starts at `x=-1.0` while `v20` blocks `x=0`, it's highly improbable that `v14` can image both from a single `#o3` configuration.
               - This suggests that either the problem is unsolvable as currently constrained, or I am misinterpreting something critical. Perhaps `v14` only needs to image *one* of them, and `v12` images the other? No, the goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. So both are needed.
           
           Let me assume the current object definitions and predicates are accurate, and I need to find a way to get both images. If `v14` cannot image both due to `v20`, then `v12` must image at least one of them, likely `v18`.
           
           **Revised Plan Strategy:**
           -   **Rover v14:** Images `v17`. Communicates to `v9`. Samples rocks.
           -   **Rover v12:** Images `v18`. Communicates to `v9`. Samples rocks (if `v14` runs out of capacity or can't reach required rocks).
           
           Let's stick to the original plan structure (v14 for imaging/comm, v12 for sampling/analysis) but critically re-evaluate the configuration choices given the severe reachability constraints and the `v20` obstacle.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 ((-0.607, 1.983))):** `v14` is at `x=-1.0`. `v17` is at `x=-0.6`. `v19` (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25).
               - `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17`: Needs to be far enough from `v19` and `v20`. Staying on the negative x side, close to `v17`. Try `(-0.8, 1.0)`. This is a significant Y-move but is on the negative X side.
           - **Imaging (v18 ((2.102, 1.769))):** This is still the issue. A single `#o3` for `v14` and both `v17` and `v18` seems impossible given `v20` and `v14`'s start `x=-1.0`.
               - **Re-reading initial state carefully**: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`. AND `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This means `both` rovers have `imagevisible` defined with the *same* `#o3` configuration parameter for *both* `v17` and `v18`. This is very critical. It implies that `#o3` must be a general configuration that *both* rovers *could* go to, and from which they *could* see both objectives. But the *executed plan* still needs one rover to execute the `take_image` action. The plan must choose *one* rover and *one* `#o3` to perform the `take_image` actions.
               - If `v14` cannot reach an `#o3` to see both `v17` and `v18`, perhaps `v12` can.
           
           **Let's try using `v12` for all imaging, and `v14` for all sampling.** This is a full reversal for imaging.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 ((-0.607, 1.983)) & v18 ((2.102, 1.769))):** Obstacle v19 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)). Obstacle v20 (x=0 strip).
               - `v12` is at `x=1.0`. It should be able to see `v18` easily. For `v17`, it's on the opposite side of `v20`.
               - If `#o3` must be a single pose, and `v20` blocks `x=0`, then `v12` cannot image both `v17` and `v18` from one `#o3` *if that `#o3` is required to be on one side of `v20`*.
               - However, `imagevisible` does not necessarily mean the rover itself is at `x=0`. The ray must be clear.
               - Let's try `#o3` for `v12` around `(1.5, 0.0)`. This avoids `v20` and `v19`. It's further to the right, so `v12` can likely see `v18` (at x=2.1) and potentially `v17` (at x=-0.6) with a long enough clear ray.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** Obstacle v20 (x=0 strip).
               - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v12` at `(0.8, -1.0)`. This avoids `v20`, is somewhat close to `v12`'s initial position, and should provide line-of-sight to `v9` (far left).
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Sampling:** Rocks v3 (type v2) at (1.686, -1.595) and v5 (type v6) at (-1.401, -0.491).
               - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               - For `v5`, it's very close. For `v3`, it's far on the other side of `v20`. This means `v14` cannot sample both `v3` and `v5` if it cannot cross `x=0`.
               - So, if `v14` is used for sampling, it needs to sample rocks on its side (negative x).
               - Let's pick `v4` (type v2) at `(-0.5, -2.115)` and `v5` (type v6) at `(-1.401, -0.491)`. Both are on the negative x side.
               - `#o5` for `v14` (to be above `v4` and `v5`): Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This is a small movement from `v15` and should be reachable.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):**
               - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This is closer to `v9` than `(-1.0, -0.5)` but not in collision. It's a small movement from `v15`.
           
           This plan aims to respect the `x=0` barrier and minimize movement to increase reachability.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The persistent "not reachable for robot base" errors for almost all proposed configurations indicate a severe constraint on the robot's movement or a very complex environment that is not fully described by the AABBs. The single collision error for `v9` indicates that my attempts to keep communication poses close to the lander are still problematic.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty in finding reachable configurations, I must consider that the "reachable" criteria is exceedingly strict or that the problem expects the rovers to stay very close to their starting positions for any non-base configurations.
           
           Let's assume the rovers can only make *tiny* movements from their initial configurations, or specific predefined moves (`motion` predicates). The `motion` predicates show movements between `#oN` and `v13`/`v15` or between `#oN` configs, which is what I'm trying to specify.
           
           I will try one more approach, making the `#oN` configurations *extremely* close to the initial base configurations, effectively assuming that the "reachable" constraint means "almost no translation". This is a last-ditch effort to satisfy reachability. If even these minimal movements are rejected, it strongly suggests the problem is unsolvable under the given constraints or my understanding of "reachable" is fundamentally flawed for this environment.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 ((-0.607, 1.983)) & v18 ((2.102, 1.769))):** Obstacle v19 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)). Obstacle v20 (x=0 strip).
               - If `v12` images both, it is very difficult to do from its side (`x=1.0`) because `v17` is at `x=-0.6`.
               - Let's try `#o3` for `v12` at `(1.05, -1.75)`. This is a tiny offset from `v13`. It makes the assumption that the `imagevisible` predicate implies the robot can rotate its camera extensively or the objects are within line-of-sight despite being far in 'y'. If this is not reachable, I suspect the provided problem has issues or I need to use the other rover to image `v17`.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** Obstacle v20 (x=0 strip).
               - `#o0` for `v12` at `(1.05, -1.75)`. Again, a tiny offset from `v13`. Assuming communication can happen over long distances with line-of-sight (which `comvisible` implies, up to 4m). `v9` is at approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Distance from `(1.05, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` is `sqrt((1.05 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(2.95^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(8.7025 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(8.765)` which is about 2.96m. This is within 4m range.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Sampling (v4 (type v2) at (-0.5, -2.115) & v5 (type v6) at (-1.401, -0.491)):**
               - `#o5` for `v14` at `(-1.05, -1.75)`. Tiny offset from `v15`. This assumes the robot's arm can reach these rocks from this almost-stationary position.
           - **Communication (v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):**
               - `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.05, -1.75)`. Tiny offset from `v15`. `v9` is approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Distance from `(-1.05, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` is `sqrt((-1.05 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0.85^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(0.7225 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.785)` which is about 0.88m. This is well within 4m range.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The continuous configurations continue to present significant challenges:
           - `#o3` for `v12` to `v17` is out of range. This confirms that minimal movement is insufficient for reaching distant targets, and highlights the difficulty of imaging `v17` from `v12`'s side of the map (positive X).
           - `#o5` for `v14` at `(-1.05, -1.75)` is not reachable.
           - `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.05, -1.75)` is not reachable.
           
           The consistent "not reachable" errors for any non-base configuration, even for very small movements, is extremely problematic. Given the problem statement and the fact that I must provide configurations for `#oN` parameters, it strongly suggests that such reachable configurations must exist. The only explanation for the repeated failures is either a very strict and non-intuitive reachability model or implicitly complex terrain that is not apparent from the AABBs of the few obstacles.
           
           Since `v12` cannot reach `v17` from its side, and `v20` (x=0 obstacle) likely prevents `v12` from moving to the negative x side, it might be impossible for `v12` to image `v17`. The same logic applies to `v14` for `v18`.
           
           Let's carefully re-evaluate the imagevisible predicates:
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           
           This means the *same* `#o3` configuration is used for *both* objectives (`v17`, `v18`) for *each* rover. This single configuration must allow line-of-sight to both targets. This is the core of the problem for imaging.
           
           Considering `v20` (obstacle at x=0):
           - `v17`: `(-0.607, 1.983)` (negative x)
           - `v18`: `(2.102, 1.769)` (positive x)
           
           If a rover cannot cross `x=0` (due to `v20` or reachability issues near it), then a single configuration `#o3` for *either* rover to image *both* `v17` and `v18` is impossible.
           For example, if `v12` stays on positive x, it cannot see `v17`. If `v14` stays on negative x, it cannot see `v18`.
           This implies that the goal of `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be achieved under the current interpretation of `imagevisible` and reachability constraints.
           
           This leads me to believe the problem is currently unsolvable with the provided information, *if* the "not reachable" and collision feedback are strictly interpreted and the single `#o3` must cover both targets for a single rover.
           
           However, since I cannot give up, I must make a different assumption or find an alternative interpretation. What if the `imagevisible` predicates are only *potential* and the plan only needs *one* of them to be valid? No, the goal explicitly needs `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           
           Let's assume there is *some* configuration `#o3` that is reachable for *one* of the rovers, say `v12`, that allows it to see both `v17` and `v18`. This configuration must be outside the `x=0` strip, and far enough up to see `y=~2.0`. A central point `(0.0, 0.0)` would be ideal, but `v20` blocks it.
           
           What if the actual valid configurations for `#oN` are among the `vXX` objects given in the problem, and my custom coordinate choices are wrong? No, the problem explicitly states that I must provide values for objects starting with `#`.
           
           The problem description explicitly includes `motion` predicates that connect different `#oN` configurations to each other and to `v13`/`v15`. For example:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o3)`
           This implies a sequence of movements is possible. The "not reachable" implies the chosen (x,y) for that particular `#oN` is bad.
           
           Let's assume the problem setter expects to use *pre-defined* points (`vXX` that are not base configurations, and not `#oN`) if they fit, but none exist for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, or `above`.
           
           I must provide a plan. The repeated failure to find reachable configurations (especially when making very small moves) suggests that the current state of information or how "reachable" is determined is extremely strict.
           
           Let's try one last attempt with configurations chosen to maximize distance from obstacles `v9`, `v20`, and `v19`, while still being "in range" for imaging and communication. This will imply larger moves, which have also failed for reachability.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 (x=-0.6) & v18 (x=2.1)):** `v12` must be able to see both. This point needs to be far from `x=0` (due to `v20`), and high enough. A point further to the right, `(2.0, 0.0)`, avoids `v20` and `v19`. Range to `v17`: `sqrt((2.0 - (-0.6))^2 + (0.0 - 1.983)^2)` = `sqrt(2.6^2 + 1.983^2)` = `sqrt(6.76 + 3.932)` = `sqrt(10.692)` = `3.27`. This is within 4m range. Range to `v18`: `sqrt((2.0 - 2.102)^2 + (0.0 - 1.769)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.102)^2 + (-1.769)^2)` = `sqrt(0.0104 + 3.129)` = `sqrt(3.1394)` = `1.77`. This is within 4m range.
               - So, `#o3` for `v12` at `(2.0, 0.0)` is promising for range and collision.
           - **Communication (v9 (x=-1.9, y=-2.0 avg)):** `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               - `#o0` for `v12` at `(0.5, -2.5)`. This avoids `v20` (x=0), is low, and within 4m of `v9`. Distance: `sqrt((0.5 - (-1.9))^2 + (-2.5 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(2.4^2 + (-0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(5.76 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(6.01)` = `2.45`. This is within 4m range.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Sampling (v4 (x=-0.5, y=-2.1) & v5 (x=-1.4, y=-0.49)):** `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               - `#o5` for `v14` at `(-0.8, -1.0)`. This position is close to both `v4` and `v5`. `v4` is `(-0.5, -2.1)`, `v5` is `(-1.4, -0.49)`. This pose for `v14` is also near `v14`'s initial pose.
           - **Communication (v9 (x=-1.9, y=-2.0 avg)):**
               - `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This avoids collision with `v9` itself (which was at `(-1.5, -1.5)` previously) and is within range. Distance: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.0 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0.9^2 + 1.0^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 1.0)` = `sqrt(1.81)` = `1.34`. This is within 4m range.
           
           Let's assume these more spatially separated points might be reachable.

           v21: AABB(lower=(-2.55, -2.55, 0.0), upper=(2.55, -2.45, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o5 = (-0.8 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The current feedback reinforces the extreme difficulty in finding collision-free and reachable continuous configurations.
           - `#o0` for `v12` to `v9` is in collision with `v21: AABB(lower=(-2.55, -2.55, 0.0), upper=(2.55, -2.45, 0.1))`. This is an obstacle that spans almost the entire x-axis at `y=-2.5`. This is a critical new constraint.
           - `#o5` for `v14` to `v4` is not reachable.
           - `#o0` for `v14` to `v9` is not reachable.
           
           This newly revealed obstacle `v21` (a long horizontal strip at `y=-2.5`) is extremely important. It means any rover configuration at or near `y=-2.5` is likely to be in collision. My last choice for `v12`'s communication point `(0.5, -2.5)` directly hit this.
           
           Given `v20` (vertical strip at x=0) and `v21` (horizontal strip at y=-2.5), the accessible region for rovers is significantly constrained. The rovers start at `y=-1.75`.
           
           Let's try to map the safe regions more carefully:
           - **`v20`**: `x` must not be between `-0.05` and `0.05`. So `x < -0.05` or `x > 0.05`.
           - **`v21`**: `y` must not be between `-2.55` and `-2.45`. So `y < -2.55` or `y > -2.45`. Since rovers start at `y=-1.75`, moving down beyond `y=-2.45` is likely to be problematic.
           
           **Revisiting Strategy:**
           - **Goal:** Images of v17, v18. Analysis of 2 rocks (type v2, type v6).
           - **Rovers:**
               - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`
               - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           - **Lander `v9`**: `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`. This is around `x=-1.9`, `y=-2.0`. This is very close to `v21`. Communication poses near `v9` must avoid `y=-2.5` and also `v9` itself.
           - **Rocks:**
               - Type v2 (stone): `v1 (1.319, -0.23)`, `v3 (1.686, -1.595)`, `v4 (-0.5, -2.115)`
               - Type v6 (soil): `v5 (-1.401, -0.491)`, `v7 (2.078, -1.786)`, `v8 (-1.818, -0.779)`
           - **Objectives:**
               - `v17 (-0.607, 1.983)`
               - `v18 (2.102, 1.769)`
           
           **Revised plan focusing on avoiding obstacles and ensuring reachability and range:**
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 & v18):** From `(1.0, -1.75)`, `v12` must image `v17` (x=-0.6) and `v18` (x=2.1). This requires a configuration `q` that is `x > 0.05` and `y > -2.45`.
               - Let's try `#o3` for `v12` at `(1.5, 0.5)`.
                   - Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.5 - (-0.6))^2 + (0.5 - 1.983)^2)` = `sqrt(2.1^2 + (-1.483)^2)` = `sqrt(4.41 + 2.199)` = `sqrt(6.609)` = `2.57m` (within 4m).
                   - Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((1.5 - 2.102)^2 + (0.5 - 1.769)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.602)^2 + (-1.269)^2)` = `sqrt(0.362 + 1.610)` = `sqrt(1.972)` = `1.4m` (within 4m).
                   - Collision check: `(1.5, 0.5)` is clear of `v19` (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25), `v20` (x=0), and `v21` (y=-2.5).
           - **Communication (v9):** `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` at `x=-1.9`, `y=-2.0`.
               - `#o0` for `v12` to `v9`: Needs to be `y > -2.45` and avoid `x=0`. Let's try `(0.8, -1.5)`.
                   - Distance to `v9` avg `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt((0.8 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.5 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(2.7^2 + 0.5^2)` = `sqrt(7.29 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(7.54)` = `2.75m` (within 4m).
                   - Collision check: `(0.8, -1.5)` is clear of `v20`, `v21`.
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Sampling:** Pick `v4` (type v2) at `(-0.5, -2.115)` and `v5` (type v6) at `(-1.401, -0.491)`. These are on `v14`'s side.
               - `#o5` for `v14` at `(-1.2, -1.5)`. This is a small movement from `v15` (x=-1.0, y=-1.75). It's `y > -2.45`.
           - **Communication (v9):** `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` at `x=-1.9`, `y=-2.0`.
               - `#o0` for `v14` to `v9`: Needs to be `y > -2.45` and avoid `v9` collision. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is directly above `v9` and not colliding.
                   - Distance to `v9` avg `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.5 - (-2.0))^2)` = `sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.5^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(1.06)` = `1.03m` (within 4m).
                   - Collision check: `(-1.0, -1.5)` is clear of `v20`, `v21`.
           
           This plan attempts to use coordinates that are explicitly outside the known obstacle regions and carefully consider range and reachability from the starting positions. The repeated "not reachable" errors are the most concerning.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The continuous configurations continue to be the main challenge, with *all* proposed `#oN` configurations consistently being reported as "not reachable for robot base". This strongly indicates a fundamental issue with how reachability is being evaluated in this problem, or that the rovers are practically immobile from their starting base configurations in terms of translation. If even minimal movements are not reachable, and the problem expects providing new continuous values for `#oN`, then there's a strong contradiction.
           
           Given that I cannot give up and must provide a plan, I am forced to assume that there *must* be some reachable configurations. Since direct numerical specification of (x,y) coordinates is failing, it suggests that the "reachable" criteria is not simply about collision-free path or distance from current pose, but perhaps about a very specific set of valid configurations or very specific paths (e.g., only moving along cardinal directions, or only rotating). However, without such specific rules, it's impossible to deduce.
           
           My only remaining approach is to try to exploit the existing `motion` predicates in the initial state more directly, rather than just using them as generic movement actions. The motion predicates explicitly connect base configurations (`v13`, `v15`) to `#oN` configurations, and `#oN` configurations to other `#oN` configurations. This implies these specific `#oN` are indeed expected to be used as waypoints.
           
           Let's look at the `motion` predicates that exist for each rover:
           **Rover v12:**
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` (stay in place)
           - `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, v13)`
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           - `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o5)`
           - `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           - `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`
           - `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o0)`
           - `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`
           - `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o3)`
           - `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`
           - `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o5)`
           - `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o3)`
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           - `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, v13)`
           - `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o3)`
           
           **Rover v14:** (similar pattern)
           - `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`
           - `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           - `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, v15)`

           These predicates confirm that the transition between specific named configurations (`v13`, `v15`, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) using `traj #o2` are the expected movements. The problem is that my assigned (x,y) values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are not working. This strongly hints that these specific `#oN` are not meant to be custom coordinates, but specific, *fixed* configurations that are "given" but not defined yet, and the system is rejecting my *attempts* to define them.
           
           I will try defining the `#oN` configurations to be exactly the coordinates of the *targets* they are associated with (for `above`, `imagevisible`, `comvisible`), or a very slight offset if collision happens. This is an extreme measure, as it means the robot base moves *onto* the target. This is usually avoided in robotics for collision. But if *any* other coordinate is not reachable, this is the only remaining option.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Imaging (v17 (x=-0.607, y=1.983) & v18 (x=2.102, y=1.769)):**
               - `#o3` for `v12`: Let's try `(0.7, 1.8)`. This point is outside `v20` (x=0) and `v21` (y=-2.5), and `v19` (0.25, 1.75) to (0.75, 2.25) is an obstacle to avoid. So `(0.7, 1.8)` is in `v19`. I need a point clear of obstacles.
               - Let's try to place `#o3` for `v12` at `(1.0, 1.5)`.
                   - Dist to `v17` `(-0.607, 1.983)`: `sqrt((-0.607-1.0)^2 + (1.983-1.5)^2)` = `sqrt(2.58 + 0.23)` = `sqrt(2.81)` = `1.67m`. (Within 4m)

                   - Collision check for `(1.0, 1.5)`: Clear of `v19`, `v20`, `v21`.
           - **Communication (v9 (x=-1.9, y=-2.0 avg)):**
               - `#o0` for `v12`: Let's try `(0.9, -1.0)`. Clear of `v20`, `v21`. Dist to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9-0.9)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.0))^2)` = `sqrt(7.84+1)` = `sqrt(8.84)` = `2.97m`. (Within 4m)

           - **Communication (v9 (x=-1.9, y=-2.0 avg)):**
               - `#o0` for `v14`: Let's try `(-1.5, -1.8)`. This is outside `v9` and not colliding with `v20`, `v21`. Dist to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9-(-1.5))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.8))^2)` = `sqrt(0.16 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(0.2)` = `0.44m`. (Within 4m)
           
           This is my most refined attempt, trying to leverage positions that are clear of *all known obstacles* and within range, and hoping for reachability.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires receiving images for objectives v17 and v18, and analyses for two rocks (one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil)).
           
           We have two rovers, v12 and v14.
           - Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The situation is becoming increasingly difficult as almost every proposed configuration, even those carefully selected to avoid previously identified obstacles, is either unreachable or collides with newly revealed obstacles (`v22` now). The environment is proving to be extremely dense with obstacles, making free movement very limited.
           
           **New Obstacles:**
           - `v22: AABB(lower=(0.743, 1.457), upper=(0.881, 1.595))`. This obstacle blocks a small area around `(0.8, 1.5)`. My last `#o3` choice `(1.0, 1.5)` collided with this.
           
           **Recurring Problems:**
           - **"Not reachable for robot base"**: This is the most consistent and problematic feedback for both rovers and all types of target configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`). This implies that the rovers are extremely restricted in their translational movement.
           - **Collisions**: `v9` (lander) and `v20` (x=0 strip) and `v21` (y=-2.5 strip) and now `v22` are making most logical positions invalid.
           
           Given the extreme constraints, I will make one final attempt, trying to leverage the *most minimal possible movements* from the base configurations, and only to positions that appear to be absolutely clear of *all* known obstacles based on their AABBs. If even these don't work, then the problem as presented might be unsolvable with the implied movement model.
           
           **Rover v12 (at v13: 1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Obstacle context**: `v20 (x=0)`, `v21 (y=-2.5)`, `v19 (0.25,1.75)-(0.75,2.25)`, `v22 (0.743,1.457)-(0.881,1.595)`.
           - **Imaging (v17 (-0.6, 1.98) & v18 (2.1, 1.76)):**
               - To avoid all positive-x obstacles (`v19`, `v22`), and be able to see `v17` (negative x) and `v18` (positive x), `v12` would need to be in a very open, central area (but `v20` blocks `x=0`).
               - The area `x > 0.881` and `y > 1.595` is clear for `v12` to move up.
               - Let's try `#o3` for `v12` at `(1.0, 2.0)`.
                   - Dist to `v17`: `sqrt((-0.6-1.0)^2 + (1.98-2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(2.56 + 0.0004)` = `1.6m`. (Within 4m)
                   - Dist to `v18`: `sqrt((2.1-1.0)^2 + (1.76-2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.21 + 0.057)` = `1.12m`. (Within 4m)
                   - Collision: `(1.0, 2.0)` is clear of `v19`, `v20`, `v21`, `v22`.
           - **Communication (v9 (-1.9, -2.0 avg)):**
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v12` at `(1.0, -1.0)`. This is a vertical movement from `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`, avoids `v20`, `v21`.
                   - Dist to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9-1.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.0))^2)` = `sqrt(8.41 + 1)` = `3.06m`. (Within 4m)
           
           **Rover v14 (at v15: -1.0, -1.75):**
           - **Obstacle context**: `v20 (x=0)`, `v21 (y=-2.5)`. `v9` is also an obstacle.
           - **Sampling (v4 (-0.5, -2.1) & v5 (-1.4, -0.49)):**
               - Let's try `#o5` for `v14` at `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This is a vertical movement from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Clear of `v20`, `v21`, `v9`.
           - **Communication (v9 (-1.9, -2.0 avg)):**
               - Let's try `#o0` for `v14` at `(-1.8, -1.7)`. This is just outside `v9`'s `upper=(-1.395, -1.654)` and clear of other obstacles. It's a very minimal movement from `v15` in y, and slightly in x.
                   - Dist to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.8))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.7))^2)` = `sqrt(0.01 + 0.09)` = `0.31m`. (Within 4m)
           
           This plan minimizes translation where possible, and when translation is needed, it explicitly places the rover outside all known obstacle AABBs and within range. This is the best I can do without more information on the exact robot kinematics or a visual representation of the environment.

           - Rover v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           All attempts to specify new continuous configurations have resulted in "not reachable for robot base" or "in collision" errors. This is a very challenging situation, as it implies an extremely restricted movement model or a heavily occluded environment not fully described by the given AABBs. The last attempt for `v14` to communicate with `v9` `(-1.8, -1.7)` was again in collision with `v9` itself, meaning even subtle offsets around the lander's bounding box are causing issues.
           
           Given the consistent failure of all my attempts to define the `#oN` continuous configurations with (x,y) values, I must conclude that the problem, as presented and with the implicit evaluation of "reachable", is currently unsolvable by generating new (x,y) coordinates. The feedback indicates that *any* proposed non-base configuration, even minimal movements, is not reachable. This effectively renders the rovers immobile or severely constrained in a way I cannot deduce from the information provided.
           
           If the rovers cannot move to new configurations for imaging, sampling, or communication, then the `take_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_image`/`send_analysis` actions cannot be performed because their preconditions require the rover to be at a specific (reachable and valid) configuration (the `?q` argument, which is always an `#oN` for these actions in the initial state).
           
           Therefore, based on the persistent feedback that all proposed continuous values for the `#oN` configurations are either not reachable or in collision, and the problem requires providing these values for the plan, I cannot construct a valid plan that achieves the goal. The preconditions for essential actions involving these `#oN` configurations cannot be satisfied.
