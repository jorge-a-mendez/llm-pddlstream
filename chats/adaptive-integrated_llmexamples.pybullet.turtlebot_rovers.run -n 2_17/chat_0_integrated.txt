           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires several conditions to be met, including having images received for objectives v17 and v18 (with mode v11), and analyses received for various rocks (v3, v4, v8, v5, v7, v1). The initial state provides two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10. Both rovers are at specific configurations, v13 and v15 respectively. The camera v10 supports mode v11.
           
           Looking at the conditions for `new-axiom@0()`, we need:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for various stone types.
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for various soil types.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve these:
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`:
           The `send_image` action can achieve this. It requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`.
           To achieve `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`:
           The `take_image` action can achieve this. It requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and not `blocked`.
           To achieve `calibrated(?c, ?v)`:
           The `calibrate` action can achieve this. It requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)`:
           The `send_analysis` action can achieve this. It requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and not `blocked`.
           To achieve `analyzed(?v, ?r)`:
           The `sample_rock` action can achieve this. It requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, and `free`.
           
           From the initial state, we have rovers v12 and v14, both equipped with camera v10 and having a free store v16. Both can communicate with lander v9 from configuration #o0. Both can take images of v17 and v18 from configuration #o3. Both are also above several rocks (v3, v4, v1, v7, v5, v8) from configuration #o5.
           
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrating the camera for each rover.
           2. Taking images of both objectives (v17 and v18) by at least one rover.
           3. Sending those images to the lander.
           4. Sampling all specified rocks (v3, v4, v8, v5, v7, v1) by at least one rover.
           5. Sending the analysis of these rocks to the lander.
           
           Let's use rover v12 for image tasks and rover v14 for analysis tasks initially, as they both have free stores.
           We can use v12 for objectives v17 and v18:
           - Calibrate v10 on v12 using v17 or v18 from #o3.
           - Take image of v17 with v12, v10, v11 from #o3.
           - Take image of v18 with v12, v10, v11 from #o3.
           - Send images of v17 and v18 from v12 at #o0 to v9.
           
           We can use v14 for rock analysis:
           - Sample all rocks (v3, v4, v1, v7, v5, v8) with v14 from #o5. This means sampling them one by one. Since the rover has only one store, it needs to sample one, send its analysis, drop the rock, and then sample the next.
           - Send analysis for each rock from v14 at #o0 to v9.
           
           Let's go step by step with v12 and v14 to achieve the goals. The order of rock sampling can be arbitrary.
           Note that the `new-axiom@0` lists specific rocks v3, v4, v8, v5, v7, v1 and types v2 (stone) and v6 (soil).
           
           The `new-axiom@0` is an "OR" of a set of conditions that can be met, and since the conditions in the provided `new-axiom@0` for this domain are just a conjunction of individual atoms like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` of specific items, we need to ensure all of them are met.
           
           Rocks: v3 (type v2), v4 (type v2), v8 (type v6), v5 (type v6), v7 (type v6), v1 (type v2).
           Objectives: v17, v18.
           
           Let's assume a strategy where rover v12 handles imaging and rover v14 handles sampling and analysis.
           
           1. **Imaging with v12**:
              - Calibrate v10 on v12 using an objective (e.g., v17) from config #o3.
              - Take image of v17 with v12.
              - Send image of v17.
              - The camera is no longer calibrated after taking an image. So we need to recalibrate.
              - Calibrate v10 on v12 using an objective (e.g., v18) from config #o3.
              - Take image of v18 with v12.
              - Send image of v18.
           
           2. **Sampling and Analysis with v14**:
              - Sample rock v3 with v14 from #o5.
              - Send analysis of v3 with v14 from #o0.
              - Drop rock from v14's store.
              - Sample rock v4 with v14 from #o5.
              - Send analysis of v4 with v14 from #o0.
              - Drop rock from v14's store.
              - Sample rock v8 with v14 from #o5.
              - Send analysis of v8 with v14 from #o0.
              - Drop rock from v14's store.
              - Sample rock v5 with v14 from #o5.
              - Send analysis of v5 with v14 from #o0.
              - Drop rock from v14's store.
              - Sample rock v7 with v14 from #o5.
              - Send analysis of v7 with v14 from #o0.
              - Drop rock from v14's store.
              - Sample rock v1 with v14 from #o5.
              - Send analysis of v1 with v14 from #o0.
              - Drop rock from v14's store (optional, but cleans up state).
           
           This sequence covers all the necessary conditions for `new-axiom@0()`. Since there are no motion actions available to change configurations beyond the provided ones, we must assume that the rovers are already in the necessary configurations for each action when they need to be, or that the configurations #o0, #o3, #o5 are reachable from v13 and v15 respectively for each rover without explicit `move` actions if they are the continuous parameters for that rover. Given that `conf(rover, #oX)` is in the initial state, it suggests these configurations are where the rover *can* be. However, `atconf` is only set for v13 and v15 initially. If #o0, #o3, #o5 are different from v13 and v15, and no `move` action for them is provided, the problem cannot be solved.
           The initial state explicitly states `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The provided configurations for the continuous parameters are `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`, and similarly for v14. The problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies that these `#oX` configurations are specific states for the rover, not just *any* configuration.
           However, there are no `move` actions to these `#oX` configurations listed in the available action instances. The only `move` actions provided are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are self-moves. This means the rovers are assumed to be *at* `v13` and `v15` respectively throughout the task, and any action requiring a different configuration like `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` cannot be performed unless `v13` (for v12) or `v15` (for v14) is *equivalent* to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. This is highly unlikely given the problem setup where `#oX` represents a *continuous parameter* that needs to be computed.
           
           The problem statement also clarifies: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies that the rover *can* be at #o0, #o3, #o5, and that these are specific configurations.
           
           However, the `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicate is a strict requirement for most actions. For example, `take_image` requires `atconf(?v, ?q)`, where `?q` is the configuration for `imagevisible`. If `?q` is `#o3`, then `atconf(v12, #o3)` must be true. Currently, only `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true. Without a way to change the `atconf` state to `#o3`, `#o5`, or `#o0`, the actions cannot be executed. The `move` actions listed don't change the configuration to these continuous parameters.
           
           Therefore, given the available action instances, the goal is not achievable because the rovers cannot reach the necessary configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) to perform `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`.
           
           The problem specifies: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that we cannot simply assume a `move` to `#o3` is possible if it's not explicitly listed.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
