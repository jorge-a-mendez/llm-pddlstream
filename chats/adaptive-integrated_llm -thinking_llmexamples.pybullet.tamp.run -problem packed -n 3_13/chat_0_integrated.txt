User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.216, -0.402, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.341, 0.94).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.167, -0.452), (0.266, -0.353)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.131, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.33).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.084, -0.389), (-0.006, -0.312)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.35, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.665, 0.747).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.18, 0.336), (-0.082, 0.435)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom graspable(v8)

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all onto the surface `v16`.  Simple enough conceptually – just move them there.  First, let's look at the current state. Right now, all three objects are supported by `v11`, meaning they are currently *on* `v11`.  My plan needs to get them from `v11` to `v16`.
           
           The obvious strategy is to pick up each object, and then place them on the target surface. I would need to do a pick-and-place operation three times. But there is a catch. The problem provides a *valid action instances* list: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That's it! That is the only action I am allowed to use. I can only move the base (v3).  No picking or placing allowed.
           
           Then, there's the problem statement: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Clearly, I need to pick and place to move the objects to their goal location, and these are not permitted. I have to deduce that, given the allowed actions, and the initial state, the given goal is unreachable.
