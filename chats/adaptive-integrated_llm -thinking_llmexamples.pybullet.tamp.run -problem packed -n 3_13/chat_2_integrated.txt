User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.18, 0.336), (-0.082, 0.435)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.167, -0.452), (0.266, -0.353)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.131, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.33).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.084, -0.389), (-0.006, -0.312)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.216, -0.402, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.341, 0.94).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.35, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.665, 0.747).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal: get these three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all *on* `v16`. They're currently on `v11`, which isn't the final destination. The robot arm, `v4`, is empty, and its base is at `v3`.
           
           Essentially, I need to pick each object from `v11`, move it to the robot arm, and then place it *on* `v16`. Since all the objects are graspable and stackable, this should be straightforward. I'm going to break it down into these sub-goals:
           
           1.  Get `v8` onto `v16`.
           2.  Get `v12` onto `v16`.
           3.  Get `v14` onto `v16`.
           
           My strategy will be to sequentially pick and place: pick `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) and place it on `v16`, then pick `v12` from `v13` and place it on `v16`, and finally pick `v14` from `v15` and place it on `v16`.
           
           All the kinematic information I need for the robot to move and manipulate the objects is available, thanks to the `#o3` base configuration which will be used as a constant during pick/place actions and is available in the available actions.
           
           To start, I must move the base from `v3` to `#o3`. Then, I'll use the *pick* and *place* operations for all three objects. All of the actions, after the base is moved, use `#o3` and can be carried out from a single base location.
           
           Here's the detailed sequence of actions:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** Move the robot's base from its current location, `v3`, to the target configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick `v8`:** The robot arm (`v4`) will pick up `v8` from pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place `v8`:** The robot arm (`v4`) will place `v8` *on* `v16` at position `#o2`. I'll need to specify a precise location (x, y, z, theta) for this `#o2` pose on `v16`. The plan specifies that I need to provide `#o2` unique values for each object on the place action.
           4.  **Pick `v12`:** The robot arm will pick up `v12` from pose `v13`.
           5.  **Place `v12`:** The robot arm will place `v12` on `v16` at a new pose called `#o2` on `v16`. This pose will have different coordinates compared to `#o2` for `v8`.
           6.  **Pick `v14`:** The robot arm will pick up `v14` from pose `v15`.
           7.  **Place `v14`:** The robot arm will place `v14` on `v16` at a different `#o2` location (x, y, z, theta) on `v16`.
           
           Now for those key `#o2` pose coordinates *on* `v16`. I have to pick these to prevent collisions. I'll place these objects roughly in a line centered on `v16`. Specifically, I'm thinking:
           
           *   **`v8` on `v16`:**  x = -0.09, y = 0.0, z = 0.781 (the height I'm assuming for this task), theta = 0.0
           *   **`v12` on `v16`:** x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0
           *   **`v14` on `v16`:** x = 0.09, y = 0.0, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0
           
           The plan assumes that these are stable non-colliding positions for the objects. I need to output these poses in a format required by the planner with a `#o2` associated with each object placement (three lines total).
