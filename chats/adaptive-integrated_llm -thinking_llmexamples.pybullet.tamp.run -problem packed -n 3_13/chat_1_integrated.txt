User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.18, 0.336), (-0.082, 0.435)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.167, -0.452), (0.266, -0.353)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.131, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.33).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.084, -0.389), (-0.006, -0.312)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.216, -0.402, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.341, 0.94).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.35, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.665, 0.747).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to tackle this problem, as I see it:**
           
           My main goal is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all on top of object v16. Currently, they're sitting on v11.  The tools I have are a robot with two arms (v4 and v6), a few actions like picking and placing, and the ability to move the robot's base.  `Clean` and `Cook` actions are irrelevant.
           
           The key is the `on` predicate: `on(object, v16)` basically means that object must be *supported* by v16.  This also depends on a pose where the supported predicate exists.  I've got the initial state information.
           
           I'll need to figure out a plan that involves picking up each object from its current location (v11) and placing it onto v16.  The 'kin' facts, about which robot arm can do what, are important here. The initial state includes support facts for `v8, v12, v14`. There are specific poses #o2 where they can be placed.
           
           So, here's the game plan:  For each object (v8, v12, v14), use one robot arm (v4 appears to be the most relevant based on the given `kin` facts) to `pick` it up from its current location, and then use the `place` action to put it at one of those poses.  Repeat for each object.
           
           I realize that to place objects on the surface `v16` the pose `#o2` must be provided.  The text suggests I choose different poses on `v16` for each object to prevent collisions since the problem statement has specified that `#o2` is meant to be a named value.
           
           I am given AABB extents for the objects, which is really just an approximation of object size and pose.  Given that I need to provide `#o2` for each object, I've got to carefully select values.
           
           Here is the approach I chose. For `v8`: The AABB is strange as the coordinates are not centered. Assuming the origin is the actual center, and not the coordinate provided in the initial state, I place `v8` so that its center is at (-0.08, 0, 0.781, 0).
           The same applies for the others: I'll use the AABB to inform positioning:
           v12 is at (0.08, 0, 0.781, 0).
           v14 is at (0, 0.08, 0.781, 0). This placement maintains relative separation and is valid, and is likely to be stable, as long as this AABB description is correct and the height and orientation is also appropriate.
           
           The action sequence will be:
           1.  Pick v8 from v9. Place v8 at (#o2 v8 v16): (-0.08 0 0.781 0)
           2.  Pick v12 from v13. Place v12 at (#o2 v12 v16): (0.08 0 0.781 0)
           3.  Pick v14 from v15. Place v14 at (#o2 v14 v16): (0 0.08 0.781 0)
           
           All the poses for picking are already defined in the problem description. There is no other base configuration to use. It doesn't look like I'll need to use any movement actions, since the goal is already described with initial objects already at their desired poses, relative to one another. The pick and place are 1 unit cost each. Thus the total cost is 6 units.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the proposed plan, and it's a non-starter. The planning framework has provided me a very limited action space: I can only use `move_base`, and even then, I can only move the base from `v3` to `v3` – basically, a null operation. This is essentially useless for manipulating objects.
           
           The goal is pretty straightforward: I need to have three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) all stacked on `v16`. My initial state is defined in terms of `atpose` and `supported` predicates, which effectively means the three objects are currently *on* `v11`.
           
           The problem is, to get from my initial state to the desired goal state, I *absolutely* need `pick` and `place` actions – some way to physically move the objects from `v11` to `v16`. But, the allowed actions only include this pointless `move_base` operation.
           
           Given this restriction, there's no way to reach the goal. It's simply unreachable within the current action space. I need a more complete set of manipulation primitives to even *begin* to consider a valid plan.
