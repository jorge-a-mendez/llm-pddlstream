User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.072, -0.318, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.631, 0.775).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.14, -0.365), (-0.063, -0.288)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.174, -0.501), (0.271, -0.404)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, -0.565), (-0.154, -0.466)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.017, 0.339), (0.116, 0.437)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.031, -0.359), (0.113, -0.276)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.101, -0.327, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.052).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.223, -0.453, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.287, 0.958).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.203, -0.515, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.434, 0.901).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.066, 0.388, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.942, 0.336).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current positions on table v11 onto surface v20. The key constraint is to place them in specific poses, where the same symbolic pose (#o2) needs to be mapped to distinct continuous values for each object on v20.  I've got the initial and goal states, and it's clear I can't move the robot's base. The `kin` predicates will be important for making sure my pick and place actions are valid, and my plan will leverage the `v4` arm to handle these actions.
           
           First, I need to understand this `#o2` pose on v20. I'm inferring from the description that `#o2` has a consistent meaning for each object (a supporting pose on the table) but a different continuous value for each object. The surface `v20` has dimensions of approximately 0.27m x 0.27m. My primary goal is to avoid collisions both during the arm trajectories and final poses, so I need to choose these positions carefully. The objects themselves are small (approximately 0.1m in width/depth).  
           
           I'll break the goal down: pick each object, move it to a unique spot on v20 and place it there. With the objects being about 0.1m, I'll need some space to avoid overlap; it looks like a cross configuration (object at center, 4 at +/- positions on x and y axes) will work.  The robot's base will stay fixed at location `v3` (-1,0,0) as this seems to be the only `basemotion` possible.
           
           Therefore, for safety, I've got to carefully plan the final positions based on the size of v20 and the objects. After some analysis of space, I've devised the following pose locations for the five objects:
           
           -   `v8`: (0.0, 0.0, 0.801, 0.0)
           -   `v12`: (0.07, 0.0, 0.801, 0.0)
           -   `v14`: (-0.07, 0.0, 0.801, 0.0)
           -   `v16`: (0.0, 0.07, 0.801, 0.0)
           -   `v18`: (0.0, -0.07, 0.801, 0.0)
           
           So, here's the overall plan:
           
           1.  Pick v8 (at location `v9`), and place it at (0.0, 0.0, 0.801, 0.0) on v20.
           2.  Pick v12 (at location `v13`), and place it at (0.07, 0.0, 0.801, 0.0) on v20.
           3.  Pick v14 (at location `v15`), and place it at (-0.07, 0.0, 0.801, 0.0) on v20.
           4.  Pick v16 (at location `v17`), and place it at (0.0, 0.07, 0.801, 0.0) on v20.
           5.  Pick v18 (at location `v19`), and place it at (0.0, -0.07, 0.801, 0.0) on v20.
           
           I've made sure to factor in object dimensions and potential overlaps when defining the final poses. Each object will get its spot with the specified continuous position while using the same symbolic `#o2`. With these coordinates, I can ensure collision-free motion and placements, avoiding any unsafe trajectories. I've double-checked the preconditions for the actions and everything looks good!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Assessment of the Provided Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the plan, and it's pretty clear we have a problem. The user's plan was rejected, and I see why: it's fundamentally flawed. The only valid action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Now, being a move from a location to itself, v3 to v3, this effectively does *nothing*. We're stuck in place, which means we can't interact with the environment at all.
           
           The goal is to move five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – onto the surface v20. To do that, we absolutely need `pick` and `place` actions. Without those, we can't manipulate the objects and bring them to the intended location. I went through the entire list of valid actions, hoping to see a `pick` or a `place` instance and I found nothing.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of the provided valid actions, the goal is simply unachievable. There's no way to physically complete the task with the tools we've been given. I'll need to clearly communicate that and explain the lack of necessary action instances that are required for completing the task.
