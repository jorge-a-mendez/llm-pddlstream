           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to get an object, specifically `?green` (let's say `v12` for now), onto another object, specifically `v18`. I know `v12` is `type(v17)` from the initial state, so that's easy.  The tricky part is getting it *on* `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the `on` axiom reveals that I need to find a pose (`?p`) where `v12` is both `supported` by `v18` and `atpose` in that pose.  Looking at the initial state, I see that `v12` is *already* `type(v17)` and `stackable` on `v18`. I also see that `v12` is *already* at a pose, but it's currently on `v14`.  I need to get it onto `v18`.
           
           Digging deeper into the facts, I find a crucial piece of information:  `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that `v12` *can* be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`. I need to get `v12` *to* that pose.
           
           Since my robot arm (`v4`) is currently hand-empty and at base configuration `v3`, I can use the actions available.  I can *pick* up `v12` from its current pose `v13` (where it is on `v14`) and *place* it at the target pose `#o2` on `v18`. However, the pick action needs me to be at base configuration `#o3`.
           
           So, here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** I need to use a `move_base` action to get from the initial `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(#o3)`. This will satisfy the base configuration precondition of the pick action, so I need to execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           
           2.  **Pick up the object:** I will use the `pick` action to grasp the object `v12`. Specifically, `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` which will lift `v12` from the previous configuration. The pick effect will set `canmove()` to true. This removes it from `v14` and now the robot has a firm grasp.
           
           3.  **Place the object:** Finally, I'll use the `place` action to place `v12` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`, by using `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           This sequence of actions should achieve my goal: `on(v12, v18)` and therefore satisfy the desired axiom. The system is well-set to execute this plan.
