(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Small Square Object**
           
           My task is to generate 50 stable placements for a small square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a defined rectangular surface (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since the surface is larger than the object, there is ample space to place the object in various configurations.  The criteria for a valid placement are: (1) complete containment within the surface bounds, (2) no collisions with obstacles (which don't yet exist), and (3) no collisions with previously placed objects (no objects placed yet).
           
           To ensure a diverse set of placements, I will vary the x, y coordinates and the rotation angle (theta). For this nearly square object, rotations of 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 are considered stable (bounding box stays relatively similar to an upright rectangle). Rotations of π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, and 7π/4 (or combinations thereof) are also considered stable, but with a different effective bounding box.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Placement Distribution:** I'll strategically arrange the placements. I'll split the valid area into two grids, corresponding to `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.
           2.  **theta = 0 Placements:**  I will create a 7x4 grid of x and y coordinates that places the object in the valid range of x and y. These valid ranges depend on the object's dimensions relative to the surface's boundaries. The valid x range is [4.235, 4.765] and the valid y range is [-0.565, -0.035]. The 28 placements within the 7x4 grid are created using a formula that evenly spaces the object.
           3.  **theta = pi/4 Placements:** I will also create a grid of 7x3 coordinates but with a slightly smaller valid area that shifts and resizes. The bounding box has a length that is multiplied by `sqrt(2)`. The effective `x` range for rotations of 45 degrees becomes [4.249, 4.751] and y becomes [-0.551, -0.050]. The goal is an even distribution within the available space.
           4.  **Final Placement:**  This gets me to 49 positions. For the 50th placement, I'll put an upright square with `theta = pi/2` at the top left corner of the rectangular area in order to add a final configuration and complete the placement list.
           
           This approach will generate a variety of stable configurations, ensuring good coverage of the surface.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 10**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for a new object, ID 10, on a given surface. This is challenging because I need to avoid overlapping with previously placed objects, specifically those with ID 5. These existing objects occupy specific regions, and I have their precise locations and dimensions, as well as the dimensions of ID 10 (which is slightly larger and square-shaped at 0.093 x 0.093). The available surface is a rectangle with extents ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           To achieve this, I'll employ a multi-pronged approach. First, I will create a system for AABB collision detection to prevent ID 10 objects from overlapping with the objects ID 5. This involves calculating the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each potential placement of ID 10 at various rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4).
           
           The initial approach is to create a fine-grained grid across the surface, trying object locations at multiple orientations. These objects must satisfy both surface-boundary constraints and the collision avoidance constraints. After filtering with my collision detection system to remove non-viable object placements, I'll proceed with alternative methods of filling space. I have considered a dense grid (for theta=0, pi/2), which should quickly find placements that are clear of obstacles. Also, the AABB calculations for the cases with 0, pi/2 and pi/4 rotations are well-established. If the number of placements is still less than 50, I will densify the placement attempts.
