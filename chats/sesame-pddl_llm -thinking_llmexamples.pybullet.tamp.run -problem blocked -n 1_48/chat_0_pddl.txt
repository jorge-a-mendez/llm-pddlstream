(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get an object of a certain type *on* another object (specifically, `v18`).  We're given the axiom defining "on" which boils down to needing an object to be *supported* in a particular pose (`#o2`) and *at* that pose.  Looking at the initial state, we see we have two potential objects, `v8` and `v12`, that fit the bill. Both are the correct type and are `stackable` on `v18`, and supported on `v18` at pose `#o2`.  So, we need to pick either `v8` or `v12` and place it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Let's start with `v8`.  `v8` is currently *atpose* `v9`.  To get it to our target state of *atpose* `#o2`, we'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions. The plan looks like this: first *move_base* to `bconf #o3`. Then *pick* `v8` from pose `v9`, and finally, *place* `v8` at pose `#o2`.
           
           The available actions seem to be in place to make this a feasible solution.  We have the `move_base` action available to maneuver the robot's base to the configuration, `bconf #o3`. This precondition for the *pick* and *place* action, as they both have a `kin` precondition which means the robot's kinematics must be valid for picking and placing at a certain base configuration. After the *move_base*, the robot will be able to perform a *pick* and *place* action.
           
           Looking at the preconditions for `pick`, we need to ensure the hand is empty (`handempty`), the object is at the correct pose, and that no `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj` scenarios arise. The `place` action has similar safety checks and requires that we have the object in the grasp position which we are able to provide after the *pick* action.
           
           I have double checked the logic and found that the logic is correct and sound.
           Let's confirm the plan with the preconditions and effects to be sure:
           1.  **Move Base:**  We need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.  This action sets `atbconf(#o3)` and makes `canmove()` false.
           2.  **Pick:**  We'll pick up `v8` from `v9`.  The `move_base` has put the robot in the correct pose for this, and our hand is empty. The `pick` action updates the arm and base states. `canmove()` becomes true again because we've completed a full move.
           3.  **Place:**  We'll place `v8` onto `v18` at `#o2`.  This sets the robot to the appropriate grasp condition.
           
           It looks like the goal is achievable with a three step plan.
