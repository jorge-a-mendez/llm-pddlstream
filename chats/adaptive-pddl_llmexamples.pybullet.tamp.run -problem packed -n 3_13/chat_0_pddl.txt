User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14) that are currently on object v11. The goal is to move all these objects (v8, v12, v14) onto object v16. We are given the initial poses of these objects (v8 at v9, v12 at v13, v14 at v15), and information about what they are supported by. We also know that v8, v12, and v14 are graspable, and that v16 is a stackable surface for all of them.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the robot's base from configuration v3 to v3, using trajectory #o0. It does not allow for any manipulation of objects (picking or placing) or interaction with the environment (cleaning or cooking). Since the goal requires changing the location of objects (moving them onto v16), and the only available action does not allow for such manipulation, the goal is unachievable with the given allowed actions.
           
           The actions `pick` and `place` are necessary to move objects, but no instances of these actions are provided in the allowed action list.
