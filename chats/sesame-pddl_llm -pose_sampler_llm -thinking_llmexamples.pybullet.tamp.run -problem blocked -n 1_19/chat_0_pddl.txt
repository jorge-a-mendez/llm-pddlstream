           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The goal is to place an object, identified as ID 5 with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, stably on a surface, specifically surface 0 defined by the bounds `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  I need to find 50 stable placements, where a stable placement means the object is entirely within the surface's bounds and its center is appropriately positioned.  Because the object is a square, the orientation (theta) doesn't change the bounding box for axis-aligned placement, so I'll largely use a theta of 0.  Since the dimensions are equal, the effective bounding box remains the same regardless of orientation.
           
           I've calculated that the valid x-range for the object's center is [4.235, 4.765] and the valid y-range is [-0.565, -0.035]. The surface is pretty spacious compared to the object, with a width and height of 0.6.  Given the size of the object (0.07 x 0.07), a grid approach seems ideal.
           
           I'm considering a grid approach. I'll step through potential x-values and y-values, spaced by 0.07 (the object's size).  I've quickly calculated that with the given ranges, I can potentially fit approximately 8 full objects along both x and y.  Specifically, the x-values will be: 4.235, 4.305, 4.375, 4.445, 4.515, 4.585, 4.655, 4.725. The y-values will be: -0.565, -0.495, -0.425, -0.355, -0.285, -0.215, -0.145, -0.075.  This yields a grid of 8 x 8, or 64 positions, more than enough for the 50 I need.  I'll start building the placement list now, using these coordinates. I will set `surf_idx = 0` and `theta = 0` for all placements.
