           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Planning for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've quickly identified as achieving `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state provides `type(v12, v17)`, meaning `v12` is a strong candidate for `?green`.  Now, the focus shifts to getting `v12` positioned on `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see `atpose(v12, v13)` and a crucial fact: `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This strongly suggests that I can achieve `on(v12, v18)` if `v12` is *at* `#o2`.
           
           Since I know `atpose(v12, v13)` is true initially, and I want `atpose(v12, #o2)`, this screams "pick-and-place" to me. I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions appropriately.
           
           Let's look at the available actions:
           *   `pick v4 v12 v13 ...`: Yes, this is perfect. It will pick v12 from its current pose v13.
           *   `place v4 v12 #o2 ...`: And here's the corresponding place action, placing v12 at the desired pose #o2.
           
           So, the plan unfolds as follows:
           
           1.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 ...)**
           2.  **(place v4 v12 #o2 ...)**
           
           Now I must meticulously verify the preconditions and postconditions. `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, and the `NegatedAtom` are all the conditions to consider. I assume an `atbconf` of `#o3`.
           
           *   **For the Pick action:** Everything checks out.
           *   **For the Place Action:** These conditions also look good.
           
           After the `place` action, the target state is reached: `atpose(v12, #o2)`, which combined with the initial state `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` directly satisfies `on(v12, v18)`. And of course `type(v12, v17)`.
           
           The state post `place`, satisfies the goal `new-axiom@0()`
           
           I considered a `move_base` action, as well, but it seems unnecessary. `canmove()` is re-asserted by `pick` and `place` and I don't see any need to move the base in this simple scenario.
           
           **Final Plan:**
           
           1.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           2.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan's Failure**
           
           Okay, the previous plan failed because `atbconf(#o3)` wasn't satisfied. Time to dissect this. I need to go back to the beginning. Looking at the initial state and the `move_base` action... the `bconf(#o3)` fact is present, but crucially, there's no explicit `atbconf` fact. That’s a red flag.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions both *need* `atbconf(?q)`, and in the previous plan, `?q` was `#o3`.  So, without `atbconf(#o3)` in the initial state, the `pick` action's precondition was immediately violated. Simple.
           
           Now, to get `atbconf(#o3)` true, I'd need an action that sets it.  The only candidate is `move_base`: `move_base(?q1, ?q2, ?t)`.  The precondition is `atbconf(?q1)`, and the effect is `atbconf(?q2)` while *negating* `atbconf(?q1)`. So, `move_base` can *maintain* `atbconf`, but it's not designed to *achieve* it.
           
           The available instance is `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`. This moves the base *from* `#o3` *to* `#o3`, using trajectory `#o0`.  However, it *requires* `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition.  If it isn't true *initially*, it can't be used to *make* it true.  That’s the core of the problem.
           
           Essentially, if `atbconf(#o3)` isn't there in the initial state, and nothing can *make* it true (based on the available actions), then any action requiring it, like `pick` and `place`, is completely blocked.
           
           Let's double-check the PDDL. Yep, `atbconf` is just a simple predicate. No axioms to magically infer it. If it's missing from the initial state, it's *false* by the problem definition. There's no way around it.  The given `basemotion` instance, `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`, just confirms that the base's motion is from and to the same configuration; it requires the base to be there to begin with.
           
           So, here's the critical issue:  If we don't know the initial base configuration, and we can't get the base to the required configuration (`#o3`), then no `pick` or `place` action can work.  That completely blocks any attempt to change the object's position.
           
           If `pick` and `place` are impossible, then I can't move `v12`.  The goal `on(v12, v18)` requires `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Currently, I have `atpose(v12, v13)`. I can’t get to the goal *without* `pick` and `place`. Therefore,  `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           Conclusion:  The goal is fundamentally unattainable with the given initial state and action instances. Because `atbconf(#o3)` is not present in the initial state, it’s false. And since `move_base` *needs* it to already be true, and nothing can make it true, no pick or place action can succeed. I can't move the object, and therefore, the goal is impossible.
