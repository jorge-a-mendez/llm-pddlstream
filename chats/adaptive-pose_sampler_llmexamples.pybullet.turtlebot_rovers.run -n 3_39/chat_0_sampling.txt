Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square (obstacles 0-4). There's a vertical obstacle (5) in the middle, splitting the space into two halves. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around, some of them are squares and some are thin rectangles. Given the target at (0.0, 0.0), which is exactly on top of obstacle 5, I will propose positions that try to get close to the target from various directions, avoiding the central obstacle and other known obstacles. Since the target is at (0,0), which is also directly on obstacle 5, I will need to be careful to propose positions that are on either side of obstacle 5, very close to (0,0) but not at (0,0). I will try to place the robot on either side of obstacle 5, at y=0, and then try a position further away in one of the corners.

Model:     My previous attempts failed because the proposed positions (0.1, 0.0) and (-0.1, 0.0) collided with obstacle 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This indicates that the target point, (-0.2966, 2.1358), is on the left side of the central obstacle, and my proposed positions were too far from the target and directly on the obstacle. The target is actually in the upper-left quadrant. I need to propose positions that are on the same side of obstacle 5 as the target, and closer to the target. I will aim for positions within a 2-unit radius of (-0.2966, 2.1358), ensuring they are to the left of x = -0.05. I will also consider the surrounding obstacles in that region. Specifically, obstacles 8, 10, 11, 19, 21 are in the upper left quadrant.

Model:     The target point is now (-2.064, 1.990). My previous positions for the *new* target point failed due to no line of sight or not being reachable. The positions (-0.3, 1.0) and (-1.5, 2.0) had no line of sight, which suggests obstacles between them and the target. The position (-2.0, 1.0) was "not reachable", which likely means it's outside the allowed x/y range or very close to the boundary. Looking at the fixed obstacles, ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) is the left wall, and there are obstacles like 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and 21: ((-2.109, 1.945), (-2.019, 2.035)) very close to the target point. The target is effectively *inside* obstacle 8, or very close to its edge. It is also inside the bounding box of 21. This means I need to be careful to select points that are not obstructed by these.
           
           Given the new target at (-2.064, 1.990), I need to find positions within 2 units. Since the target is very close to obstacle 21 and within obstacle 8, I should try to place the robot in open spaces around this area. I'll try to place it to the right of the target, and slightly above or below.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point remains at (-2.064, 1.990). All my previous attempts for this target have failed.
           (-0.3, 1.0) and (-1.5, 2.0) failed due to no line of sight. This implies there are obstacles blocking views from these positions.
           (-2.0, 1.0) and (-1.0, 1.99) were "not reachable". This is surprising given they are within the general x,y bounds. It might mean they are too close to existing obstacles.
           
           Let's re-examine the target and its surroundings.
           Target: (-2.064, 1.990)
           Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - the target is inside this obstacle.
           Obstacle 21: ((-2.109, 1.945), (-2.019, 2.035)) - the target is also inside this obstacle.
           
           The fact that the target is *inside* a fixed obstacle is a critical piece of information. This means any position *must* have line of sight to a point *within* that obstacle. It's possible that the target is meant to be viewed from *outside* these obstacles, perhaps through a gap. The "not reachable" might also be a clue that the region immediately around the target is very constrained.
           
           Since the target is within 8 and 21, I need to place the robot in a location where it can "see" into these obstacles, or rather, see the specified target point *within* these obstacles. My previous attempts were to the right and slightly below. Let's try to approach from slightly different angles. I need to be careful to not collide with obstacles 4 (left wall), 6, 8, 11, 21.
           
           I'll try to get closer to the target, but not within any of the known obstacles. I will try positions that are further to the right, and also slightly above. I'll also try a position directly below the target point, but not too close to the x-axis boundary or other obstacles.

Model:     The target point has changed again to (1.828, 2.089). My previous proposals for the *last* target failed due to collisions or no line of sight.
           
           For the new target (1.828, 2.089):
           - (-1.8, 1.5) no line of sight. This is expected as it's on the opposite side of the central obstacle (5) and quite far.
           - (-1.6, 1.8) collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This is also far from the new target and on the wrong side.
           - (-1.9, 2.4) collided with obstacle 1 ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) (the top wall) and obstacle 8. Again, too far and on the wrong side.
           
           The new target (1.828, 2.089) is in the upper right quadrant. It is very close to obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and obstacle 17: ((1.133, 2.092), (1.263, 2.221)). It also appears to be within obstacle 7.
           
           I need to find positions within 2 units of (1.828, 2.089) that are not obstructed. I will aim for positions near the target, keeping in mind the obstacles in this region. Obstacles to consider include 1 (top wall), 3 (right wall), 5 (center vertical), 7, 17, 20. Since the target is within obstacle 7, I need to try to approach it from the sides, being careful about the bounding box.

           (1.0 2.0)
