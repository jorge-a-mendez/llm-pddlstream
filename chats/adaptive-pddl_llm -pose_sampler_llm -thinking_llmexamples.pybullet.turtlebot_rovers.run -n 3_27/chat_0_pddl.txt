           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but this boils down to ensuring I can send images and analyses to the lander and that certain initial conditions remain valid.** I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, each at their starting positions, and I'm going to focus on v14 because it seems best-positioned to meet the demands.
           
           First, I see I need to receive images. To get these, I'll use `v14`'s camera in mode `v11`. It seems I'll need to calibrate and then take pictures of each of the targets and transmit them. This is the sequence: calibrate, take, and transmit - repeatedly for each image.
           
           Then I get to the analyses. I see that there is a need to analyse stone of type v2, and then soil of type v6. I've to sample rocks of the given types, perform the analysis with `v14`s on-board tools, send the analysis to the lander. The rover has a store where it can collect the samples, but this store has a capacity constraint. I have to make sure the store is empty before a new sample can be taken. 
           
           Once both analyses are sent, the objective is fulfilled.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v3 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v3), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, I messed up. I initially misunderstood the constraints. The critical issue is the *specific* list of permitted action instances.  I incorrectly assumed I could derive actions (even with continuous parameters) from the action definitions.  The problem explicitly states that any action *not* in the provided list is forbidden.  This is a tight constraint.
           
           Let's break it down: The goal states require `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. My permitted actions are:  `(move)` and `(drop_rock)`.  Neither of these actions can possibly achieve either `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. These are generated as the results of *other* operations (`send_image` and `send_analysis`, which themselves rely on other operations like `calibrate`, `take_image` or `sample_rock`, which are also excluded.)
           
           I've carefully re-examined the initial state.  The initial state *does not* include any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts.  Therefore, and the fact that the axioms `new-axiom@0()` contain the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` goals, and they are not true in the initial state.
           
           Since the problem strictly forbids any action not on the list, and the goal *cannot* be achieved using only the permitted actions, I must conclude that the goal is *unachievable*.
