(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on surface 0, which is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. The object has dimensions (size_x, size_y) = (0.07298498273688059, 0.07298498273688064), and I need to represent each placement as (surf_idx, theta, x, y). The key is ensuring that the object is *fully* contained within the surface for each placement.
           
           Since the object's width and height (obj_x and obj_y) are nearly equal, it's almost a square. This means that the object's bounding box doesn't change *much* with rotation (theta). Still, I need to account for rotation to have a good diversity of placements. I know the surface 0 has a center at (0,0). So, I'll calculate `half_obj_x` and `half_obj_y` to determine the maximum allowed center position for containment.
           
           To ensure it's contained for all `theta`, I *must* calculate the *largest* possible extents. I'll use the bounding box calculations for a rotated rectangle, the formula is: `hw = 0.5 * (abs(obj_x * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_y * sin(theta)))` and `hh = 0.5 * (abs(obj_x * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_y * cos(theta)))`, and I know the max size of the rotated bounding box will be at *pi/4* or *3pi/4*. The minimum will be when `theta=0` or `pi/2`.
           
           So, the next step is to generate placements within the safe region, trying different rotations, specifically, 16 distinct angles, using the formula mentioned above. I will use the corners, the centre and some mid points of those edges. I'm going to carefully select 4 unique locations for the `x` and `y` center for each angle. This will result in 64 placements. From those 64, I will select the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object, Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, I've got a new challenge: place object ID 4, which is almost square (about 0.098 units on a side), on surface 0 without touching the existing object, ID 7.  Object 7 is centered at (0,0) and has dimensions of about 0.073 units on a side.  I've already successfully placed the previous object (ID 7) at (0, 0, 0).
           
           My primary strategy is still to generate a diverse set of possible placements for the new object. I will vary the x, y position and rotation (theta) of the object.  I'll then determine its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) using the object dimensions and rotation angle. I'll need to make sure the object's AABB remains within the valid bounds of surface 0.
           
           But here's the kicker: I need to avoid any collision with object 7.  Since object 7 is at (0,0) as well, putting the new object there is a definite no-go. I need to calculate the bounding box for object 7, and make sure that the AABB of object 4 never overlaps that of object 7.
           
           To solve this, I'm going to follow these steps:
           1.  **Generate candidate placements:** For each rotation angle (at 16 equal intervals around a circle), I'll determine the valid range of x and y positions based on the surface 0 dimensions.
           2.  **Calculate AABBs:** I'll calculate the AABB for each candidate, based on its x, y and theta.
           3.  **Check Surface Containment and Collision:** For each placement, I will first confirm the placement is on the surface. Next, I will check whether the AABB of object 4 overlaps the AABB of object 7 using standard AABB intersection checks.
           4.  **Selection:** I'll gather a collection of up to 50 unique placements that meet those criteria.
           
           To make things more efficient, I have determined the maximum half-extents (hw4 and hh4) for any orientation of object 4 are just under 0.049 units. This impacts the valid placement range.
           
           Also, I've noticed the most effective way to avoid collisions is to position each placement so its AABB is away from the center of the surface at (0,0). I have defined 8 specific candidate positions for each angle: four at the corners of the valid x, y range, and four at the midpoints of the valid range sides. I can use these as starting points to avoid (0,0).
           
           Since I am certain the first candidate, at zero rotation, does not collide, my primary strategy is to use the 8 candidate positions and check for collisions. If this generates enough valid placements (over 50), I can avoid generating more candidates.
           
           I will iterate through all 16 angles, and generate up to 8 valid non-colliding placements for each angle, adding them to the final solution list.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with two existing obstacles: Object 7 and Object 4. I'll need to consider the dimensions of the new object (0.077 x 0.077 units) and the size and position of existing objects.
           
           I plan to iterate through a range of 16 different angles (from 0 to 2π radians, spaced evenly). For each angle, I will compute the half-extents of the rotated object and define the safe region on the surface based on the object's size and the surface boundaries (-0.135 to 0.135 units in both X and Y directions).
           
           To determine collision-free placement points within the safe area, I will use a grid-based approach. I'll divide the valid X and Y ranges into 5 equal steps, creating a grid of potential locations. Then, I will iterate through each grid point and apply bounding box (AABB) collision checks with the two obstacle AABBs. I will keep any placement point that does not collide with the obstacles.
           
           The collision check involves ensuring that the object's AABB does not overlap with any of the obstacle AABBs (Object 7 and Object 4).  By generating and testing the grid placements, I expect to find 50 valid positions.  The details are as follows:
           
           *   I'll pre-calculate dimensions and safe areas based on the object dimensions, and bounding boxes.
           *   The placement will be determined by applying the AABB algorithm and iterating through the pre-determined array of angles and X and Y placements.
           *   Once a position is determined to not collide, it will be added to the list of placements.
           
           This approach will efficiently identify a set of stable and collision-free locations for the new object on surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for this new object (ID: 6) on Surface 0, taking into account existing obstacles. My approach will be methodical and collision-aware.
           
           First, I've got to analyze what's already there: Object 7 (right in the center, a 3D box), Object 4 (in the lower-left corner), and Object 5 (upper-right corner). These objects define my "forbidden" zones.  Their bounding boxes are calculated, including center coordinates, rotations (currently none), and crucial half-extents.
           
           Next, the new object (ID 6).  It's roughly a square shape with specific dimensions. The surface area is bounded by a rectangle, defined by  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'll be rotating Object 6 through a range of angles (16 increments) to cover a full rotation to make sure I get a good distribution. For each angle, I calculate the new object's half extents, which define my placement range (Surface 0 bounds minus the object's extents). Now for the placement logic. Instead of just randomly placing, which is slow and brute force, I will generate placements in a grid, and filter for collisions.
           
           Key for checking for collisions:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculations:** For each placement, I create an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for the new object.
           2.  **Overlap Check:** I check if the object's AABB collides with any of the existing obstacles (Object 7, 4, 5). I use a dedicated collision check function that I know well. If no overlap, the placement is kept.  I stop when I find 50.
           
           I'll start with a 7x7 grid for each rotation (16 total rotations for a high number of samples), so a bit more than the initial thought.  This grid strategy has me looking at about 784 placements at maximum (depending on the rotation), which will give me enough options.  The grid will provide my `(x, y)` locations. The `(x, y)` values will be within the valid surface range (Surface bounds minus the new half extents) for this specific rotation.
           
           Finally, I use my standard AABB collision checking strategy, which I've validated before. The AABB checks are very fast.
           
           A good plan, let's execute.

           First, I've got to analyze what's already there: Object 7 (right in the center, a 3D box), Object 4 (in the lower-left corner), and Object 5 (upper-right corner). These objects define my "forbidden" zones.  Their bounding boxes are calculated, including center coordinates, rotations (currently none), and crucial half-extents.
           
           Next, the new object (ID 6).  It's roughly a square shape with specific dimensions. The surface area is bounded by a rectangle, defined by  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'll be rotating Object 6 through a range of angles (16 increments) to cover a full rotation to make sure I get a good distribution. For each angle, I calculate the new object's half extents, which define my placement range (Surface 0 bounds minus the object's extents). Now for the placement logic. Instead of just randomly placing, which is slow and brute force, I will generate placements in a grid, and filter for collisions.
           
           Key for checking for collisions:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculations:** For each placement, I create an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) for the new object.
           2.  **Overlap Check:** I check if the object's AABB collides with any of the existing obstacles (Object 7, 4, 5). I use a dedicated collision check function that I know well. If no overlap, the placement is kept.  I stop when I find 50.
           
           I'll start with a 7x7 grid for each rotation (16 total rotations for a high number of samples), so a bit more than the initial thought.  This grid strategy has me looking at about 784 placements at maximum (depending on the rotation), which will give me enough options.  The grid will provide my `(x, y)` locations. The `(x, y)` values will be within the valid surface range (Surface bounds minus the new half extents) for this specific rotation.
           
           Finally, I use my standard AABB collision checking strategy, which I've validated before. The AABB checks are very fast.
           
           A good plan, let's execute.
