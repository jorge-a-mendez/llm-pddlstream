           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular, with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for the object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object is entirely within the bounds of the surface. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't significantly change its footprint, but I will still vary it. I will generate placements by distributing the object's center across the surface, ensuring the object's full extent is within the surface boundaries.
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Width of surface 0: `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6`
           Height of surface 0: `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`
           Object dimensions: `size_x = 0.07, size_y = 0.07`
           
           For the object to be entirely within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + object_half_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object_half_x`
           `surface_lower_y + object_half_y <= y <= surface_upper_y - object_half_y`
           
           Object half dimensions: `half_x = 0.07 / 2 = 0.035`, `half_y = 0.07 / 2 = 0.035`
           
           X-range for center: `4.2 + 0.035 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.035` => `4.235 <= x <= 4.765`
           Y-range for center: `-0.6 + 0.035 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.035` => `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`
           
           I will distribute the 50 placements across this valid range, trying to cover the space. I'll also vary the theta (orientation).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The new object (ID: 10) is also rectangular, with dimensions 0.07247536568423563 x 0.07247536568423585. These dimensions are very close to the previous object's dimensions, making it essentially a square of side 0.0725.
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 10 on surface 0, ensuring it's entirely within the bounds of the surface. I also need to consider the previously placed object (ID: 5) to avoid collisions, although in this request, there is no explicit information about object 5's final placement, only that some of the proposed placements were successful. Since I don't know the exact final position of object 5, and the request asks for stable placements on the surface for object 10, my primary goal is to find valid placements for object 10 on the surface itself. If I receive feedback that these collide, I will then incorporate that knowledge. For now, I'll treat this as finding valid placements for object 10 on the given surface.
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Width of surface 0: `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6`
           Height of surface 0: `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`
           Object 10 dimensions: `size_x = 0.07247536568423563`, `size_y = 0.07247536568423585`
           
           Object half dimensions: `half_x = size_x / 2 = 0.036237682842117815`, `half_y = size_y / 2 = 0.036237682842117925`
           
           X-range for center (assuming worst case for rotation, but since it's almost a square, this is simpler):
           `4.2 + half_x <= x <= 4.8 - half_x` => `4.23623768 <= x <= 4.76376232`
           Y-range for center:
           `-0.6 + half_y <= y <= 0.0 - half_y` => `-0.56376232 <= y <= -0.03623768`
           
           I will distribute the 50 placements across this valid range, trying to cover the space and vary the orientation.
