User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a thin wall/barrier along x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the room, some forming clusters. I need to find 3 positions within 2 units of the target point (-0.05739029587428459, -0.4930121703664441) that avoid these obstacles and have a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           I will try to place the robot in open areas, away from the walls and known obstacles, while remaining within the range limit.
