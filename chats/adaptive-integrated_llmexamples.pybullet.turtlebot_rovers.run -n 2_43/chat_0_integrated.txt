           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two storage units, v16, and various rocks and objectives. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied in several ways, but it primarily requires two images to be received and two rocks to be analyzed. Given the provided initial state, neither rover is currently in a configuration where it can take an image or analyze a rock. Also, there are no actions for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` in the allowed action instances, which suggests that the goal cannot be achieved through those direct actions.
           
           However, the `new-axiom@0()` predicate actually means the following:
           ```
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           Looking at the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           - We need `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           - We need `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
           - We need `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, and the actions to achieve these (e.g., `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are *not* provided in the list of valid action instances, it implies that the goal is likely already satisfied through the axiom. Let's re-examine the goal and axioms.
           
           The provided goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` is an axiom. This means that if the conditions of the axiom are met in the state, the axiom is considered true.
           
           Let's check if the conditions of the `new-axiom@0()` are met in the initial state:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True (Initial state).
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True (Initial state).
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True (Initial state).
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True (Initial state).
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False (Not in initial state).
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False (Not in initial state).
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a pattern. We have `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`. So, ?stone can be v4, v3, or v1.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means for some object of type `v2` (stone), `receivedanalysis` must be true. False (Not in initial state).
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a pattern. We have `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`. So, ?soil can be v7, v5, or v8.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means for some object of type `v6` (soil), `receivedanalysis` must be true. False (Not in initial state).
           
           Since `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are not true in the initial state, and there are no actions provided to achieve them, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions. The `move` and `drop_rock` actions do not affect the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable from the initial state with the given allowed actions.
