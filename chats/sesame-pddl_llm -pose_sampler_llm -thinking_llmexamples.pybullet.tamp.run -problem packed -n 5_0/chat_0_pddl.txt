(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: ID 5**
           
           My primary objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions `(0.07828824613544665, 0.07828824613544663)` on surface 0, which is a square surface defined by the range `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           To achieve stability and containment within the surface, I need to ensure that the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), when rotated, stays completely within the surface's boundaries. Since the object is very nearly square, the rotation's impact on the overall bounding box isn't drastic.
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid of placements based on two representative rotation angles: 0 radians and pi/4 radians. I selected these to get distinct object orientations.
           
           1.  **For Theta = 0:** I calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates where the center of the object can be located while remaining fully within the surface. The coordinates are calculated precisely using `obj_w`, `obj_h`, and surface bounds. Then, I generate a grid of 5 x 5 (x, y) coordinates within these calculated boundaries.
           
           2.  **For Theta = pi/4:** I perform similar calculations to compute the surface-constrained min/max coordinates for the center of the rotated object, taking into account the increased width of the bounding box due to rotation. Then, I similarly generate a 5 x 5 grid of x,y coordinates constrained by the bounds.
           
           This combination of two rotations (0 and pi/4) results in 50 distinct, valid placements, ensuring coverage within the surface, because the object is small and almost square. These placements represent: `(surf_idx=0, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 7: A Collision-Free Approach**
           
           Okay, so the feedback confirms a successful placement for Object ID 5, and that's key. It's a good reference point for avoiding collisions in the future, even though this is a request for a new object, ID 7. The requirement is clear: avoid collisions between object 5 (already placed) and object 7.
           
           Based on the problem definition and past performance of the placement algorithm, object ID 5 has been given a position of `(0, 0.0, -0.09585587693227667, -0.09585587693227668)` with dimensions `size_x = 0.07828824613544665`, `size_y = 0.07828824613544663`, and zero rotation about the Z axis. This means the bounding box (AABB) of object 5, based on its established placement, extends from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.05671175386455334, -0.056711753864553365)`. It basically occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface 0, which measures `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'll start by checking the constraints to make sure object 7 does not intersect with object 5.
           Object 7 is a square with an edge length of `0.09756438027478609`. Now, to prevent collisions, the coordinates of the center of object 7 will need to be at least `0.048782190137393045` away from the center of object 5. Because this object is square, this distance is fixed regardless of rotation.
           
           I will start by calculating the bounds for `theta = 0`, then I will do the same calculation for `theta = pi/4`.
           For `theta = 0`: The center `(x, y)` must be placed such that the object is not overlapping object 5's bounding box.
           For `theta = pi/4`: the effective dimensions are larger, given the diagonal orientation. The new box would cover the whole extent of the object, because of its square shape.
           
           By generating a grid of placements in these locations I should generate 50 places that will not overlap and will meet the constraints.
           I can then feed this information into the environment to check these results and iterate through those 50 candidate placements.
           
           I am confident in this approach.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My goal is to place Object ID 4, a square with size `0.0815`, a total of 50 times on Surface 0, which is a square region centered at the origin, with extents `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`. However, I must carefully avoid collisions with two pre-existing objects: Object ID 5 and Object ID 7, which are currently obstacles.
           
           Object ID 5 resides in the area approximately defined as `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.057, -0.057)]`, while Object ID 7 occupies `[(-0.057, -0.135), (0.041, -0.037)]`. Notice that these two objects' footprints are contiguous along the bottom edge up to x=0.041. So, the region covered by those two objects forms the combined occupied region: `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.041, -0.037)]`.
           
           To maximize my chances of finding 50 stable and collision-free locations, I plan to consider Object ID 4 in two orientations: aligned with the axes (0 radians) and rotated by 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). For each orientation, I will compute the valid placement zone on Surface 0 and then exclude the region occupied by Objects 5 and 7.
           
           *   **Orientation 1 (0 radians):** The square object requires me to calculate the smallest x and y coordinate. I have the effective dimensions `obj4_hw` and `obj4_hh`. The placement zone is determined by ensuring the center of the object isn't too close to surface edges or obstacles. I calculate `x_start = 0.0816` and the valid surface range for the y-coordinate. I can form 5 points along both the x and y axis with equal interval.
           
           *   **Orientation 2 (pi/4 radians):** I will be doing the exact same thing for the Object ID 4 at pi/4 radians. I will have a value to avoid with x coordinates. Since it doesn't fit in range, I must make sure that it's above a certain value for the y-coordinate. Then I can form 5 points on the surface with equal intervals for the valid region.
           
           This two-pronged approach ensures I have a diverse set of placement candidates that avoid the existing obstacles and fill the surface effectively.

           7.  **Find Available Space (theta=pi/4):** The process is similar, but I have to use the rotated size for the object, and I use a different grid based on the surface bounds.
