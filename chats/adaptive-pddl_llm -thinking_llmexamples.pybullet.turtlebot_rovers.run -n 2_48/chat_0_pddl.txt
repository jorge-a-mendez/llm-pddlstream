           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but it seems like we're hitting a wall. The core of this axiom involves receiving images and analyses of specific objects. The initial state gives me a clear picture of what needs to happen: I need to get images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`, analyze both a stone and some soil, and receive those analyses.
           
           I started by looking at what actions I have available: some basic movements (which don't actually *move* anything, just confirm the current configuration), and rock-dropping actions. These actions alone don't seem to get me anywhere near the goal.
           
           The real problem arises when I look at the preconditions for the actions I *would* need, like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. To take and send an image, I need the rover to be in the correct configuration (`#o3`) so it can "see" the image. Similarly, to sample a rock, the rover has to be at `#o5`. But here's the kicker: the rovers are currently stuck at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, according to the initial `atconf` facts. I can't move them from their initial configurations to those key configurations, because the only move actions are effectively "no-ops".
           
           I need `move` actions which let me change the configuration of the rovers to `#o3` and `#o5`, but they are not among the permitted actions. The given actions don't allow any changes to the current configurations. This constraint effectively cripples my ability to gather the images and perform the necessary analysis.
           
           Since no possible action can get the rovers in the required configurations, the goal of achieving the new axiom is *impossible* with the given actions. I've re-evaluated every step, checked the available actions, and compared them to the necessary preconditions. I'm confident that the current list of available actions simply cannot lead me to my objective. The `move` actions are not providing any movement to the necessary configuration where the rovers can complete the tasks they must complete. I can't overcome this constraint.
