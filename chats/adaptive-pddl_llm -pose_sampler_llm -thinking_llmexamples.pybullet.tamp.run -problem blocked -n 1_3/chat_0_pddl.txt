           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           My primary objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) *after* rotation is fully contained within the surface's AABB.  Since the object is square, its effective bounding box changes with rotation, reaching its maximum size at 45 degrees.  I've decided on the following approach:
           
           1.  **Exploiting Symmetry:** For a square, I can use two angles to represent max/min: angle 0 for no rotation and angle pi/4 for 45 degree.
           
           2.  **Effective AABB Calculation:**  The key calculation is the effective AABB dimensions when rotated, especially knowing a max is at 45 deg, where the objects bounding box is s \* sqrt(2).
           
           3.  **Grid-Based Placement:** For each chosen angle (0 and pi/4), I create a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the valid placement area (surface bounds minus effective half-width/height). This uses  5 evenly spaced points on each dimension.
           
           This ensures a robust set of 50 placements, evenly distributed across the surface and encompassing the maximum effective object size at any rotation. The result is a total of 50 placements.
