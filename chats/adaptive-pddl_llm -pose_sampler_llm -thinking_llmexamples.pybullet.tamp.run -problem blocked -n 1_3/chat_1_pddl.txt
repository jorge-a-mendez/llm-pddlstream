           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal is Unreachable Due to Base Configuration Conflict**
           
           My analysis begins by dissecting the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true.  I quickly realize that I need to establish the `on` predicate, which requires that an object be `supported` by something and `atpose` in a specific location.
           
           Initially, I identify two possible candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`, both of which have the required `type` predicate. I then focus on trying to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.  I can see that `v8` is initially at pose `v9`, but it's supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`. I know that I must 'pick' `v8` from pose `v9` and 'place' it at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, the crucial roadblock emerges during the `pick` action's preconditions. The `pick` requires that the robot arm's base be at base configuration `#o3` (`atbconf(#o3)`). The kinematics information (`kin`) also requires `#o3`. However, the initial state shows that the current base configuration is `v3`. The only available `move_base` action instance doesn't change the configuration from `v3`.
           
           The core problem then comes to light: I can't reach the required base configuration `#o3` to perform the `pick` and `place` operations.  Since there is no `move_base` action that accomplishes the necessary base configuration transition.  Because `#o3` and `v3` are different objects, I cannot use the `pick` and `place` actions at all.
           
           This means that there's no way to manipulate `v8` or `v12` to satisfy the `on` predicate. I confirm that `on(?green, v18)` isn't true initially, and because `pick` and `place` are blocked, I conclude that the goal is unattainable.  The available "clean" and "cook" actions are irrelevant to the task.
           
           In conclusion, I have no plan to solve the problem because of the unreachable `atbconf(#o3)` requirement in all the kin actions. The only move base action present does not move the robot's base configuration. The goal is likely unreachable as stated.
