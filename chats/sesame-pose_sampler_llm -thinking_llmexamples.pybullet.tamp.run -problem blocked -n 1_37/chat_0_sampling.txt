(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0.  I've got the object's dimensions (`0.07 x 0.07`) and the surface's definition.  The key is "stable placement," which means the object's AABB has to stay within the surface's boundaries, even when rotated.  Since the problem statement indicates the geometry is described by the AABB, I'm going to assume that the object itself is an axis-aligned box with those dimensions, and the rotation (`theta`) only *affects* the effective bounding box.  Specifically, it seems the AABB is always axis-aligned, but the object itself is *rotated* inside.
           
           Given that, my strategy hinges on managing how the object's AABB changes with rotation.  I calculated that when rotated by `theta`, the *effective* width and height of the box will be equal since it's a square. The formula is `S_eff = 0.07 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`, with the max value at 45 degrees.
           
           The surface is also a square, sized `0.6 x 0.6`.  I'll start with the simplest case:  placing the object with `theta = 0` (no rotation).  With this orientation, I can calculate a grid of placements based on the surface area and object size to make a grid to maximize object density. To avoid overlaps, I know I must start by offsetting the center by half the width/height to make sure the object remains inside the surface, making the formula for valid centers the min boundary point + the object's half size or width.
           
           I can fit 8 non-overlapping objects along the horizontal, giving a total of `8 * 8 = 64` placements using steps of `0.07`.  Since I only need 25, I'll take a grid of `5 x 5` from this.
           
           For diversification and to meet the requirement to explore rotations, I'll then repeat this procedure for a rotation of 45 degrees (`theta = pi/4`).  When rotated, the object is contained within a box of slightly larger dimensions, and the space for valid center placement is smaller. I will again calculate the `S_eff`, which has increased. Because the size has increased, the calculation for the center point range is adjusted too. The effective size change requires using `0.07 * sqrt(2) / 2` to determine the bounding placement range. It turns out I can fit `6 * 6 = 36` placements in the 45 degree orientation, from which I will also select 25 to add to my set of 50. I calculate each coordinate point using the same approach as `theta = 0`, but using the rotated dimensions and calculated start points.
           
           I'm confident that this approach guarantees stability (full containment within the surface boundaries) and provides diverse placements across the surface to meet the request.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 10, to place on surface 0, and I need to avoid collisions with the existing instances of object 5. The good news is, all the successful placements for object 5 are concentrated in a specific lower-left region of the surface.  This means I can essentially work around this "occupied" zone.
           
           Object 10 is almost a square with sides of about 0.07. First, I need to figure out where I *can't* place it. I've calculated the bounding boxes of all the existing object 5 instances.  They occupy a rectangle that stretches from `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.34, -0.25)` on surface 0. My surface has the coordinates `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           Now, the main idea is to first place object 10 using `theta=0`. For `theta=0`, my object 10's center needs to be outside the rectangle occupied by the placed object 5 instances. Therefore, I'm checking for two cases:
           1. `cx >= 4.375479881835347` AND `cy` can be anywhere within the surface limits (specifically between -0.56 and -0.035 in the y-axis), or 
           2. `cy <= -0.21452011816465255` or `cy >= -0.6354798818353475`
           
           However, the surface coordinates limit us to values from -0.6 to 0, which means that the safest placement option is the first case to prevent collision.
           
           After this I determine I have a `[4.375479881835347, 4.764520118164652]` for cx coordinates and `[-0.564520118164652, -0.03547988183534745]` for cy coordinates. I have a loop to place object with intervals of 0.07 to generate 48 placements. For the last two I generate them using a theta of pi/4 with x and y offsetted at the center point.
           
           Therefore I have generated 50 stable object 10 placements.
