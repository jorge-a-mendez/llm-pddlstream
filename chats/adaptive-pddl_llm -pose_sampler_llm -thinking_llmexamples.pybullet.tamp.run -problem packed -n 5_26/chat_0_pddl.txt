           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my approach to generating 50 stable placements for the object on the surface:**
           
           I first considered the object's dimensions and the surface's boundaries. Since the object is nearly square and the surface is centered at the origin, I determined that the rotation angle `theta` and center coordinates `(x, y)` are the primary variables for placement. To maximize the available placement area, I chose to use the object's smallest bounding box (achieved when `theta` is a multiple of pi/2).
           
           Knowing the object’s dimensions and the surface’s AABB, I calculated the valid range for the object’s center coordinates at `theta = 0`. With that, I generated a 7x7 grid of center points to provide 49 unique placements. For the 50th placement, to add variety, I tested placing the object rotated at `pi/4` at the center of the surface.
           
           This approach ensures diverse placements across the surface while adhering to the object’s stability requirements and surface boundaries.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put object 4 without it running into object 5. Object 5 is chilling in the bottom-left corner of the surface, and its AABB is clearly defined. Object 4 is almost a square, and I have its dimensions.
           
           First, I calculate the boundaries for object 4's center, ensuring it stays within the surface. Then I'm on the lookout for collisions. I'm focusing on "no-collision regions," where object 4 won't intersect with object 5's AABB.
           
           After doing the calculations, I realize I have an L-shaped region where object 4 can safely be placed. Now I'm tasked with creating 50 points in the L-shape. I start by setting up a 9x9 grid, I can filter the points to avoid collisions. Using a 9x9 grid with a "theta = 0", I'll have 56 safe locations. After filtering out points that could collide, I have more than 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Final Placement Strategy for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to place Object 6 fifty times on Surface 0, making sure it's stable and avoiding collisions with the existing objects, Object 5 and Object 4.
           
           First, I defined the valid placement area on Surface 0, a square of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I then calculated the boundaries for Object 6's center, considering its dimensions and orientation (zero rotation).
           
           Next, I determined the areas where Object 6 *would* collide with Object 5 and Object 4, which is crucial. Object 5 is located near the center of the surface, and Object 4 is positioned below Object 5. I calculated the collision areas based on the dimensions and positions of the existing objects.
           
           To find the safe placements, I decided to use a grid approach within the valid surface area. I created a 10x10 grid of points, resulting in 100 candidate placements, covering the entire valid region.
           
           After creating my grid, I analyzed each grid point to see if it would create a collision with objects 5 or 4. I looked at the collision areas I'd calculated, and rejected the grid points within those areas.  The grid points that would cause a collision were removed.
           
           Finally, I discovered I needed a more granular grid to get 50 non-colliding points.  I came up with a list of exactly 50 safe positions based on the expanded 10x10 grid, by identifying which grid points did *not* overlap with the known collision areas.  These points are guaranteed to result in stable, non-colliding placements of Object 6!
