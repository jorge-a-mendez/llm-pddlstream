           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning:**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goal state: all of the objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 on v20.  Currently, they are all on v11, and the fundamental predicate involved is "on(object, object)". To satisfy "on(object, object)", the facts supported and atpose must be true for the relevant objects and poses. In the initial state, the key fact is "supported(object, pose, v11)", which I must change to "supported(object, pose, v20)".
           
           I've examined the available actions – `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Clearly, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant.  To alter the "on" relation, picking up and placing objects are necessary. That leaves `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`.
           
           The `pick` action requires facts proving the robot arm can move, the object is at the correct pose, the arm is empty and that both the base and arm trajectories are safe.
           The `place` action, in turn, requires that the robot is holding the object, that a pose on the table is safe, and that the base and arm trajectories are safe.
           
           Initially, all objects are at their original poses (e.g. `atpose(v8, v9)`). There are facts showing that all the objects can be placed on either v10 or v20, and that the grasp is the same as the current pose (e.g. `supported(v8, #o2, v20)` and `pose(v8, #o2)`). Therefore, the plan must involve moving the objects from their initial poses, `v11`, to new positions (supported and atpose for v20).
           
           The provided facts suggest using a specific robot arm `v4`. The `kin` facts tie `v4` to all the object pick/place configurations. Thus, I will use `v4`. Also the facts indicate `v3` is the base configuration, which seems consistent because the *only* `move_base` action instance listed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, suggesting the robot *must* stay at base configuration v3, and not move.
           
           To achieve the goal, I need a sequence: pick v8, place v8, pick v12, place v12, and so on. For each object, I would pick it from its initial pose with `pick(v4, object, initial_pose, #o1, v3, #o4)` and place it at the target pose with `place(v4, object, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           Now, here is the problem: I've carefully re-read the prompt. I am constrained to only using the listed action instance: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. The prompt explicitly states, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that I *cannot* use the `pick` and `place` actions, which are essential to solve this problem. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given these constraints.
           
           Since the goal is provably unreachable given these restrictions, I am not including a plan.
