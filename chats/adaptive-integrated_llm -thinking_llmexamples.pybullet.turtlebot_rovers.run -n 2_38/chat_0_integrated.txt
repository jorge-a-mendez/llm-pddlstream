           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My task is to create a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`.  This boils down to ensuring both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, receive image data of objectives `v17` and `v18`, and that all six rock samples (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) are analyzed and have their results received.
           
           The initial state reveals crucial conditions. The rovers are *already* in a configuration where several preconditions are met. However, the key obstacle is the `atconf` predicate. While the rovers are initially in configurations `v13` and `v15`, the necessary actions for image capture and analysis require the rovers to be in different, continuous configurations.
           
           To achieve an image, I need to use the `take_image` and `send_image` actions. Each action has an `atconf` precondition, but the initial state does not have the rovers in the required configuration.  For example, to take a clear image, rover `v12` needs to be in a configuration where it can *see* the target (e.g., `#o3`) and communicate with the lander. Similarly, the `sample_rock` action is required for analysis, and it also has the precondition.
           
           The issue arises because the only "move" actions given merely return the robot to the same config, meaning that the rover cannot *change* its configuration at all. The configurations for image capture, analysis, and communication are specified as `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. But the `move` action only allows to move *from* and *to* the *same* continuous configuration. Therefore, there's no path to the correct configurations, and my planning process comes to an abrupt halt. I cannot modify the robots' configurations to meet the `atconf` preconditions. Consequently,  I can't take an image, send it, sample rocks, or transmit the analysis, making the final goal impossible to satisfy.
           
           Therefore, after a careful analysis of the initial state, the available actions, and the required goal, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable* given the limitations imposed on rover movement. The only way is to have the preconditions defined for the rovers' current configurations, but that is not the case. This problem stems from a lack of mobility in a world where visibility and analysis are only possible from different, reachable configurations.
