User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square (from approximately -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some are near the edges and some are more central. Some of these are quite thin, acting like small wall segments.
           
           Given the target point (1.319728479261314 0.6128033288410977), I'll try to find positions within a 2-unit radius from it. I should avoid the known obstacles.
           
           The target point is in the right half of the environment. I need to be careful with the central wall at x=0.
           The target is at (1.32, 0.61).
           Obstacle 7 is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
           Obstacle 13 is at ((1.03, 1.59), (1.16, 1.72))
           Obstacle 17 is at ((0.92, -0.9), (1.06, -0.76))
           
           I will try positions around the target, keeping in mind the obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.319728479261314 2.4)
           (2.4 0.6128033288410977)
           (0.5 0.6128033288410977)
           

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous target was different from what I used. I apologize for that error. I will use the *new* target point for the current request.
           
           The scene is enclosed by a large square (from approximately -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some are near the edges and some are more central. Some of these are quite thin, acting like small wall segments.
           
           The *new* target point is (-0.7016918659210205, 2.0788652896881104).
           My previous proposed positions were (1.319728479261314, 2.4), (2.4, 0.6128033288410977) and (0.5, 0.6128033288410977). All of these failed with the *previous* target point of (-0.7016918659210205, 2.0788652896881104).
           The failure reasons were:
           1. (1.319728479261314, 2.4) collided with obstacle 0: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)). This is the top wall. This position is at y=2.4, which is within the obstacle's y range.
           2. (2.4, 0.6128033288410977) collided with obstacle 0: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)). This is the right wall. This position is at x=2.4, which is within the obstacle's x range.
           3. (0.5, 0.6128033288410977) was "not reachable for robot base". This likely means it was too far from the previous target, or perhaps too close to the x=0 wall for a valid line of sight.
           
           The target point is (-0.7016918659210205, 2.0788652896881104). This is in the top-left quadrant, near the top edge.
           I need to be careful with the bounding boxes of the environment and the fixed obstacles:
           Obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - top wall, avoid y > 2.45
           Obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))
           Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
           Obstacle 15: ((-1.557, 2.051), (-1.417, 2.191))
           Obstacle 19: ((-2.08, 2.14), (-2.00, 2.21))
           Obstacle 21: ((-0.74, 2.03), (-0.66, 2.11)) - This is very close to the target point.
           
           The target is at x=-0.70, y=2.08.
           Obstacle 21 is at ((-0.74, 2.03), (-0.66, 2.11)). The target point is inside this obstacle, or very close to its edge.
           It's possible the target point is *within* an obstacle, which would make it impossible to find a valid viewpoint from the outside. However, assuming the target point itself is valid, I need to place the robot outside of the obstacles.
           
           Given the target (-0.70, 2.08) and the nearby obstacle 21, I need to find positions that are not inside any of the obstacles and are within 2 units of the target.
           I'll try positions below and to the left of the target, avoiding obstacle 21 and the top wall.
           The target is at (-0.70, 2.08).
           A possible position could be directly below it, or to its left.
           Let's try:
           1. Directly below the target, at y = 2.08 - 1.5 = 0.58. x = -0.70. This seems far from other obstacles.
           2. To the left of the target, at x = -0.70 - 1.5 = -2.20. y = 2.08. Need to check for other obstacles. Obstacle 19 is at ((-2.08, 2.14), (-2.00, 2.21)), which is above and to the right of (-2.2, 2.08). Obstacle 8 is at ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). So (-2.2, 2.08) is within obstacle 8. So this is not good.
           3. Slightly down and right from the target, to clear obstacle 21, and stay away from the central wall at x=0. x = -0.5, y = 1.0. This is 1.2 units away in x and y, so sqrt(1.2^2 + 1.08^2) = 1.6 distance.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.7016918659210205 0.58)
           (-1.5 1.5)
           (-0.5 1.0)
