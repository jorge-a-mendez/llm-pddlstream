User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Position Strategy for a Target**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find the 25 best spots for the robot base. I've got a target point in mind, and the robot needs to get a good view of it, avoiding obstacles along the way. First, I need to get the general picture. I'm focusing on an area within 4 units of the target. Then there are some constraints. My starting x range is -2.5, to 2.5, y range is -2.5, to 2.5. But with a target point at (2.13,-1.8) it makes sense for the robot to operate x > 0.
           
           Based on the scene analysis, the target is in the bottom-right part of the scene. The main challenge will be that big vertical wall down the middle. So I'll need to keep the robot on the right side if possible. Obstacles might block my view, especially that little one near the target. I'll need to make sure I don't collide with it.
           
           I'm starting with a circle of possible locations around the target, varying the radii and the angles to spread it out as much as possible, looking at angles and radii. These positions are inside the scene x and y ranges. I need to get it so that the distance is less than 4, and no collisions. I will avoid positions inside any obstacles.
           
           My main logic is:
           1. I'll search around the target using polar coordinates to get a nice distribution.
           2. I will filter out points outside of the scene and too far from the target.
           3. I'll check if the point intersects an existing fixed obstacle.
           
           I want a variety of positions, so if I run out of the circular arrangement spots, I'll fill it with a grid or a random point generation.
           
           For each point, I will ensure that if the point is within the robot's valid boundaries and no obstacles are inside it, then it is a valid base location for the robot.
           
           The core strategy is to get 25 unique spots. If I find any positions, I'll keep them and round the result to 2 decimal places. I will never give up. If I cannot find enough distinct ones, I will fill the remaining with duplicates. This approach should get the job done!
