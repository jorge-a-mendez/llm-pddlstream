User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5, centered at (0,0). There are walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's also a vertical wall at x=0. There are several small rectangular obstacles throughout the room, mostly concentrated near the walls and corners. The target point is {target_point}. I need to find 3 base positions within a radius of 2 from this target point. I will try to find positions that are not too close to the obstacles, and I will try to vary the angle around the target point.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0] + 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 1.5})
