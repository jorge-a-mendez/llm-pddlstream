           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, which are currently on a surface `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto surface `v16`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but only `v4` seems to have relevant `kin` facts for the objects. The base is currently at `v3`. The target surface `v16` is not explicitly given a pose. We need to find collision-free poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface (no pose given), we will choose `v11` (whose AABB is ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))) to place objects on instead.
           
           First, we need to pick up each object from its current pose and then place it onto a pose on `v16` (using `v11` as the actual placement surface).
           
           We can pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           Then pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at a different `#o2` on `v16`.
           Finally, pick `v14` from `v15` and place it at a third `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The given actions use `#o2` as a generic placeholder for a target pose. We will need to define distinct continuous values for `#o2` for each object placed on `v16`. Since the AABB for `v11` is ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)), we will place the objects at different locations within `v11` to avoid collisions.

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to unstable placements. I incorrectly calculated the AABB for the object at the given pose. The AABB for `v16` is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to ensure that the AABB of the object, when placed at a given pose, falls completely within this surface AABB.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the placements.
           The object `v12` has an AABB ((-0.087, -0.305), (-0.013, -0.23)).
           The object `v8` has an AABB ((-0.076, 0.263), (0.012, 0.35)).
           The object `v14` has an AABB ((0.122, -0.451), (0.215, -0.358)).
           The surface `v16` has an AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           I need to make sure the full extent of the object's AABB is within `v16`'s AABB, considering its dimensions and the pose.
           Let's define the placement for `v8` as (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0). The object `v8` is small and will fit within `v16` centered at (0,0).
           For `v12`, with AABB ((-0.087, -0.305), (-0.013, -0.23)), let's try (0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0). Its width is 0.074, and height is 0.075. Placing it at (0, 0.05) would mean its x-extent is between -0.037 and 0.037, and y-extent between 0.0125 and 0.0875. This should fit within the range of -0.135 to 0.135.
           For `v14`, with AABB ((0.122, -0.451), (0.215, -0.358)), let's try (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0). Its width is 0.093, and height is 0.093. Placing it at (0, -0.05) would mean its x-extent is between -0.0465 and 0.0465, and y-extent between -0.0965 and -0.0035. This should fit within the range of -0.135 to 0.135.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The error "Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!" indicates that the `move_base` action or the `pick`/`place` actions are trying to use a base configuration `v35` that is not the current base configuration. In the initial state, `atbconf(v3)` is true. The `pick` and `place` actions in the provided list all use `#o3` as the base configuration. Therefore, before executing any `pick` or `place` action, the robot must move its base to `#o3` if it's not already there. From the initial state, the robot is at `v3`. So, we need to add a `move_base` action from `v3` to `#o3`.
           
           Also, I must assign a continuous value to `#o3`. Since there is no explicit instruction to move the base, and `v3` is the initial `atbconf`, it means that `#o3` should be `v3` itself (the robot does not need to move its base). If `#o3` represents the base pose required for the `kin` facts, it's likely a computed pose that facilitates the arm's reach. I will assume it can be the same as `v3` unless explicitly moved. Since `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is given, I will use `v3` for `#o3`.
           
           Let's re-examine the available actions for `move_base`:
           `((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base #o3 v3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))`
           `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`
           
           If we assume `#o3` is `v3`, then all these move_base actions essentially mean staying at `v3`. The `pick` and `place` actions have `#o3` as their required base configuration. Given that `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, and we are aiming to achieve `kin(v4, ..., #o3, #o4)`, and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` is an available action, it's likely that `#o3` is meant to be a target base configuration that is achieved by moving from `v3`. Since `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is also an option, it suggests that `#o3` could represent `v3` without a real movement. Let's assume that `#o3` can be the same as `v3` for now, meaning no `move_base` is needed. However, if the error indicates `v35`, it's possible that `#o3` is meant to be a *new* configuration, and not `v3`. The problem statement says any fact not explicitly stated is false, so `bconf(v35)` is false. `bconf(#o3)` is true. It implies that `#o3` is a valid base configuration. The `kin` facts associate `#o3` with the `pick` and `place` operations. If `v35` appeared in the error, it's a generated internal variable that is not in the original problem description. It could be that the solver is attempting to assign a value to `#o3` and that value is `v35`.
           
           Let's consider that `#o3` is actually `v3` and therefore no `move_base` action is necessary. However, the error message indicates a `v35` which is neither `v3` nor `#o3`. This is confusing. Let's re-read the problem description: "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter* (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose) that has not yet been computed." This means `#o3` needs a value. The `kin` facts require a base configuration `#o3`. Since the robot starts at `v3`, and there's `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`, it means `#o3` can either be `v3` or some other configuration reachable from `v3`. If the problem states `v35` is not satisfied, it implies that whatever value `#o3` was assigned to by the internal solver (possibly `v35`) was incorrect, or not reachable.
           
           Let's assume the simplest case: `#o3` should be `v3`, meaning the robot doesn't need to move its base for picking and placing. If `v3` is `#o3`, then the initial `atbconf(v3)` would satisfy `atbconf(#o3)`. The previous plan did not include `move_base`.
           
           It seems the solver automatically assigned `v35` to `#o3`, and then failed because `atbconf(v35)` was not satisfied. This means my assumption that `#o3` can be `v3` without a move action might be incorrect, or the solver expects an explicit `move_base` even if `#o3` is `v3`. Let's try to explicitly move to `#o3` even if `#o3` is `v3`.
           
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` is an available action. Let's explicitly put `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` in the plan. And if the goal is to have `on(obj, v16)`, then `#o2` for each object needs to be on `v16`.
           
           Let's try:
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           I need to provide a value for `#o3`. Since `v3` is the initial base configuration and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is an available motion, let's set `#o3` to `v3`. This implies the robot moves from `v3` to `v3` (i.e. doesn't move), but this explicitly sets `#o3` to `v3` so that `atbconf(#o3)` is satisfied for the `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           The object AABBs are:
           `v8`: ((-0.076, 0.263), (0.012, 0.35))

           Surface `v16`: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           Let's recalculate the poses carefully. The Z-coordinate for placements on a surface `v11` (used as `v16` here) should be `0.781`.
           For `v8`, its extent in x is 0.088, in y is 0.087.
           For `v12`, its extent in x is 0.074, in y is 0.075.
           For `v14`, its extent in x is 0.093, in y is 0.093.
           Max extent is 0.093. If we place objects centered, 0.093/2 = 0.0465.
           The surface `v16` (using `v11`'s AABB: (-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) allows objects within 0.135 from the center. So, if an object is centered at (0,0), its extent is from -0.0465 to 0.0465, which is well within -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           Let's try to place them at:
           `v8`: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           `v12`: (0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           `v14`: (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           These should be stable. The error about `v35` is tricky. I'm assigning `#o3` to `v3`, and including a `move_base` action that effectively means staying at `v3`, but explicitly sets `#o3` as the current base configuration.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
