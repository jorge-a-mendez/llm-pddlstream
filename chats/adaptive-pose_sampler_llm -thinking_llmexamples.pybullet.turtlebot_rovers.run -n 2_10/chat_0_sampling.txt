User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Approach for Robot Base Position Generation**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find the 25 best robot base positions for a given target point, considering the constraints and obstacles:
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field. There's a room with fixed walls, a central pillar, and some smaller obstacles. The robot's got to be within a certain distance from the target and within the room's boundaries. Collisions are a no-go, and line-of-sight is paramount. If I get the same target again, it means the last position didn't work, so I'll learn from that.
           
           My strategy boils down to:
           
           1.  **Generate Candidates:** I'll create a bunch of potential positions. I'll use a grid to cover the area around the target, plus I will space out more positions around a series of concentric circles around the target. This mix of grids and circles ensures a good spread of candidate points and a bit of diversity.
           2.  **Filter by Constraints:** Each candidate gets put through a series of checks.
               *   **Room Check:** First off, I make sure the candidate is within the room limits. No robot outside the playing field!
               *   **Distance Check:** Next, I ensure the position is within the specified range from the target.
               *   **Collision Avoidance:** Then, I check for any collisions with those fixed obstacles. These are the immovable objects that must be respected.
               *   **Line-of-Sight Check:** The most crucial check is the line-of-sight. The central pillar is a real problem for visibility, so I made a special check. If the robot and target are on opposite sides of that pillar, the view is blocked, and that position is out. I made a new more reliable function to confirm the line of sight for each point is clear.
           
           3.  **Prioritize and Return:** Finally, the remaining candidates are sorted by distance from the target, as locations close to the target are more likely to provide good views. The goal is 25 valid positions.
           
           The goal here is a set of valid locations, spread out, and most importantly, with an unobstructed view of the target.
