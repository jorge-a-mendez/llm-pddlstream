           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.024, 0.46), (2.124, 0.559)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.754, -2.042), (1.878, -1.919)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom derived from several conditions. The axiom `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by a variety of conditions, but in this specific initial state, it simplifies to:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is true initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Need to take and send an image of `v17` using mode `v11`.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Need to take and send an image of `v18` using mode `v11`.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Need to take and send an image of `v19` using mode `v11`.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: We have rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` with type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Need to analyze and send analysis for a rock of type `v2`. For example, `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` with type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Need to analyze and send analysis for a rock of type `v6`. For example, `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`.
           
           All `move` actions in the available action instances are self-loops, meaning they don't change the rover's configuration. This implies that we must use the existing `atconf` positions (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) and the configurations that start with '#' for any `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates.
           
           Let's break down the requirements for the `receivedimage` predicates:
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           - `v12` can see `v17` from `#o3` (with ray `#o4`).
           - `v14` can see `v17` from `#o3` (with ray `#o4`).
           We need to `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.
           
           For `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - `v12` can see `v18` from `#o3` (with ray `#o4`).
           - `v14` can see `v18` from `#o3` (with ray `#o4`).
           We need to `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.
           
           For `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           - `v12` can see `v19` from `#o3` (with ray `#o4`).
           - `v14` can see `v19` from `#o3` (with ray `#o4`).
           We need to `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.
           
           Let's break down the requirements for the `receivedanalysis` predicates:
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`):
           - We can sample `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`. Let's pick `v4` (rock type `v2`).
           - `v12` is `above(v12, #o5, v4)`.
           - `v14` is `above(v14, #o5, v4)`.
           We need to `sample_rock`, and then `send_analysis`. This will consume a store (`v16`).
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`):
           - We can sample `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`. Let's pick `v7` (rock type `v6`).
           - `v12` is `above(v12, #o5, v7)`.
           - `v14` is `above(v14, #o5, v7)`.
           We need to `sample_rock`, and then `send_analysis`. This will consume a store (`v16`).
           
           Both rovers (`v12` and `v14`) have an onboard camera `v10` that supports mode `v11`. They also both have a store `v16`. Since both rovers start `free(v_rover, v16)`, they each have a store. We need to analyze two rocks, so each rover can analyze one.
           
           Let's use `v12` for `receivedimage` for `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for `v7` (type `v6`).
           And `v14` for `receivedanalysis` for `v4` (type `v2`).
           
           Plan:
           1. `v12` calibrates its camera `v10` at `#o3` to observe `v17`.
           2. `v12` takes an image of `v17` at `#o3` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           3. `v12` sends the image of `v17` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           4. `v12` calibrates its camera `v10` at `#o3` to observe `v18`.
           5. `v12` takes an image of `v18` at `#o3` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           6. `v12` sends the image of `v18` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           7. `v12` calibrates its camera `v10` at `#o3` to observe `v19`.
           8. `v12` takes an image of `v19` at `#o3` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           9. `v12` sends the image of `v19` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           10. `v12` samples rock `v7` at `#o5` into store `v16`.
           11. `v12` sends analysis of `v7` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           12. `v14` samples rock `v4` at `#o5` into store `v16`.
           13. `v14` sends analysis of `v4` to `v9` from `#o0`.
           
           This plan achieves all required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, and the `atconf` and `free` predicates are already true.
           
           For configurations:
           `#o3` is used by `v12` and `v14` to view `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. The AABBs for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are:
           `v17`: ((1.923, 1.905), (2.014, 1.996)) -> center (1.9685, 1.9505)
           `v18`: ((-0.4, 2.092), (-0.308, 2.185)) -> center (-0.354, 2.1385)
           `v19`: ((0.512, 1.763), (0.6, 1.851)) -> center (0.556, 1.807)
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `v12` to see `v17` (center (1.9685, 1.9505)), from `v13` (1.0, -1.75), a good `#o3` would be somewhere between. A simple approach is to try to make `#o3` coincide with `v13` if no obstructions. Since `#o3` is a continuous value, it means there is some valid configuration. We will provide a specific value for `#o3` for each (rover, target) pair.
           
           For `v12` to see `v17`: From `v13`(1.0, -1.75) to `v17`(1.9685, 1.9505). Distance is sqrt((1.9685-1.0)^2 + (1.9505 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.9685^2 + 3.7005^2) = sqrt(0.938 + 13.693) = sqrt(14.631) = 3.82. This is within the range of 2.
           Oh, wait, `imagerange` is 2.0, so the distance cannot be greater than 2. `v12` at `v13` cannot see `v17`.
           Let's check `v12` at `v13` to `v18` (-0.354, 2.1385). Distance = sqrt((-0.354-1.0)^2 + (2.1385 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.354)^2 + (3.8885)^2) = sqrt(1.833 + 15.12) = sqrt(16.953) = 4.11. Too far.
           Let's check `v12` at `v13` to `v19` (0.556, 1.807). Distance = sqrt((0.556-1.0)^2 + (1.807 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.444)^2 + (3.557)^2) = sqrt(0.197 + 12.65) = sqrt(12.847) = 3.58. Too far.
           
           It seems `v12` cannot directly image `v17`, `v18`, or `v19` from `v13` as the distance is greater than 2.0. Similarly, for `v14` from `v15`.
           `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (1.9685, 1.9505). Distance = sqrt((1.9685 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.9505 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.9685^2 + 3.7005^2) = sqrt(8.81 + 13.69) = sqrt(22.5) = 4.74. Too far.
           `v14` at `v15` to `v18` (-0.354, 2.1385). Distance = sqrt((-0.354 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.1385 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.646^2 + 3.8885^2) = sqrt(0.417 + 15.12) = sqrt(15.537) = 3.94. Too far.
           `v14` at `v15` to `v19` (0.556, 1.807). Distance = sqrt((0.556 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.807 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.556^2 + 3.557^2) = sqrt(2.42 + 12.65) = sqrt(15.07) = 3.88. Too far.
           
           The problem states that `#o3` represents a configuration such that `imagevisible` is true. `imagerange` is 2.0, so the distance has to be less than 2.0.
           The initial state explicitly gives `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` and `imagerange(v12, #o3, v19)`. This means there *exists* a configuration `#o3` for `v12` (from `v13`) from which it can see `v19`. Same for other `imagevisible` predicates. This means the `#o3` configuration does not need to be `v13` or `v15`.
           The given action instances only include `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. This means the rovers are static at their initial positions. So any action that requires a rover to be at `#o3` means `#o3` needs to be the same as `v13` (for `v12`) or `v15` (for `v14`). But my previous calculation shows these distances are too far.
           
           Let's re-read the problem statement carefully: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The third argument to the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate is the ray from the configuration to the target object. The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`. If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           And: "If the plan you select uses a configuration that does not begin with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists."
           
           This implies that if I use `#o3`, I need to provide a new coordinate for it, and this coordinate must be reachable from `v13` (or `v15`) and must be within 2 units of the target.
           However, the available action instances only permit `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. These are self-loops, meaning the rover always stays at `v13` or `v15`. This makes it impossible for the rover to move to any new `#o3` coordinate. This is a contradiction.
           
           Given the available `move` actions which are self-loops, the rovers cannot change their `atconf` state. This means that for any action that requires `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `?q` must be `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`.
           If we must use `v13` and `v15` as the configurations for `imagevisible` actions, then the `imagevisible` predicates with `#o3` as the configuration are not possible due to the `imagerange` constraint. The distances are all greater than 2.0.
           This would mean that `receivedimage` goals are impossible to achieve.
           Similarly for `comvisible`. Both `v12` and `v14` have `comvisible(?rover, #o0, #o1, v9)`. `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)), let's use its center (-1.9, -2.0).
           `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0). Distance = sqrt((-1.9-1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-2.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) = 2.91. This is within the `comrange` of 4. So `v12` at `v13` can see `v9`.
           `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0). Distance = sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) = 0.93. This is within the `comrange` of 4. So `v14` at `v15` can see `v9`.
           
           So, the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions are possible from the initial configurations `v13` and `v15` using `#o0` as the communication configuration, which can be `v13` or `v15` respectively. We need to assign `#o0` values. Since `v13` and `v15` are not `#`, we can use them for `#o0`. The problem states: "If the plan you select uses a configuration that does not begin with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists." This applies to `v13` and `v15`. So, we should assign `#o0` to be `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`.
           
           The core issue remains `receivedimage`. Since the rovers cannot move from `v13` or `v15`, and the `imagerange` of 2.0 is too small for any of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to be seen from `v13` or `v15`, the `take_image` action cannot be executed.
           Therefore, the `receivedimage` predicates cannot be achieved. As `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)` are all necessary for the `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's double check the axiom definition. The axiom definition is:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           The first four atoms are true initially. The `receivedimage` are indeed required.
           
           Conclusion: The `move` actions available are only self-loops, meaning the rovers (`v12`, `v14`) cannot move from their initial configurations (`v13`, `v15`). The targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) are all more than 2.0 units away from both `v13` and `v15`, making it impossible to satisfy the `imagerange` precondition for the `take_image` action. Therefore, `haveimage` cannot be achieved, and consequently `receivedimage` cannot be achieved. Since `receivedimage` for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` are all required by the goal axiom `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unreachable.
