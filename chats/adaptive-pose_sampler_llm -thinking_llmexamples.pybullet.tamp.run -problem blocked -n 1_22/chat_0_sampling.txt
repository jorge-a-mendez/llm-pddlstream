(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a 0.07 x 0.07 object (ID 5) on a rectangular surface (Surface 0, from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)).  Stability means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be *fully* within the surface. The critical factor is how the object's AABB changes with rotation (theta). Because the object is a square, its bounding box has dimensions `S = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. We need to calculate the allowable center coordinates (x, y) given the object's orientation `theta`.
           
           For `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`, `pi`, or `3pi/2`), the effective half-extents of the AABB is 0.035. This gives us the widest possible placement ranges on the surface. For these rotations, the x-coordinate of the object's center must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and the y-coordinate must be between -0.565 and -0.035.
           
           I will start by generating 25 placements at `theta = 0` using a grid of x and y values within these bounds, and another 25 placements at `theta = pi/2`.  Because of the square shape of the object, these two rotations will have the *same* AABB dimensions. This will allow for a good spread across the available surface area. I chose slightly shifted grid positions (compared to theta=0) for `theta=pi/2` to promote diversity in the solution. For both rotation angles, the placement can be considered stable.
           
           This should give 50 valid placements without overlaps or going outside of the surface.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 10, that needs placement on surface 0. My goal is to generate 50 stable placements. I recall the feedback on object ID 5, but that's not relevant here; no collision checks needed *yet*.
           
           The object's dimensions are roughly 0.097 x 0.097, meaning it's a square.  I'll use `s` to represent this side length (0.097). A square object's bounding box simplifies the calculations since the dimensions are the same regardless of its orientation in multiples of 90 degrees.  Half-extents `h` will be `s/2`.
           
           Surface 0 is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0). I need to figure out the valid range for the center of the square. Given the size of the object, the valid X range is between 4.2 + `h` and 4.8 - `h`, and the Y range is between -0.6 + `h` and 0.0 - `h`. 
           
           To efficiently cover the space, I'll generate two grids: one with theta = 0, and another at theta = pi/2 (90 degrees). Each grid will have 25 placements.
           
           First, I calculate `x_step` and `y_step` that divides the valid x/y range in 4 equal segments. 
           
           For the second grid I'll try to apply a different x and y step/offset to diversify. Let's start the grid at midpoint and use `x_step` and `y_step` that divides the valid x/y range in 5 equal segments, which are almost the same step size as the previous ones but will start in the midpoints of the previously considered ranges.
           
           After calculating the coordinates of the 50 object placements, I'll send the results.
