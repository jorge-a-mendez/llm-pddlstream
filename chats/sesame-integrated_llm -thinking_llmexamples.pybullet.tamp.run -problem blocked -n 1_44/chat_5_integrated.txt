           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.425, -0.194), (-4.351, -0.121)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.388, -0.158, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.023, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My objective is to ensure object `v12` is placed on surface `v18` and that its type, which is `v17`, is also true.  I can satisfy the first condition by making `on(v12, v18)` true.  I know from an axiom that `on(v12, v18)` requires `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  Fortunately, the initial state tells me that `supported(v12, #p2, v18)`. This indicates that I should place the object in some pose `#p2`.
           
           Initially, `v12` is at pose `v13`. I need to execute a pick and place action.
           
           The system has given me the plan:
           
           1.  **Move the base robot to position `#q5`**. This configuration is required for a `pick` action.
           2.  **Pick `v12` from pose `v13` using arm `v4` and bring it to `#q5`**.  The configuration of base robot needed for picking the object.
           3.  **Move the robot base from `#q5` to `#q4`**. Prepare the robot to place it in the right place.
           4.  **Place `v12` at pose `#p2` on surface `v18` with arm `v4`**.  Since `pose(v12, #p2)` is true, I will place v12 on #p2.
           
           Regarding the collision, the problem states that by default, collision preconditions are false unless explicitly stated in the initial state as true. Since no such predicates are true in the initial state, I can ignore collision concerns.
           
           For the value of pose `#p2`, since I need to give the system something to start with, I will give the value. I've considered that the surface `v18` spans from `4.2` to `4.8` in the x-axis and `-0.6` to `0.0` in the y-axis. The object to be placed has AABB from `(-4.425, -0.194)` to `(-4.351, -0.121)`. Based on these, the proposed pose `#p2` would be `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. This should ensure placement stability and avoid any collisions.
           
           Finally, the cost is calculated by summing the move-base costs (euclidean distances) and picking/placing costs. The pick and place costs are always 1, and distances will be filled in the real-world execution by the system.
