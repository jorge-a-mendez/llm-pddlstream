           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.425, -0.194), (-4.351, -0.121)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.388, -0.158, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.023, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to achieve the state described by `(new-axiom@0)`, which boils down to ensuring `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. Examining the initial state, I see that `v12` is the object in question (`type(v12, v17)` is given). Thus, I need to make `on(v12, v18)` true.  This requires placing `v12` on `v18`.  
           
           My initial analysis reveals I need to satisfy the preconditions for the `pick` and `place` actions, and ensure no collisions during the manipulation. The following plan is what I've devised:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This moves the robot's base configuration from its current state, `v3`, to a pre-defined configuration `#o3`.  This `#o3` configuration is critical because it's used in the `kin` predicates for both `pick` and `place` actions, indicating a suitable robot configuration for both operations.
           2.  **Pick Object:**  Next, I'll perform `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.  This action picks the object `v12` from its current pose `v13` using arm `v4`, grasping at grip `#o1`, using base configuration `#o3`, and following the trajectory `#o4`.
           3.  **Place Object:** Finally, I'll execute `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.  This places `v12` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.  The same arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3`, and trajectory `#o4` will be used.
           
           The key to success lies in the continuous value I need to assign `#o2`. This represents the object's pose. To avoid collisions and ensure a stable placement, I'll calculate `#o2`'s continuous value, focusing on the coordinates of object `v12` relative to the AABB box for surface `v18`. The AABB for `v18`'s range (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). `v12` has a base surface at z=0.801. I chose a reasonable center point within `v18`'s bounds: (4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0), assuming the object's reference frame has 0.0.
           
           By following this plan, I'm confident that I will successfully achieve the desired goal of `(new-axiom@0)`.  The lack of explicitly stated collision issues and available action instances ensures that the preconditions and the calculated pose `#o2` allow for execution with the initial state facts.
