           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.425, -0.194), (-4.351, -0.121)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.388, -0.158, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.023, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Orchestration of a New Axiom: A Planner's Perspective**
           
           Alright, let's dissect this. We're tasked with achieving `new-axiom@0()`, which, as I see it, boils down to placing an object, `v12`, of a particular type, `v17`, onto another object, `v18`. From the initial state and the provided axioms, it's clear that the solution hinges on successfully manipulating `v12` to satisfy the `on` predicate.
           
           My initial thought process involved breaking down the `on` axiom. The key lies in finding a pose, which I'm calling `#p2`, where `v12` is *supported* by `v18` and *at* that pose. The initial state already provides us with the supporting evidence - a pose `#p2` and the `supported` predicate true. Therefore, the task reduces to reaching that `atpose` state.
           
           Now, the current state shows that `v12` is located elsewhere, supported by `v14` at `v13`. We need to use the robot, `v4`, to reposition it. My mind immediately jumped to the standard "pick-and-place" paradigm, and the available actions confirmed this intuition: pick `v12` from its current location, and then place it at `#p2`.
           
           I've carefully considered the preconditions for these actions.  I'm assuming certain conditions are true in the problem setup for the sake of simplicity. The robot's base configuration needs adjustment, so I've identified the necessary `move_base` actions that ensure that the robot is at the correct `aconf` or `bconf` before each manipulation.  In addition, I'm assuming that no collisions will occur.
           
           *   **Move Base Actions**: These are the fundamental steps to shift the robot to the appropriate base configuration for picking and placing `v12`.
           *   **Pick Action**: This is a direct consequence of finding a plan that satisfies all the initial state's preconditions:  Moving to base config `#q5`,  picking the object at the object's current location.
           *   **Place Action**: It's a key process that will bring the robot to base config `#q4`. To place, the robot has to be situated at `#q4` before carrying out the place action.
           
           The plan thus appears to be a sequence: 1)  `move_base`, 2) `pick`, 3) `move_base`, 4) `place`.
           
           I then focused on determining a concrete pose for `#p2`. I leveraged the AABBs of both `v12` and `v18`. After a bit of calculation, I arrived at a reasonable pose within `v18`'s bounds that's safe from collision. Using common knowledge of the placing of the object, it seems correct. 
           
           In terms of cost, the plan is a function of the distances the robot has to move (with a default cost of 1 for the pick/place operations).
           I've ensured that, assuming no unforseen preconditions, the plan should succeed, delivering the desired `new-axiom@0()` outcome, and allowing the plan to successfully finish.
