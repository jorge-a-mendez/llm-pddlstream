(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a small, approximately square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is a rectangle described by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A "stable" placement, in this context, really just means the object has to be completely inside the surface's boundaries.  No collisions with other *existing* objects, which is currently a non-issue since this is the first one.
           
           I've got a good grasp of the constraints.  Placement is defined by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. `surf_idx` is easy - it's always 0.  `theta` is the rotation, and `(x, y)` are the object's center coordinates.  The tricky part is figuring out the *effective* size of the rotated object, and how that affects where I can safely place it.
           
           Since the object is basically a square, the rotated bounding box changes based on the rotation angle. At 0 and 90 degrees (and multiples of 90), the rotated bounding box is just the object's original side length (0.07). But at 45 degrees, the effective size increases.  The most I need to account for is approximately 0.099.
           
           To make sure I satisfy the *complete containment* constraint for *any* rotation, I decided to shrink the valid placement area on surface 0 by half of this maximum rotated size. This gives me a smaller, but guaranteed "safe" zone.  By choosing (x, y) coordinates from this *safe* region, I know I'm covered, regardless of the rotation.
           
           I divided the safe region into a 5x5 grid of (x,y) positions, giving me 25 unique points. For the variety of 50, I’m using two different theta angles for each of the 25 points, meaning theta = 0, and pi/4 radians. This ensures a decent variety of placements and rotations.  Surface index is surface 0 for all of them. I should be able to place 50 stable placements according to the rules this way.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Placement Plan for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, here's my game plan for positioning object ID 10, a square of roughly 0.075 x 0.075, on surface 0, while avoiding collision with the existing object, ID 5. I'll need to generate 50 stable placements.
           
           First, I analyzed object ID 10. Given its square shape, its diagonal length will be its maximum effective dimension for all rotations. I calculated this and then determined half of that diagonal length, which will be the minimum padding needed to maintain surface contact.
           
           Next, I defined the safe region on surface 0. Using the surface boundaries and the calculated padding, I created an initial bounding box.
           
           Now, the critical part: collision avoidance with object ID 5, already placed at `(0, 0.0, 4.249497474683071, -0.5505025253169292)`. I'll consider it a square too. To avoid collisions regardless of object 10's rotation, I'll calculate a "forbidden zone" around object 5. The minimum allowable distance between the centers is `half_S5 + S10_diagonal/2`. This will create a conservative exclusion zone.
           
           To find safe placements, I'll generate a grid of candidate points within the safe surface region. Then I'll check each candidate point against the "forbidden zone" to remove conflicting point. If a point is within this region, I'll discard it. If a point is valid, I'll consider placement for the object's orientations.  Since the number of valid points would be enough I'll return the first 50 configurations with orientation 0 and pi/4. I'm using a 6x5 grid, so a total of 30 candidate placements.
           
           This approach will ensure I avoid collisions by strictly separating the placements from the forbidden zone. The goal is efficient and robust placement generation with specific precision requirements.
