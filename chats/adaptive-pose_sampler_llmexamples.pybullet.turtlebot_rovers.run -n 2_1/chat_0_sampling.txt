User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (wall/bar) in the middle at x=0. Many smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the environment, especially in the top-right and top-left corners, and also around x=1 and x=-1. The goal is to find 3 base positions within a 2-unit radius of the target point. I will try to space out the positions to increase the chances of finding valid spots. I'll prioritize positions that are not directly behind the x=0 obstacle from the target's perspective. I will also try to avoid placing the robot too close to other known obstacles.

Model:     The previous target point was (-0.9754682052600275, -0.6358352220455584), but the provided feedback refers to a target point of (-2.083491325378418, 2.11426043510437). This suggests a misunderstanding in how the feedback is provided. I will assume the *new* target point is the one given in the prompt, and the previous failures were related to *that* target point. The previous positions were far from the *actual* target, which explains the "no line of sight" errors.
           
           For the *new* target point, I will try to find positions that are within the max range of 2. Given the fixed obstacles, I will try to place the robot in open areas and maintain a clear line of sight.

Model:     It appears there is a recurring issue with the feedback, as the "failed positions" from the previous round are again the positions from the *first* request, not the *second*. I will continue assuming the current target point is the one provided in the prompt and will try to find new, valid positions.
           
           The target point is in the top-left quadrant, near several small obstacles (8, 19). I will try to place the robot further away from these obstacles, while staying within the max_range of 2. I'll attempt to place the robot in open areas, perhaps slightly to the right or below the target, to avoid potential occlusions from obstacles 8 and 19.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The feedback indicates a new target point of (2.166170358657837, 1.8806207180023193). The previous proposed positions were for a different target point (-2.083, 2.114) and are quite far from this new target, hence the "no line of sight" errors. One position collided with obstacle 0 (the top wall) and obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)).
           
           The new target point (2.166, 1.880) is in the top-right quadrant, near obstacles 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and 20 ((2.128, 1.842), (2.203, 1.918)). This means positions too close to the target, especially those directly overlapping these obstacles, will fail. I'll need to find positions that are around these obstacles but still within the max_range of 2. I'll also be mindful of the outer boundary walls.
