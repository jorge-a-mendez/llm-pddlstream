(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, I've got the task: place this square object (ID 5, size about 9 cm) stably on a surface.  The surface is a square centered at the origin, from -13.5cm to +13.5cm. "Stably" means the object's AABB has to be *fully* within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object's square, the rotation angle (theta) won't *change* its bounding box's dimensions for *stability*. That's the key. Its AABB dimensions are always the same. So, for the 50 placements I need, theta's a degree of freedom.  I can use a grid for x and y placement coordinates, ensuring that each placement meets the bounds requirement. Then I can simply cycle through a few different values of theta (0, π/4, π/2, etc.) to get some rotational diversity and ensure I get 50 different poses for object ID 5.
           
           The math's straightforward:  I calculate the valid range for the object's center (x, y). That's just the surface bounds, minus half the object's side. The actual object's side is ~9.1cm so half of that is ~4.5cm. Thus, the center (x,y) must range between -8.9cm to +8.9cm.
           
           I'll generate an 8x7 grid within that range, and add rotations to each placement, ensuring exactly 50 distinct object positions are output according to the requested format.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Object Placements:**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating that Object ID 5 has been successfully placed. That means I need to factor it into my calculations to avoid collisions when placing Object ID 6. Object 5 is a square with a known position, rotation, and dimensions. Since the placement of object 5 is on the surface with an angle of 0, I can directly compute the AABB of Object 5 using its half extents, which are provided. I will use these half extents to set the bounding rectangle. Now, I have to compute the AABB for the new square object.
           
           Object 6 also has a known size, and I am aware of the surface on which I need to place it. My primary goals are to place object 6 on the surface, avoid collisions with object 5, and respect the surface boundary limitations.
           
           To ensure there are no collisions, I have calculated the available space on the surface. Now I need to take the AABB of the new object, and ensure the bounding rectangle avoids the pre-existing bounding rectangle.
           
           To solve the collision avoidance, I have to ensure that the AABB of the new object does not overlap with the AABB of object 5. This boils down to checking if the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of both objects intersect. Since the object's extents are given, I use that to compute a forbidden region for the center of the new object.
           
           After evaluating all this, the center of object 6 must satisfy a few constraints. First, the center of object 6 can be either the `x` or the `y` value greater than `-0.0019` to avoid collision. I have the surface boundaries which sets the x and y bounds for center points. So I must compute the x and y coordinates for the center point of the new object, and cycle through the possible rotation angles, based on constraints.
           
           I need to generate 50 potential placements. To do this systematically and efficiently, I will utilize a grid-based approach within the valid area, taking into consideration the collision constraint.
           I'll create an L-shaped region. The forbidden area for object 6 is where it overlaps with object 5. So I will create two rectangles where object 6 won't be colliding with object 5. I will create a grid in these two rectangles.
           To find a good distribution for the x-y coordinate positions I will create two grids.
           In the first right section, `x` ranges from -0.001 to 0.093. This gives 49 different placements plus one in the top section. For each x-y position I have the valid angle points.
           With each potential position I will associate a series of rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, etc).
           
           In summary, I'll generate a list of 50 (x, y, theta) combinations. I will filter the positions within the collision boundary, and rotate them using a set of 8 rotations.
           This approach will help me to find valid locations for object 6 while preventing it from colliding with object 5, and it respects the surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to put this new object, ID 7, on surface 0, and I need to come up with 50 stable placements.  The key is avoiding collisions with the two existing objects, ID 5 and ID 6, which are already in place.  I've got the surface dimensions: it's a square area from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 7 is pretty close to a square too, about 0.0728 units on each side, so that's what I'll assume for simplicity. That simplifies the math a bit.
           
           First, I calculated the half-extents (half the side length) for object 7, which turns out to be about 0.036.  Then, I took a look at object 5. Its center is at (-0.089, -0.089) and it’s also a square, about 0.091 units per side. I've got a minimum x and y of -0.135 and a maximum of -0.043. Next up, object 6 is located a bit off-center, with dimensions of 0.083. So the minimum and maximum ranges are different.
           
           Now, for placing the new object, I have to ensure the center of the new object is within the surface boundaries, but also make sure it doesn't overlap with the existing objects' bounding boxes. I need to make sure the center of object 7 must be in the surface boundary. So, object 7 can move within the boundary and not overlap with 5. For a new valid range, I must ensure that for a point, a minimum and maximum exist. I need to restrict the placements of object 7's center so it isn't within certain rectangles, due to the overlapping AABBs of objects 5 and 6.
           
           I generated a grid, because the problem requests 50 diverse placements, I'll put a 10x10 grid on that surface. I considered some values, then implemented code to check if a new point would collide, given the existing points. My code loops through the generated points and then checks each of the points.
           
           In summary, for each possible placement point, I've got to check if it's within the surface and ensure no overlap. I'll test each point to check if I can add the object. I'll take account of all potential overlaps of object 7, with either 5, or 6, I think this is a good approach to ensure the points are stable. I have ensured that the AABBs have been checked. Also note that since object 7 is square, the rotation does not change the bounds.

(Thoughts: **Initial Setup and Constraints**
           
           Alright, I need to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 4) on surface 0. My first step is to define the playing field: surface 0 is a square with boundaries `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 4 is also a square, with dimensions `0.09818790869538191` x `0.09818790869538188`, making its half-extent `0.049093954347690955`.
           
           **Obstacle Analysis and AABB Calculations**
           
           Crucially, the new object must not collide with other existing objects. I need to take the existing objects and their positions into account. Specifically, these objects are:
           -   **Object 5**: Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.0891772904329126, -0.0891772904329126)`. Its dimensions are `0.09164541913417479` x `0.09164541913417479`, half-extent is `0.045822709567087395`. This lets me derive the AABB of object 5, which is `[-0.135, -0.043354580865825205] x [-0.135, -0.043354580865825205]`
           
           -   **Object 6**: Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.09354927530033923, 0.006148077555635882)`. Dimensions are `0.08290144939932154` x `0.08290144939932154`, half-extent `0.04145072469966077`. AABB is `[-0.135, -0.05209855060067846] x [-0.03530264714402489, 0.04759880225529665]`.
           
           -   **Object 7**: Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.004395428861780004, -0.09855828771566084)`. Dimension is `0.07288342456867833` x `0.0728834245686783`, half-extent `0.036441712284339165`. AABB is `[-0.03204628342255916, 0.04083714114611917] x [-0.135, -0.062116575431321675]`.
           
           **Calculating Valid Placement Area**
           
           First, consider surface 0's bounds. The center of object 4 can only reside within a smaller square inside the larger surface. That "smaller surface" range is within `x: [-0.0859, 0.0859]` and `y: [-0.0859, 0.0859]`.
           
           Then, I must avoid collisions with existing objects. To accomplish this, I need to check the AABB of object 4 against each other object's AABB.
           
           I will define the AABB of the new object (4), as `[x_center - half_extent, x_center + half_extent] x [y_center - half_extent, y_center + half_extent]`. For each of the other objects, I need to check for overlaps on both the X and Y axes. If

           -   **Object 7**: Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.004395428861780004, -0.09855828771566084)`. Dimension is `0.07288342456867833` x `0.0728834245686783`, half-extent `0.036441712284339165`. AABB is `[-0.03204628342255916, 0.04083714114611917] x [-0.135, -0.062116575431321675]`.
           
           **Calculating Valid Placement Area**
           
           First, consider surface 0's bounds. The center of object 4 can only reside within a smaller square inside the larger surface. That "smaller surface" range is within `x: [-0.0859, 0.0859]` and `y: [-0.0859, 0.0859]`.
           
           Then, I must avoid collisions with existing objects. To accomplish this, I need to check the AABB of object 4 against each other object's AABB.
           
           I will define the AABB of the new object (4), as `[x_center - half_extent, x_center + half_extent] x [y_center - half_extent, y_center + half_extent]`. For each of the other objects, I need to check for overlaps on both the X and Y axes. If
