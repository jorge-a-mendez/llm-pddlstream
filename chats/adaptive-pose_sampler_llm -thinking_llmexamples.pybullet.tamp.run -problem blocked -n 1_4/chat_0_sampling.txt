           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts:** My goal is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A placement is a tuple: (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).  I need to ensure the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's boundary.
           
           Since the object is small relative to the surface (0.6 x 0.6), there are many possibilities. First, I need to calculate the bounding box of surface 0. Then, the key is understanding how the object's rotation affects its bounding box.  Since it's a square, its rotated bounding box changes with the angle `theta`.
           
           To start, I need to compute `h_eff`, the half-width and half-height of the rotated object's bounding box. For a square with side `S = 0.07`, this is:  `h_eff = 0.5 * S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The center coordinates must be adjusted to ensure the rotated object fits within the surface limits, taking into account `h_eff`.  Therefore I must find a range for the x and y coordinates.
           
           I'll choose five `theta` values: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2 to ensure even distribution of rotations.  Then, for each rotation, I'll generate 10 placements across the surface to have an even distribution. By picking the corners, center and a few other points I will create 10 placements for each rotation.  This ensures I have a good variety of angles and positions within the available surface area.
           
           I checked all the calculations, and that my math is sound. I have all the bounds for the x,y coordinates to ensure a valid placement. The final placements will consist of (0, `theta`, `x-coord`, `y-coord`). All 50 placements will be valid.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Okay, I've got a new placement request. Object ID 10 needs to find 50 stable placements on surface 0, and here's the crucial part: I *must* avoid any collision with Object ID 5, which is already placed. I remember that Object 5's successful placement at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`. It's a square with dimensions of 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           Object 10 is almost square too (0.090818 x 0.090818), so let's call the side length 0.090818. My approach involves careful calculations to determine valid placement areas.
           
           First, I'll calculate the *effective half-dimension* (`h_eff`) for Object 10, considering different rotations (`theta`). This accounts for how the object's shape changes as it rotates. Because it's square, I can simplify the `h_eff` calculation: `h_eff = 0.5 * 0.090818 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll calculate this for 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.
           
           Next, I need to account for Object 5's position, specifically the AABB. I know it occupies the region `[4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53]`. To avoid collision, I need to make sure Object 10's AABB doesn't overlap with it. I can achieve this by ensuring the center of Object 10 is *either* entirely to the right or entirely above Object 5.
           
           Therefore, the valid ranges are:
           x: `[4.2 + h_eff, 4.8 - h_eff]`. y:`[-0.6 + h_eff, 0.0 - h_eff]`
           Object 5 occupy the region:
           x: `[4.2, 4.27]`. y:`[-0.6, -0.53]`
           We need `x_min_10 >= 4.27 + h_eff` OR `y_min_10 >= -0.53 + h_eff`
           
           I'll generate 10 placement points for each of the five angles. These will be spread out and satisfy:
           1. Object 10's center is entirely to the right of Object 5, which would mean `cx >= 4.27 + h_eff`
           2. Object 10 is above Object 5, but for simplicity sake, to avoid unnecessary edge cases, points will be generated from the right range.
           I have carefully crafted a plan to ensure the placements are not just valid but also collision-free, by keeping these strategies in mind: the AABB to AABB, the effective dimensions, and the use of right and top restrictions in placing the points. With these points in place, I can be certain I generate the right plan.
