           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Frustrating Impasse**
           
           The core of the problem, as I see it, is achieving the desired configuration: four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) stacked atop v18.  My initial assessment was straightforward: to achieve `on(object, v18)`, I need to ensure `atpose(object, #o2)`. This hinges on the fact that I already know these objects are *supported* by v18 when at that specific pose.
           
           My plan was to leverage `pick` and `place` actions. I would grasp each object (currently at poses v9, v13, v15, and v17) using my robotic arm (v4), move it to the base configuration matching kin facts involving those objects, and then place them all on pose #o2. I confirmed all necessary `kin` facts are available, indicating feasible grasping and placement actions.
           
           However, the provided list of *valid* actions is severely limited: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This "move_base" action, as I understand it, does absolutely nothing beneficial. It leaves the robot in its starting base configuration. It will just waste a move.
           
           The core dilemma is clear: to manipulate objects, I **must** utilize `pick` and `place`. Yet, I am explicitly *denied* the actions I need to manipulate objects. There's no way to reach bconf #o3, meaning that the precondictions of all pick and place actions, including atbconf(q), cannot be reached, so these actions are unreachable.
           
           I'm essentially stuck. The system won't let me do what's necessary to accomplish the goal.  It seems the plan is doomed from the start because I don't have the appropriate actions to enact it.
