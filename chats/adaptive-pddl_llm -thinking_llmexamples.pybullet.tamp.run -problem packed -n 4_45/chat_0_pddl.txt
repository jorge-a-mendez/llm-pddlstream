           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is clear: to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* `v18`. From my understanding, the *on* predicate is defined by the axioms; specifically, an object is on another if it is supported and at a particular pose.
           
           First, I examined the initial state of the scenario. Right now, all those objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) are resting on `v11`. Clearly, I need to manipulate these objects to place them where I need them.
           
           I know I can pick and place objects. My initial thought was to pick each object off of `v11` and then place each onto `v18`. Looking at the object properties, they are all graspable and stackable. I have two available arms, which are both hand empty. And my base configuration is currently at `v3`.
           
           However, the allowed action instances tell a different story. The only action I'm *allowed* to perform is a base movement: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is a bit of a problem. Pick and place actions require the use of `kin`, `atraj`, and `grasp` predicates, and those aren't permitted. In essence, my permissible moves don't enable object manipulation at all.
           
           Therefore, given these restrictions, there's no way to reach the desired goal state. The required action type, which is the pick-and-place action, is disallowed. It's simply not possible.
