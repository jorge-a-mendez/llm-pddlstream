           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera (v10) and a store (v16). There are several rocks and objectives scattered around. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means:
           1. Both rovers v12 and v14 are at their initial configurations v13 and v15 respectively.
           2. Both rovers have their stores (v16) free.
           3. Images of objectives v17, v18, v19, and v20 have been received with mode v11.
           4. Rocks of type v2 (stone) and v6 (soil) have been analyzed.
           
           Let's break down the goal conditions and see how to achieve them:
           
           *   **atconf(v12, v13) and atconf(v14, v15):** Both rovers are already at these configurations in the initial state. The `move` actions listed don't change the configuration, they just indicate that the rovers can stay at their current positions (moving from a config to the same config). So these conditions are met.
           
           *   **free(v12, v16) and free(v14, v16):** Both rovers have their stores (v16) free in the initial state. So these conditions are met.
           
           *   **receivedimage(v17, v11), receivedimage(v18, v11), receivedimage(v19, v11), receivedimage(v20, v11):** To achieve these, the rovers need to:
               1.  Calibrate their camera (v10) for each objective.
               2.  Take an image of each objective (v17, v18, v19, v20) using mode v11.
               3.  Send the image to the lander (v9).
           
               Both rovers v12 and v14 have `imagevisible` predicates for all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) with configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`, and `comvisible` predicates with configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1` to the lander (v9). We should use these configurations. Since rover v12 has `atconf(v12, v13)` and rover v14 has `atconf(v14, v15)`, we'll need to define the continuous values for `#o0` and `#o3` for each rover if we use them. Since all given `move` actions are self-moves, we won't be changing the rover's configuration to a fixed one. We'll use the `#o` configurations for imaging and communication.
           
           *   **type(?stone, v2), receivedanalysis(?stone), type(?soil, v6), receivedanalysis(?soil):** To achieve these, the rovers need to:
               1.  Sample a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil).
               2.  Send the analysis for both types.
           
               In the initial state:
               *   Rocks of type `v2` (stone) are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
               *   Rocks of type `v6` (soil) are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
               Both rovers v12 and v14 are `above` all these rocks with configuration `#o5`. This means they can sample any of them. We'll need to define the continuous value for `#o5` for each rover if we use it.
           
           Given the available actions, we cannot use `move` actions to reach a specific configuration from the initial configuration unless it's a self-move. However, the initial state gives us configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for rovers `v12` and `v14` as valid for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates respectively. This implies that these configurations are reachable or are the current "working" configurations for these specific tasks, or that they are directly reachable from `v13` and `v15` respectively for the purposes of these actions. Since the only `move` actions are self-moves, we assume that the rovers can perform the `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions from their current `atconf` (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) using the `#o` configurations which would be "sub-actions" or specific poses within their current location.
           
           Let's plan the steps:
           
           1.  **Handle images:** Rover v12 can handle all image-related tasks. It has onboard camera v10 which supports mode v11.
               *   Calibrate v10 for v17 using #o3, #o4.
               *   Take image of v17 with v10, v11.
               *   Send image of v17 to v9 from #o0, #o1.
               *   Repeat for v18, v19, v20.
           
           2.  **Handle analysis:** Rover v12 can also handle analysis.
               *   Sample a stone (e.g., v1, which is above v12 at #o5).
               *   Send analysis of v1 to v9 from #o0, #o1.
               *   Sample a soil (e.g., v5, which is above v12 at #o5).
               *   Send analysis of v5 to v9 from #o0, #o1.
           
           We will use rover `v12` because it's simpler to use one rover for all tasks if possible. Since the `atconf` of `v12` is `v13`, and the actions specify `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, these will be considered as reachable poses or sub-configurations from `v13`.
           
           For each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), we need to calibrate, take an image, and send it.
           For each rock type (`v2` and `v6`), we need to sample and send analysis.
           
           There are no obstructions indicated for the rays.
           Maximum distance for `imagevisible` is 2, for `comvisible` is 4.
           The AABB values for the objectives are:
           v17: ((1.835, 1.83), (1.934, 1.929))
           v18: ((-2.203, 2.014), (-2.12, 2.098))
           v19: ((0.279, 1.867), (0.361, 1.949))
           v20: ((-0.486, 1.908), (-0.396, 1.998))
           Lander v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           Rover v12 current position (v13): (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)
           Rover v14 current position (v15): (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>)`:
           The rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75).
           v17: (1.8845, 1.8795) - distance is sqrt((1.8845-1.0)^2 + (1.8795 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.782 + 13.208) = sqrt(13.99) approx 3.74. This is too far for `imagevisible` (max 2).
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The initial state lists `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v20)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v19)`, `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)`. This suggests that the range is satisfied for these pairs, despite the Euclidean distance calculation. The system provides `imagevisible` predicates, so we assume the conditions are met when these predicates are present.
           
           Let's try to use rover v12 for imaging all objectives and rover v14 for sampling and analysis.
           For rover v12 to image:
           It needs to be at a configuration where it has line of sight to the objective. `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>)` are given. This means `#o3` is a valid configuration for `v12` to take images. `atconf(v12, v13)` implies `v13` is the current configuration, but we are given `conf(v12, #o3)` meaning `#o3` is a valid *potential* configuration. Since the `move` actions are self-loops, we'll assume `v12` can reach `#o3` or is capable of performing imaging from `v13` as if it's at `#o3`.
           The same logic applies to `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Rover v12 can communicate from `#o0`.
           For `sample_rock`, `above(v12, #o5, <rock>)` means rover v12 can sample the rock from `#o5`.
           
           It seems safer to consider the `atconf` predicates as the robot's current location and that the `#oX` configurations are specific viewpoints/poses accessible from the current location for the respective actions, so we use those in the plan.
           
           For analysis:
           Rocks of type v2 (stone): v1, v3, v4. v12 is above v1, v3, v4 from #o5.
           Rocks of type v6 (soil): v5, v7, v8. v12 is above v5, v7, v8 from #o5.
           Let's choose `v1` for stone analysis and `v5` for soil analysis.
           
           Plan:
           1.  **Rover v12 - Image tasks:**
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v17` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
               *   Take image of `v17` using `v10` and `v11`.
               *   Send image of `v17` from `#o0` with ray `#o1` to `v9`.
               *   Repeat for `v18`, `v19`, `v20`.
           2.  **Rover v12 - Sample and Analyze tasks:**
               *   Sample rock `v1` (type `v2`) at `#o5`.
               *   Send analysis of `v1` from `#o0` with ray `#o1` to `v9`.
               *   Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`) at `#o5`.
               *   Send analysis of `v5` from `#o0` with ray `#o1` to `v9`.
           
           We need to provide configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for rover `v12`.
           
           For `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`):
           Target `v17` (1.8845, 1.8795). Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Target `v18` (-2.1615, 2.056). Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Target `v19` (0.32, 1.908). Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Target `v20` (-0.441, 1.953). Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           Since `imagevisible` and `imagerange` are given for `v12` at `#o3` to all these objectives, we need a single `#o3` configuration for `v12` that can see all objectives. This is generally difficult for a single configuration point given widely distributed targets. However, the problem statement says "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This means for each `imagevisible` action instance using `#o3`, we need a specific value for `#o3` (if it's tied to a target). But the initial state has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` etc., with the same `#o3`. This implies `#o3` is a configuration that *can* see all of them, or the model implies it's a "generic" imaging config that is valid given the predicates. To be safe, I'll provide a configuration for each (rover, target) pair.
           
           Let's assume the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates with `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` indicate that these are poses from which the actions can be performed, and the `atconf` simply means the rover's base is at that location. We don't have to move the base `v12` from `v13`.
           
           Let's calculate a suitable configuration for `v12` for imaging. Given the `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), an imaging configuration for `#o3` should be within 2 units.
           For `v17` (1.8845, 1.8795): The current distance is ~3.74, which exceeds 2. This implies the given `imagerange` and `imagevisible` predicates are *not* from the `v13` configuration but from some other configuration, which is `#o3`. Since `#o3` must be collision-free and reachable from `v13`, and within range, I must provide one.
           
           This is a critical point: If `imagerange` is true for `v12, #o3, v17`, then `#o3` must be close to `v17` (within 2 units) and reachable from `v13`.
           
           Let's try to find a single `#o3` near the center of the objectives, then check reachability from v13.
           Center of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`:
           `v17`: (1.8845, 1.8795)
           `v18`: (-2.1615, 2.056)
           `v19`: (0.32, 1.908)
           `v20`: (-0.441, 1.953)
           Average X: (1.8845 - 2.1615 + 0.32 - 0.441) / 4 = -0.0995 / 4 = -0.024875
           Average Y: (1.8795 + 2.056 + 1.908 + 1.953) / 4 = 7.7965 / 4 = 1.949125
           So a central point is roughly (-0.025, 1.95).
           Distance from v13 (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.025, 1.95): sqrt((1.0 - (-0.025))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.95)^2) = sqrt((1.025)^2 + (-3.7)^2) = sqrt(1.05 + 13.69) = sqrt(14.74) approx 3.83. This is still quite far.
           
           The problem statement implies if `conf(rover, #name)` is in initial state AND `#name` is second argument to `imagevisible` OR `comvisible`, *then* I must provide a continuous value. So `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)` are present, thus I must provide them.
           
           Let's re-read: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           
           The objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` are far from `v12`'s initial position `v13`. But the `imagevisible` predicates are *given*. This means the system already knows that a valid configuration `#o3` exists for `v12` to see them. I just need to provide a value.
           To be within 2 units, for `v17` ((1.835, 1.83), (1.934, 1.929)), I'd pick `#o3` as (1.0, 1.8) for `v12`. Dist to v17 center (1.88, 1.87) is sqrt((1.88-1)^2 + (1.87-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.88^2 + 0.07^2) = sqrt(0.7744 + 0.0049) = sqrt(0.7793) approx 0.88. This is within range.
           For `v18` ((-2.203, 2.014), (-2.12, 2.098)), `#o3` as (-2.0, 2.0). Dist to v18 center (-2.16, 2.05) is sqrt((-2.16 - (-2))^2 + (2.05-2)^2) = sqrt(-0.16^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(0.0256 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.0281) approx 0.16. Within range.
           For `v19` ((0.279, 1.867), (0.361, 1.949)), `#o3` as (0.3, 1.8). Dist to v19 center (0.32, 1.90) is sqrt((0.32-0.3)^2 + (1.9-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.02^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(0.0004 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.0104) approx 0.1. Within range.
           For `v20` ((-0.486, 1.908), (-0.396, 1.998)), `#o3` as (-0.4, 1.9). Dist to v20 center (-0.44, 1.95) is sqrt((-0.44 - (-0.4))^2 + (1.95-1.9)^2) = sqrt(-0.04^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(0.0016 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.0041) approx 0.06. Within range.
           
           It seems I *must* provide a separate `#o3` for each target if the problem states "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". The initial state has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`, etc., with the same `#o3`. This is ambiguous. I will try to provide separate configurations for each (rover, target) pair as specified. Let's name them `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, `#o3_v19`, `#o3_v20`.
           
           For `#o0` (communicating with `v9`): `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75).
           Distance to center of `v9` (-1.9, -2.0) is sqrt((1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(2.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) approx 2.91. This is within `comrange` (max 4). So `v12` can communicate from `v13` to `v9`. But the problem specifies `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So I'll specify `#o0` to be `v13`.
           
           For `#o5` (sampling `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`):
           `above(v12, #o5, v7)` etc. `v7` is ((-1.213, 1.941), (-1.077, 2.077)). `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). This is also far.
           Again, the `above` predicate states that `#o5` exists.
           I will set `#o5` to be close to the rocks, and assume it's reachable. To sample `v1` ((-0.921, -0.678), (-0.819, -0.575)), for example, I will pick a point close to `v1`. Rover `v12` at (1.0, -1.75).
           Let's choose a point common for sampling if possible. If not, pick one for the first rock sampled and assume it's valid for all given `above` predicates. I'll pick one near `v1` as an example.
           `v1` center is (-0.87, -0.62). I'll choose `#o5` as (-0.87, -0.62) for `v12` to sample `v1`.
           
           Let's refine the plan and configurations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3_v17 #o4_v17 v17 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3_v17 #o4_v17 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0_v17 #o1_v17 v9 v17 v11) , (calibrate v12 #o3_v18 #o4_v18 v18 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3_v18 #o4_v18 v18 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0_v18 #o1_v18 v9 v18 v11) , (calibrate v12 #o3_v19 #o4_v19 v19 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3_v19 #o4_v19 v19 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0_v19 #o1_v19 v9 v19 v11) , (calibrate v12 #o3_v20 #o4_v20 v20 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3_v20 #o4_v20 v20 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0_v20 #o1_v20 v9 v20 v11) , (sample_rock v12 #o5_v1 v1 v16) , (send_analysis v12 #o0_v1 #o1_v1 v9 v1) , (sample_rock v12 #o5_v5 v5 v16) , (send_analysis v12 #o0_v5 #o1_v5 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid actions only includes `move` actions which are self-loops and `drop_rock` actions. The goal requires taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis. None of these actions are available in the list of valid actions. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` predicates for `v17, v18, v19, v20` and `receivedanalysis` predicates for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`. The only way to achieve these is through `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, none of which are in the provided list of valid actions. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
