           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of Plan Feasibility**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but looking at the definition, I'm faced with several conditions, some of which are already met in the initial state. The crux lies in achieving the image and analysis reception predicates: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` & `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The crucial issue here is the limited action instances I'm allowed to use. I only have access to `move` actions that don't actually change anything, and `drop_rock` actions which are inapplicable in the initial state. Crucially, I'm *not* given access to essential actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. These are exactly the actions I need to achieve the image and analysis goals.
           
           Consider this: to get `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, I need `send_image`. But `send_image` is not among the allowed action instances! Similarly, to get `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, I need `send_analysis`, which relies on `sample_rock` which is unavailable.
           
           The constraints are clear: I *must* only use the provided action instances. And the goal explicitly requires me to have `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates true. However, the available actions cannot achieve these predicates. The list of allowed actions restricts me to actions which are useless in this particular task. This is clearly a case of being set up for failure. Therefore, the goal is simply unachievable with the provided actions. The plan, if one could be formed, would be entirely unsatisfiable as it cannot contain any actions necessary for achievement.
