           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with sides of approximately 0.097.
           
           To find stable placements, I will consider placing the object on surface 0. Since the object is square and the surface is square, the object can be placed at various positions and orientations. I will prioritize placing it in the center or near the center, and then move outwards. I will also vary the rotation, including 0, pi/2, and pi/4, as these are common stable orientations for square objects.
           
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a side length of 0.09735.
           For a rotation of 0 or pi/2, the half-extents of the object will be 0.09735 / 2 = 0.048675.
           This means the x-coordinates can range from -0.135 + 0.048675 to 0.135 - 0.048675, which is -0.086325 to 0.086325.
           The same range applies to the y-coordinates.
           
           For a rotation of pi/4, the effective half-extents along x and y will be (0.09735 / sqrt(2)) / 2 * 2 = 0.09735 / sqrt(2) = 0.06883.
           So, the x-coordinates can range from -0.135 + 0.06883 to 0.135 - 0.06883, which is -0.06617 to 0.06617.
           The same range applies to the y-coordinates.
           
           I will generate a diverse set of placements, varying the x, y, and theta.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Now I need to place object 5, which is also a square, but smaller (0.0706 vs 0.09735). I must ensure that object 5 does not collide with object 7, which is centered at the origin.
           
           Since object 7 is at (0, 0, 0) with extents (0.09735, 0.09735), its AABB is from -0.048675 to 0.048675 in both x and y.
           The new object 5 has extents (0.0706, 0.0706). Its half-extents are 0.0706 / 2 = 0.0353.
           
           To avoid collision with object 7, the new object 5 must be placed such that its AABB does not overlap with object 7's AABB. This means its x or y coordinates must be outside the range of approximately +/- 0.048675. Considering the half-extents of object 5, this means the center of object 5 must be at least 0.048675 + 0.0353 = 0.083975 away from the origin in x or y.
           
           The surface 0 has bounds from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 5 (half-extents 0.0353), the valid range for its center (without considering object 7) is from -0.135 + 0.0353 to 0.135 - 0.0353, which is -0.0997 to 0.0997.
           
           Combining the constraints:
           - x and y must be between -0.0997 and 0.0997.
           - abs(x) must be >= 0.083975 OR abs(y) must be >= 0.083975.
           
           This means the placement must be near the edges of the surface, but outside the central region occupied by object 7. I will try placing object 5 along the edges of the surface, outside the area occupied by object 7.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0). Now I need to place object 4, which is a square with sides of approximately 0.0931. I must ensure that object 4 does not collide with object 7 or object 5.
           
           Let's review the current occupied space:
           - Object 7 (ID 7): Centered at (0, 0), extents (0.09735, 0.09735). Half-extents: 0.048675. Its AABB is approximately [-0.048675, 0.048675] in x and y.
           - Object 5 (ID 5): Centered at (0.09, 0), extents (0.0706, 0.0706). Half-extents: 0.0353. Its AABB is approximately [0.09 - 0.0353, 0.09 + 0.0353] in x, which is [0.0547, 0.1253], and [-0.0353, 0.0353] in y.
           
           The new object 4 has extents (0.0931, 0.0931). Its half-extents are 0.0931 / 2 = 0.04655.
           The surface 0 has bounds from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The valid range for object 4's center (without considering other objects) is from -0.135 + 0.04655 to 0.135 - 0.04655, which is -0.08845 to 0.08845 in both x and y.
           
           Now let's consider the collision avoidance:
           - Collision with object 7: Object 4's AABB should not overlap with object 7's AABB ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]). This means object 4's center x or y must be at least 0.048675 + 0.04655 = 0.095225 away from the origin.
           - Collision with object 5: Object 4's AABB should not overlap with object 5's AABB ([0.0547, 0.1253] x [-0.0353, 0.0353]).
             - If object 4 is placed such that its center x is C_x and its center y is C_y:
             - C_x + 0.04655 < 0.0547 OR C_x - 0.04655 > 0.1253
             - OR C_y + 0.04655 < -0.0353 OR C_y - 0.04655 > 0.0353
           
           Let's look for placement possibilities:
           - The region around x=0, y=0 is blocked by object 7.
           - The region around x=0.09, y=0 is blocked by object 5.
           
           Given the constraints, I will try placing object 4 in the remaining "corners" or along the edges, far from both object 7 and object 5.
           For example, a placement at (0, 0.09) would have its AABB as [-0.04655, 0.04655] x [0.09-0.04655, 0.09+0.04655] = [-0.04655, 0.04655] x [0.04345, 0.13655].
           - This would not collide with object 7 (x overlaps, but y is clear: 0.04345 > 0.048675 is False, actually, so there is an overlap in Y. For X, the y range of O7 is [-0.048675, 0.048675] while the y range of O4 is [0.04345, 0.13655]. There is no overlap here.)
           - This would not collide with object 5 (x range of O5 is [0.0547, 0.1253], x range of O4 is [-0.04655, 0.04655]. No overlap in x). So, (0, 0.09) seems promising.
           
           Let's try (0, -0.09), (0.09, 0.09), (-0.09, 0.09), etc.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09)

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0), and object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09). Now I need to place object 8, which is a square with sides of approximately 0.0967. I must ensure that object 8 does not collide with object 7, object 5, or object 4.
           
           Let's review the current occupied space:
           - Object 7 (ID 7): Centered at (0, 0), extents (0.09735, 0.09735). Half-extents: 0.048675. Its AABB is approximately [-0.048675, 0.048675] in x and y.
           - Object 5 (ID 5): Centered at (0.09, 0), extents (0.0706, 0.0706). Half-extents: 0.0353. Its AABB is approximately [0.09 - 0.0353, 0.09 + 0.0353] in x, which is [0.0547, 0.1253], and [-0.0353, 0.0353] in y.
           - Object 4 (ID 4): Centered at (0, 0.09), extents (0.0931, 0.0931). Half-extents: 0.04655. Its AABB is approximately [-0.04655, 0.04655] in x, and [0.09 - 0.04655, 0.09 + 0.04655] in y, which is [0.04345, 0.13655].
           
           The new object 8 has extents (0.09669, 0.09669). Its half-extents are 0.09669 / 2 = 0.048345.
           The surface 0 has bounds from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The valid range for object 8's center (without considering other objects) is from -0.135 + 0.048345 to 0.135 - 0.048345, which is -0.086655 to 0.086655 in both x and y.
           
           Now let's consider the collision avoidance. The "corners" of the surface seem like the most promising areas.
           - Try placing object 8 at (-0.09, 0.0)
             - O8 AABB if placed at (-0.09,0): [-0.09-0.048345, -0.09+0.048345] x [-0.048345, 0.048345] = [-0.138345, -0.041655] x [-0.048345, 0.048345]
             - Collision with O7 ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]): There is an x overlap between [-0.048675, 0.048675] and [-0.041655, -0.041655] (specifically at x = -0.041655). The y ranges overlap. So this is a collision. My calculation for collision avoidance must be precise. The left edge of O7 is -0.048675, the right edge is 0.048675. The left edge of O8 is -0.138345, the right edge is -0.041655. The right edge of O8 (at -0.041655) overlaps with the left part of O7 (-0.048675 to -0.041655). So, placing at (-0.09,0) will collide.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 8 must be far enough from the centers of the other objects.
           - From O7 (0,0), O8 center must be at least 0.048675 (O7 half-extent) + 0.048345 (O8 half-extent) = 0.09702 in x or y.
           - From O5 (0.09,0), O8 center must be at least 0.0353 (O5 half-extent) + 0.048345 (O8 half-extent) = 0.083645 away.
             - O5 occupies x from 0.0547 to 0.1253.
             - If O8 is at (-0.09, 0), its x-range is [-0.138345, -0.041655]. No x overlap with O5.
           - From O4 (0,0.09), O8 center must be at least 0.04655 (O4 half-extent) + 0.048345 (O8 half-extent) = 0.094895 away.
             - O4 occupies y from 0.04345 to 0.13655.
             - If O8 is at (-0.09, 0), its y-range is [-0.048345, 0.048345]. No y overlap with O4.
           
           It seems the x-range for an object centered at x=-0.09 with half-extent 0.048345 is indeed [-0.138345, -0.041655]. This *does* overlap with object 7's x-range [-0.048675, 0.048675]. The overlap is between x=-0.048675 and x=-0.041655. So (-0.09, 0) is not a valid placement due to collision with object 7.
           
           Let's rethink the placements that satisfy the non-collision rule for O7. Object 8's center must be such that its closest edge is outside 0.048675 in both directions for X and Y, or 0.09702 from the origin.
           So, valid center positions C_x, C_y:
           - abs(C_x) >= 0.09702
           - abs(C_y) >= 0.09702
           The total available range for object 8's center is [-0.086655, 0.086655].
           This means there is no place to put object 8 if it's placed in a cardinal alignment (0 or pi/2 rotation) and its center must be 0.09702 away from (0,0). This means the object is too big to be placed without touching object 7 in a cardinal alignment.
           
           However, if I rotate object 8 by pi/4, its effective half-extents will be 0.09669 / sqrt(2) = 0.06836.
           Then the total available range for object 8's center in x and y is -0.135 + 0.06836 to 0.135 - 0.06836, which is -0.06664 to 0.06664.
           And to avoid O7, the O8 center needs to be at least (0.048675 + 0.06836) = 0.117035 away from (0,0) in x or y. This also won't fit within the -0.06664 to 0.06664 range.
           
           This means object 8 is generally "too big" to be placed in any simple cardinal or 45-degree angle without overlapping the central object 7, if using an AABB approximation and the centers must be separate by half-width sums.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision logic. If I place object 8 at (-0.08, 0.08) with 0 rotation:
           O8 AABB: [-0.08-0.048345, -0.08+0.048345] x [0.08-0.048345, 0.08+0.048345]
           = [-0.128345, -0.031655] x [0.031655, 0.128345]
           
           Check collision with O7 ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]):
           - X overlap: O8_x_max (-0.031655) > O7_x_min (-0.048675) AND O8_x_min (-0.128345) < O7_x_max (0.048675). So there is an x overlap from -0.048675 to -0.031655.
           - Y overlap: O8_y_max (0.128345) > O7_y_min (-0.048675) AND O8_y_min (0.031655) < O7_y_max (0.048675). So there is a y overlap from 0.031655 to 0.048675.
           Since there is both an x and y overlap, this placement collides with O7.
           
           It seems I need to place object 8 entirely outside the AABB of object 7, object 5, and object 4.
           The combined occupied space (AABB union) currently is:
           O7: [-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]
           O5: [0.0547, 0.1253] x [-0.0353, 0.0353]
           O4: [-0.04655, 0.04655] x [0.04345, 0.13655]
           
           The object 8 (half-extent 0.048345) must be placed such that its AABB doesn't overlap any of these.
           Let's analyze the space available.
           - Left side of surface: x from -0.135 to -0.048675 (left of O7)
           - Right side of surface: x from 0.048675 to 0.135 (right of O7)
           - Bottom side of surface: y from -0.135 to -0.048675 (below O7)
           - Top side of surface: y from 0.048675 to 0.135 (above O7)
           
           The area around (0.09,0) is occupied by O5.
           The area around (0,0.09) is occupied by O4.
           
           Consider the region around (-0.09, -0.09).
           A placement candidate: (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)
           O8 AABB: [-0.09-0.048345, -0.09+0.048345] x [-0.09-0.048345, -0.09+0.048345]
           = [-0.138345, -0.041655] x [-0.138345, -0.041655]
           
           Check collision with O7 ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]):
           - X overlap: Yes, [-0.048675, -0.041655]
           - Y overlap: Yes, [-0.048675, -0.041655]
           So this placement also collides with O7.
           
           It seems the object ID 8 is too large to fit in any of the remaining quadrants without overlapping object 7, when using cardinal alignments.
           Let's re-examine the collision rule: "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface". The collision detection for objects uses AABB.
           For a square object of side `s` and a square obstacle of side `S`, placed at origin. If `s/2 + S/2 > surface_half_size`, then it is not possible to place the object without overlap if one is in the center. Here `0.048345 + 0.048675 = 0.09702`. The surface half size is 0.135.
           The maximum valid center coordinate for object 8 is `0.135 - 0.048345 = 0.086655`.
           For object 8 to avoid object 7, its minimum distance from origin in x or y is `0.048675 + 0.048345 = 0.09702`.
           Since `0.086655 < 0.09702`, this implies that object 8 cannot be placed in a cardinal orientation without colliding with object 7, even if it fits on the surface.
           
           This is a tricky situation. The only way it could work is if the collision detection is not strictly AABB, or if it allows a tiny bit of overlap. Or perhaps, the provided feedback is not a hard "no collision with any fixed object, ever" but "no collision with *fixed* objects known by the system and *not* with other objects I placed unless they become fixed objects".
           However, the prompt states "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", and "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". This implies I need to respect the AABB based collision model with other placed objects.
           
           Given the calculation, there is no place to put object 8 if it's placed with 0 or pi/2 rotation.
           What about pi/4 rotation?
           Object 8 half-extents for pi/4: 0.09669 / sqrt(2) = 0.06836.
           Surface limits for center: -0.135 + 0.06836 = -0.06664 to 0.135 - 0.06836 = 0.06664.
           To avoid O7 (AABB [-0.048675, 0.048675]^2), the center of O8 (rotated) needs to be at least `0.048675 + 0.06836 = 0.117035` from the origin in x or y. This is also impossible because `0.06664 < 0.117035`.
           
           It appears that object 8 cannot be placed on surface 0 without colliding with object 7.
           However, the problem states "You never give up." and "you will always try to find a new placement."
           It is possible that the AABB collision check is less strict than my calculation, or there's a small margin for error, or I am misunderstanding the problem.
           
           I will try to place it at the furthest corners, assuming there's a tiny bit of space or my mental AABB calculation is overly conservative. Let's try placing it near the corners that are "free" of previously placed objects: (-0.08, -0.08), or (-0.08, 0.08), or (0.08, -0.08). The last one (0.08, -0.08) might collide with O5 (centered at (0.09,0)).
           
           Let's pick (-0.08, -0.08).
           O8 AABB centered at (-0.08,-0.08) with 0 rotation:
           [-0.08 - 0.048345, -0.08 + 0.048345] x [-0.08 - 0.048345, -0.08 + 0.048345]
           = [-0.128345, -0.031655] x [-0.128345, -0.031655]
           This still has X and Y overlap with O7's AABB [-0.048675, 0.048675]^2.
           X overlap: [-0.048675, -0.031655]
           Y overlap: [-0.048675, -0.031655]
           
           This is a problem. The instructions say "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           If object 8's minimum half-extent (0.048345) plus object 7's half-extent (0.048675) is 0.09702, and the surface extends only 0.135 in each direction, and its center range is up to 0.086655, then I cannot place object 8 without colliding with object 7. This is a geometric impossibility with the current constraints and if AABB collision is strictly applied.
           
           Is there any possibility that the 'extents' are *radius* and not full size? No, it clearly states (size_x, size_y).
           
           Let me try to find a placement anyway, even if my calculations suggest it's impossible. I will try the corner of the surface that is furthest from the other objects.
           The objects are at (0,0), (0.09,0), (0,0.09). This means the quadrant (-x, -y) is least occupied.
           Let's try center coordinates close to the bounds of the surface but in that quadrant.
           Max for center_x for O8: 0.086655. Max for center_y for O8: 0.086655.
           So, try something like (-0.08, -0.08) again, or push it even further to (-0.086, -0.086).
           O8 AABB centered at (-0.086, -0.086) with 0 rotation:
           [-0.086 - 0.048345, -0.086 + 0.048345] x [-0.086 - 0.048345, -0.086 + 0.048345]
           = [-0.134345, -0.037655] x [-0.134345, -0.037655]
           Still overlaps with O7. Overlap is [-0.048675, -0.037655] for X and Y.
           
           This implies that with a standard AABB collision, object 8 cannot be placed.
           However, the problem statement "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." suggests I should still provide a list of placements. Perhaps the collision checker is more forgiving than my calculations, or there is a scenario where my interpretation of 'collision' or 'fixed obstacles' is wrong.
           
           I will try placements that minimize the overlap with object 7. These will be at the maximum possible coordinates away from object 7, but still within surface bounds.
           I will use the coordinates x = -0.086 and y = -0.086 as they are close to the edge of the surface for object 8.
           I'll also include rotations to see if that helps, though my rotation math also suggests it's impossible.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     My previous calculations indicated that placing object 8 was impossible without collision with object 7, but a placement `(ID: 8) -- 0, 0.0, -0.086, -0.086` was successful. This indicates that my AABB collision calculation was too conservative, or there's a slight tolerance in the collision detection. This is valuable information.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the successful placement of object 8.
           The current occupied space:
           - Object 7 (ID 7): Centered at (0, 0), extents (0.09735, 0.09735). Half-extents: 0.048675. AABB: [-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675].
           - Object 5 (ID 5): Centered at (0.09, 0), extents (0.0706, 0.0706). Half-extents: 0.0353. AABB: [0.0547, 0.1253] x [-0.0353, 0.0353].
           - Object 4 (ID 4): Centered at (0, 0.09), extents (0.0931, 0.0931). Half-extents: 0.04655. AABB: [-0.04655, 0.04655] x [0.04345, 0.13655].
           - Object 8 (ID 8): Centered at (-0.086, -0.086), extents (0.09669, 0.09669). Half-extents: 0.048345. AABB: [-0.134345, -0.037655] x [-0.134345, -0.037655].
           
           The new object 6 has extents (0.09867, 0.09867). Its half-extents are 0.09867 / 2 = 0.049335.
           The surface 0 has bounds from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The valid range for object 6's center (without considering other objects) is from -0.135 + 0.049335 to 0.135 - 0.049335, which is -0.085665 to 0.085665 in both x and y.
           
           Since object 8 was successfully placed at (-0.086, -0.086) despite my collision predictions, it means there's a small gap that my calculations missed or a tolerance. The successful placement of O8 showed its AABB x-range [-0.134345, -0.037655] and O7's x-range [-0.048675, 0.048675] could exist simultaneously. The overlap was from -0.048675 to -0.037655. This implies the collision check uses a slightly different criterion, or a very small overlap is permitted.
           
           Now, let's try to place object 6. It is slightly larger than object 8 and object 7.
           Half-extents O6: 0.049335
           Half-extents O7: 0.048675
           Half-extents O5: 0.0353
           Half-extents O4: 0.04655
           Half-extents O8: 0.048345
           
           Let's target the remaining corners, for instance, (0.086, -0.086) or (0.086, 0.086) or even (-0.086, 0.086).
           The quadrants occupied are:
           - (0,0) by O7
           - (+x, 0) by O5
           - (0, +y) by O4
           - (-x, -y) by O8
           
           The remaining available corner regions seem to be:
           1. (+x, -y)
           2. (-x, +y)
           
           Let's try to place O6 at (0.08, -0.08) for example.
           O6 AABB at (0.08, -0.08) (0 rotation):
           [-0.049335 + 0.08, 0.049335 + 0.08] x [-0.049335 - 0.08, 0.049335 - 0.08]
           = [0.030665, 0.129335] x [-0.129335, -0.030665]
           
           Check collisions:
           - With O7 ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]):
             - X overlap: No. O6_x_min (0.030665) > O7_x_max (0.048675) is False. Overlap from 0.030665 to 0.048675 for X.
             - Y overlap: O6_y_max (-0.030665) > O7_y_min (-0.048675). Overlap from -0.048675 to -0.030665 for Y.
             - This suggests a collision with O7 based on my conservative AABB calculation. However, O8 was allowed to slightly overlap. This suggests there is a region of 'allowed' slight overlap near the edges of O7.
           
           Let's try (0.086, -0.086) which is symmetric to O8's successful placement.
           O6 AABB at (0.086, -0.086) (0 rotation):
           [0.086 - 0.049335, 0.086 + 0.049335] x [-0.086 - 0.049335, -0.086 + 0.049335]
           = [0.036665, 0.135335] x [-0.135335, -0.036665]
           
           Check collisions:
           - With O7 ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]):
             - X overlap: O6_x_min (0.036665) < O7_x_max (0.048675). Overlap from 0.036665 to 0.048675 for X.
             - Y overlap: O6_y_max (-0.036665) > O7_y_min (-0.048675). Overlap from -0.048675 to -0.036665 for Y.
             - Still indicates collision with O7.
           
           - With O5 ([0.0547, 0.1253] x [-0.0353, 0.0353]):
             - X overlap: O6_x_min (0.036665) < O5_x_max (0.1253) AND O6_x_max (0.135335) > O5_x_min (0.0547). So overlap.
             - Y overlap: O6_y_max (-0.036665) < O5_y_max (0.0353) AND O6_y_min (-0.135335) < O5_y_min (-0.0353). So overlap (O5_y_min, O5_y_max: [-0.0353, 0.0353]). O6_y_max (-0.036665) is less than O5_y_max (0.0353) but also less than O5_y_min (-0.0353). So no Y overlap.
             - This means it's possible to avoid O5 in Y, but there is X overlap.
               - O5 x: [0.0547, 0.1253]
               - O6 x: [0.036665, 0.135335]
               - Overlap: [0.0547, 0.1253]
               So it collides with O5.
           
           This is very challenging because O6 is large. The successful placement of O8 suggests that an overlap of about (0.048675 - 0.037655) = 0.011 units is tolerated.
           This means that if O8's edge was at -0.037655, and O7's edge was at -0.048675, they were considered non-colliding.
           
           Let's apply this tolerance. The distance from the center for O6 to avoid O7 must be:
           0.048675 (O7_half_extent) + 0.049335 (O6_half_extent) - tolerance.
           If the tolerance is ~0.011, then the required distance is 0.09801 - 0.011 = 0.08701.
           The maximum placement for the center for O6 is 0.085665.
           This still means that even with the observed tolerance, placing it along cardinal directions with a single axis displacement is not possible without touching O7.
           
           This suggests that O6 might need to be placed in a corner where it has minimal overlap with the "thin" parts of other objects.
           The only places left are the corners, near (0.086, -0.086), (-0.086, 0.086).
           Let's try to place it at (-0.086, 0.086).
           O6 AABB at (-0.086, 0.086) (0 rotation):
           [-0.135335, -0.036665] x [0.036665, 0.135335]
           
           Check collisions:
           - With O7 ([-0.048675, 0.048675] x [-0.048675, 0.048675]):
             - X overlap: O6_x_max (-0.036665) > O7_x_min (-0.048675). Overlap [-0.048675, -0.036665].
             - Y overlap: O6_y_min (0.036665) < O7_y_max (0.048675). Overlap [0.036665, 0.048675].
             - This again predicts collision with O7, but this is the same amount of overlap as O8's successful placement (0.011 distance between the edges). So this location (-0.086, 0.086) might actually work.
           
           - With O4 ([-0.04655, 0.04655] x [0.04345, 0.13655]):
             - O6_x_range: [-0.135335, -0.036665]
             - O4_x_range: [-0.04655, 0.04655]
             - X overlap: Yes, [-0.04655, -0.036665].
             - O6_y_range: [0.036665, 0.135335]
             - O4_y_range: [0.04345, 0.13655]
             - Y overlap: Yes, [0.04345, 0.135335].
             - This means it significantly collides with O4, as both x and y ranges overlap significantly beyond the small tolerance. So (-0.086, 0.086) is unlikely to work due to O4.
           
           Let's try to place it such that it is in the "corner" but primarily displaced in one axis to avoid a "big object" and then the other axis for the other.
           This is getting complicated. I will trust the system's tolerance and generate placements in the remaining regions that are roughly symmetrical to the successful placement of O8.
           
           The only remaining "free" areas are those that are not covered by the current successful placements:
           - (0,0) is O7
           - (0.09,0) is O5
           - (0,0.09) is O4
           - (-0.086,-0.086) is O8
           
           So, I should look at:
           - (-x, 0) region (but that could collide with O7 and O8)
           - (0, -y) region (but that could collide with O7 and O8)
           - (+x, -y) region (could collide with O7 and O5)
           - (-x, +y) region (could collide with O7 and O4)
           
           Given that O8 at (-0.086, -0.086) worked, and my AABB collision check failed to predict it, I will try to use the same absolute coordinates and place object 6 at (0.086, -0.086) and (-0.086, 0.086).
           I will also try to place it in between the objects, in the small gaps that may exist. For example, between O4 and O7, or O5 and O7. But this is very unlikely because O6 is large.
           
           Let's focus on the empty corner regions:
           - (+x, -y) region. I will try (0.086, -0.086). This location did have a calculated overlap with O5, and a calculated small overlap with O7. But given the success of O8, it's worth trying.
           - (-x, +y) region. I will try (-0.086, 0.086). This location had a calculated large overlap with O4. So it's less likely.
           
           I will try to place it close to the maximum boundary for its center, which is 0.085665.
           So, coordinates like (0.085, -0.085), (0.08, -0.08), and variations, including rotations.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.085, -0.085)
