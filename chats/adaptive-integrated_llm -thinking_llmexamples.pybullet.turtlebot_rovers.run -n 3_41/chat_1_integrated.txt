           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Comprehensive Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0() Goal in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get this `new-axiom@0()` thing done. It's a bit involved, so I've broken it down into a few key steps:
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal boils down to two main sub-goals:
           
           1.  **Get Images:**  I need to grab pictures of three specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a particular mode (`v11`).
           2.  **Get Analysis:** I need to receive analysis of three rocks (of type `v2` or 'stone': `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and three rocks (of type `v6` or 'soil': `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           **Resources:**
           
           *   **Rovers:** I've got two rovers, `v12` and `v14`.  They're initially at locations `v13` and `v15`, respectively. They also each have a `free` store and a mode for analysis.
           *   **Cameras:** Each rover has a camera (`v10`) that can operate in mode `v11`.
           *   **Lander:** The lander (`v9`) is where I need to send the images and analysis.
           *   **Objectives and Rocks:** These are the key objects to be imaged and analyzed.
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           I'll split the work to make the plan more efficient:
           
           *   **Rover `v12` - Image Acquisition & Type v2 Analysis**: This rover will handle the image capture and the analysis of the 'stone' rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`).
           *   **Rover `v14` - Type v6 Analysis**: This rover will take care of analyzing the 'soil' rocks (`v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           **Action Sequence for v12:**
           
           1.  **Move to Imaging Configuration**: `v12` moves from `v13` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Image v17**: Calibrate camera and take picture of the object (ray `#o4`).
           3.  **Image v18**: Calibrate camera and take picture of the object.
           4.  **Image v19**: Calibrate camera and take picture of the object.
           5.  **Move to Communication Configuration**: `v12` moves to `#o0`.
           6.  **Send Images**: Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to the lander.
           7.  **Move to Sampling Location**: `v12` moves to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v1. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           9.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v3. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           10. **Sample and Analyze** Rock v4. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           11. **Return** to initial position.
           
           **Action Sequence for v14:**
           
           1.  **Move to Sampling Location**: `v14` moves to `#o5`.
           2.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v5. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           3.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v7. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           4.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v8. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           5.  **Return** to initial position.
           
           **Details of Configuration Parameters:**
           
           I will use abstract locations. All `#o`s are continuous parameters.
           
           *   **#o0**: This is a communication pose. To have `#o0`, I need:
               *   For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` -> use (0.5 -2.0)
               *   For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` -> use (-1.0 -2.0)
           *   **#o3**: This is an imaging pose. To have `#o3`, I need:

Model:     **Comprehensive Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0() Goal in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get this `new-axiom@0()` thing done. It's a bit involved, so I've broken it down into a few key steps:
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal boils down to two main sub-goals:
           
           1.  **Get Images:**  I need to grab pictures of three specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using a particular mode (`v11`).
           2.  **Get Analysis:** I need to receive analysis of three rocks (of type `v2` or 'stone': `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and three rocks (of type `v6` or 'soil': `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           **Resources:**
           
           *   **Rovers:** I've got two rovers, `v12` and `v14`.  They're initially at locations `v13` and `v15`, respectively. They also each have a `free` store and a mode for analysis.
           *   **Cameras:** Each rover has a camera (`v10`) that can operate in mode `v11`.
           *   **Lander:** The lander (`v9`) is where I need to send the images and analysis.
           *   **Objectives and Rocks:** These are the key objects to be imaged and analyzed.
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           I'll split the work to make the plan more efficient:
           
           *   **Rover `v12` - Image Acquisition & Type v2 Analysis**: This rover will handle the image capture and the analysis of the 'stone' rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`).
           *   **Rover `v14` - Type v6 Analysis**: This rover will take care of analyzing the 'soil' rocks (`v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           **Action Sequence for v12:**
           
           1.  **Move to Imaging Configuration**: `v12` moves from `v13` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Image v17**: Calibrate camera and take picture of the object (ray `#o4`).
           3.  **Image v18**: Calibrate camera and take picture of the object.
           4.  **Image v19**: Calibrate camera and take picture of the object.
           5.  **Move to Communication Configuration**: `v12` moves to `#o0`.
           6.  **Send Images**: Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` to the lander.
           7.  **Move to Sampling Location**: `v12` moves to `#o5`.
           8.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v1. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           9.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v3. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           10. **Sample and Analyze** Rock v4. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           11. **Return** to initial position.
           
           **Action Sequence for v14:**
           
           1.  **Move to Sampling Location**: `v14` moves to `#o5`.
           2.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v5. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           3.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v7. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           4.  **Sample and Analyze** Rock v8. Move to `#o0` to send the analysis.
           5.  **Return** to initial position.
           
           **Details of Configuration Parameters:**
           
           I will use abstract locations. All `#o`s are continuous parameters.
           
           *   **#o0**: This is a communication pose. To have `#o0`, I need:
               *   For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` -> use (0.5 -2.0)
               *   For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` -> use (-1.0 -2.0)
           *   **#o3**: This is an imaging pose. To have `#o3`, I need:
               *   For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` -> use (0.5 1.0)
               *   For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` -> use (-1.0 1.5)

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising and Refining the Rover Plan**
           
           Based on the feedback, I need to adjust the plan for the rovers, focusing on resolving the reachability and collision issues. The overall strategy of task division seems sound; the key is to ensure each rover can reach its imaging targets and communication points.
           
           First, I identified two problems: a configuration for rover `v12` to reach target `v18` and a collision of `v12`'s configuration for target `v19` with obstacle `v20`. To solve this, I need to revisit the imaging configurations and, potentially, re-assign imaging targets.
           
           *   **Imaging Configurations:** I re-evaluated the configurations of `#o3` (imaging) for `v12` and `v14`. My reasoning focused on finding configurations within the imagerange and avoiding obstacles. I determined the need to move `v12` away from imaging `v18` and have `v14` image `v18` instead.
           *   **Rover `v12`:** Its initial location is `(1.0, -1.75)`. Its first objective is `v17` at approx `(0.54, 1.94)`. Previous `#o3` config `(0.5, 1.0)` looks good: the distance is ~0.94 and within range. To image `v19` at approx `(2.16, 1.85)`, the previous collision at `(1.5, 1.0)` suggested moving towards, and above, the obstacle. I will test the new configuration `(1.0, 1.2)` since it's above and to the left of `v20`.
           *   **Rover `v14`:** Its starting location is `(-1.0, -1.75)`. To image `v18` with its center at `(-1.98, 2.17)`, it makes more sense to have this be `v14`'s objective. I will use the configuration `(-1.5, 1.0)`.
           
           **Revised Imaging Strategy and Configurations**
           *   **v12:** Images `v17` and `v19`.
           *   **v14:** Images `v18`.
           
           I revised and checked the new configurations for both `v12` and `v14`. I adjusted and confirmed that the distance to targets and the reachability were fine and no collisions occurred.
           
           For communications, both rovers will use the single `#o0` for comms with `v9` so the distances should be appropriate. For sampling, both will also go to `#o5` which I assume to be a general configuration and I don't need to specify coordinates for it.
           
           I revisited the actions and checked that each action had any of its preconditions and that the goals will be satisfied with the new assignment. I made sure to include and properly order calibrate and take_image actions.
           
           In conclusion, I defined distinct continuous values for `(#o0, v12, v9)`, `(#o0, v14, v9)`, `(#o3, v12, v17)`, `(#o3, v12, v19)`, and `(#o3, v14, v18)`. All other configuration variables will be handled by the system.

(Thoughts: **Revised Configuration Strategy and Task Sequencing**
           
           Okay, so I've gone back through the previous plan's configurations, addressing the issues raised about collisions and reachability. Based on the initial positions of the rovers, their targets, and the obstacles in the environment, I've come up with a revised strategy.
           
           For *v12*, starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`:
           
           *   **Communication (`#o0` for *v9*):** I've set the new position as `(0.5, -1.0)`. This position stays away from the collision range of the obstacle `v21` and maintains within the communication range (approximately 2.6).
           *   **Imaging (`#o3` for *v17*):** `v17` is approximately at `(0.54, 1.94)`. To ensure the best image, I've chosen `(0.5, 0.0)` for *v12*. The distance is close enough (around 1.94) and the path from the initial position to this point appears reachable, thus minimizing any necessary rotations.
           *   **Imaging (`#o3` for *v19*):**  To target *v19* and avoid the obstacle *v20*, I've set this to `(1.5, 0.5)`. This is around 1.5 units from `v19` and allows for an imaging angle.
           
           For *v14*, starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           
           *   **Communication (`#o0` for *v9*):** Re-using the configuration of *(-2.0, -1.0)* as before. The communication range is maintained (approximately 1.0) and there are no new obstacles in this area.
           *   **Imaging (`#o3` for *v18*):** To get the best image of *v18* and to avoid `v22`, I'm going with `(-2.0, 0.8)`. The calculated distance is roughly 1.37. Also, given the position of the obstacle, this configuration does not clash.
           
           **Revised Tasks and Sequencing**
           
           Now I have to ensure the rover returns to the initial configurations. It seems best that `v12` should target both *v17* and *v19*, then send the images and take all the samples. And `v14` should target *v18*, then do its samples.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           *   **Rover *v12* tasks:**
               *   Move to *#o3* (for *v17*): `(0.5, 0.0)`.
               *   Calibrate and image *v17*.
               *   Move to *#o3* (for *v19*): `(1.5, 0.5)`.
               *   Calibrate and image *v19*.
               *   Move to *#o0* (for *v9*).
               *   Send image *v17*.
               *   Send image *v19*.
               *   Move to *#o5* (for sampling).
               *   Sample v1, move to *#o0*, send analysis v1, drop rock.
               *   Sample v3, move to *#o0*, send analysis v3, drop rock.
               *   Sample v4, move to *#o0*, send analysis v4, drop rock.
               *   Move back to `v13`.
           
           *   **Rover *v14* tasks:**
               *   Move to *#o3* (for *v18*): `(-2.0, 0.8)`.
               *   Calibrate and image *v18*.
               *   Move to *#o0* (for *v9*).
               *   Send image *v18*.
               *   Move to *#o5* (for sampling).
               *   Sample v5, move to *#o0*, send analysis v5, drop rock.
               *   Sample v7, move to *#o0*, send analysis v7, drop rock.
               *   Sample v8, move to *#o0*, send analysis v8, drop rock.
               *   Move back to `v15`.
           
           I have to verify that all necessary motions are covered and that these configurations are reachable. Looks like the motions are all viable! So, I'm confident that this plan will allow for the data collection
)

Model:     **Revised Configuration Strategy and Task Sequencing**
           
           Okay, so I've gone back through the previous plan's configurations, addressing the issues raised about collisions and reachability. Based on the initial positions of the rovers, their targets, and the obstacles in the environment, I've come up with a revised strategy.
           
           For *v12*, starting at `(1.0, -1.75)`:
           
           *   **Communication (`#o0` for *v9*):** I've set the new position as `(0.5, -1.0)`. This position stays away from the collision range of the obstacle `v21` and maintains within the communication range (approximately 2.6).
           *   **Imaging (`#o3` for *v17*):** `v17` is approximately at `(0.54, 1.94)`. To ensure the best image, I've chosen `(0.5, 0.0)` for *v12*. The distance is close enough (around 1.94) and the path from the initial position to this point appears reachable, thus minimizing any necessary rotations.
           *   **Imaging (`#o3` for *v19*):**  To target *v19* and avoid the obstacle *v20*, I've set this to `(1.5, 0.5)`. This is around 1.5 units from `v19` and allows for an imaging angle.
           
           For *v14*, starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           
           *   **Communication (`#o0` for *v9*):** Re-using the configuration of *(-2.0, -1.0)* as before. The communication range is maintained (approximately 1.0) and there are no new obstacles in this area.
           *   **Imaging (`#o3` for *v18*):** To get the best image of *v18* and to avoid `v22`, I'm going with `(-2.0, 0.8)`. The calculated distance is roughly 1.37. Also, given the position of the obstacle, this configuration does not clash.
           
           **Revised Tasks and Sequencing**
           
           Now I have to ensure the rover returns to the initial configurations. It seems best that `v12` should target both *v17* and *v19*, then send the images and take all the samples. And `v14` should target *v18*, then do its samples.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           *   **Rover *v12* tasks:**
               *   Move to *#o3* (for *v17*): `(0.5, 0.0)`.
               *   Calibrate and image *v17*.
               *   Move to *#o3* (for *v19*): `(1.5, 0.5)`.
               *   Calibrate and image *v19*.
               *   Move to *#o0* (for *v9*).
               *   Send image *v17*.
               *   Send image *v19*.
               *   Move to *#o5* (for sampling).
               *   Sample v1, move to *#o0*, send analysis v1, drop rock.
               *   Sample v3, move to *#o0*, send analysis v3, drop rock.
               *   Sample v4, move to *#o0*, send analysis v4, drop rock.
               *   Move back to `v13`.
           
           *   **Rover *v14* tasks:**
               *   Move to *#o3* (for *v18*): `(-2.0, 0.8)`.
               *   Calibrate and image *v18*.
               *   Move to *#o0* (for *v9*).
               *   Send image *v18*.
               *   Move to *#o5* (for sampling).
               *   Sample v5, move to *#o0*, send analysis v5, drop rock.
               *   Sample v7, move to *#o0*, send analysis v7, drop rock.
               *   Sample v8, move to *#o0*, send analysis v8, drop rock.
               *   Move back to `v15`.
           
           I have to verify that all necessary motions are covered and that these configurations are reachable. Looks like the motions are all viable! So, I'm confident that this plan will allow for the data collection

           Alright, let's break this down. We're dealing with continuous configurations, those pesky (x, y) coordinates for our rovers. The previous attempts hit a snag with "not reachable" errors, which likely means we're bumping into things the environment model doesn't explicitly flag. Given our expert knowledge of these systems, we know this likely stems from either overly constrained robot kinematics or some hidden obstacles not defined as simple shapes.  We've got to adapt.
           
           First, the key is the `x=0` barrier. This seems to be a major obstacle. While the rovers *can* move across it, it might be the reason for the "not reachable" errors. So, we'll try to minimize crossing that x=0 line during the main imaging and sampling tasks.
           
           Next, image visibility. We have to address the constraint that images for v17, v18 and v19 are dependent on the position of each of the rovers.
           
           Our updated strategy:
           *   **Rover `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`):**  We'll keep `v12` on the right side of the map (x > 0) to take images v17 and v19, and sample rocks.  It'll then need to *cross* the x=0 line to communicate with the lander.
           *   **Rover `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`):**  We'll keep `v14` on the left side of the map (x < 0), taking the image of v18 and doing all its communication with the lander.  `v14` will also need to cross the x=0 line to sample and communicate the data.
           
           Crucially, the prompt is forcing me to treat the configurations as specific (e.g., `#o3` must be *different* depending on the target). So, when `v12` images multiple things, it'll have to *move to each different `#o3` value explicitly*.  Same for the comms positions. This dictates the plan. We're dealing with PDDL actions, so each `move` is an implicit state change.
           
           For Rover `v12`, here's the plan:
           
           1.  Move to a dedicated `#o3` for the image of `v17` at approx. (0.8, 1.5).
           2.  Take image of `v17`.
           3.  Move to a separate `#o3` for the image of `v19` at approx. (2.0, 1.2).
           4.  Take image of `v19`.
           5.  *Move* to a shared `#o5` configuration, then, *one by one*, sample rocks (`v3`, `v7`, `v8`).
           6.  *Move* to a shared `#o0` for comms.  (Comms requires us to cross the x=0 line.)
           7.  *Send* images and data.
           8.  Drop the collected rocks.
           
           Rover `v14`'s plan:
           
           1.  Move to its `#o3` for the image of `v18` at approx. (-1.8, 1.2).
           2.  Take the image of `v18`.
           3.  *Move* to comms at ( -1.5, -1.5).
           4.  Send the image.
           5.  *Move* to a common `#o5` for sampling (for all rocks it needs to sample).
           6.  *Move*, sample, send, drop, for all rocks on the left side.
           
           Crucially, we're ensuring that `#o3` locations and sampling locations are distinct.  The comms locations (`#o0`) for *both* rovers are also treated as unique for comms tasks, even if the rovers are taking turns to occupy it to send data back to the base station.
           
           This should give us a more robust plan, because we're minimizing *moving into collision*, while providing clear instructions for the continuous planner. The key insight is that because the "not reachable" errors are likely due to implicit obstacles or the kinemactic limitations of our robot base, we've got to be explicit in our path and coordinate constraints.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so the old configurations led to "not reachable" errors, which means I need to re-evaluate the whole plan.  The main issue seems to be finding points the rover can actually *get* to.  I'm interpreting that to mean choosing locations closer to the initial rover position, or on more easily traversable paths, rather than assuming free space.
           
           I've got two main problems: rover reachability and avoiding collisions. The "not reachable" errors are a huge red flag. My previous coordinates were probably too far, or maybe there are hidden constraints.  The collision problem is more straightforward: the lander and other obstacles are AABBs, so I need to make sure my coordinate assignments don't overlap.
           
           I've re-evaluated the key players: the rovers themselves, their targets (objects and the lander), and the obstacles. Here are some critical points.
           
           *   **Rovers:** v12 at (1.0, -1.75), v14 at (-1.0, -1.75).
           *   **Lander:** v9 (AABB).
           *   **Objectives:** v17, v18, v19.
           *   **Obstacles:** v20, v21 (a vertical wall at x=0), v22, v23.
           
           Given the distance constraints (`imagerange` max of 2, `comrange` max of 4), I'm making a strategic shift.  Instead of just throwing coordinates at the problem, I'm going to start with the rover's initial position and then incrementally adjust the values, focusing on staying *close*. The "different continuous value" constraint is still there, meaning I can't reuse points.
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           *   **Communication with Lander (`v9`):**  I'm getting closer to the lander but making sure I'm *clear*.  I need a distinct coordinate pair for v12 and v14.
               *   `v14` will aim for (-1.0, -1.0) and then the closest feasible pair.
               *   `v12` will aim for a distinct point, maybe (-1.0, -0.5).
           
           *   **Imaging the objectives:** Staying within the `imagerange` is key now, so this is critical. I should keep the images close to the starting y coordinate to make sure the robot can travel.
               *   `v12`: Try the coordinate pair `(0.5, 0.0)` for objective v17 (instead of `(0.8, 1.5)`) and `(1.8, 0.0)` for objective v19 (instead of `(2.0, 1.2)`)
               *   `v14`: Try (-1.8, 0.5) to view v18.
           
           Here are the precise, new coordinate assignments:
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:**
               *   `#o3` (to view `v17`): (0.5, 0.0)
               *   `#o3` (to view `v19`): (1.8, 0.0)
               *   `#o0` (communicate to `v9`): (-1.0, -0.5)
           
           *   **Rover `v14`:**
               *   `#o3` (to view `v18`): (-1.8, 0.5)
               *   `#o0` (communicate to `v9`): (-1.0, -1.0)
           
           I'm aiming for the same y coordinate in many cases to make sure the reachability problem is alleviated.
           
           Final check. All the distances seem to satisfy requirements, collision free. The new configuration seems to meet all reachability requirements.
           
           **Revised Action Sequencing:**
           
           (Rover, Obj) Pairs.
           
           *   v12 : `take_image(v12, v17)`, `take_image(v12, v19)`. Then send.
           *   v14 : `take_image(v14, v18)`. Then send.
           
           With these changes, I'm more confident that the rover will be able to reach its imaging and communication positions, while still avoiding collisions. I will check the obstacle and start running the new configurations.
