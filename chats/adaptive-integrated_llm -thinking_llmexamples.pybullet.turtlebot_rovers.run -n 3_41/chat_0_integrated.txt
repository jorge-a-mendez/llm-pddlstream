           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unachievable Goal Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           My analysis reveals a fundamental impediment to achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  The goal breaks down into satisfying several sub-goals related to image reception and analysis, which in turn require the rover to perform actions contingent on their position.  Specifically: taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analyses.  Each of these actions requires the rover to be at a specific configuration.
           
           The initial state defines the rover's current configurations.  Unfortunately, the available `move` actions are limited to self-moves.  These moves keep the rovers fixed at configurations that are not conducive to satisfying the goal. For instance, the rovers need to be at `#o3` to take images, `#o5` for sampling, or `#o0` to send data to the lander. However, the rovers are stuck at `v13` and `v15`, and the only `move` actions available do not enable any change.  Because there are no other action instances to change the rover's configurations, I conclude that the required preconditions cannot be met.  Without these preconditions, the core sub-goals of the `new-axiom@0()` cannot be satisfied, rendering the overall goal unreachable.
