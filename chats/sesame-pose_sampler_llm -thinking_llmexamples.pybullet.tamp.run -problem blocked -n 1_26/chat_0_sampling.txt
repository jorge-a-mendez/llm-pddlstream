(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place this object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) stably on Surface 0, an AABB defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  "Stable" here means the object's entire AABB fits within the surface's boundaries. Since it's a square, I know that the critical factor is its rotation –  when the square is aligned with the axes, half the length of the square's sides gives me the `half_x` and `half_y` in calculation. When rotated by 45 degrees, the minimum bounding square that fits the diagonal increases the half side length to the original times `sqrt(2)`.
           
           I've determined that the surface's dimensions (width and height) are both 0.6.  The object's half-dimension is 0.035, so I know I have some wiggle room for positioning.
           
           I need 50 stable placements. I'll need to generate several.
           
           Since the object's square shape means that `half_x_rotated = half_y_rotated`, and I can define `h_rot = 0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to represent the effective bounding box. I now know I can use `0.035` and `0.035 * sqrt(2) = 0.049497` as the limits for my calculations.
           
           The surface is large enough that I can vary the center (x, y) of the object in both axes without problem for the vast range of angles.
           
           My strategy is to generate these by calculating the ranges of `x_coords` and `y_coords`. In addition, I will generate placements based on varying the angle `theta`. I will start by using `theta = 0` or a multiple of `pi` to establish a base, then use additional angles to find a spread of placements. I will select the angles in intervals to make for a good spread. Then I will generate a number of placements at each angle.
           
           I've worked out the constraints for the center point (x, y) as:
           
           -   *For theta = 0, pi* or *pi/2, 3pi/2*: x range is \[4.235, 4.765] and y range is \[-0.565, -0.035]
           -   *For theta = pi/4 and 3pi/4*: x range is \[4.249497, 4.750503] and y range is \[-0.550503, -0.049497]
           
           Given this, I plan to generate a set of placements by combining the available angle intervals. Specifically, 9 placements at `0`, then 9 at `pi/2`, then 9 at `pi` then 9 at `pi/4` then 9 at `3*pi/4`. This yields 45 placements. I'll add the remaining 5 to different positions and angles.
           
           The distribution strategy ensures that I can build a diverse set of coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object ID 10**
           
           My analysis indicates that the previous successful placements of object ID 5, now fixed obstacles, restrict placement of object ID 10 on the surface `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  Object 10 is nearly a square (0.09752 x 0.09752), while the obstacles from ID 5 are 0.07 x 0.07. These existing obstacles create a dense grid that makes simple placement impossible. To solve this, I will implement a strategy for finding stable, non-colliding locations for object 10.
           
           First, I define `get_rotated_half_extents(theta)` to compute the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) half extents of object 10 at rotation angle *theta*, accounting for the slightly different x and y sizes. This function provides the necessary value for collision detection calculations and the determination of valid x and y bounds.
           
           Next, I will carefully search for valid, non-colliding locations. I will sample a grid of possible x and y positions within the surface bounds, for a variety of rotation angles *theta*. For each potential placement, I will check:
           1. Is it within the surface bounds?
           2. Does it collide with any of the nine fixed obstacle AABBs?
           
           The collision detection uses the function `check_collision(obj10_x, obj10_y, obj10_theta)`. The grid is made sufficiently dense, spanning the x- and y- axes within the surface while avoiding overlapping the existing obstacles, in search of 50 stable placements.
