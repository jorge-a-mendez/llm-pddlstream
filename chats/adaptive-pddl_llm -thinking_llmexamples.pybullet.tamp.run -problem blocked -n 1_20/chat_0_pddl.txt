           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning Process: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My objective is to craft a plan to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means ensuring an object of a specific type is positioned "on" a particular target. First, I decoded the goal, recognizing it demands an object, currently represented by `?green`, to be both `on v18` and have the type `v17`. My analysis turned toward the initial conditions, pinpointing `v12` and `v8` as potential candidates since they both satisfy `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           The crucial challenge arose when considering the "on" requirement. Based on the axioms, to establish `on(?o, ?r)`, both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` must hold true. Examining the initial state, I confirmed `v12` is initially `on v14` and `v8` is initially `on v11`. The path toward `on(v18)` is blocked by the absence of `pick` and `place` actions. These actions are vital to repositioning objects and altering their support and pose, hence achieving the desired "on" state. However, the action instances are limited to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't modify the necessary "on" related predicates, only its preconditions.
           
           The available `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` creates a contradictory state, and therefore would make no progress toward the goal. The limited action set renders the goal, which demands changing object positions to satisfy the `on` predicate, unattainable. Consequently, no plan can be constructed to reach the `new-axiom@0()` target.
