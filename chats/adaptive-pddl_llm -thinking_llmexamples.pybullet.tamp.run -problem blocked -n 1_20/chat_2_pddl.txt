(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out a plan to achieve this new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, in the `pr2-tamp` domain. It's a conjunction, meaning I need to satisfy both parts:  `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Essentially, the plan needs to place *some* object, let's call it `?green`, *on* object `v18` and ensure that `?green` has the type `v17`.
           
           My first step is to analyze the initial state and available objects. I see a lot of objects, including potential candidates for `?green`. I've quickly identified two objects that could work since their type is `v17`: `v12` and `v8`. Now, I need to figure out which is easier to work with, or which will require fewer actions to achieve the goal.
           
           It looks like the initial state already contains `on(v12, v14)` and `on(v8, v11)`. Both need to be moved to v18.
           
           By studying the continuous parameters and kinematic information, I see that I have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that either of these objects could be placed on `#o2`, which in turn is supported by `v18`. I see that I can utilize these poses and use the `kin` information.
           
           Let's start with `v8`. The plan would be: 1) Move the robot's base to a configuration that allows grasping `v8`, 2) pick up `v8`, and 3) place `v8` at the appropriate pose (`#o2`) on `v18`. From the available `kin` information, base configuration `#o3` is ideal for picking `v8`. I also know base config `v3` and the fact that `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` is available.
           
           The detailed plan:
           1.  **Move Base**: Execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This will shift the robot's base from its current configuration `v3` to `#o3`, ready for manipulation.
           2.  **Pick Up**: Perform `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Using arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`, I'll pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place**: Then `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, this places `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v18`, so I can satisfy the `on` axiom requirement.
           
           I believe this plan is sufficient because with `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`  and after the *place* action, `v8` is `atpose(#o2)`, and therefore `on(v8,v18)`. With my initial reasoning, I determined that the `type` element is already satisfied. I'll make sure that these are all compatible with the provided action instances.
           
           Let's analyze, using the facts, how the plan will work to achieve our objective.
           
           After running through the whole plan with all the actions, all the preconditions are consistent and the goal is achieved: `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`. The plan seems sound.

           3.  **Place**: Then `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, this places `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v18`, so I can satisfy the `on` axiom requirement.
