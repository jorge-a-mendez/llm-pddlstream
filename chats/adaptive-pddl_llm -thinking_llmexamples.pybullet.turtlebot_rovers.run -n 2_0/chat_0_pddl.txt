           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to ensuring certain images are received and analyses of specific rock and soil types are also received. It seems straightforward initially, but as I delve into the preconditions and available actions, a significant hurdle emerges.
           
           Firstly, I need to get the images: `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This part seems achievable. I can use rover `v14` (as an example), equipped with its camera `v10`, to:
           
           1.  Calibrate the camera for the target objectives, `v17` and `v18`.
           2.  Take an image of each objective in mode `v11`.
           3.  Send the images to a communication lander.
           
           The initial state contains the information I need, specifically, that `v14` is in the right position, the camera is onboard, and the necessary communication channels are open. The `~blocked` status is also positive.
           
           The tricky part lies in the rock analysis. I need to get `receivedanalysis` for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`. This involves the following:
           
           1.  Move a rover above the rock.
           2.  Sample the rock.
           3.  Send the analysis.
           
           Here's where it falls apart. The available "move" actions seem to be self-referential – the rovers stay put. The `sample_rock` action has a precondition that the rover must be `above` the rock. While the rovers are `above` the rocks in the initial state, they are at different configurations. The `sample_rock` action *also* requires that the rover be `atconf` at the configuration it is above the rock. However, the existing actions do not provide a means to transition the rovers to these target configurations. There are no available `move` actions that allow it to travel and become `atconf(#o5)`.
           
           Therefore, I cannot satisfy the preconditions for `sample_rock`. Because I can't sample, I can't get an analysis, thus preventing completion of the axiom. It is not currently possible to satisfy all of the required subgoals.
           
           In essence, while I can fulfill the image requirement, the absence of a configuration-changing "move" action makes the rock analysis part of the goal unreachable. The plan fails due to these missing actions to reposition the rovers.
           
           I have to note, I found that I need two distinct types of `receivedanalysis`, which means I need two different types of rocks, but the state, as is, seems to only include rocks that are accessible via the configuration `#o5`. This is a bit of a problem.
           
           The plan is inherently flawed due to an incomplete action set that cannot achieve the goal as described.
