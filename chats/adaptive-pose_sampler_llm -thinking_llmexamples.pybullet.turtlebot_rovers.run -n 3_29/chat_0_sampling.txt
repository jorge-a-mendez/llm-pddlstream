User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to find the robot base positions, broken down step-by-step:**
           
           First, I need to visualize the environment. It's a square, 5x5, with walls and various obstacles. There's a big central vertical pillar, and that's the key. My target is at (-1.01, -1.14), which puts it to the left of that pillar.
           
           The most important thing is avoiding that central pillar, because it completely blocks line of sight. So, if the target is on the left, the robot needs to stay on the left too.
           
           Here's my approach:
           *   I'll generate three diverse positions (meaning they aren't all clustered together).
           *   Each position has to be within 2 units of the target.
           *   The robot must stay within the arena's boundaries.
           *   I'll be mindful of the fixed obstacles.
           
           I'll calculate the coordinates and check these conditions:
           1.  Make sure the generated positions are within the environment boundaries (-2.5 to 2.5 on the x and y axes).
           2.  Make sure they don't collide with the fixed obstacles, using the bounding boxes.
           3.  Check if a line between the candidate point and the target intersects the central pillar (i.e. is blocked by it), so that no line of sight exists.
           
           After the check, I'll return three valid base positions.
