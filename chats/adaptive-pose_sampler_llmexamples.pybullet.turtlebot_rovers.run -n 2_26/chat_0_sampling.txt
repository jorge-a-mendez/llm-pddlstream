User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene consists of a large central square obstacle (AABB 0), with a cross-shaped opening due to AABB 5. AABBs 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a border around the allowed area. There are also smaller rectangular obstacles scattered around, some in clusters like 7, 8, 9, 10. Given the target point {target_point}, I will try to find positions on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target point, and then check for collision with known fixed obstacles. The max range from the target point is 2. The allowed area for x and y is [-2.5, 2.5]. I will focus on positions that are not too close to the obstacles, especially the central cross.

           (1.603 0.999)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     I understand the previous positions failed. (1.821, 0.449) collided with AABB 18. (1.977, -0.258) had no line of sight, likely due to a combination of AABB 0 and AABB 5. The target point is (0.6137384176254272, 1.8962361812591553). I need to find new positions that are within a distance of 2 from this target, within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds, and avoid the known obstacles, especially AABB 18 and the large central obstacles that caused the line-of-sight issue. I will try to stay on the left side of the central vertical barrier (AABB 5) or closer to the top boundary.

Model:     I have accumulated several failed positions. For the target (0.6137384176254272, 1.8962361812591553), (1.821, 0.449) collided with AABB 18 and (1.977, -0.258) had no line of sight. For the new target (2.0847904682159424, 2.1538448333740234), (0.0, -0.0) collided with AABB 5, and (0.614, -0.104) and (-0.5, 1.0) had no line of sight. These indicate that the central vertical obstacle (AABB 5) and the inner walls (AABB 0) severely restrict line of sight from the center.
           
           The current target point is (2.0847904682159424, 2.1538448333740234). This point is in the top-right corner of the allowed area. Given its high Y coordinate, I should try positions with high Y values to maintain line-of-sight and avoid the central obstacles. I'll focus on the upper right quadrant and try to stay away from AABB 20 which is very close to the target, and AABB 7.
