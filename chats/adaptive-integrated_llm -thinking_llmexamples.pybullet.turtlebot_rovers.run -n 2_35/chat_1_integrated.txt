           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` from my perspective.**
           
           My primary objective is to make sure two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, meet a set of specific conditions.  These conditions include having the rovers at certain configurations, ensuring their storage units are empty, and acquiring images and analyses of specific objects.
           
           Firstly, I need to get images of two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, in a particular mode `v11`. To accomplish this, I'll direct rover `v12` to take and send these images.  `v12` will need to move to a location, I'm calling `#o3`, from where it can see both objectives.  It'll then calibrate its camera, snap the pictures, move to another location, `#o0`, and send the images to a lander `v9`.
           
           After the images are acquired, the plan requires me to get analyses of a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil). To do this, `v12` will move to a sampling location `#o5`, collect a sample, then return to location `#o0`, send the analysis data, then drop the sample to free the storage unit. This needs to happen for both the stone and soil samples.
           
           The plan involves multiple movements for `v12`. I need to ensure `v12` returns to its initial configuration `v13` after the tasks are completed, and `v14` remain at its original position `v15`.
           
           The trickiest part is determining the continuous values: I need to determine the positions for the imaging configuration, `#o3`, and the communication config, `#o0`. `#o3` must be a position where `v12` can see both `v17` and `v18` clearly for imaging, so my proposed (x, y) coordinate is `(0.0, 1.0)`. Similarly, I've designated a suitable communications position `(-0.5, -2.0)` for `#o0`, from where the signal is unobstructed and within acceptable transmission distance.
           
           I am confident that the proposed plan, with the defined continuous parameters, will meet all requirements of `new-axiom@0()`.

(Thoughts: **New Collision-Free Configurations for Imaging and Communication**
           
           Okay, the previous plan failed, blocked by obstacles `v19` and `v20` at configurations `#o3` and `#o0`.  My immediate focus is finding new, collision-free configurations for these continuous parameters. The core problem is that my imaging and communication configurations previously put me in the path of these obstacles.
           
           First, let's look at imaging. I need to get a good look at `v17` and `v18`.  Target `v17` is at around (0.49, 2.05) and `v18` is at around (-0.69, 1.91).  I need the rover, `v12`, to be within 2 units to get a clear image of both, and the previous configuration for `#o3` was (0.0, 1.0), which was on `v19`. I've identified `v19` as a wall at x=0. To avoid this, and still see the targets, I'll move to the right a bit and try `#o3` at (0.1, 1.0). This position is close enough to capture both targets. Calculating the distances confirms this.  And, crucial, (0.1, 1.0) is *not* inside `v19`. That's a solid start.
           
           Next, communication. For communication, I need a connection to the lander `v9`, which is at approximately (-1.9, -2.0). My previous communication configuration `#o0` was at (-0.5, -2.0), the center of obstacle `v20`.  To avoid this, I'll shift the communication point to `(-0.6, -2.0)`. This position is to the left of the obstacle `v20`. The lander is within the 4 unit comm range, so I'll be in contact.
           
           With these changes, the remaining plan can stay the same. I start at (1.0, -1.75). I move to the new `#o3` to image `v17`, then `#o0` to send, then back to `#o3` to image `v18`, back to `#o0` to send. Then on to `#o5` to collect some samples, then back to `#o0` to transmit the analyses. Finally, return to my start.
           
           The strategy adheres to all the requirements. The rover ends at its initial configuration `v13`. All conditions are met: free states and the images and analyses will all be received. Everything should work now!

Model:     **New Collision-Free Configurations for Imaging and Communication**
           
           Okay, the previous plan failed, blocked by obstacles `v19` and `v20` at configurations `#o3` and `#o0`.  My immediate focus is finding new, collision-free configurations for these continuous parameters. The core problem is that my imaging and communication configurations previously put me in the path of these obstacles.
           
           First, let's look at imaging. I need to get a good look at `v17` and `v18`.  Target `v17` is at around (0.49, 2.05) and `v18` is at around (-0.69, 1.91).  I need the rover, `v12`, to be within 2 units to get a clear image of both, and the previous configuration for `#o3` was (0.0, 1.0), which was on `v19`. I've identified `v19` as a wall at x=0. To avoid this, and still see the targets, I'll move to the right a bit and try `#o3` at (0.1, 1.0). This position is close enough to capture both targets. Calculating the distances confirms this.

This position is to the left of the obstacle `v20`. The lander is within the 4 unit comm range, so I'll be in contact.
           
           With these changes, the remaining plan can stay the same. I start at (1.0, -1.75). I move to the new `#o3` to image `v17`, then `#o0` to send, then back to `#o3` to image `v18`, back to `#o0` to send. Then on to `#o5` to collect some samples, then back to `#o0` to transmit the analyses. Finally, return to my start.
           
           The strategy adheres to all the requirements. The rover ends at its initial configuration `v13`. All conditions are met: free states and the images and analyses will all be received. Everything should work now!

(Thoughts: **Updated Collision-Free Configurations**
           
           Alright, the previous attempts to find collision-free configurations failed. I've got to re-evaluate the obstacles and ensure the rover's movements are truly safe.  My primary concern is that the system's collision detection seems to be based on an assumption of the rover's dimensions that I need to keep in mind.
           
           **For Obstacle v19 (Wall at x=0):**  The problem is, as I understand it, my proposed coordinate (0.1, 1.0) for the rover, `#o3`, reported as a collision, even though, in a point-based analysis, it seemed to be clear. I can't dismiss the collision detection's results, so I must take the rover's dimensions into account. If the rover has any width at all, it will collide with v19 (a wall at x=0) when placed at `x=0.1`.  Therefore, I'll need to move `#o3` further away from this wall. I'm going to set the new coordinate as `#o3_new = (0.2, 1.9)`.  This gives me a much safer margin and still meets the constraints of viewing the targets v17 and v18.
           
           **For Obstacle v20 (around x=-0.5):** The issue with the previous `#o0` (-0.6, -2.0) colliding with v20 remains. The AABB for `v20` clearly shows an x-range. So, I need to adjust the position of the rover again, and now my aim is to make the rover's `x`-value outside the x-range defined by the obstacle. I will set the new coordinate as `#o0_new = (-0.7, -2.0)`.
           
           **Overall Plan:** The overall plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` remains the same; the sequence of actions are good. I've only modified the coordinates of `#o3` and `#o0` to account for collisions, which addresses the primary issue. I re-checked all the preconditions and post-conditions, along with ensuring the continuous values for `above` predicates (e.g., `#o5`) remain untouched.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for New Axiom at 0**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, as I see it. The challenge is to get rover `v12` to grab images of objectives `v17` and `v18`, analyze a stone and soil sample, and then communicate all that back to base.  I'm starting with a few givens: both rovers `v12` and `v14` at their initial positions, storage free, objectives ready to be imaged, and the necessary communication mode enabled.  
           
           The trick is navigating the environment and picking collision-free poses for `v12` to image and communicate. The collision reports are my starting point, but I've got to carefully re-evaluate them.
           
           First, let's look at the imaging scenario (#o3). I was initially told that `(0.2, 1.9)` would work, but it apparently collides with `v19` (a wall along x=0) and `v21` (an obstacle in the upper right).  The coordinate values look off, suggesting either my assumption about a rover radius is incorrect or the collision detector is reporting a more restricted area.  
           
           `v17` and `v18` need to be within a 2-unit radius of the camera. I need a pose that sees both, and keeps `v12` out of trouble. I checked to see that the camera could potentially see through both `v19` and `v21`, but this is still a *local* problem. The obstacle `v21` is at `(0.25, 1.75)` to `(0.75, 2.25)`, and `v17` is *inside* that AABB.  I have to find a pose that both allows imaging of `v17` and keeps the rover from crashing.  Since imaging is explicitly given as possible, I assume that `v21` isn't a problem, just the rover's location.
           
           After some thought, I need to make an educated guess. If `v12` is at `(0.0, 1.0)`, distance to `v17` and `v18` would be OK, but that collides with `v19`.  So, I had to move `v12` to `(-1.0, 1.9)`. The distance to both is still less than 2, and that location avoids `v19` and `v21`. The distances are about 1.5 to `v17`, and about 0.31 to `v18`. I should be collision-free.  So I'm going with `#o3` at `(-1.0, 1.9)` as my imaging location.
           
           Now for communication (#o0). My initial pose, `(-0.7, -2.0)`, was colliding with `v20`.  `v20`'s coordinates are x in `[-0.58, -0.44]`, so my original location was still not collision-free. So, let's move out of that AABB. I'll place `#o0` at `(-1.0, -2.0)`. The distance to base is well within the 4-unit limit, it is no longer in collision, and it should be a good communication pose.
           
           The plan itself is straightforward: move to the imaging location, calibrate the camera, take pictures, move to the communication spot, send them, go sampling, send the analyses, and head back to the original spot. `above` predicates (e.g. `above(v12, #o5, v4)`) are included for the sampling location.
            
           I checked for any problems I might encounter, looking at things like `blocked(?y)` axioms, and making sure the "occlusion-free line of sight" condition is met, but I think I should be good.
           
           So, here's the modified plan.  
           Move, Calibrate, take and send, take and send, go to sampling, collect, send, drop, then return.
           
           Collision reports were my main hurdle, and I have addressed them. It looks good from here.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement for New-Axiom Goal**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. The primary challenge remains the spatial arrangement to avoid collisions while satisfying the *receivedimage* and *receivedanalysis* goals, with the constraints of maintaining initial configurations and storage states. The plan's structure appears sound; it's the continuous parameters I need to nail down.
           
           My analysis of previous attempts highlights the need to find collision-free and reachable configurations for imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0).
           
           I've identified the following key obstacles:  a thin wall (v19) along the y-axis, and two boxes (v21 and v22) in the upper-right and upper-left quadrants, respectively, and a small box (v20) in the lower-left. The rover's initial configuration for this process is at `v13`.
           
           **Imaging Configuration (#o3):**
           The two targets (v17 and v18) are located in the upper-right quadrant.
           I need to image `v17` and `v18` from a clear line of sight, and within 2m.
           The previous approach `(-0.2, 1.9)` failed because it was within the bounds of  `v22`, so I'm aiming for a y-coordinate slightly lower than the obstacles, and an x-coordinate far enough away from the obstacles.
           
           Based on these constraints, I've determined that an imaging position of **(1.0, 1.9)** should avoid all obstacles and be within range for both targets.
           
           **Communication Configuration (#o0):**
           The lander (v9) is located, with an x range of (-1.9, -2.0). 
           The previous attempt failed with `(-0.8, -2.0)`, a common "not reachable for robot base" error that's likely caused by being too close to the obstacle, or a collision path, or too large a move that the motion controllers may not like.
           
           I've decided on **(-1.5, -2.0)** for communication.  This should provide a clear line of sight to the lander and stay clear of collision from object `v20`.
           
           The revised plan for rover v12:
           1.  Move v12 from initial config v13 to (1.0, 1.9)
           2.  Calibrate, Image, and send images for targets v17 and v18
           3.  Move from (1.0, 1.9) to (-1.5, -2.0)
           4.  Sample, send analyses and drop rocks
           5.  Return to initial configuration (v13)
           
           With these refined values for #o3 and #o0, I should be able to satisfy the new-axiom@0() goal. I hope the `motion` predicates in the initial state will ensure that the path can be taken to these poses.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement: Navigating the Obstacles**
           
           Okay, so I've got the overall plan in place, but I need to nail down those problematic configurations. The initial problem seems to be an unreachable position. It is probably because of obstacles. I had to revise my strategy to avoid the repeated "not reachable" errors. The given robot configuration appears sound, and my task is to find collision-free continuous configurations.
           
           **Imaging Configuration (`#o3`)**: I've determined that the troublesome `(1.0, 1.9)` isn't feasible, most likely due to hidden geometric constraints or obstacles. I need a clear path that does not collide with the specified obstacles: `v19`, `v21`, and `v22`. I need to look for a position that avoids the *y* range of the obstacle boxes. I need to be *y < 1.75* or *y > 2.25*, to avoid *y* values inside the bounding boxes. Considering the objectives `v17` and `v18`, with their *y* coordinates between 1.9 and 2.0. The coordinates `v12` requires to "look up". I'll try `(-1.0, 1.0)` for imaging. This coordinate should be safe. I then make sure the rover is at the appropriate range to send images.
           
           **Communication Configuration (`#o0`)**: My previous attempt `(-1.5, -2.0)` collided with the lander `v9`. I need to choose another coordinate outside the lander's bounding box. Given the AABB of the lander `v9`, I now choose `(-1.2, -2.0)`.
           
           **Revised Plan**: I believe the sequence is correct. I will simply substitute the new configurations `#o3` and `#o0` to the plan: `atconf(v12, v13)`. This plan should work.
           
           1.  `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3` (from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, 1.0)`)
           2.  `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
           3.  `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
           4.  `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0` (from `(-1.0, 1.0)` to `(-1.2, -2.0)`)
           5.  `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`
           6.  `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o3` (from `(-1.2, -2.0)` to `(-1.0, 1.0)`)
           7.  `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`
           8.  `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`
           9.  `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0` (from `(-1.0, 1.0)` to `(-1.2, -2.0)`)
           10. `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`
           11. `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5` (from `(-1.2, -2.0)` to sampling config. This is a `#o5` which means its value will be found by the system, just needs to be reachable from `#o0` and above the rocks. `above(v12, #o5, v4)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)` are in initial state, so the system should find a valid `#o5` for the rover `v12` to be above `v4` and `v5`.)
           12. `sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16`
           13. `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`
           14. `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4`
           15. `drop_rock v12 v16`
           16. `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5`
           17. `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16`
           18. `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the `new-axiom@0()` Goal and Unachievability**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This plan depends on fulfilling several sub-goals: obtaining images of objectives `v17` and `v18`, and ensuring those images are received by the lander `v9`.  The initial state provides the starting configuration for rovers `v12` (the focus) and `v14`.  I need to find collision-free continuous configurations for imaging (`#o3`) and communication (`#o0`).
           
           My analysis begins by examining the critical components: the rover's starting configuration, the locations and bounding boxes of the objectives (v17 and v18), the lander's position, the positions and bounding boxes of the rocks to be sampled, and, crucially, the locations and bounding boxes of obstacles like `v19`, `v20`, `v21`, and `v22`. I need to calculate where the rover can move without colliding with any of the obstacles and while also maintaining line-of-sight to the objectives or the lander.
           
           I've already attempted several configurations for the rover, specifically for imaging (`#o3`), which have failed because of collisions.  This history informs my current approach, leading me to investigate configurations that avoid the known problem areas: vertical wall at x=0, and the small box near y=-2.0.  I consider that `v17` is the objective, with AABB `((0.446, 2.006), (0.535, 2.096))` and `v21` is an obstacle with AABB `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`.
           
           **Crucially, upon examining the AABBs of the target object `v17` and the obstacle `v21`, I have determined that `v17` is *entirely contained within* the bounds of obstacle `v21`.** This is a critical observation. It means that any attempt to obtain an image of `v17` with line-of-sight *must* be blocked by obstacle `v21`.
           
           **The implications of this geometric relationship are dire.** The plan requires a precondition to take an image of `v17`: it must not be blocked.  However, with `v17` physically *inside* `v21`, any ray directed towards `v17` will necessarily collide with `v21`.  This violates the precondition for `take_image`, making the image action impossible. Since the sub-goal `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is necessary, and the geometric configuration is such that this sub-goal *cannot* be achieved, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` becomes unachievable in this current state.  The current plan will fail due to the unachievable nature of the vision sub-goal.
