           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several predicates: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `type`, and `receivedanalysis`.  I need to get two images (`receivedimage`) and analyze both a stone and soil sample (`receivedanalysis`).  Based on the problem definition, I'm starting at configuration `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The issue is, I can't seem to get to `#o3` or `#o5` for either rover (`v12` or `v14`)!
           
           **Identifying Required Actions and Dependencies**
           
           To achieve the `receivedimage` goals, I have to use `send_image`. This action depends on `haveimage`, which in turn, uses `take_image`. `take_image` requires `calibrated` and also necessitates being at a location/config (`#o3`) that is visible to the target object. It's the same for getting an image of `v18`.  For the soil and rock analysis, I've got to use `send_analysis`. This relies on `analyzed` which comes from using `sample_rock`.  This, again, hinges on being at the right config (`#o5`) where the sample is.
           
           **Critical Constraint: Limited Rover Movement**
           
           Here's the problem.  The initial state says I have two rovers `v12` and `v14`. They are at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. The allowed "move" action instances are `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`.  Effectively, this means the rovers are *stuck*. They can't move to other configurations, like `#o3` (imaging) or `#o5` (sampling).  This limitation makes everything else impossible.
           
           **Unreachable Subgoals and Overall Conclusion**
           
           Because I can't change configurations, I can't satisfy the preconditions for `take_image` or `sample_rock`. The rover is simply unable to do any of the tasks needed. Since I can't achieve any of the necessary subgoals (getting the images, analyzing the samples), the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unreachable* with the given action set.
           
           I've carefully re-read the problem statement and checked the provided action instances list.  The conclusion remains: given the strict movement restrictions, the plan cannot be realized.
