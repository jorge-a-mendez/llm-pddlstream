           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, size 0.07 x 0.07) on a given surface (surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))).  A placement is defined by (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate of the AABB center, y-coordinate of the AABB center). Stability is determined by the object's complete containment within the surface bounds and avoiding collisions with any other objects (which are not yet defined in this scenario).  
           
           The object's geometry introduces some ambiguity.  While the problem states that the geometry of the object will be described using the x and y dimensions of the object's AABB, it doesn't clearly specify how the *rotation* will affect the object geometry. Assuming that the AABB refers to the object's dimensions *before* rotation, I will take a conservative approach.
           
           Since the object is a square, the most significant dimension change will be at a 45 degree angle. For stability I've chosen to include two rotations into the 50 positions. 
           
           To cover the surface area with placements, I constructed a grid. I have generated 25 placements at theta = 0, and another 25 placements at pi/4. 
           
           This plan ensures I achieve the desired placements, accommodating the geometric considerations given.
