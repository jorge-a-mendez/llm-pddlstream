           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of an Impossible Plan**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the following: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. This translates to positioning these objects at pose `#o2` on top of `v16`.  The initial state reveals that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently resting on `v11` and need to be moved to the correct pose.
           
           I must work within the constraints of the available actions. However, the plan is destined to fail. The only action allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This move base action appears to be self-referential: the robot moves from `v3` to `v3`. It also has the effect of making both `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()` false. Since both `atbconf()` and `canmove()` are preconditions for `pick` and `place` actions, this single move action *precludes* all other actions needed to achieve the goal. No `pick` or `place` instances are available.
           
           The goal requires changing the location of these three objects from their initial support. This requires a `pick` and a `place` action. Neither action can be used because it is not within the provided list of actions. The initial state does not already satisfy the goal: thus, the goal is impossible. I am unable to pick up, move, or place the objects. Therefore, there's no way to reach the desired final state.
