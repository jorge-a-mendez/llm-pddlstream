(Thoughts: **My Plan for Stable Object Placements**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions: 0.08246375657916988, 0.08246375657916985) on a given surface (Surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))). A stable placement means the object is: 1) fully contained within the surface boundaries, 2) doesn't collide with any fixed obstacles (none given yet, but I'll account for it in future iterations), and 3) doesn't collide with any other placed objects (none exist yet).
           
           I'll start by determining the allowable center region for the object. Since the object's dimensions are almost identical, I can effectively treat it as a square, which simplifies the containment check. The rotation *theta* has minimal impact on the object's AABB size. I'll define `L` as the maximum dimension (0.08246375657916988) of the object, which is practically `w` or `h`.
           
           To ensure full containment, the object's center must be positioned such that the entire object stays within the surface bounds. Given the surface's corners and the object's effective half-dimension, which is `L/2 = 0.04123187828958494`, I calculate the allowed ranges for x and y center coordinates.
           
           For x, the range is determined by `surface_x_min + L/2 <= x <= surface_x_max - L/2`, and for y, `surface_y_min + L/2 <= y <= surface_y_max - L/2`. Therefore, the valid x and y range is `[-0.09376812171041506, 0.09376812171041506]`. I will create a 7x7 grid of center coordinates within this area for 49 placements.
           
           To generate these points, I will divide the x and y ranges into 6 equal intervals to create the grid of placement points. I will use a simple spacing and symmetry to get the placement locations. Because the range is symmetric and the object is a square (and will be placed at theta=0), the values are calculated as the start of the range + the step size multiplied by a counter for each interval. The range is inclusive of the values that will be used.
           
           For variety and in case it impacts a physics engine, I will rotate some of the objects. I'll use `theta = 0` for 49 placements, and for the 50th, I will place the object at the center of the surface with `theta=pi/4`. This ensures a diverse set of placements.

(Thoughts: **My Thought Process for Placing Object 7**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've just successfully placed object 5, and I need to avoid it for object 7.  Object 5 is at `(-0.09376812171041506, -0.09376812171041506)`. I need to ensure object 7 doesn't collide with it.
           
           First, I define object 7's dimensions and the surface bounds. Object 7 is almost square with size `0.09845754536320879 x 0.09845754536320883`. The surface is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I calculate the "half-size" (which is `0.049228772681604415`) and the allowed center range on the surface, which is `x` and `y` between `[-0.08577122731839558, 0.08577122731839558]`.
           
           Now, the crucial part: avoiding object 5.  Object 5's dimensions are `0.08246375657916988 x 0.08246375657916985`, with a half-size of `0.04123187828958494`.  Its bounding box extends from `[-0.135, -0.135]` to `[-0.05253624342083012, -0.05253624342083012]`. To avoid a collision, I make sure the boxes of objects 5 and 7 do not intersect at all. If they touch, I need to make sure they are on different sides of an axis.
           
           From this, I derived that object 7 cannot be positioned entirely to the left and below object 5. So, object 7 can only be placed above, or to the right of object 5, or both.
           
           To generate 50 valid placements, I set the y-coordinate range of the centers of object 7 to be greater than -0.0033... This means that the objects will not collide with each other. Then, with a 7x7 grid, I can cover 49 placements, and I added a 50th, centered on the surface and rotated by pi/4. This will give me all the necessary placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: place object 4 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with the already-placed objects 5 and 7. I need to find 50 stable placements. I'll take a methodical approach, drawing on my understanding of AABBs and collision checks.
           
           First, I need to define the safe area on surface 0. Then, I'll calculate the allowed ranges for object 4's center coordinates (x4, y4). Crucially, I have to ensure that object 4 won't overlap with the *AABBs* of objects 5 and 7.
           
           I'll start by defining the boundaries. Surface 0 is a rectangle from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Based on object 4's size, I compute the allowed range for the object's center: x4 must be between -0.09112 and 0.09112 and similarly for y4. Then I look at the AABBs of objects 5 and 7. Object 5 is placed to the left with an AABB `[-0.135, -0.0525]` for x and y, and object 7 has AABB `[-0.135, -0.0365]` for x and `[-0.0525, 0.0459]` for y.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to make sure that object 4's *AABB* doesn't overlap those of objects 5 and 7. So, for each object, I've got conditions: to not hit object 5, x4 must be greater than -0.00866 or y4 greater than -0.00866. To not collide with object 7, x4 must be greater than 0.0073, y4 must be greater than 0.08979 or y4 must be less than -0.0964.
           
           I have to carefully calculate this based on the positions and sizes of all objects.
           
           I'm making it easier on myself by defining a "safe" region for object 4 where I can guarantee no collisions.
           
           The safe zone I've identified is where x4 >= 0.00733. I will make a grid of points within this rectangle, covering the available area.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 6, that I need to place 50 times on Surface 0 without any collisions.  Surface 0 is a rectangle, and the object is essentially a square, around 0.099 units on each side.  I've already got three other objects (IDs 5, 7, and 4) placed there, and I need to avoid bumping into them.
           
           The first thing I did was figure out where I *can't* place the new object. I calculated the allowed area on the surface based on the object's size. Then, I looked at the bounding boxes (AABBs) of the existing objects. They form some oddly shaped, L-like area of the surface is already taken. To place a new object, I have to ensure that its coordinates do not result in overlap.
           
           I tried to simplify the collision-detection by assuming the objects create a larger rectangular region. But then, I had to analyze the remaining space carefully. It seems like the available space is in a top-right section of the surface.  By examining the overlap and the surface's boundaries, I have identified the safe placement range.
           
           Now, I'll generate the 50 placements based on this safe area, mostly in a grid. I'll need to check the exact coordinates and orientations to make sure they're clear of other objects and within the surface. It is a bit trickier than it seems, so I'll need to be thorough with the coordinate calculations.

To place a new object, I have to ensure that its coordinates do not result in overlap.
           
           I tried to simplify the collision-detection by assuming the objects create a larger rectangular region. But then, I had to analyze the remaining space carefully. It seems like the available space is in a top-right section of the surface.  By examining the overlap and the surface's boundaries, I have identified the safe placement range.
           
           Now, I'll generate the 50 placements based on this safe area, mostly in a grid. I'll need to check the exact coordinates and orientations to make sure they're clear of other objects and within the surface. It is a bit trickier than it seems, so I'll need to be thorough with the coordinate calculations.
