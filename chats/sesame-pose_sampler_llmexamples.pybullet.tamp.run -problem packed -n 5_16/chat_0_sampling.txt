           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with sides of approximately 0.089 units. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its footprint, but a rotation of pi/4 would make it appear as a diamond. I will try to place the object in various positions on the surface. The surface has dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object has dimensions 0.089 x 0.089. This means that the object can fit comfortably on the surface.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, with a single square surface centered at the origin. I have successfully placed object 8 at the origin. Now I need to place object 7, which is also square with sides of approximately 0.072 units. I must ensure that the new placement for object 7 does not collide with the previously placed object 8 (at 0, 0, 0, 0).
           
           Since object 8 has dimensions 0.089 x 0.089 and is placed at the origin, its bounding box occupies x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           Object 7 has dimensions 0.072 x 0.072. To avoid collision, the center of object 7 must be far enough from the origin. The minimum distance between centers for the objects to not overlap is (0.089 + 0.072) / 2 = 0.0805. So, the absolute value of x and y coordinates of object 7 must be greater than 0.0805 for the objects to not collide when axis-aligned. I will choose placements that respect this condition.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 8 at (0, 0, 0, 0) and object 7 at (0, 0, 0.09, 0.0). Now I need to place object 4, which is square with sides of approximately 0.079 units.
           
           Object 8 (ID: 8) has dimensions 0.089 x 0.089 and is centered at (0,0). Its AABB is x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           Object 7 (ID: 7) has dimensions 0.072 x 0.072 and is centered at (0.09, 0.0). Its AABB is x: [0.09 - 0.036, 0.09 + 0.036] = [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].
           Object 4 (ID: 4) has dimensions 0.079 x 0.079.
           
           To avoid collision with object 8 (at origin), the center of object 4 must be at least (0.089 + 0.079) / 2 = 0.084 from the origin.
           To avoid collision with object 7 (at (0.09, 0.0)), the center of object 4 must be at least (0.072 + 0.079) / 2 = 0.0755 from (0.09, 0.0).
           
           Given the previous placements, the surface is quite populated along the x-axis around the center. I will try placing object 4 along the negative x-axis or along the y-axis, making sure it doesn't collide with the existing objects.
           
           Let's check potential collisions for a placement at (-0.09, 0.0):
           - With object 8: Center of 4 is (-0.09, 0.0). Distance to 8's center (0,0) is 0.09. Minimum distance needed is 0.084. So, 0.09 > 0.084, no collision with 8.
           - With object 7: Center of 4 is (-0.09, 0.0). Center of 7 is (0.09, 0.0). Distance between centers is 0.18. Minimum distance needed is 0.0755. So, 0.18 > 0.0755, no collision with 7.
           This placement at (-0.09, 0.0) seems stable and collision-free.
           
           I'll also consider placing it along the y-axis.
           Let's check potential collisions for a placement at (0.0, 0.09):
           - With object 8: Center of 4 is (0.0, 0.09). Distance to 8's center (0,0) is 0.09. Minimum distance needed is 0.084. So, 0.09 > 0.084, no collision with 8.
           - With object 7: Center of 4 is (0.0, 0.09). Center of 7 is (0.09, 0.0). Distance between centers is sqrt((0.09-0)^2 + (0-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0162) approx 0.127. Minimum distance needed is 0.0755. So, 0.127 > 0.0755, no collision with 7.
           This placement at (0.0, 0.09) also seems stable and collision-free.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 8 at (0, 0, 0, 0), object 7 at (0, 0, 0.09, 0.0), and object 4 at (0, 0, -0.09, 0.0). Now I need to place object 5, which is square with sides of approximately 0.091 units.
           
           Here's a summary of the placed objects and their AABBs:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [-0.1295, -0.0505], y: [-0.0395, 0.0395].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091.
           
           I need to find a placement for object 5 that does not collide with 8, 7, or 4.
           The entire central band along the x-axis, from approximately x = -0.1295 to x = 0.126, and y = -0.0445 to y = 0.0445 (roughly) is occupied by the existing objects.
           
           Let's consider placing object 5 along the y-axis, for example at (0.0, 0.09).
           - With object 8: Center of 5 is (0.0, 0.09). Distance to 8's center (0,0) is 0.09. Minimum distance needed is (0.089 + 0.091) / 2 = 0.09. So, 0.09 = 0.09, they are touching but not colliding along the y-axis (if they were axis-aligned and centered on same x). This placement is stable.
           - With object 7: Center of 5 is (0.0, 0.09). Center of 7 is (0.09, 0.0). Distance between centers is sqrt((0.09-0)^2 + (0-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0162) approx 0.127. Minimum distance needed is (0.072 + 0.091) / 2 = 0.0815. So, 0.127 > 0.0815, no collision.
           - With object 4: Center of 5 is (0.0, 0.09). Center of 4 is (-0.09, 0.0). Distance between centers is sqrt((-0.09-0)^2 + (0-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0162) approx 0.127. Minimum distance needed is (0.079 + 0.091) / 2 = 0.085. So, 0.127 > 0.085, no collision.
           This placement at (0.0, 0.09) looks good. I will choose (0.0, 0.09) and also (0.0, -0.09).

Model:     I have successfully placed object 8 at (0, 0, 0, 0), object 7 at (0, 0, 0.09, 0.0), object 4 at (0, 0, -0.09, 0.0), and object 5 at (0, 0, 0.0, 0.09). Now I need to place object 6, which is square with sides of approximately 0.081 units.
           
           Here's a summary of the placed objects and their AABBs:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [-0.1295, -0.0505], y: [-0.0395, 0.0395].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (0.0, 0.09). AABB: x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           - Object 6 (ID: 6): 0.081 x 0.081.
           
           I need to find a placement for object 6 that does not collide with 8, 7, 4, or 5.
           The central x-axis area (around y=0) is mostly occupied by 8, 7, and 4.
           The central y-axis area (around x=0) is mostly occupied by 8 and 5.
           
           Let's consider placing object 6 along the negative y-axis at (0.0, -0.09).
           - With object 8: Center of 6 is (0.0, -0.09). Distance to 8's center (0,0) is 0.09. Minimum distance needed is (0.089 + 0.081) / 2 = 0.085. So, 0.09 > 0.085, no collision.
           - With object 7: Center of 6 is (0.0, -0.09). Center of 7 is (0.09, 0.0). Distance between centers is sqrt((0.09-0)^2 + (0-(-0.09))^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0162) approx 0.127. Minimum distance needed is (0.072 + 0.081) / 2 = 0.0765. So, 0.127 > 0.0765, no collision.
           - With object 4: Center of 6 is (0.0, -0.09). Center of 4 is (-0.09, 0.0). Distance between centers is sqrt((-0.09-0)^2 + (0-(-0.09))^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0162) approx 0.127. Minimum distance needed is (0.079 + 0.081) / 2 = 0.08. So, 0.127 > 0.08, no collision.
           - With object 5: Center of 6 is (0.0, -0.09). Center of 5 is (0.0, 0.09). Distance between centers is 0.18. Minimum distance needed is (0.091 + 0.081) / 2 = 0.086. So, 0.18 > 0.086, no collision.
           This placement at (0.0, -0.09) looks good.
           
           Let's try a corner placement, for example (0.09, 0.09). However, object 7 (0.09, 0.0) and object 5 (0.0, 0.09) are already placed such that they occupy regions very close to this point. Object 7's AABB: [0.054, 0.126] x [-0.036, 0.036]. Object 5's AABB: [-0.0455, 0.0455] x [0.0445, 0.1355].
           A placement at (0.09, 0.09) for object 6 (size 0.081) would mean its AABB is [0.09 - 0.0405, 0.09 + 0.0405] = [0.0495, 0.1305] in x and y.
           This would collide with object 7 in x and object 5 in y. So, (0.09, 0.09) is not a good placement.
           
           I'll try (0.09, -0.09).
           - With object 8: Center of 6 is (0.09, -0.09). Distance to 8's center (0,0) is sqrt(0.09^2 + (-0.09)^2) = 0.127. Minimum needed 0.085. No collision.
           - With object 7: Center of 6 is (0.09, -0.09). Center of 7 is (0.09, 0.0). Distance is 0.09. Minimum needed 0.0765. No collision.
           - With object 4: Center of 6 is (0.09, -0.09). Center of 4 is (-0.09, 0.0). Distance is sqrt((0.09-(-0.09))^2 + (-0.09-0)^2) = sqrt(0.18^2 + (-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.0324 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0405) approx 0.201. Minimum needed 0.08. No collision.
           - With object 5: Center of 6 is (0.09, -0.09). Center of 5 is (0.0, 0.09). Distance is sqrt((0.09-0)^2 + (-0.09-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.09^2 + (-0.18)^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.0324) = sqrt(0.0405) approx 0.201. Minimum needed 0.086. No collision.
           This placement (0.09, -0.09) also looks good.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 8 at (0, 0, 0, 0), object 7 at (0, 0, 0.09, 0.0), object 4 at (0, 0, -0.09, 0.0), and object 5 at (0, 0, 0.0, 0.09) and (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09), (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.09), (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09). Many placements for object 6 were previously provided, and some were stable, while others (further out, especially with rotation) were not stable due to exceeding the surface bounds. I need to continue finding stable placements for object 6 (0.081 x 0.081).
           
           Let's re-evaluate the safe placement region for object 6. The surface is from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. Object 6 has half-extents of 0.081 / 2 = 0.0405. So, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0405 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0405 => -0.0945 <= x <= 0.0945
           -0.135 + 0.0405 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0405 => -0.0945 <= y <= 0.0945
           
           For placements with rotation (e.g., pi/4), the effective half-extents are larger. The diagonal of the object's square bounding box is sqrt(0.081^2 + 0.081^2) = 0.081 * sqrt(2) approx 0.1145. Half of this is approx 0.05725. So for theta = pi/4, the center must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.05725 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.05725 => -0.07775 <= x <= 0.07775
           -0.135 + 0.05725 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.05725 => -0.07775 <= y <= 0.07775
           This explains why some of the earlier rotated placements, like (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.09), were unstable.
           
           Current occupied AABBs:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].

           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (0.0, 0.09). AABB: x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].

           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (-0.09, 0.09). AABB: x: [-0.1355, -0.0445], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           
           Object 6 (ID: 6): 0.081 x 0.081.
           
           I need to find remaining spaces in the -0.0945 <= x, y <= 0.0945 box for axis-aligned placements.
           The previous stable placements for 6 were at corners, e.g., (0.09, -0.09) and (-0.09, -0.09). These are still valid.
           I will look for "mid-points" or other corner regions.
           
           Consider placing object 6 at (-0.09, 0.09).
           - Object 5 is already at (-0.09, 0.09). This would be a collision. I must avoid placing two objects at the same location if they are different IDs or if it's the same ID but I need a new placement. Since the previous request provided a list of successful placements for ID 6, I will assume those are 'fixed' in the same way the other IDs are fixed. I should avoid repeating successful placements if I need new ones to fulfill the quota of 50.
           
           Let's list the known fixed placements:
           (ID: 8) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
           (ID: 7) -- 0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0
           (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.09
           (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09
           
           And stable placements for ID 6 from previous turn:
           (ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09 (this is a direct collision with Object 5 at 0,0,-0.09 based on the current output. This is a learning point. Even if two objects can technically be placed at the same location without fixed collision, they would collide with each other. I will avoid placing new object 6 at locations where object 5 is, or any other object). I must consider all placed objects as obstacles for the current object.
           
           So, let's redefine the list of *all* objects and their *final, assumed* positions for collision checking with the *new* ID 6 object. If a previous request provided multiple successful placements for the *same* ID, it means those are *all* valid possibilities, but I only assume *one* of them is ultimately chosen for the scene setup. Given the wording, "These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests", it implies the *last* successful placement (or a selection of them) for an ID from the *previous* request are *in the scene*. This is a critical ambiguity.
           
           I'll assume that for *each* object ID, only *one* of its successful placements is chosen to be in the scene. If multiple successes are listed for the same ID in the "successes" section, it means *any one* of those could have been chosen. To be safe, I must find a placement that *avoids all previously listed successful placements for any object ID*. This is the safest interpretation for "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           Therefore, I need to assume the following objects are in the scene (picking the first successful placement for each ID):
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [-0.1295, -0.0505], y: [-0.0395, 0.0395].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (0.0, 0.09). AABB: x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           
           Now for Object 6 (ID: 6): 0.081 x 0.081.
           
           I will try to place Object 6 at (0.0, -0.09) again, as it was listed as a success for ID 6 previously, but then there were also other successes for ID 5 at (0.0, -0.09). This is the source of the ambiguity. If *all* successful placements from the previous turn are now 'fixed obstacles', then there's an issue. The prompt states "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This implies a *single* placement for a given object ID becomes an obstacle.
           
           I will proceed under the assumption that for each ID, the *first* successful placement in the "successes" list is the one that is now fixed. If there are multiple successes listed for the *current* object ID (ID 6 in this case), it simply means I have multiple options for where to put this specific object if it were to be placed in the scene, not that *all* of them are currently in the scene. This means I still need to find 50 *new* placements for the current object (ID 6).
           
           Therefore, the fixed objects are:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: [-0.0445, 0.0445] x [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: [0.054, 0.126] x [-0.036, 0.036].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0). AABB: [-0.1295, -0.0505] x [-0.0395, 0.0395].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (0.0, 0.09). AABB: [-0.0455, 0.0455] x [0.0445, 0.1355].
           
           Now let's find placements for object 6 (ID: 6, size 0.081 x 0.081).
           Valid center range for axis-aligned placement: x in [-0.0945, 0.0945], y in [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           
           Consider (0.0, -0.09):
           - With 8: dist( (0,-0.09), (0,0) ) = 0.09. Min dist = (0.089+0.081)/2 = 0.085. No collision.
           - With 7: dist( (0,-0.09), (0.09,0) ) = 0.127. Min dist = (0.072+0.081)/2 = 0.0765. No collision.
           - With 4: dist( (0,-0.09), (-0.09,0) ) = 0.127. Min dist = (0.079+0.081)/2 = 0.08. No collision.
           - With 5: dist( (0,-0.09), (0,0.09) ) = 0.18. Min dist = (0.091+0.081)/2 = 0.086. No collision.
           So (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09) is a valid, stable placement for object 6.
           
           Let's try (0.09, -0.09):
           - With 8: dist( (0.09,-0.09), (0,0) ) = 0.127. Min dist = 0.085. No collision.
           - With 7: dist( (0.09,-0.09), (0.09,0) ) = 0.09. Min dist = 0.0765. No collision.
           - With 4: dist( (0.09,-0.09), (-0.09,0) ) = 0.201. Min dist = 0.08. No collision.
           - With 5: dist( (0.09,-0.09), (0,0.09) ) = 0.201. Min dist = 0.086. No collision.
           So (0, 0.0, 0.09, -0.09) is a valid, stable placement for object 6.
           
           Let's try (-0.09, -0.09):
           - With 8: dist( (-0.09,-0.09), (0,0) ) = 0.127. Min dist = 0.085. No collision.
           - With 7: dist( (-0.09,-0.09), (0.09,0) ) = 0.201. Min dist = 0.0765. No collision.
           - With 4: dist( (-0.09,-0.09), (-0.09,0) ) = 0.09. Min dist = 0.08. No collision.
           - With 5: dist( (-0.09,-0.09), (0,0.09) ) = 0.201. Min dist = 0.086. No collision.
           So (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) is a valid, stable placement for object 6.
           
           I will continue generating variations of these. I need to be careful with rotations now. For 0.785 rad rotation, the max (abs) x/y extent is ~0.057. So the center has to be within [-0.07775, 0.07775].

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     My previous reasoning about the interpretation of "successful placements" was flawed. The feedback shows *all* listed placements are considered 'fixed obstacles' or simply 'part of the scene' for future collision checks. This means that multiple placements for the *same ID* can coexist. This drastically changes the available space.
           
           Let's re-list *all* fixed objects and their exact AABBs based on *all* provided successes. I need to be careful with the ID 6 successes, as they also contained some failures for coordinates slightly outside the boundary.
           
           The fixed obstacles are:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [-0.1295, -0.0505], y: [-0.0395, 0.0395].
           
           And now for Object 5 (ID: 5, size 0.091 x 0.091):
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09) -> AABB: x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09) -> AABB: x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [-0.1355, -0.0445].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.09) -> AABB: x: [0.0445, 0.1355], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           - (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.09) -> AABB: x: [-0.1355, -0.0445], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.09, -0.09) -> AABB: x: [0.0445, 0.1355], y: [-0.1355, -0.0445].
           - (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) -> AABB: x: [-0.1355, -0.0445], y: [-0.1355, -0.0445].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.09) -> AABB: x: [0.0045, 0.0955], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           - (0, 0.0, -0.05, 0.09) -> AABB: x: [-0.0955, -0.0045], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.05, -0.09) -> AABB: x: [0.0045, 0.0955], y: [-0.1355, -0.0445].
           
           And for Object 6 (ID: 6, size 0.081 x 0.081). I will only list the previously *successful* placements for ID 6, ignoring the ones that were explicitly marked as failures.
           
           Successful placements for Object 6 (0.081 x 0.081, half_size = 0.0405):

           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.02) -> AABB: x: [-0.0405, 0.0405], y: [-0.0605, 0.0205].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.02, -0.02) -> AABB: x: [-0.0205, 0.0605], y: [-0.0605, 0.0205].
           - (0, 0.0, -0.02, -0.02) -> AABB: x: [-0.0605, 0.0205], y: [-0.0605, 0.0205].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.01) -> AABB: x: [-0.0405, 0.0405], y: [-0.0505, 0.0305].
           - (0, 0.0, 0.01, -0.01) -> AABB: x: [-0.0305, 0.0505], y: [-0.0505, 0.0305].
           - (0, 0.0, -0.01, -0.01) -> AABB: x: [-0.0505, 0.0305], y: [-0.0505, 0.0305].
           
           The space is getting very crowded, especially in the bottom half. The central region (x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445]) is occupied by Object 8.
           The top-left corner seems to have less density of small objects.
           Maximum center for unrotated object is (0.0945, 0.0945).
           Object 6 (0.081 x 0.081). half_size = 0.0405.
           
           Let's look at the remaining 'empty' corners:
           - Top-Right (0.09, 0.09) is taken by Object 5.
           - Bottom-Right (0.09, -0.09) is taken by Object 6.
           - Bottom-Left (-0.09, -0.09) is taken by Object 6.
           - Top-Left (-0.09, 0.09) is taken by Object 5.
           
           This means the corners are quite full. I need to find locations that are not directly on these 'grid' points.
           The available space is now primarily the outer edges/corners of the surface that haven't been filled by all these objects, *and* that satisfy the stability constraints.
           
           I need to find places where an AABB of 0.081x0.081 (or 0.1145x0.1145 for 45-deg rotation) can fit without overlapping with the AABBs of any of the fixed objects, and within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's test an offset placement for ID 6.
           Try (0.0, 0.0). This overlaps with ID 8. No.
           Try (0.0, 0.01). Overlaps with ID 8. No.
           
           Consider a placement at (0.0, -0.09) was successful for ID 6 (and ID 5).
           Consider (0.05, 0.05).
           - With 8: dist((0.05, 0.05), (0,0)) = 0.0707. Min dist = (0.089+0.081)/2 = 0.085. Collision. (0.0707 < 0.085).
           
           My strategy of checking distance between centers is suitable for circular objects or simplified AABB checks. However, with many existing AABBs, a visual inspection or a more rigorous AABB overlap test is necessary.
           The problem statement gives me feedback "collided with fixed obstacles", so I should generate candidates and learn from the failures.
           
           I need new placements that are not in the existing set of successes and also not in the set of failures.
           The last set of failures for ID 6 were for positions like (0.0, -0.1), (0.1, -0.1), (-0.1, -0.1) and their rotated variants. This implies the stable region boundary is very close to 0.09 for axis-aligned placements and 0.07 for rotated ones.
           
           I'll target locations in the remaining "quadrants" or "channels" that haven't been filled.
           The upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right regions are filled.
           The middle regions around (0, X) and (X, 0) are filled.
           
           There's a band of space near the edge from roughly `x = 0.0945` to `0.135 - 0.0405 = 0.0945` and same for y.
           Let's look at positive X, positive Y.
           All of `(0.09, 0.09)`, `(0.09, 0.0)`, `(0.0, 0.09)` are occupied by ID 5 or 7.
           Let's try (0.06, 0.06).
           - Object 6 center (0.06, 0.06), half size 0.0405. AABB: [0.0195, 0.1005] x [0.0195, 0.1005].
           - Object 8 (0,0): AABB: [-0.0445, 0.0445] x [-0.0445, 0.0445]. Overlap in x and y. Collision with 8.
           
           How about (0.0, 0.0)? Collision with 8.
           How about (0.0, 0.01)? Collision with 8.
           
           The only way to avoid collision with 8 is to have `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` greater than roughly 0.0445 + 0.0405 = 0.085.
           So, placements like (0.0, 0.0), (0.01, 0.01) etc., near the center, will always collide with object 8. This explains why my first set of placements for ID 8 included (0,0,0,0) as a first attempt.
           
           I will try to place the object in some of the small gaps that are not directly on the axis-aligned lines or corners.
           
           Let's consider the region near (0.0, 0.0). We know it's occupied by 8.
           The region around (0.09, 0.0) is 7. The region around (-0.09, 0.0) is 4.
           The region around (0.0, 0.09) is 5. The region around (0.0, -0.09) is 5.
           
           Let's reconsider (0.0, -0.09) and other successful placements for ID 6. If they were successful, it implies they did not collide with other fixed objects *at the time of that request*. But now, if ID 5 also sits at (0.0, -0.09), then a new ID 6 at (0.0, -0.09) would collide with an existing ID 5. This is the crucial point.
           
           So, I need to treat ALL provided successful placements for ALL IDs as fixed obstacles, and then find new places for ID 6.
           
           Fixed objects and their AABBs (including ID 6 successful placements):
           - ID 8 (0.0, 0.0): [-0.0445, 0.0445] x [-0.0445, 0.0445]
           - ID 7 (0.09, 0.0): [0.054, 0.126] x [-0.036, 0.036]
           - ID 4 (-0.09, 0.0): [-0.1295, -0.0505] x [-0.0395, 0.0395]
           - ID 5 (0.0, 0.09): [-0.0455, 0.0455] x [0.0445, 0.1355]
           - ID 5 (0.0, -0.09): [-0.0455, 0.0455] x [-0.1355, -0.0445]
           - ID 5 (0.09, 0.09): [0.0445, 0.1355] x [0.0445, 0.1355]
           - ID 5 (-0.09, 0.09): [-0.1355, -0.0445] x [0.0445, 0.1355]
           - ID 5 (0.09, -0.09): [0.0445, 0.1355] x [-0.1355, -0.0445]
           - ID 5 (-0.09, -0.09): [-0.1355, -0.0445] x [-0.1355, -0.0445]
           - ID 5 (0.05, 0.09): [0.0045, 0.0955] x [0.0445, 0.1355]
           - ID 5 (-0.05, 0.09): [-0.0955, -0.0045] x [0.0445, 0.1355]
           - ID 5 (0.05, -0.09): [0.0045, 0.0955] x [-0.1355, -0.0445]
           
           - ID 6 (0.0, -0.09): [-0.0405, 0.0405] x [-0.1305, -0.0495] (This clashes with ID 5 at (0.0, -0.09))
           - ID 6 (0.09, -0.09): [0.0495, 0.1305] x [-0.1305, -0.0495] (This clashes with ID 5 at (0.09, -0.09))
           - ID 6 (-0.09, -0.09): [-0.1305, -0.0495] x [-0.1305, -0.0495] (This clashes with ID 5 at (-0.09, -0.09))
           This is very confusing. The same coordinates are being reused for different objects/IDs as "successes". This means the prompt isn't assuming all previously successful placements are in the scene simultaneously.
           
           Let's follow the first interpretation I had: for each object ID, *only the first listed successful placement* is considered "fixed". If an ID is requested again, I need to generate *new* placements for that ID, avoiding previous ones for *all* IDs (including new ones for the current ID that *might* be chosen).
           So the list of fixed obstacles is minimal, which allows for more placements.
           
           Fixed Objects for collision checking:
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0). AABB: x: [-0.0445, 0.0445], y: [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [0.054, 0.126], y: [-0.036, 0.036].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0). AABB: x: [-0.1295, -0.0505], y: [-0.0395, 0.0395].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (0.0, 0.09). AABB: x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           
           Now for Object 6 (ID: 6): 0.081 x 0.081. This is the object I'm currently trying to place.
           I must avoid *all* of the previously listed successful placements for ID 6. I also must avoid the placements for IDs 8, 7, 4, and 5.
           
           Let's mark the center coordinates already used for ID 6 in previous successes:
           (0.0, -0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09), (0.05, -0.09), (-0.05, -0.09), (0.09, -0.05), (-0.09, -0.05), (0.02, -0.09), (-0.02, -0.09), (0.09, -0.02), (-0.09, -0.02), (0.0, -0.08), (0.08, -0.08), (-0.08, -0.08), (0.0, -0.07), (0.07, -0.07), (-0.07, -0.07), (0.0, -0.06), (0.06, -0.06), (-0.06, -0.06), (0.0, -0.05), (0.05, -0.05), (-0.05, -0.05), (0.0, -0.04), (0.04, -0.04), (-0.04, -0.04), (0.0, -0.03), (0.03, -0.03), (-0.03, -0.03), (0.0, -0.02), (0.02, -0.02), (-0.02, -0.02), (0.0, -0.01), (0.01, -0.01), (-0.01, -0.01).
           Also, rotations of some of these were successful. The axis-aligned AABB for a rotated square is the same as the unrotated one if the object is square itself (for 90-degree rotations). For 45-degree rotations, the effective bounding box is larger (diagonal as side).
           
           The failures for ID 6 at negative y values with rotation 0.785398... (45 degrees) for coordinates like (0.0, -0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09) and also (0.0, -0.1), (0.1, -0.1), (-0.1, -0.1) confirms that for 45-degree rotations, the object occupies more space and the safe zone boundary is tighter (around 0.07775).
           
           I need to find places in the region:
           x, y in [-0.0945, 0.0945] for 0 or pi/2 rotation.
           x, y in [-0.07775, 0.07775] for pi/4 rotation.
           
           Given the density of successful placements for ID 6 in the negative y region, I should focus on the positive x and y regions. The top-right corner is (0.09, 0.09) for ID 5. This is very close to surface boundary.
           
           Let's try to fill the remaining positive Y space that isn't already taken by ID 5 centered at (0.0, 0.09), (0.09, 0.09), (-0.09, 0.09), etc.
           
           How about (0.0, 0.0)? No, collision with ID 8.
           How about (0.0, 0.01)? No, collision with ID 8.
           How about (0.0, 0.02)? No, collision with ID 8.
           How about (0.0, 0.03)? No, collision with ID 8.
           How about (0.0, 0.04)? No, collision with ID 8.
           
           The only safe region for ID 6 seems to be the one where it can completely avoid the already placed AABBs.
           I will generate placements that are slightly offset from the currently placed objects, trying to find small gaps.
           
           Let's try to fill the 'middle-ish' regions that are not on the main axes, and also not too far out that they become unstable.
           Consider x: 0.06 to 0.08, y: 0.06 to 0.08 range.
           (0.06, 0.06) was a collision with 8.
           What about the region that is not directly aligned with object 8, 7, 4, 5 etc?
           The coordinates for the successful ID 6 placements were overwhelmingly in the negative y region. This implies there is space for it there that does not overlap with 8, 7, 4, 5.
           
           Let's try the *positive* Y region, specifically where ID 5 is not sitting, but within the bounds.
           ID 5 at (0.0, 0.09) occupies x: [-0.0455, 0.0455], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           ID 5 at (0.09, 0.09) occupies x: [0.0445, 0.1355], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           ID 5 at (-0.09, 0.09) occupies x: [-0.1355, -0.0445], y: [0.0445, 0.1355].
           
           This means the entire upper band from y=0.0445 to y=0.1355 is heavily occupied from x=-0.1355 to x=0.1355.
           So, the negative y region is the more likely candidate for new placements, which is why I focused there before.
           
           I must *not* re-use the successful ID 6 placements as new candidate placements.
           I also must strictly obey the boundary limits.
           
           Let's reconsider the stable range for centers of ID 6 for an unrotated object: `x,y in [-0.0945, 0.0945]`.
           For 45-degree rotated: `x,y in [-0.07775, 0.07775]`.
           
           Available regions for a new ID 6:
           - A small gap exists between ID 8 (0,0) and ID 7 (0.09, 0.0) along x-axis for positive y. The union of AABBs for 8 and 7 is approximately [-0.0445, 0.126] x [-0.0445, 0.0445].
           - Object 6 is 0.081.
           
           I need to place 50 items. This is hard when the area is so constrained. I will try to fill small gaps that were previously missed.
           Given the previous successes for ID 6 in the negative y-region, let's explore that area again with slightly different coordinates.
           The coordinates like (0.0, -0.09) for ID 6 (or ID 5) seem to be at the edge of stability. The failures for (0.0, -0.1) confirm this.
           
           I will try some coordinates that are slightly off from the main axes, and not previously listed.
           Consider the negative y, negative x quadrant not fully saturated yet.
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.09) - This one failed to be in the success list. Why? Perhaps it collided with -0.09, -0.09 or -0.05, -0.09.
           - AABB of ID 6 at (-0.08, -0.09) is x: [-0.1205, -0.0395], y: [-0.1305, -0.0495].
           - Compare to ID 6 at (-0.09, -0.09), AABB: x: [-0.1305, -0.0495], y: [-0.1305, -0.0495]. There is an overlap in y. In x, it is partial overlap. x_min of current = -0.1205. x_max of fixed = -0.0495. They overlap. This would cause a collision.
           
           This means I must be very careful not to overlap with *any* of the listed successful positions for *any* ID.
           
           The available space is becoming extremely fragmented and small. The overall surface is 0.27x0.27.
           ID 8 (0.089) is in center.
           ID 7 (0.072) is at (0.09, 0).
           ID 4 (0.079) is at (-0.09, 0).
           ID 5 (0.091) is at (0, 0.09).
           
           So roughly:
           x-axis: [-0.1295 to -0.0505] occupied by 4. [-0.0445 to 0.0445] occupied by 8. [0.054 to 0.126] occupied by 7.
           y-axis at x=0: [-0.0445 to 0.0445] by 8. [0.0445 to 0.1355] by 5.
           
           This leaves a narrow band of space around y = 0 for x outside the [-0.13, 0.13] bounds.
           And narrow bands around x = 0 for y outside the [-0.13, 0.13] bounds.
           
           Let's try to place in the region `x > 0.0445` and `y > 0.0445` but *not* (0.09,0.09) etc.
           The coordinate `0.09` for object centers seems to be a common target. The maximum center coordinate is 0.0945.
           So, the region `x in [0.0445, 0.0945]` and `y in [0.0445, 0.0945]` is potentially available, provided I don't collide with existing objects.
           
           I'll target the four corners of the 'empty' quadrants.
           (0.045, 0.045): collision with 8.
           (0.045, -0.045): collision with 8.
           (-0.045, 0.045): collision with 8.
           (-0.045, -0.045): collision with 8.
           
           I need to ensure the full object AABB fits within `(-0.135, -0.135)` and `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           And that it does not overlap with any of the fixed obstacles' AABBs.
           
           Given the density of placements for ID 6 in the negative Y zone, I'll attempt placements in the positive Y zone where there are fewer ID 6s.
           The fixed obstacles in the top half are:
           - ID 8 (0,0) (overlaps into top half)
           - ID 5 (0.0, 0.09)
           - ID 5 (0.09, 0.09)
           - ID 5 (-0.09, 0.09)
           - ID 5 (0.05, 0.09)
           - ID 5 (-0.05, 0.09)
           
           This means the top half is very full along `y=0.09`.
           Let's try `y=0.05` to `y=0.08` in the 'top left' and 'top right' gaps.
           
           (0.06, 0.05)
           - ID 6 AABB: [0.0195, 0.1005] x [0.0095, 0.0905]
           - Collision with 8? No. (8 is [-0.0445, 0.0445]x[-0.0445, 0.0445]). Min x_overlap 0.0195, max x_overlap 0.0445. Overlap.
           - Collision with 7? (7 is [0.054, 0.126] x [-0.036, 0.036]). x overlap. 0.054 to 0.1005. y_min 0.0095 > 0.036. No y overlap. No collision.
           - Collision with 5(0.0,0.09)? x: [0.0195, 0.1005]. 5: [-0.0455, 0.0455]. No x overlap.
           - Collision with 5(0.09,0.09)? x: [0.0195, 0.1005]. 5: [0.0445, 0.1355]. x overlap. y: [0.0095, 0.0905]. 5: [0.0445, 0.1355]. y overlap. Collision.
           
           This is much harder than anticipated due to the density. I need to find locations very precisely.
           I will generate a grid of valid centers and then filter for collisions.
           Safe bounds for object center for unrotated object 6: [-0.0945, 0.0945].
           I need to avoid the 'core' region: [-0.0445 - 0.0405, 0.0445 + 0.0405] x [-0.0445 - 0.0405, 0.0445 + 0.0405] = [-0.085, 0.085] x [-0.085, 0.085] due to ID 8.
           This means for an unrotated object, at least one of `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` must be greater than 0.085.
           
           I will attempt a sparse grid of valid (x,y) coordinates within the safe range `[-0.0945, 0.0945]`, making sure `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` is greater than 0.085.
           Candidates for (x,y) could be (0.09, 0.0), (-0.09, 0.0), (0.0, 0.09), (0.0, -0.09) and their small offsets. However, most of these are already taken by other IDs or previous 6 IDs.
           
           Let's try to fill the remaining slots very close to the edge, or between existing blocks.
           Possible candidates for centers of new ID 6:
           - (0.094, 0.0) -> x from 0.0535 to 0.1345, y from -0.0405 to 0.0405.
               - Collision with 7: Yes, x overlap with [0.054, 0.126]. No.
           - (0.0, 0.094) -> x from -0.0405 to 0.0405, y from 0.0535 to 0.1345.
               - Collision with 5: Yes, y overlap with [0.0445, 0.1355]. No.
           
           The only way to proceed is by generating a new set of possible placements that are very specific and try to avoid all currently occupied spots. This is highly constrained.
           I will focus on the corners not occupied by ID 5, or the regions between.
           
           Consider x in range [0.08, 0.09], y in range [-0.04, 0.04]. This region is very close to ID 7 (0.09,0.0).
           ID 7 is [0.054, 0.126] x [-0.036, 0.036].
           If object 6 is at (0.08, 0.0), its AABB is [0.0395, 0.1205] x [-0.0405, 0.0405].
           This would collide with ID 7 (overlap in x and y).
           
           Okay, this requires very precise non-overlapping placements.
           I'll try to find "negative" spaces.
           For example, the region y < -0.09: it's all failures because it's outside.
           The region x > 0.09 and y > 0.09 is for 5.
           The region x < -0.09 and y > 0.09 is for 5.
           The region x > 0.09 and y < -0.09 is for 5 and 6.
           The region x < -0.09 and y < -0.09 is for 5 and 6.
           
           I need to choose coordinates and orientations that are *not* already used for successful placements of ID 6, and that also do not collide with any of the fixed objects (8, 7, 4, 5).
           
           Since I am asked to provide 50 stable placements, I will assume that the prior successful placements for object 6 were chosen to illustrate the types of valid placements possible, but that for *this* request, I can *re-propose* them if they are still valid in the current scene (considering the base 8, 7, 4, 5 objects). The prompt stated, "You may reuse previous placements if they are stable". This contradicts my earlier stricter interpretation for ID 6. I will re-use successful ID 6 placements as they are *not* the 'fixed obstacles' that I am trying to avoid, but rather *examples* of stable placements for this current object. This seems more in line with the quantity requested.
           
           Fixed obstacles (based on first listed success per ID):
           - Object 8 (ID: 8): 0.089 x 0.089, centered at (0,0).
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): 0.072 x 0.072, centered at (0.09, 0.0).
           - Object 4 (ID: 4): 0.079 x 0.079, centered at (-0.09, 0.0).
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): 0.091 x 0.091, centered at (0.0, 0.09).
           
           Object 6 (ID: 6): 0.081 x 0.081.
           
           Now, I will generate placements for ID 6, avoiding *only* these 4 objects. This should give me plenty of room. The previous 'successes' for ID 6 were just examples, not fixed objects.
