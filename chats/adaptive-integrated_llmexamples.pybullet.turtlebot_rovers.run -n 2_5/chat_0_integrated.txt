           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two landers, v9, several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8), two objectives (v17, v18), a camera (v10), a mode (v11), and a store (v16). Both rovers are currently at their base configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have a free store v16. The camera v10 is onboard both rovers and supports mode v11.
           
           The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (This means we need to analyze a rock of type v2)
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (This means we need to analyze a rock of type v6)
           
           Looking at the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           So, the first four conditions are already met.
           
           We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This involves:
           1. Calibrating the camera.
           2. Taking an image of the objective.
           3. Sending the image.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?r)` for a rock of type `v2` and `v6`:
           1. Sample a rock of type `v2`.
           2. Sample a rock of type `v6`.
           3. Send the analysis of these rocks.
           
           Let's analyze the available actions and predicates to achieve the goal:
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           - Rover v12 can image v17 and v18 using configuration #o3 and ray #o4.
           - Rover v14 can image v17 and v18 using configuration #o3 and ray #o4.
           - Both rovers can communicate with lander v9 from configuration #o0 with ray #o1.
           
           Let's use rover v12 to take and send images of v17 and v18.
           - To take an image, v12 needs to be calibrated.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is true.
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true.
           - `onboard(v10, v12)` and `supports(v10, v11)` are true.
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true. However, `calibrate` and `take_image` require `atconf(v12, #o3)`. This means v12 needs to move to #o3. However, there are no `move` actions available to change `v12`'s configuration from `v13` to `#o3`. Only `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` which is a no-op, and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` which is also a no-op.
           This is a problem for using `#o3` for imaging. If `#o3` were `v13`, it would be simpler. But the problem states that `#o3` is a continuous parameter, and `conf(v12, #o3)` is given. However, there is no direct `move` action to `#o3`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the initial state for possible configurations.
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           
           The available actions are only `move` with a no-op movement, and `drop_rock` with an empty store. No other actions are provided as valid instances. This means we cannot take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis if it requires moving to a different configuration than the current ones (v13 and v15).
           
           However, if an action *can* be executed from the current configuration (e.g., v13), then it's valid if the preconditions are met.
           Let's check `imagevisible` and `comvisible` at `v13` or `v15`.
           The initial state gives `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, where `#o3` is a configuration. It also gives `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, where `#o0` is a configuration.
           The same applies to v14.
           
           Since no `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, or `calibrate` actions are provided as valid instances, the goal of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved. The only valid action instances are `move` actions which are no-ops and `drop_rock` actions which also don't help as the stores are already free.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the limited set of allowed action instances.
           
           The goal is not achievable because the necessary action instances (like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`) are not provided in the list of valid action instances. Only no-op `move` actions and `drop_rock` actions (which are not useful as the stores are free) are available.
