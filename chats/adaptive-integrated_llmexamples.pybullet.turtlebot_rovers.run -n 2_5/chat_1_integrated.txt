User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           A possible plan would be:
           1. Rover `v12` handles `v17` and `v3` (type v2 stone).
           2. Rover `v14` handles `v18` and `v7` (type v6 soil).
           3. Both rovers send their data from configuration `#o0`.
           
           Detailed steps:
           
           For `v12`:
           - Move `v12` to `#o3` to image `v17`.
           - Calibrate `v10` for `v17`.
           - Take image of `v17`.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` to sample `v3`.
           - Sample `v3`.
           - Move `v12` to `#o3` to image `v18`.
           - Calibrate `v10` for `v18`.
           - Take image of `v18`.
           - Move `v12` to `#o0` to send data.
           - Send image of `v17`.
           - Send image of `v18`.
           - Send analysis of `v3`.
           
           For `v14`:
           - Move `v14` to `#o3` to image `v17`.
           - Calibrate `v10` for `v17`.
           - Take image of `v17`. (This is redundant if `v12` already did it, but the goal only requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, not that a specific rover takes it. We can adjust the plan to be more efficient.) Let's have `v12` do `v17` and `v14` do `v18`.
           
           Revised plan:
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           1. Move to `#o3` to image `v17`.
           2. Calibrate camera for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Move to `#o5` to sample rock `v3` (type `v2`).
           5. Sample rock `v3`.
           6. Move to `#o0` to send data.
           7. Send image of `v17`.
           8. Send analysis of `v3`.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           1. Move to `#o3` to image `v18`.
           2. Calibrate camera for `v18`.
           3. Take image of `v18`.
           4. Move to `#o5` to sample rock `v7` (type `v6`).
           5. Sample rock `v7`.
           6. Move to `#o0` to send data.
           7. Send image of `v18`.
           8. Send analysis of `v7`.
           
           This revised plan distributes the tasks between the two rovers to achieve all required conditions.
           
           Let's check for collisions and reachability.
           The initial configuration for v12 is v13, and for v14 is v15.
           All configurations #o0, #o3, #o5 are assumed to be reachable from the current configuration via `motion` actions, as explicitly stated in the initial state. The rays #o1 and #o4 are also given.
           The `blocked` predicate is not true in the initial state for any ray mentioned, so we can assume visibility.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           Revised plan:
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           1. Move to `#o3` to image `v17`.
           2. Calibrate camera for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Move to `#o5` to sample rock `v3` (type `v2`).
           5. Sample rock `v3`.
           6. Move to `#o0` to send data.
           7. Send image of `v17`.
           8. Send analysis of `v3`.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           1. Move to `#o3` to image `v18`.
           2. Calibrate camera for `v18`.
           3. Take image of `v18`.
           4. Move to `#o5` to sample rock `v7` (type `v6`).
           5. Sample rock `v7`.
           6. Move to `#o0` to send data.
           7. Send image of `v18`.
           8. Send analysis of `v7`.
           
           This revised plan distributes the tasks between the two rovers to achieve all required conditions.
           
           Let's check for collisions and reachability.

           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           The previous plan failed because the proposed configurations for `#o3` and `#o5` were not reachable for the rovers. I need to propose configurations that are reachable for the rovers.
           
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` (target `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`), `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. A configuration for `#o3` needs to be closer to `v17`. A configuration near `(-0.5, 1.0)` seems like a good target.
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` (target `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)`), `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. A configuration near `(0.5, 1.0)` seems like a good target.
           
           For `above(v12, #o5, v3)` (target `v3` at `(0.487, -0.806)`), `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. A configuration near `(0.5, -0.7)` seems reasonable.
           For `above(v14, #o5, v7)` (target `v7` at `(-1.983, -0.205)`), `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. A configuration near `(-1.9, -0.1)` seems reasonable.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` (target `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)`), `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. A configuration for `#o0` should be within 4 units of `v9`. A configuration like `(-0.8, -0.7)` might be suitable for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. Let's try `(1.0, -1.75)` for `v12` to communicate, assuming it's within range, or closer to the lander. Let's try `(0.0, -2.0)` for `v12` for `v9`. `v9` minx,miny = `(-2.405, -2.346)`. A config for `v12` like `(-0.8, -0.7)` would be closer to `v9`.
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` (target `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)`), `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. A configuration for `#o0` should be within 4 units of `v9`. A configuration like `(-0.8, -0.7)` might be suitable.
           
           Let's refine the configuration choices considering reachability from initial positions:
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`):**
           - To image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`), let's try `#o3` at `(0.0, 0.0)`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.0, 0.0)` is sqrt((1-0)^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 3.0625) = sqrt(4.0625) approx 2.0. This seems reasonable. Distance from `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v17` is sqrt((-0.549-0)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt(0.3014 + 3.411) = sqrt(3.7124) approx 1.9. This is within 2.
           - To sample `v3` (at `(0.487, -0.806)`), let's try `#o5` at `(0.5, -1.0)`. Distance from `(0.0, 0.0)` (previous config) to `(0.5, -1.0)` is sqrt((0.5-0)^2 + (-1.0-0)^2) = sqrt(0.25+1) = sqrt(1.25) approx 1.1. Distance from `(0.5, -1.0)` to `v3` is sqrt((0.487-0.5)^2 + (-0.806-(-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.013)^2 + (0.194)^2) = sqrt(0.000169 + 0.0376) approx sqrt(0.0378) approx 0.19. This is very close.
           - To communicate with `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`), let's try `#o0` at `(-0.5, -2.0)`. Distance from `(0.5, -1.0)` (previous config) to `(-0.5, -2.0)` is sqrt((-0.5-0.5)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-1)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(1+1) = sqrt(2) approx 1.4. Distance from `(-0.5, -2.0)` to `v9` is sqrt((-2.405-(-0.5))^2 + (-2.346-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.905)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(3.629 + 0.1197) = sqrt(3.748) approx 1.9. This is within 4.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           - To image `v18` (at `(0.543, 2.031)`), let's try `#o3` at `(0.0, 0.0)`. Distance from `v15` to `(0.0, 0.0)` is sqrt((-1-0)^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(1 + 3.0625) = sqrt(4.0625) approx 2.0. This seems reasonable. Distance from `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v18` is sqrt((0.543-0)^2 + (2.031-0)^2) = sqrt(0.2948 + 4.1249) = sqrt(4.4197) approx 2.1. This is within 2.
           - To sample `v7` (at `(-1.983, -0.205)`), let's try `#o5` at `(-1.5, -0.5)`. Distance from `(0.0, 0.0)` (previous config) to `(-1.5, -0.5)` is sqrt((-1.5-0)^2 + (-0.5-0)^2) = sqrt(2.25+0.25) = sqrt(2.5) approx 1.58. Distance from `(-1.5, -0.5)` to `v7` is sqrt((-1.983-(-1.5))^2 + (-0.205-(-0.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.483)^2 + (0.295)^2) = sqrt(0.233 + 0.087) = sqrt(0.32) approx 0.56. This is close enough.
           - To communicate with `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`), let's try `#o0` at `(-0.5, -2.0)`. Distance from `(-1.5, -0.5)` (previous config) to `(-0.5, -2.0)` is sqrt((-0.5-(-1.5))^2 + (-2.0-(-0.5))^2) = sqrt((1)^2 + (-1.5)^2) = sqrt(1+2.25) = sqrt(3.25) approx 1.8. Distance from `(-0.5, -2.0)` to `v9` is sqrt((-2.405-(-0.5))^2 + (-2.346-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.905)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(3.629 + 0.1197) = sqrt(3.748) approx 1.9. This is within 4.
           
           These configurations attempt to satisfy the reachability constraint by being within a reasonable distance from the initial position or the preceding configuration.

           Configuration #o5 = (-1.5 -0.5) for rover v14 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           The previous plan failed because the proposed configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5` were not reachable or were in collision. I need to propose configurations that are reachable for the rovers and collision-free.
           
           Obstacle `v19` is `AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This is a thin wall along the y-axis at x=0.0. This means configurations with x-coordinate 0.0 are in collision.
           
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` (target `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`), `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) needs to move. We need a configuration with x not equal to 0. Let's try `(0.1, 0.0)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.1, 0.0)` is sqrt((1-0.1)^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.8725) approx 1.96. Distance from `(0.1, 0.0)` to `v17` is sqrt((-0.549-0.1)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt((-0.649)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(0.421 + 3.411) = sqrt(3.832) approx 1.95. This is within 2.
           
           For `above(v12, #o5, v3)` (target `v3` at `(0.487, -0.806)`), let's try `#o5` at `(0.5, -1.0)`. Distance from `(0.1, 0.0)` (previous config) to `(0.5, -1.0)` is sqrt((0.5-0.1)^2 + (-1.0-0)^2) = sqrt(0.16+1) = sqrt(1.16) approx 1.07. Distance from `(0.5, -1.0)` to `v3` is sqrt((0.487-0.5)^2 + (-0.806-(-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.013)^2 + (0.194)^2) = sqrt(0.000169 + 0.0376) approx sqrt(0.0378) approx 0.19. This is very close.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` (target `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)`), let's try `#o0` at `(0.1, -2.0)`. Distance from `(0.5, -1.0)` (previous config) to `(0.1, -2.0)` is sqrt((0.1-0.5)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(0.16+1) = sqrt(1.16) approx 1.07. Distance from `(0.1, -2.0)` to `v9` is sqrt((-2.405-0.1)^2 + (-2.346-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-2.505)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(6.275 + 0.1197) = sqrt(6.394) approx 2.5. This is within 4.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           - To image `v18` (at `(0.543, 2.031)`), let's try `#o3` at `(-0.1, 0.0)`. Distance from `v15` to `(-0.1, 0.0)` is sqrt((-1-(-0.1))^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + 3.0625) = sqrt(0.81 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.8725) approx 1.96. Distance from `(-0.1, 0.0)` to `v18` is sqrt((0.543-(-0.1))^2 + (2.031-0)^2) = sqrt((0.643)^2 + 2.031^2) = sqrt(0.413 + 4.1249) = sqrt(4.5379) approx 2.13. This is within 2.
           
           - To sample `v7` (at `(-1.983, -0.205)`), let's try `#o5` at `(-1.5, -0.5)`. Distance from `(-0.1, 0.0)` (previous config) to `(-1.5, -0.5)` is sqrt((-1.5-(-0.1))^2 + (-0.5-0)^2) = sqrt((-1.4)^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.96+0.25) = sqrt(2.21) approx 1.48. Distance from `(-1.5, -0.5)` to `v7` is sqrt((-1.983-(-1.5))^2 + (-0.205-(-0.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.483)^2 + (0.295)^2) = sqrt(0.233 + 0.087) = sqrt(0.32) approx 0.56. This is close enough.
           
           - To communicate with `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`), let's try `#o0` at `(-0.1, -2.0)`. Distance from `(-1.5, -0.5)` (previous config) to `(-0.1, -2.0)` is sqrt((-0.1-(-1.5))^2 + (-2.0-(-0.5))^2) = sqrt((1.4)^2 + (-1.5)^2) = sqrt(1.96+2.25) = sqrt(4.21) approx 2.05. Distance from `(-0.1, -2.0)` to `v9` is sqrt((-2.405-(-0.1))^2 + (-2.346-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-2.305)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(5.313 + 0.1197) = sqrt(5.4327) approx 2.33. This is within 4.
           
           These configurations avoid the collision with `v19` (x=0.0) and attempt to be reachable from the rover's current position.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           The previous plan failed because the proposed configurations for `#o0`, `#o3` and `#o5` were not reachable or were in collision with obstacle `v19` which is `AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This means any x-coordinate between -0.05 and 0.05 (exclusive) will cause a collision. So we need to choose x-coordinates outside this range, e.g., < -0.05 or > 0.05.
           
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`):**
           - To image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`), let's try `#o3` at `(0.2, 0.5)`. This avoids collision with `v19`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.2, 0.5)` is sqrt((1-0.2)^2 + (-1.75-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.7025) approx 2.38. This distance might be too large for one `move` action. Let's try two moves, or a closer config.
           Let's try a configuration for `#o3` at `(0.8, 0.0)`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.8, 0.0)` is sqrt((1-0.8)^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.1025) approx 1.76. This is reachable. Distance from `(0.8, 0.0)` to `v17` is sqrt((-0.549-0.8)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt((-1.349)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(1.82 + 3.411) = sqrt(5.231) approx 2.28. This is slightly over 2, so it might not be `imagevisible`.
           
           Let's rethink `imagevisible` targets.
           `v17` is at `(-0.549, 1.847)`
           `v18` is at `(0.543, 2.031)`
           
           Perhaps one rover can get both images. Or, maybe the rovers can move to configurations near the center of the objectives.
           `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Let's try to get `v12` to `(0.5, 1.0)` for imaging `v18`. Distance from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.5, 1.0)` is sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (-1.75-1)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.8125) approx 2.79. This is likely too far for a single motion primitive.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` can also be satisfied if `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are satisfied *by any rover*. So we could have one rover take both images.
           
           Let's try to have `v12` do all image taking and analysis sending:
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`):**
           - Move to `#o3` to image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`) and `v18` (at `(0.543, 2.031)`). Let's pick a `#o3` that is reachable from `v13` and can see both. A location around `(0.0, 1.5)` would be good, but it would collide with `v19`. Let's try `(0.1, 1.5)` for `#o3`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.1, 1.5)` is sqrt((1-0.1)^2 + (-1.75-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 10.5625) = sqrt(11.3725) approx 3.37. Still too far for a single motion.
           
           The `motion` predicates in the initial state are specific for each rover.
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`.
           This means `v12` can move directly from `v13` to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`.
           Same for `v14`. This simplifies reachability checks.
           
           Let's retry:
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           - We need a collision-free `#o3` for `v12` to image `v17` (`(-0.549, 1.847)`). Let's try `(1.0, 0.0)`. This should not collide with `v19`. Distance from `(1.0, 0.0)` to `v17` is sqrt((-0.549-1.0)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt((-1.549)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(2.4 + 3.41) = sqrt(5.81) approx 2.4. This is too far for `imagevisible`.
           Let's try for `v18` instead for `v12`. Target `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)`. `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `#o3` as `(0.5, 0.5)`. This is outside `v19`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.5, 0.5)` is sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (-1.75-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) approx 2.3. Still too far.
           
           Let's assume there exist reachable collision-free configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for both rovers, and focus on the overall plan logic first. The problem states "You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable...". The system is indicating that the configurations I'm proposing are invalid.
           
           Let's re-examine `v19`: `AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This means the region `-0.05 < x < 0.05` is blocked.
           So, any x-coordinate `X` such that `abs(X) < 0.05` will be in collision. I need to pick `X` such that `X <= -0.05` or `X >= 0.05`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           - Target `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`.
           - Target `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)`.
           - Target `v3` at `(0.487, -0.806)`.
           - Target `v7` at `(-1.983, -0.205)`.
           - Lander `v9` at `(-2.405, -2.346)`.
           
           Let's focus on `v12` doing `v17` and `v3`, and `v14` doing `v18` and `v7`. This distribution seems balanced.
           
           **For `v12`:**
           - **Image `v17`**: Current position `(1.0, -1.75)`. Target `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`.
               - Try `#o3` at `(0.1, 0.5)`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.1, 0.5)` is approx 2.38. (Still too far from initial position if motion only allows distance 2).
               - Let's try `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`. Dist from `v13` to `(1.0, 0.0)` is `1.75`. Dist from `(1.0, 0.0)` to `v17` is `2.4`. This is too far for `imagevisible` (max 2).
           
           The `imagerange` predicate states the maximum distance from rover to target for image capture is 2. The `comrange` predicate states the maximum distance for communication is 4.
           
           Let's consider the possible configurations more carefully.
           `v12` current `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v14` current `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **For `v12` and `v17` (image, `v17` is `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
           A point `P` must be such that `dist(P, v17) <= 2`.
           E.g., `( -0.5, 0.0)` is `dist(( -0.5, 0.0), v17) = sqrt(0^2 + 1.847^2) = 1.847 <= 2`.
           This `(-0.5, 0.0)` is outside `v19` range.
           Now, check if `(-0.5, 0.0)` is reachable from `v12`'s current `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `dist((1.0, -1.75), (-0.5, 0.0)) = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (1.75)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) approx 2.3`. This means a single `move` to this configuration might be too far as it implies distance `motion` property. The `motion` predicate arguments are just `(v, q1, t, q2)`. There is no explicit range mentioned. Let's assume the continuous values for `motion` are generated such that the distance is covered. However, the system error message suggests reachability from the base config might be distance constrained. Let's try configs closer to the robot's starting points.
           
           Let's choose configurations that are close to the initial rover positions *and* satisfy visibility/above constraints:
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           - Image `v18` (at `(0.543, 2.031)`).
               - `#o3`: try `(0.8, 0.5)`. Not in collision with `v19`.
                   - Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.8, 0.5)` is `sqrt((1-0.8)^2 + (-1.75-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.1025) approx 2.25`. This is still likely outside a single motion primitive range.
           
           It seems my understanding of "reachable" for the provided continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 is the main issue. The `motion` facts in the initial state are very explicit:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           This means that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *already specified* as reachable configurations from `v13` for `v12`. I just need to specify *values* for them such that they are collision-free and satisfy the `imagevisible`/`comvisible`/`above` conditions. The system is telling me the values I provide are causing collisions or making targets not visible.
           
           Let's assume the `motion` facts mean that *any* valid configuration I assign to `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *is* reachable from `v13` (or the previous configuration in the sequence). The problem then becomes purely finding collision-free and visible configurations.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the collision with `v19` (x in `(-0.05, 0.05)`).
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - Need a `#o3` configuration (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) within distance 2 of `v17`.
              - Try `#o3`: `(-0.5, 1.0)`. Distance to `v17` is `sqrt((-0.549 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.847 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.049)^2 + (0.847)^2) = sqrt(0.0024 + 0.7174) = sqrt(0.7198) approx 0.84`. This is well within 2. It is also not in collision with `v19`.
           2. **Above `v3` (at `(0.487, -0.806)`):**
              - Need a `#o5` configuration (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) directly above `v3`.
              - Try `#o5`: `(0.487, -0.806)`. This is the exact location of `v3`, so `above` should be true if the rover is at this x,y. This config is not in collision with `v19`.
           3. **Comms with `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`):**
              - Need a `#o0` configuration (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) within distance 4 of `v9`.
              - Try `#o0`: `(-1.0, -2.0)`. Distance to `v9` is `sqrt((-2.405 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.346 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.405)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(1.974 + 0.1197) = sqrt(2.0937) approx 1.45`. This is well within 4. It is not in collision with `v19`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v18` (at `(0.543, 2.031)`):**
              - Need a `#o3` configuration (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) within distance 2 of `v18`.
              - Try `#o3`: `(0.5, 1.0)`. Distance to `v18` is `sqrt((0.543 - 0.5)^2 + (2.031 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((0.043)^2 + (1.031)^2) = sqrt(0.0018 + 1.063) = sqrt(1.0648) approx 1.03`. This is well within 2. It is not in collision with `v19`.
           2. **Above `v7` (at `(-1.983, -0.205)`):**
              - Need a `#o5` configuration (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) directly above `v7`.
              - Try `#o5`: `(-1.983, -0.205)`. This is the exact location of `v7`, so `above` should be true. This config is not in collision with `v19`.
           3. **Comms with `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`):**
              - Need a `#o0` configuration (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) within distance 4 of `v9`.
              - Try `#o0`: `(-1.0, -2.0)`. Distance to `v9` is `sqrt((-2.405 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.346 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.405)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(1.974 + 0.1197) = sqrt(2.0937) approx 1.45`. This is well within 4. It is not in collision with `v19`.
           
           The problem is the `motion` predicates. If I use `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`, then the system knows `v13` and `#o3` are connected by motion. The question is if my *chosen values* for `#o3` are reachable by this motion.
           The prompt mentions: "reachable from the rover's current configuration". This suggests a distance constraint, possibly around 2 units for `move`.
           
           Let's try to ensure that consecutive configurations are within 2 units of each other, and all are outside the collision zone.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - `#o3`: `(0.6, 0.0)`. Dist from `v13` to `(0.6, 0.0)` is `sqrt((1-0.6)^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.2225) approx 1.79`. (Reachable).
              - Dist from `(0.6, 0.0)` to `v17` is `sqrt((-0.549-0.6)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt((-1.149)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(1.32 + 3.41) = sqrt(4.73) approx 2.17`. Still too far for `imagevisible`.
           
           This is becoming tricky. The geometry and range constraints are very tight.
           
           What if one rover does all the imaging and the other does all the sampling?
           Let `v12` do all imaging, and `v14` do all sampling and communication.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. Image `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`.
           2. Image `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)`.
              - Try to find a single `#o3` that can see both `v17` and `v18` within distance 2, and is reachable from `v13`.
              - `v17` is at `x=-0.549`, `v18` is at `x=0.543`. A point like `(0.0, 1.0)` would be central, but collides.
              - Let's try `(0.06, 1.0)` for `#o3`. Dist from `v13` to `(0.06, 1.0)` is `sqrt((1-0.06)^2 + (-1.75-1)^2) = sqrt(0.8836 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.4461) approx 2.9`. Too far.
           
           It seems I cannot reliably find suitable reachable configurations that avoid collision for imaging *both* targets with `v12`. I need to be *very* close to the target for `imagevisible`.
           
           Let's assume the `motion` predicates in the initial state mean any #config is reachable from v13.
           Then, let's focus on `imagevisible` and `comvisible` ranges.
           
           **For `v12` to image `v17`:**
           `v17` is `(-0.549, 1.847)`. Need `#o3` such that `dist(#o3, v17) <= 2`.
           Let `#o3` be `(-0.549, 0.5)`. This means the rover is `1.347` units away from `v17`. `x = -0.549` is not in collision with `v19`.
           **For `v12` to image `v18`:**
           `v18` is `(0.543, 2.031)`. Need `#o3` such that `dist(#o3, v18) <= 2`.
           Let `#o3` be `(0.543, 0.5)`. This means the rover is `1.531` units away from `v18`. `x = 0.543` is not in collision with `v19`.
           
           These require different configurations for `#o3`. The problem setup says `#o3` can be a single continuous parameter object. This means if I use `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17` and later for `v12` to see `v18`, I need to use motion to get `v12` to the different `imagevisible` positions.
           
           Let's try:
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. Move to `#o3_1` to image `v17`.
           2. Calibrate.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Move to `#o3_2` to image `v18`.
           5. Calibrate. (camera state is changed by `take_image`, so re-calibrate)
           6. Take image of `v18`.
           7. Move to `#o5` to sample `v3`.
           8. Sample `v3`.
           9. Move to `#o0` to send data.
           10. Send image of `v17`.
           11. Send image of `v18`.
           12. Send analysis of `v3`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. Move to `#o5_2` to sample `v7`.
           2. Sample `v7`.
           3. Move to `#o0_2` to send data.
           4. Send analysis of `v7`.
           
           The issue is that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are fixed objects. I cannot introduce `#o3_1` and `#o3_2`. So a single `#o3` has to work for `imagevisible` for both `v17` and `v18` for `v12` (or use `v14` for one of them). And it has to be collision-free and reachable from current.
           
           Let's choose `v12` for `v17` and `v14` for `v18`.
           Let `v12` also sample `v3`.
           Let `v14` sample `v7`.
           Both `v12` and `v14` will send from the same `#o0` (since it's a fixed continuous parameter object, its value is fixed for the problem).
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           - **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
               - `#o3`: `(-0.4, 0.0)`. `x=-0.4` is not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
                   - Dist to `v17`: `sqrt((-0.549 - (-0.4))^2 + (1.847 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.149)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(0.022 + 3.411) = sqrt(3.433) approx 1.85`. This is good for `imagevisible`.
                   - Dist from `v13` to `(-0.4, 0.0)`: `sqrt((1-(-0.4))^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(1.4^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 3.0625) = sqrt(5.0225) approx 2.24`. This might be considered "not reachable" if the max distance for `motion` is strictly 2.
               - Let's try to find an `#o3` for `v12` that is closer to `v13` *and* visible to `v17`.
               - How about a config for `v12` for `v17` at `(0.5, -0.5)`? Dist from `v13` to `(0.5, -0.5)` is `sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (-1.75-(-0.5))^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 1.5625) = sqrt(1.8125) approx 1.34`. This is good for reachability.
               - Dist from `(0.5, -0.5)` to `v17` is `sqrt((-0.549-0.5)^2 + (1.847-(-0.5))^2) = sqrt((-1.049)^2 + 2.347^2) = sqrt(1.1 + 5.5) = sqrt(6.6) approx 2.5`. This is too far for `imagevisible`.
           
           The system's error messages for "not reachable" strongly suggest a distance constraint on the motion primitives, possibly a strict 2 units. Given this, it seems difficult for `v12` starting at `(1.0, -1.75)` to reach `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)` and `v14` starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)` to reach `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)` with a single move.
           
           Perhaps the configurations for `imagevisible` (`#o3`) and `comvisible` (`#o0`) are not meant to be far from the initial positions.
           And `#o5` for `above` is also not too far.
           
           Let's carefully examine the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts again.
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           This means that *both* rovers, if at configuration `#o3`, can image *both* `v17` and `v18`. This is a strong hint that `#o3` is a central location. However, this central location `(0, y)` is blocked.
           
           The only way this is possible is if there are multiple configurations for `#o3` or the collision check is on the *base* of the robot. If the camera is on a joint and can extend, then the base can be further away. But the prompt does not specify this. It refers to `conf(rover, #q)`, implying the rover's base configuration.
           
           Let's assume the problem means *only* the specific listed configurations are valid and the `conf` statements like `conf(v12, #o5)` imply that `#o5` is a parameter for the specific location for `above` or `imagevisible`.
           
           Given the `motion` predicates, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are reachable from `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`). This implies that there are indeed valid continuous values for these configurations that are reachable. My task is to find those specific values that satisfy all constraints.
           
           Let's assume that the specific numerical values of the objects given in the problem description (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8, v9, v17, v18) are fixed, and only #o0, #o3, #o5 need values.
           
           Let's try to put the imaging configuration for `v12` (`#o3`) very close to `v17` but also reachable from `v13`.
           `v17` is `(-0.549, 1.847)`. `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           A point `(0.06, 0.0)` would be reachable from `v13` (`dist approx 1.79`). But `dist((0.06, 0.0), v17)` is `sqrt((-0.549-0.06)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt((-0.609)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(0.37 + 3.41) = sqrt(3.78) approx 1.94`. This is within 2. So `(0.06, 0.0)` for `#o3` might work for `v12` and `v17`.
           
           **For `v12`:**
           - `#o3`: `(0.06, 0.0)` (for `v17`). This is reachable from `v13` (distance 1.79) and within 2 of `v17` (distance 1.94). Not in collision with `v19`.
           - `#o5`: `(0.5, -0.8)`. For `v3` (`0.487, -0.806`). Dist from `(0.06, 0.0)` to `(0.5, -0.8)` is `sqrt((0.5-0.06)^2 + (-0.8-0)^2) = sqrt(0.44^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.1936 + 0.64) = sqrt(0.8336) approx 0.91`. This should be reachable. Not in collision with `v19`.
           - `#o0`: `(-0.2, -2.0)`. For `v9` (`-2.405, -2.346`). Dist from `(0.5, -0.8)` to `(-0.2, -2.0)` is `sqrt((-0.2-0.5)^2 + (-2.0-(-0.8))^2) = sqrt((-0.7)^2 + (-1.2)^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 1.44) = sqrt(1.93) approx 1.38`. This should be reachable. Dist from `(-0.2, -2.0)` to `v9` is `sqrt((-2.405-(-0.2))^2 + (-2.346-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-2.205)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(4.86 + 0.12) = sqrt(4.98) approx 2.23`. This is within 4. Not in collision with `v19`.
           
           **For `v14`:**
           - `#o3`: `(-0.06, 0.0)` (for `v18`). `v18` (`0.543, 2.031`).
               - Dist from `v15` (`-1.0, -1.75`) to `(-0.06, 0.0)` is `sqrt((-1-(-0.06))^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt((-0.94)^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.8836 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.9461) approx 1.98`. Reachable.
               - Dist from `(-0.06, 0.0)` to `v18` is `sqrt((0.543-(-0.06))^2 + (2.031-0)^2) = sqrt(0.603^2 + 2.031^2) = sqrt(0.3636 + 4.1249) = sqrt(4.4885) approx 2.11`. This is slightly over 2.
           
           This suggests that `#o3` must be specific to `v12` to `v17`, and a different `#o3` for `v14` to `v18`. But the problem provides a single `#o3` object. This implies that either `v12` and `v14` will share the same `#o3` values (which means it needs to be visible to both `v17` and `v18`), or `imagevisible` from `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` cannot all happen at `#o3`. However, the `imagevisible` facts are given with `#o3` for *all four* combinations. This means one value for `#o3` must work for all.
           
           The only way for one `#o3` to work for `v12` with `v17`, `v12` with `v18`, `v14` with `v17`, `v14` with `v18` is if `#o3` is very central. But central `(0,y)` is blocked by `v19`.
           This implies that perhaps the "base" of the robot is not what is in collision, but a point that is offset. However, the problem statement says `conf(rover, #q)`, which typically refers to the base.
           
           Given that `v19` is an obstacle around `x=0`, and both `v17` and `v18` are on opposite sides of `x=0` (one at `-0.549`, the other at `0.543`), a single `#o3` for `imagevisible` of both `v17` and `v18` by the same rover will be difficult, if the rover has to be within 2 units. A configuration at `(0.06, 1.0)` or `(-0.06, 1.0)` would be good for visibility, but too far from initial positions.
           
           Let's assume the problem intends for `#o3` to be a configuration that is actually feasible for *both* rovers to image. This means `v12` can use `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `v14` can use `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           So `#o3` must be within 2 units of `v17` AND within 2 units of `v18`.
           `v17` is `(-0.549, 1.847)`. `v18` is `(0.543, 2.031)`.
           Let's find the midpoint of `v17` and `v18`: `((-0.549+0.543)/2, (1.847+2.031)/2) = (-0.003, 1.939)`. This is clearly in collision with `v19`.
           
           This problem seems very constrained by the collision object `v19` and the `imagevisible` range.
           
           Let's try to place `#o3` on one side of `v19`, for example, `x > 0.05`.
           Let `#o3 = (0.06, 1.0)`.
           Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((-0.549-0.06)^2 + (1.847-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.609)^2 + 0.847^2) = sqrt(0.37 + 0.717) = sqrt(1.087) approx 1.04`. This is within 2.
           Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((0.543-0.06)^2 + (2.031-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.483^2 + 1.031^2) = sqrt(0.233 + 1.063) = sqrt(1.296) approx 1.14`. This is within 2.
           So, `#o3 = (0.06, 1.0)` works for imaging both `v17` and `v18`. This configuration is not in collision.
           Now, check reachability:
           For `v12`: `dist(v13, #o3) = dist((1.0, -1.75), (0.06, 1.0)) = sqrt((0.94)^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(0.8836 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.4461) approx 2.9`. This is too far for one `move`.
           
           This suggests that the interpretation of "reachable" must be strictly limited, and there is likely no single configuration for `#o3` that can satisfy the `imagevisible` predicate for both targets and rovers simultaneously while also being reachable. This would imply the goal is unreachable or the problem formulation is misleading.
           
           However, I must provide a plan. Let's reconsider what "reachable" might mean given the `motion` facts in the initial state. The problem implies that these `motion` facts *are* valid. If so, then `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *always* reachable from `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`), and also from each other using `#o2`. This implies that the reachability constraints on the coordinates I am trying to impose are implicitly handled by the `motion` predicate. Therefore, my configurations only need to be collision-free and satisfy range requirements for `imagevisible`/`comvisible`.
           
           Let's assume the `motion` facts guarantee reachability for *any* valid coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. This is the only way to make sense of the problem if strict distance constraints are failing the reachability.
           
           New attempt at configurations based purely on collision and range constraints:
           
           **For `#o3` (Image):**
           - Target `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`. Target `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)`.
           - We need `x` not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
           - Let's try to place `#o3` at `x=0.06`. Y needs to be around the middle of `v17` and `v18`'s Y-coordinates, `~1.9`.
           - `#o3 = (0.06, 1.9)`.
               - Dist from `#o3` to `v17`: `sqrt((-0.549-0.06)^2 + (1.847-1.9)^2) = sqrt((-0.609)^2 + (-0.053)^2) = sqrt(0.3708 + 0.0028) = sqrt(0.3736) approx 0.61`. (Within 2).
               - Dist from `#o3` to `v18`: `sqrt((0.543-0.06)^2 + (2.031-1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.483^2 + 0.131^2) = sqrt(0.2332 + 0.0171) = sqrt(0.2503) approx 0.5`. (Within 2).
               - This `#o3` is collision-free.
           
           **For `#o5` (Above):**
           - `v3` at `(0.487, -0.806)`. `v7` at `(-1.983, -0.205)`.
           - If `v12` samples `v3`, `#o5` for `v12` should be `(0.487, -0.806)`. This is collision-free.
           - If `v14` samples `v7`, `#o5` for `v14` should be `(-1.983, -0.205)`. This is collision-free.
           - But there is only *one* `#o5` object. This implies that one rover samples `v3` at `#o5`, and the other samples `v7` also at `#o5`. This is not possible unless `#o5` can be at two different locations simultaneously, which it cannot.
           - This means only one `above` location is defined for `#o5`. The specific `above` facts in the initial state are:
               `above(v12, #o5, v7)`
               `above(v12, #o5, v8)`
               `above(v12, #o5, v3)`
               `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
               `above(v12, #o5, v1)`
               `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
               And same for `v14`.
           This means *any* of `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` can be sampled if the rover is at `#o5`.
           So, I need to pick one rock of type `v2` (stone: `v1, v3, v4`) and one of type `v6` (soil: `v5, v7, v8`) and place `#o5` directly above one of them. The other rover will not use `#o5` for `above`. This is a simplification.
           
           Let's use `v12` to sample `v3` (type `v2`).
           Let `#o5 = (0.487, -0.806)`. This is collision-free.
           This means `v14` cannot use `#o5` for sampling `v7`. This contradicts my earlier plan.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 are *unique* to each rover, even if they share the same object name. The problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover`... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration...". And "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs... then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This clarifies that I can provide different values for the same `#o` object *if* it's tied to a different `(rover, target)` pair, even if the object name is the same. This means:
           `#o0` for `v12` (with `v9`) can be different from `#o0` for `v14` (with `v9`).
           `#o3` for `v12` (with `v17`) can be different from `#o3` for `v14` (with `v18`).
           `#o5` for `v12` (with `v3`) can be different from `#o5` for `v14` (with `v7`).
           
           This resolves the issue of having one `#o` object for multiple tasks.
           
           Let's re-state the plan and configurations with this interpretation.
           
           --Plan--:

Configuration #o0 = (-0.2 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v19: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (0.4 0.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-1.983 -0.205) for rover v14 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           The issue is consistently with reachability and collision with `v19` (AABB for `x` between `-0.05` and `0.05`). The system also indicates that my proposed configurations for `#o3` and `#o5` are "not reachable for robot base". This implies a distance constraint between consecutive configurations.
           
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           Let's assume the maximum distance a rover can move in one `move` action (which corresponds to `motion` primitive) is around 2 units. I must ensure my proposed configurations are within this distance from the previous configuration or the starting configuration.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - Need `#o3` (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`) within distance 2 of `v17`.
              - Also `#o3` must be reachable from `v13` (distance <= 2).
              - `v13` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's aim for an `#o3` around `(0.5, 0.0)`.
              - `dist(v13, (0.5, 0.0)) = sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (-1.75-0)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.3125) approx 1.82`. This is reachable.
              - Now, check `imagevisible` range for `v17` from `(0.5, 0.0)`.
              - `dist((0.5, 0.0), v17) = dist((0.5, 0.0), (-0.549, 1.847)) = sqrt((-0.549-0.5)^2 + (1.847-0)^2) = sqrt((-1.049)^2 + 1.847^2) = sqrt(1.1004 + 3.411) = sqrt(4.5114) approx 2.12`. This is slightly over the `imagevisible` range of 2.
           
           This means a single configuration for `v12` at `#o3` won't work for imaging `v17` while being reachable from `v13`.
           
           What if the plan is to move to a `comvisible` location first, which allows a larger range (4 units)? The problem does not constrain the order like this.
           
           Let's revisit the possibility of having both rovers image their respective targets using `#o3`.
           It is extremely challenging to find a single `#o3` that is within 2 units of both `v17` and `v18` (which are on opposite sides of `x=0` and far apart vertically), and also avoid `v19`, while being reachable from `v13` and `v15`.
           
           The most direct interpretation of "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs... then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" allows me to specify different coordinates for `#o3` for `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Let's use specific `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` values for each (rover, target) pair. This means I'll specify 6 distinct coordinates.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - `#o3_v12_v17`: `(0.06, 0.5)`. This avoids `v19`.
                - `dist(v13, (0.06, 0.5)) = sqrt((1-0.06)^2 + (-1.75-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.94^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(0.8836 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.9461) approx 2.44`. Still not reachable within 2.
           
           This suggests that `v12` cannot reach a position to image `v17` in a single motion step. Perhaps the `motion` predicate means that a sequence of moves can be used to reach these configurations. However, the plan only allows single `move` actions as given.
           
           Given the persistent "not reachable" errors even with coordinates within 2 units, it implies the `motion` parameters are more complex or imply existing paths rather than direct distance.
           If `motion(v, q1, t, q2)` is true, then `q2` *is* reachable from `q1` via `t`. My job is to set the values for `q2`. The problem states that `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` is an initial fact. This means `v13` to `#o3` is a valid motion. This implies the underlying `motion` computation handles reachability, *if* the given configurations are valid. My problem is finding such valid configurations.
           
           Let's be extremely close to the initial rover positions, or the objects being acted upon.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - This seems impossible with the constraints. `v12` is at `x=1.0`. `v17` is at `x=-0.549`. There's `v19` at `x=0`. To image `v17`, `v12` needs to cross `x=0` or get very close to `x=0`.
              - The closest x-coordinate to `v17` for `v12` on the positive side of `v19` would be `0.06`.
              - `dist((0.06, y), v17) <= 2`. If `y=0`, `dist((0.06, 0.0), v17) = 1.94`.
              - But `dist(v13, (0.06, 0.0)) = 1.79`. This should be reachable. Why did it fail last time? "not reachable for robot base". Perhaps the coordinate system means something else for `v13` and `v15` or the object `v12` itself has a larger footprint.
           
           Let's assume the provided base configs `v13` and `v15` are not just points but have an extent, and my chosen points are for the center. If there's an obstacle `v19` at `x=0` from `-0.05` to `0.05`, `v12` at `(0.06, 0.0)` is *not* in collision.
           
           Let's try again with the closest possible configurations that avoid collision for `v19` and satisfy distance for `imagevisible`/`comvisible`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (initial `v13` = `(1.0, -1.75)`):**
           1. **Image `v17`:** (`v17` is `(-0.549, 1.847)`).
              - `#o3_v12_v17`: `(0.06, 0.0)`.
                - `dist((0.06, 0.0), v17) = 1.94`. (Within 2).
                - `dist(v13, (0.06, 0.0)) = 1.79`. (Within 2, should be reachable).
           2. **Above `v3`:** (`v3` is `(0.487, -0.806)`).
              - `#o5_v12_v3`: `(0.487, -0.806)`. (Rover literally on top of rock).
                - `dist((0.06, 0.0), (0.487, -0.806)) = sqrt((0.487-0.06)^2 + (-0.806-0)^2) = sqrt(0.427^2 + (-0.806)^2) = sqrt(0.1823 + 0.6496) = sqrt(0.8319) approx 0.91`. (Reachable from previous config).
           3. **Comms `v9`:** (`v9` is `(-2.405, -2.346)`).
              - `#o0_v12_v9`: `(-0.06, -2.0)`.
                - `dist((0.487, -0.806), (-0.06, -2.0)) = sqrt((-0.06-0.487)^2 + (-2.0-(-0.806))^2) = sqrt((-0.547)^2 + (-1.194)^2) = sqrt(0.299 + 1.425) = sqrt(1.724) approx 1.31`. (Reachable from previous config).
                - `dist((-0.06, -2.0), v9) = sqrt((-2.405-(-0.06))^2 + (-2.346-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-2.345)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(5.499 + 0.1197) = sqrt(5.6187) approx 2.37`. (Within 4).
           
           **Rover `v14` (initial `v15` = `(-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           1. **Image `v18`:** (`v18` is `(0.543, 2.031)`).
              - `#o3_v14_v18`: `(-0.06, 0.0)`.
                - `dist((-0.06, 0.0), v18) = sqrt((0.543-(-0.06))^2 + (2.031-0)^2) = sqrt(0.603^2 + 2.031^2) = sqrt(0.3636 + 4.1249) = sqrt(4.4885) approx 2.11`. This is still slightly over 2.
           
           This distance calculation (`approx 2.11`) for `v14` imaging `v18` from `(-0.06, 0.0)` is consistently the problem. I need `#o3` for `v14` to be closer to `v18`.
           Let's try to place `#o3_v14_v18` at `(0.06, 1.0)`.
           - `dist((0.06, 1.0), v18) = sqrt((0.543-0.06)^2 + (2.031-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.483^2 + 1.031^2) = sqrt(0.233 + 1.063) = sqrt(1.296) approx 1.14`. (Within 2).
           - `dist(v15, (0.06, 1.0)) = dist((-1.0, -1.75), (0.06, 1.0)) = sqrt((1.06)^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(1.1236 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.6861) approx 2.94`. This is too far for reachability.
           
           It appears impossible to reach an imaging position for `v18` for `v14` (starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) within 2 units that is also within 2 units of `v18`.
           This might mean that the goal is not achievable with the given `motion` constraints, or my interpretation of `motion` and reachability is off.
           
           However, the question implies a solution must exist. Let me try a drastically different strategy. The goal `new-axiom@0()` doesn't specify *which* rover performs the actions, except for the `atconf` and `free` predicates. Both rovers must be in their initial `atconf` and `free` states.
           Let one rover (`v12`) do all the imaging and analysis sending. This will involve more `move` actions for `v12`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. Move to `#o3_v12_v17` to image `v17`.
              - `v17` at `(-0.549, 1.847)`.
              - Let `#o3_v12_v17 = (0.06, 0.0)`. `dist(v13, (0.06, 0.0)) = 1.79`. `dist((0.06, 0.0), v17) = 1.94`.
           2. Calibrate `v12` for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Move to `#o3_v12_v18` to image `v18`.
              - `v18` at `(0.543, 2.031)`.
              - `(0.06, 0.0)` is the current location. `dist((0.06, 0.0), v18) = 2.11`. Still too far.
           
           This is the central issue. If `v12` is imaging both `v17` and `v18`, and it needs to be within 2 units of each, and `v17` and `v18` are somewhat far apart, `v12` might need to move to two different `#o3` locations. But the problem definition of `#o3` implies a single parameter.
           
           I must use the provided action instances. `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10` and `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10` implies the same `#o3` is used. Similarly for `take_image`.
           This forces `#o3` to be a location where `v12` (or `v14`) can see *both* `v17` and `v18`.
           As calculated before, `#o3 = (0.06, 1.9)` would work for visibility of both `v17` and `v18` from `#o3`.
           Dist to `v17`: `0.61`. Dist to `v18`: `0.5`. Collision-free.
           Reachability:
           `dist(v13, (0.06, 1.9)) = sqrt((1-0.06)^2 + (-1.75-1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.94^2 + (-3.65)^2) = sqrt(0.8836 + 13.3225) = sqrt(14.2061) approx 3.76`. This is definitively not reachable in one `move`.
           
           This leads me to believe the problem is unsolvable as stated due to conflicting geometry constraints, or I am fundamentally misunderstanding "reachable". Since I must provide a plan, I will try to make the most reasonable assumptions possible, i.e., that `motion(v, q1, t, q2)` implies reachability even if the Euclidean distance is large, provided the configurations themselves are valid (collision-free, visibility conditions met). The error messages "not reachable for robot base" suggest Euclidean distance is checked.
           
           Final attempt strategy: Assume the `motion` facts indicate reachability, and that my chosen continuous parameters are valid, provided they are collision-free and satisfy range. I'll pick configurations for `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` that are collision-free and satisfy visibility/above ranges. I must assume the system generating errors on reachability is checking against an unstated distance metric for *my* choices of coordinates for the #objects, even though `motion` is pre-defined.
           
           Let's try to keep configurations very close to the objects themselves, on the "correct" side of `v19`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (at `v13` (1.0, -1.75))**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):** Let `#o3_v12_v17 = (-0.06, 1.0)`. (Collision-free, dist to `v17` = `1.04`).
           2. **Above `v3` (at `(0.487, -0.806)`):** Let `#o5_v12_v3 = (0.487, -0.806)`. (Collision-free).
           3. **Comms `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`):** Let `#o0_v12_v9 = (-0.06, -2.0)`. (Collision-free, dist to `v9` = `2.37`).
           
           **Rover `v14` (at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75))**
           1. **Image `v18` (at `(0.543, 2.031)`):** Let `#o3_v14_v18 = (0.06, 1.0)`. (Collision-free, dist to `v18` = `1.14`).
           2. **Above `v7` (at `(-1.983, -0.205)`):** Let `#o5_v14_v7 = (-1.983, -0.205)`. (Collision-free).
           3. **Comms `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)`):** Let `#o0_v14_v9 = (-0.06, -2.0)`. (Collision-free, dist to `v9` = `2.37`).
           
           This approach respects the unique (rover, target) pair for each `#o` object.
           The issue of "not reachable for robot base" remains perplexing given the provided `motion` predicates. I will provide the plan with these values, as they are the most geometrically sound based on collision and range. If it fails due to reachability again, I would conclude the problem is unsolveable under the given constraints.

           Configuration #o5 = (-1.983 -0.205) for rover v14 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           The persistent errors indicate that the previous attempts to place configurations just outside `v19`'s x-range (e.g., `x=0.06` or `x=-0.06`) are still causing collision. This implies that the rover's body might have a larger extent than a single point, or that the `v19` AABB defines the blocked region more inclusively. The AABB `lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)` clearly defines an x-range of `(-0.05, 0.05)`. My choices like `0.06` should not be in collision. This leads me to believe the collision detection is using a different logic or that the rover itself has a certain width, so its center at `0.06` might still collide. Given this, I must choose x-coordinates further away from 0.
           
           Also, the "not reachable for robot base" is a consistent issue for `#o5` and sometimes `#o3` despite distance calculations being within a reasonable range (e.g., ~2 units). This might imply a stricter limit or that the path generation is complex.
           
           Let's assume the problem's implicit constraints are stricter than simple Euclidean distance for reachability, and that collision detection requires a larger buffer from `v19`. I will try to place the configurations further away from `x=0`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - Let `#o3_v12_v17 = (0.5, 0.0)`. This is clearly outside `v19`'s x-range.
                - `dist((0.5, 0.0), v17) = 2.12`. Still slightly over 2. This suggests `v12` cannot image `v17`.
           
           This is a critical deadlock. If `v12` cannot image `v17` due to distance constraints from a non-colliding reachable spot, and `v14` cannot image `v18` from a similar situation, then `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` might be unachievable.
           
           Let me try to be extremely close to the targets (within 2 units) while still avoiding the collision zone.
           `v17` is at `(-0.549, 1.847)`.
           `v18` is at `(0.543, 2.031)`.
           `v13` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v15` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           For `v12` and `v17`: A point like `(X, Y)` where `sqrt((X - (-0.549))^2 + (Y - 1.847)^2) <= 2`.
           To avoid `v19`, `X` must be `X >= 0.05` or `X <= -0.05`.
           Let's try `X = -0.06`. Then `sqrt((-0.06 - (-0.549))^2 + (Y - 1.847)^2) <= 2`.
           `sqrt(0.489^2 + (Y-1.847)^2) <= 2`. `0.239 + (Y-1.847)^2 <= 4`. `(Y-1.847)^2 <= 3.761`. `Y-1.847 <= 1.939`. `Y <= 3.786`.
           So, `Y` can be `1.0`. `(-0.06, 1.0)` was previously tried and caused collision error.
           The `x` must be *strictly* outside the AABB. Let's try `x=-0.1`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. **Image `v17` (at `(-0.549, 1.847)`):**
              - Let `#o3_v12_v17 = (-0.1, 1.0)`. (x not in `(-0.05, 0.05)`).
                - `dist((-0.1, 1.0), v17) = sqrt((-0.549 - (-0.1))^2 + (1.847 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.449)^2 + 0.847^2) = sqrt(0.2016 + 0.7174) = sqrt(0.919) approx 0.95`. (Within 2).
                - `dist(v13, (-0.1, 1.0)) = sqrt((1.0 - (-0.1))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.7725) approx 2.96`. (Still not reachable, if range is ~2).
           
           This indicates that my interpretation of reachable from `v13` (or `v15`) as within ~2 units Euclidean distance is what is causing the consistent "not reachable" errors. The problem text clearly states `motion(?v: object, ?q1: object, ?t: object, ?q2: object)` which is pre-defined for `v13` to `#o0, #o3, #o5`. This must mean these are reachable. The only other explanation for the error message "not reachable for robot base" is that the geometric configuration I'm trying to assign to `#o0, #o3, #o5` has no valid path, *even if the endpoints are theoretically connected by a `motion` primitive*.
           
           I will try to keep configurations for sampling as close to the target object as possible (exact coordinates if possible) to make the "above" predicate true. For image/comms, they need to be far enough to satisfy the range. For collision, they need to be outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
           
           Let's assume the `motion` predicates imply that any valid configuration for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for the respective rover *is* reachable, and the errors are coming from collision or image/comms range check (or specific, hidden `motion` range check on my chosen coordinates).

              - `#o3_v14_v18`: `(0.1, 0.5)`. This avoids `v19`.
                - `dist((0.1, 0.5), v18) = sqrt((0.543 - 0.1)^2 + (2.031 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.443^2 + 1.531^2) = sqrt(0.1962 + 2.3438) = sqrt(2.54) approx 1.59`. (Within 2).

           I have chosen configuration coordinates that are distinctly outside the `(-0.05, 0.05)` range for `x` to avoid `v19`, and verified that they satisfy the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` range conditions. The "not reachable for robot base" message is the most difficult one to resolve because the `motion` facts indicate reachability, so the problem might be in the (unspecified) path generation or strict Euclidean distance limits. However, I have followed the instructions to provide a plan.

           Configuration #o5 = (-1.983 -0.205) for rover v14 at target v7 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means both objectives v17 and v18 need to be imaged by a rover and the images sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v1` is a rock of type `v2`, `v3` is a rock of type `v2`, and `v4` is a rock of type `v2`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. From the initial state, `v5` is a rock of type `v6`, `v7` is a rock of type `v6`, and `v8` is a rock of type `v6`. We need to analyze and send analysis for one of these.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `imagevisible` to the objective is true.
           - Calibrate its camera.
           - Take an image.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the image.
           There are `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           There are `comvisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` to `v9` (lander) at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6), a rover needs to:
           - Move to a configuration where `above` a target rock is true.
           - Sample the rock.
           - Move to a configuration where `comvisible` to the lander is true.
           - Send the analysis.
           Rover `v12` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v14` is `above` `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick specific rocks to analyze. For type `v2` (stone), let's choose `v3`. For type `v6` (soil), let's choose `v7`.
           
           The primary issue continues to be collision with `v19` (AABB `lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)`) for x-coordinates between -0.05 and 0.05, *and* "not reachable for robot base" for positions far from the initial ones. The latest failures indicate that even `x=-0.1` and `x=0.1` are colliding. This is very restrictive, implying a larger footprint for the rover or a more inclusive collision detection for `v19`. I will now try values for `x` that are significantly further from `0`.

                - `dist(v15, (0.5, 0.5)) = sqrt((-1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 5.0625) = sqrt(7.3125) approx 2.7`. (Still likely not reachable).

                - `dist((-0.5, -2.0), v9) = sqrt((-2.405 - (-0.5))^2 + (-2.346 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.905)^2 + (-0.346)^2) = sqrt(3.629 + 0.1197) = sqrt(3.7487) approx 1.93`. (Within 4).
           
           The "not reachable" problem for `#o3` and `#o5` for both rovers is the most persistent problem. The given `motion` predicates in the initial state are the only information I have about reachability between configurations. If those `motion` facts mean that `v13` can move to `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` (and `v15` similarly), then these configurations *are* reachable. The only other interpretation is that my selected coordinates (even if collision-free and within range) are not among the set of coordinates that the `motion` primitive *actually* allows. Since I cannot know the exact range of coordinates that are reachable for the given `motion` facts, and the problem explicitly states to propose values for '#', I am forced to assume that the `motion` predicates imply reachability. The error messages, therefore, are problematic.
           
           Given I *must* provide a plan, I will persist with the geometrically sound choices that avoid `v19` and satisfy range. If the system continues to reject them as "not reachable", it is because of an unstated, stricter reachability constraint that cannot be inferred from the provided PDDL domain and initial state.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     It appears I am in a loop where every set of coordinates I provide, no matter how carefully chosen to satisfy collision and visibility/range constraints, is deemed "not reachable for robot base" by the system. The problem statement says I must provide a plan if the goal is achievable. Given the consistent "not reachable" errors for multiple iterations, and the fact that `motion` predicates are provided as initial facts (which normally imply reachability), it is highly probable that the implicit reachability constraints (e.g., maximum Euclidean distance for a single primitive move, or path planning through complex geometry) are much stricter than can be inferred or satisfied with trial-and-error by just providing x,y coordinates.
           
           Since I am unable to find coordinates that the system considers "reachable" while also satisfying the visibility/sampling requirements and avoiding collisions, I conclude that, with the current information and constraints, the goal is not achievable. This is because every attempt to define the continuous parameters (#o0, #o3, #o5) results in a "not reachable" error, which means the necessary preconditions for actions like `move`, `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis` cannot be satisfied.
           
           Without a better understanding of the implicit reachability model (e.g., maximum step distance, or full collision geometry of the rover itself, or available path segments for `#o2`), it is impossible to find valid coordinates.
           
           Therefore, I cannot provide a plan.
