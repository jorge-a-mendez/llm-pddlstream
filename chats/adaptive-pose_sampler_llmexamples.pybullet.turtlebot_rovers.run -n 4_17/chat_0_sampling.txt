           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is primarily defined by a large square bounding box from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), with thinner boxes for the edges, suggesting a walled-off area. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. Other obstacles are smaller AABBs scattered around, some appearing as small "tables" or "posts." I should avoid placing the robot within these fixed obstacles. The robot can be placed anywhere within the overall boundaries, provided it's not in an obstacle and has line-of-sight to the target. The maximum range of 2 from the target means I need to search within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target point. I will try to find positions that are within this range and are likely to be in open spaces, avoiding the walls and known obstacles. I will prioritize diversity in the positions to maximize the chances of finding a valid spot.

Model:     My previous attempts for target point (0.1082163459030006 1.4883461299945038) failed due to collisions with the central vertical wall (0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))) and obstacle 16: ((0.9112566540570115, 1.278153462204442), (1.0525312592654372, 1.4194280674128676)). One position was also marked as "not reachable", which implies it might have been outside the overall bounding box or a similar constraint, though the coordinates seem to be within the [-2.5, 2.5] range. This tells me that simply moving along cardinal directions might not be enough. I need to be more mindful of the scattered obstacles and the central divider. The new target point is (-1.8605384826660156, 1.8415400981903076). This target is in the upper-left quadrant, far from the central divider. I will try positions that are also in the upper-left quadrant and avoid known obstacles in that region.

Model:     The previous feedback was for a different target point (0.1082163459030006 1.4883461299945038), not the current one (-1.8605384826660156 1.8415400981903076).

Model:     The previous feedback indicates that for target point (0.3761279881000519, 1.9477651119232178), all my proposed positions were invalid. This means the central divider (obstacle 0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))) is definitely in play, as are other smaller obstacles. The target point (0.3761279881000519 1.9477651119232178) is in the upper right quadrant. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of this target, avoiding the central divider and any other known obstacles, and ensuring line-of-sight. The positions from the previous round for this target were (-1.8605384826660156, 0.8415400981903076), (-1.0605384826660156, 1.8415400981903076), and (-2.2605384826660155, 1.0415400981903076). All these positions are on the *left* side of the central divider (x < 0), while the target is on the *right* side (x > 0). This is why they failed due to "no line of sight" or "not reachable". I made a mistake in re-using positions from the previous *request* which had a different target point, instead of generating fresh ones for the *current* target.
           
           For this target point (0.3761279881000519 1.9477651119232178), I need to choose positions with x > 0 to have a chance of line of sight.

Model:     The previous attempts for target point (0.3761279881000519, 1.9477651119232178) all failed.
           (0.3761279881000519, 0.9477651119232178) was rejected for "no line of sight to target due to occlusion" by target (1.932246446609497, 2.0508086681365967). This suggests an obstacle somewhere between these points.
           (1.3761279881000519, 1.9477651119232178) was rejected for "no line of sight to target" for target (1.932246446609497, 2.0508086681365967). This might be due to obstacle 16 or 22 nearby.
           (0.3761279881000519, 2.4477651119232178) collided with the top wall (obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55))).
           
           The new target point is (1.932246446609497, 2.0508086681365967). This is in the top-right corner of the map. I need to be very careful to avoid the top wall (y=2.5), the right wall (x=2.5), and nearby obstacles like 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and 22 ((1.8887, 2.0073), (1.9757, 2.0942)). The previous feedback was for this target, which is good. My previous proposed positions for *this* target point were (0.3761279881000519, 0.9477651119232178), (1.3761279881000519, 1.9477651119232178) and (0.3761279881000519, 2.4477651119232178).
           
           Given the target is very close to the corner (1.93, 2.05), I'll try to place the robot further away from the walls and other small obstacles. I will try to stay within the range and ensure line-of-sight. The target itself is inside obstacle 7.
