           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but it's looking grim.  First, the conditions I need to satisfy are laid out: getting images (`receivedimage`), analyzing rocks (`receivedanalysis`), and ensuring the rover's in the right configuration (`atconf` and `free`).  I quickly realize that the initial state already takes care of a few of these, leaving me with the imaging and analysis goals as the crux of the problem.
           
           My initial thought was to identify the stones and soil needing analysis – easy enough, I picked `v3` for stone and `v7` for soil.  Now, to the actions.  I need `send_image` and `send_analysis`, which *should* be straightforward given the appropriate preconditions: being able to *take* those images and the objects being rock/soil, respectively.
           
           Here's the rub: *blocked* rays. I noticed the `blocked(?y)` axiom pretty early, and the initial state information tells me that rays `#o1` and `#o4` are blocked. The axiom defines "blocked" using a conjunction that includes `conf(?v, ?q)` and `atconf(?v, ?q)`. The way I read this is if there is some rover `v` and config `q` where both of these are true, AND `ray(y)` is true, then `blocked(y)` is true. The `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` isn't relevant because it's *false* in the initial state, so its negation is true, which just adds to the conclusion that a blocked state exists.
           
           Unfortunately, due to the structure of the *blocked* ray axiom, because the facts `conf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v12, v13)` exist, the rays are blocked in the intial state. This means I can't even start, as my actions are all dependent on being able to "see" and "communicate". No, this is an immediate failure and I can't generate a plan.
