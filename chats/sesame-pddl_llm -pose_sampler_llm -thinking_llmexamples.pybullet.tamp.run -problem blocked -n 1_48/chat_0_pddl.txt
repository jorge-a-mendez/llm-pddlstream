           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placing the Object: A Detailed Approach**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this placement problem. My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a small square object (ID 5, 0.07m x 0.07m) on a single rectangular surface. A stable placement means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains entirely within the surface when the object is rotated.
           
           Firstly, the surface is defined by its coordinates `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  This gives us a surface width of 0.6m and height of 0.6m. Since the object is a perfect square, its AABB's dimensions will change depending on the rotation.
           
           Let's break down the placement format which is defined as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The first element is the index of the surface, theta is the rotation of the object, x, and y are the center of the object. My approach needs to ensure that the object's AABB fits inside the surface's AABB for all 50 placements.
           
           Now I need to account for the object's rotations. When it rotates by an angle of `theta`, the AABB's dimensions also change. Let's denote the half-extents of the object's AABB as `hx` and `hy`. So, after rotations, the rotated half-extents, or `rotated_hx` and `rotated_hy` will be calculated using this formula which is correct in my field:
           
           `rotated_hx = hx * abs(cos(theta)) + hy * abs(sin(theta))`
           `rotated_hy = hx * abs(sin(theta)) + hy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Because the object is a square, things simplify. Since `size_x = size_y = 0.07`, then `hx=hy=0.035`. I can simplify the formula even further. The most important thing here is to recognize that because of the square shape, the max dimension will be when the rotation is 45 degrees, or `pi/4` (0.049). This is easy to calculate because I can just multiply the half the side length of the square and the square root of 2.
           
           *   **Rotation Analysis:** Since the object is square, it's pretty easy to know that the greatest increase of the AABB will come from a 45-degree angle.
           
           Considering all possible rotations, I'll need to use `pi/4` and 0 for my thetas. Also, since I know my AABB's width to be less than half of the surface's dimensions, I can easily ensure that all 50 placements fit. I can even space it out on a grid.
           *   **The Object Dimension:** The object dimensions are 0.07 x 0.07, and since it is square the dimensions of the rotated AABB is 0.07. To find the rotated max half-extents of the object, at a `pi/4` rotation I can multiply by `0.035 * sqrt(2)`. This calculation becomes `0.049` for the half-extents.
           
           *   **Placement Strategy:** I'll focus the x and y coordinates on the `(0, 0)` range for the theta. Because the object can take any rotation, I will use `pi/4` and `0` to build out the placements. Since my AABB's width is much smaller, I can pick a distribution of `x` and `y` points. I will use a simple grid to select points. I will use the dimensions of the original surface to pick the `x` and `y` center coordinates. I can space out the objects within the 0.6 surface. The valid range for `x` will be `4.235` to `4.765`, and the `y` coordinate will be from `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           *   **Generation:** I'm going to create a grid of `x` and `y` coordinates. Then I'll combine these with different `theta` values. Specifically, 25 points at `theta=0`, and 25 at `pi/4`.
           
           To summarize the calculation:
           25 placements: `theta = 0`, `x` from `4.27, 4.37, 4.47, 4.57, 4.67` and `y` from `-0.53, -0.43, -0.33
