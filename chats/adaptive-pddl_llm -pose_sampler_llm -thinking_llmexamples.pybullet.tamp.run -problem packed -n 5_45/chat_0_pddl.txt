(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for a given object on a specified surface. I'll represent each placement as a tuple: (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate). Since there is only one surface, its index will always be 0.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** I've identified the object's dimensions (`obj_sx`, `obj_sy`) and the surface's boundaries. I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface for all placements. The rotation is represented by `theta`, and the object's center is at `(x, y)`.
           
           2.  **Calculate Valid Center Ranges:**  I need to determine the ranges of x and y for which the object will be fully within the surface after rotating it by angle `theta`. Given the object's dimensions and the surface's size, I can calculate the minimum and maximum x and y center coordinates as a function of `theta`. I approximate the maximum rotated extent by either using the more precise rotated extents, or using half the average of the sides and multiplying it by sqrt(2) at the 45-degree angle.
           
           3.  **Generate Placements:**  I'll generate placements by combining different rotation angles and `(x, y)` positions. I plan to pick 6 different `theta` values, ranging from 0 to pi. For each `theta`, I will create a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the valid range calculated in step 2. I'll use a 3x3 grid for each `theta`, which, if done fully, will generate 54 placements, and I'll take the first 50.
           
           4.  **No Collisions:** No previously placed objects are mentioned, so I will not handle collision avoidance between the placement of this object and other objects.
           
           5.  **Placement Validation:** During the generation of the x and y coordinate, I check that the calculated ranges are valid.
           
           This strategy ensures that the object is always contained within the surface, and by varying both the rotation angle and the object's center position, I'll achieve a diverse and stable set of placements. I verified these ranges manually.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that a previous object, ID 5, was successfully placed at a particular location. Now, my task is to find 50 stable placements for a new object, ID 6, on the same surface.  The key constraint here is to *avoid collisions* between object 6 and the already placed object 5.
           
           I've got the necessary dimensions and surface details: object 6 is a nearly square, and I know the exact location and size of object 5, along with the surface boundaries.  Since object 5 is placed at `(-0.086, -0.086)`, which, for the surface size of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, means object 5 is snugly placed in the bottom left.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate placements and then filter them based on a collision check. I’m thinking, given the known position of object 5, placing object 6 in the top-right quadrant or along the top/right edges would be a good starting point to guarantee no overlap.
           
           I will be using 6 different rotations and applying a 5x5 grid strategy. So I calculate the rotated half-extents for object 6 for each angle (theta) – it's going to be basically the same regardless of the angle due to the nearly-square shape.  For each placement I generate, I can check against the known occupied space of object 5 - an AABB check.
           
           Based on the collision condition (`xc - hx_rot >= obj5_max_x OR yc - hy_rot >= obj5_max_y`), I have confirmed that for the 5x5 grid and the 6 rotations (thetas) and for the rotation, `3 * 2 + 2 * 5 = 16`, valid for a `theta` rotation, which should give me the 50 desired placements, and potentially far more in reality!
