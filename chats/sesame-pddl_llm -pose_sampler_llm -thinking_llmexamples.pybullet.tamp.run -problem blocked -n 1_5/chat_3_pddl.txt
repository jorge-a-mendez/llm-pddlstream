           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, the task is to develop a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` within the `pr2-tamp` domain. This goal, as I see it, boils down to establishing two specific facts: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The objects `v8` and `v12` both fit this `type` criteria initially. I need a sequence of valid actions to manipulate either `v8` or `v12` so that they end up *on* the support `v18`. Initially, `v8` is on `v11`, and `v12` is on `v14`. My instinct says I'll need a "pick" and "place" strategy to move one of them.
           
           **Action Precondition Analysis and Proposed Plan**
           
           I need to pick either `v8` or `v12` from where it is and place it on `v18`. So my preliminary plan is to use existing actions. `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` are available. I'll need to move the robot base from `v3` to `o3`, pick `v8` with `v4`, and place it at `#o2`. I'll start with the robot's base configuration, move it to a specific configuration, and then pick and place the object from point A to point B.
           
           Let's test each of these steps and their preconditions to make sure they are valid. Before I move to place, I will pick from a current pose and place at the target pose, `#o2`.
           
           **Encountering the First Stumbling Block: The `pick` Action and the Axiom**
           
           Here's where things get interesting and where a past issue resurfaces. The `pick` action has a precondition, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. Now, there's another axiom here,  `new-axiom@0(?o: object) ...` where the argument `?o` is used in our code. Reading this means the pick action relies on there *not* being a situation where an object is picked up at all. In other words, to be able to pick an item `o`, all the other items in the environment *cannot* be graspable.
           
           This is a very restrictive condition!
           
           **Rethinking and Conclusion**
           
           Given the current state, and the presence of `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` as graspable objects, this precondition makes any attempt to use the `pick` action impossible! No matter which object I try to pick, there will always be *another* graspable object present that prevents the precondition from being met. Consequently, this prevents me from reaching my goal. Since I cannot perform `pick` actions, I am blocked from changing the objects' `on` state to satisfy the goal predicate `new-axiom@0()`. Unfortunately, the goal is unachievable given this situation.
