           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Placement Request**
           
           My primary objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, on surface 0, defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains entirely within the surface's AABB. I need to provide each placement as (surf_idx, theta, x, y).
           
           Since the object is square, the rotation angle `theta` doesn't affect its AABB dimensions; hence, I'll set it to 0 for simplicity. This also ensures I consider only translations.
           
           First, I calculate the valid range for the object's center (x, y).  Given the object's size and surface dimensions, x must fall between 4.235 and 4.765, and y must be between -0.565 and -0.035.
           
           Next, I decide to create a grid-based approach. Because I need 50 placements, I'll use 7 steps in x and 8 steps in y. This yields 56 positions, more than enough.
           
           I determine the increment for x (dx) as (4.765 - 4.235) / 6 = 0.08833333333333333 and the increment for y (dy) as (0.53) / 7 = 0.07571428571428571.
           
           Finally, I generate the 50 placements by iterating through this grid. The placements have `surf_idx = 0` and `theta = 0.0`. Each placement will start with `x` from 4.235 increasing by dx, and `y` starting at -0.565 increasing by dy as I iterate.
