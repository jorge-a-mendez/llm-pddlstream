           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal in Rovers Domain**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. However, after careful analysis, I've determined that this goal is currently *unachievable* given the provided initial state and the restricted set of actions I'm allowed to use.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires several key conditions: receiving images from three objectives, analyzing a stone, and analyzing soil. To accomplish the image reception, the `send_image` action is mandatory. To achieve the analysis, the `send_analysis` action is required. Critically, the prompt states I'm only allowed to use the *specific* instances of actions listed, *and neither `send_image` nor `send_analysis` are among them*.
           
           The available actions are two no-op "move" actions (which keep rovers in their initial configurations) and two "drop_rock" actions.  The `drop_rock` actions have a precondition that the rover's store must be *full*, but the store is *empty* initially, rendering the `drop_rock` impossible at the very start. The `move` operations, being essentially no-ops, clearly cannot contribute to the image or analysis goals.
           
           In summary, the necessary `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions are simply not permitted in the permissible action set. Consequently, the core task of receiving images and analyses, central to the `new-axiom@0()` goal, is unachievable from the provided initial state. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a valid plan to reach the given target state.
