           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.0714. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           I will try to place the object in various positions and orientations on the surface. Since the object is square, rotations by multiples of pi/2 will result in the same effective bounding box on the surface. However, to maximize diversity, I will include rotations by other angles as well. I will aim for a grid-like distribution of positions, and vary the rotation for each.
           
           The surface ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a side length of 0.071396.
           If placed upright (theta=0), its half-extents are 0.03569808.
           Thus, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.03569808 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.03569808
           -0.09930192 <= x <= 0.09930192
           Same for y.
           
           For rotated objects, the maximum dimension will be sqrt(2) * (side/2) if rotated by pi/4.
           sqrt(2) * 0.03569808 = 0.050499.
           So, -0.135 + 0.050499 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.050499
           -0.084501 <= x <= 0.084501
           Same for y.
           
           I will prioritize placements near the center and then expand outwards.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           A new object (ID: 5) is requested, which is also square, with side length approximately 0.0958.
           This object is larger than the previous one (ID: 4, size ~0.0714).
           
           I need to place object 5, avoiding object 4 if it's considered fixed at its last successful position: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). However, the prompt states "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." It's not explicitly stated that object 4 is *fixed* in the scene, only that it had a successful placement. For now, I will assume it's a fixed obstacle.
           
           Object 4 has a bounding box from -0.0357 to 0.0357 in x and y (since its size_x = size_y = 0.07139616470819321 and it's placed at (0,0) with theta=0).
           
           Object 5 has size_x = size_y = 0.09582647270325917.
           If placed upright (theta=0), its half-extents are 0.047913236.
           Thus, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.047913236 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.047913236
           -0.087086764 <= x <= 0.087086764
           Same for y.
           
           For rotated objects (e.g., pi/4), the maximum dimension will be sqrt(2) * (side/2) if rotated by pi/4.
           sqrt(2) * 0.047913236 = 0.06778.
           So, -0.135 + 0.06778 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.06778
           -0.06722 <= x <= 0.06722
           Same for y.
           
           Since object 4 is at (0,0) with a side of ~0.0714, it occupies the central region. Object 5, with half-extent ~0.0479, will collide with object 4 if its center is near (0,0). For instance, if object 5 is at (0,0), its bounding box is [-0.0479, 0.0479] x [-0.0479, 0.0479]. This overlaps with object 4's bounding box [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357].
           
           To avoid collision with object 4 (placed at (0,0), half_extent=0.0357):
           The center of object 5 must be at least 0.0357 + 0.0479 = 0.0836 away from (0,0) in x or y directions if both are axis-aligned.
           So if I place object 5 along the x-axis, its center x should be >= 0.0836 or <= -0.0836.
           The maximum allowed x is 0.087086764. This leaves a very small range for axis-aligned placements outside of object 4.
           
           I will try to place object 5 around the edges of object 4's occupied space, trying to fit it within the available surface area. I will also try different rotations. Given the tight fit, the options are limited.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           A new object (ID: 6) is requested, which is also square, with side length approximately 0.0730.
           
           I need to place object 6, avoiding collision with previously successfully placed objects:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Side length ~0.0714. Half-extent ~0.0357. Bounding box: [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0). Side length ~0.0958. Half-extent ~0.0479. Bounding box: [0.085 - 0.0479, 0.085 + 0.0479] x [-0.0479, 0.0479] which is [0.0371, 0.1329] x [-0.0479, 0.0479].
           
           Object 6 has size_x = size_y = 0.073011689.
           If placed upright (theta=0), its half-extents are 0.0365058445.
           Thus, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0365058445 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0365058445
           -0.0984941555 <= x <= 0.0984941555
           Same for y.
           
           For rotated objects (e.g., pi/4), the maximum dimension will be sqrt(2) * (side/2).
           sqrt(2) * 0.0365058445 = 0.05162.
           So, -0.135 + 0.05162 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.05162
           -0.08338 <= x <= 0.08338
           Same for y.
           
           Collision check with Object 4:
           Object 4's bounding box: [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357].
           Object 6's half-extent: 0.0365.
           To avoid collision with Object 4 (axis-aligned), Object 6's center (x,y) must have |x| >= 0.0357 + 0.0365 = 0.0722 or |y| >= 0.0722.
           
           Collision check with Object 5:
           Object 5's bounding box: [0.0371, 0.1329] x [-0.0479, 0.0479].
           Object 6's half-extent: 0.0365.
           To avoid collision with Object 5 (axis-aligned), Object 6's center (x,y) must satisfy:
           x_object6_max < x_object5_min OR x_object6_min > x_object5_max OR
           y_object6_max < y_object5_min OR y_object6_min > y_object5_max
           
           This means, for instance, for x-separation:
           x_object6_center + 0.0365 < 0.0371 => x_object6_center < 0.0006
           OR
           x_object6_center - 0.0365 > 0.1329 => x_object6_center > 0.1694
           
           And for y-separation:
           y_object6_center + 0.0365 < -0.0479 => y_object6_center < -0.0844
           OR
           y_object6_center - 0.0365 > 0.0479 => y_object6_center > 0.0844
           
           So, viable regions for Object 6 (axis-aligned):
           - x between -0.0985 and 0.0985, y between -0.0985 and 0.0985.
           - Avoid x in [-0.0722, 0.0722] AND y in [-0.0722, 0.0722] (collision with Obj 4).
           - Avoid x in [0.0006, 0.1694] AND y in [-0.0844, 0.0844] (collision with Obj 5's x-range).
           - Avoid x in [-0.0985, 0.0985] AND y in [-0.0844, 0.0844] (collision with Obj 5's y-range).
           
           This is getting complex, so I'll simplify my approach for initial placements:
           Object 4 is at (0,0), Object 5 is at (0.085, 0.0). Both are centered along the y=0 axis.
           Their combined footprint roughly covers:
           x: [-0.0357, 0.0357] U [0.0371, 0.1329]
           y: [-0.0479, 0.0479] (for object 5) and [-0.0357, 0.0357] (for object 4)
           So essentially, the entire strip of y from -0.0479 to 0.0479 in x from -0.0357 to 0.1329 is problematic.
           
           I should focus on placing Object 6 in the negative x-region, or in the positive/negative y-regions further away from the current objects.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           A new object (ID: 7) is requested, which is also square, with side length approximately 0.0894.
           
           I need to place object 7, avoiding collision with previously successfully placed objects:
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Side length ~0.0714. Half-extent ~0.0357. Bounding box: [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357].
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0). Side length ~0.0958. Half-extent ~0.0479. Bounding box: [0.085 - 0.0479, 0.085 + 0.0479] x [-0.0479, 0.0479] which is [0.0371, 0.1329] x [-0.0479, 0.0479].
           - Object 6 (ID: 6) at (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0). Side length ~0.0730. Half-extent ~0.0365. Bounding box: [-0.09 - 0.0365, -0.09 + 0.0365] x [-0.0365, 0.0365] which is [-0.1265, -0.0535] x [-0.0365, 0.0365].
           
           Object 7 has size_x = size_y = 0.08944589679263953.
           If placed upright (theta=0), its half-extents are 0.044722948.
           Thus, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.044722948 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.044722948
           -0.090277052 <= x <= 0.090277052
           Same for y.
           
           For rotated objects (e.g., pi/4), the maximum dimension will be sqrt(2) * (side/2).
           sqrt(2) * 0.044722948 = 0.06324.
           So, -0.135 + 0.06324 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.06324
           -0.07176 <= x <= 0.07176
           Same for y.
           
           Summary of occupied space (axis-aligned, Y=0 centered for now):
           Obj 4: [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357]
           Obj 5: [0.0371, 0.1329] x [-0.0479, 0.0479]
           Obj 6: [-0.1265, -0.0535] x [-0.0365, 0.0365]
           
           Notice that the y-axis (y=0) region is heavily occupied:
           From Obj 6: x from -0.1265 to -0.0535, y from -0.0365 to 0.0365
           From Obj 4: x from -0.0357 to 0.0357, y from -0.0357 to 0.0357
           From Obj 5: x from 0.0371 to 0.1329, y from -0.0479 to 0.0479
           
           The available space seems to be primarily in the positive and negative y-regions, away from y=0.
           Let's calculate collision thresholds for Obj 7 (half-extent 0.0447):
           
           With Obj 4 (half-extent 0.0357):
           Collision if |x_center| < 0.0357+0.0447 = 0.0804 and |y_center| < 0.0357+0.0447 = 0.0804
           
           With Obj 5 (half-extent 0.0479, center (0.085, 0)):
           Collision if x_center is in [0.085 - 0.0479 - 0.0447, 0.085 + 0.0479 + 0.0447] = [0.085 - 0.0926, 0.085 + 0.0926] = [-0.0076, 0.1776]
           AND y_center is in [-0.0479 - 0.0447, 0.0479 + 0.0447] = [-0.0926, 0.0926]
           
           With Obj 6 (half-extent 0.0365, center (-0.09, 0)):
           Collision if x_center is in [-0.09 - 0.0365 - 0.0447, -0.09 + 0.0365 + 0.0447] = [-0.09 - 0.0812, -0.09 + 0.0812] = [-0.1712, -0.0088]
           AND y_center is in [-0.0365 - 0.0447, 0.0365 + 0.0447] = [-0.0812, 0.0812]
           
           This means, for axis-aligned placements, to avoid collision:
           If y_center is between -0.08 and 0.08 (roughly, due to half-extents):
           - x_center must be outside [-0.0804, 0.0804] (due to Obj 4)
           - x_center must be outside [-0.0076, 0.1776] (due to Obj 5)
           - x_center must be outside [-0.1712, -0.0088] (due to Obj 6)
           
           Combining the x-constraints for the y-strip where objects are:
           x_center needs to be < -0.0804 OR x_center > 0.0804 (due to Obj 4)
           x_center needs to be < -0.0076 OR x_center > 0.1776 (due to Obj 5)
           x_center needs to be < -0.1712 OR x_center > -0.0088 (due to Obj 6)
           
           The total x-range for the surface is [-0.0902, 0.0902].
           - The region between -0.0804 and 0.0804 is problematic (Obj 4).
           - The region between -0.0076 and 0.1776 is problematic (Obj 5).
           - The region between -0.1712 and -0.0088 is problematic (Obj 6).
           
           If y_center is around 0, it means x_center must be in the intersection of (x < -0.0804 or x > 0.0804), (x < -0.0076 or x > 0.1776), (x < -0.1712 or x > -0.0088).
           This is very difficult for x-axis aligned placements for y=0.
           
           Therefore, I'll focus on placing Obj 7 at higher or lower y-coordinates.
           For example, a y-center of 0.085 or -0.085 would put its bounding box (0.085 +/- 0.0447) as [0.0403, 0.1297] or [-0.1297, -0.0403].
           This would avoid the y-collision with Obj 4, 5, 6 as their y-ranges are [-0.0479, 0.0479] max.
           So if y_center is, say, 0.085, then min_y is 0.0403. This is outside of all existing y-ranges.
           Then I only need to ensure x_center is within [-0.0902, 0.0902].
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.085) # Centered on X, top part of surface.
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.085) # Centered on X, bottom part of surface.
           (0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.085) # Offset to positive X, top part.
           (0, 0.0, -0.04, 0.085) # Offset to negative X, top part.
           (0, 0.0, 0.04, -0.085) # Offset to positive X, bottom part.
           (0, 0.0, -0.04, -0.085) # Offset to negative X, bottom part.
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.085) # Close to right edge
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.085) # Close to left edge
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.085) # Close to right edge, bottom
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.085) # Close to left edge, bottom
           
           Let's try some rotated placements for the top/bottom regions.
           Rotated by pi/4, half_extent becomes 0.06324.
           So if y_center is 0.085, y_min = 0.085 - 0.06324 = 0.02176. This still avoids other objects' y-ranges.
           Max x/y for center: 0.07176
           
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.08)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.08)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.03, 0.08)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.03, 0.08)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.03, -0.08)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.03, -0.08)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.06, 0.06) # Diagonal placement, but centered away from occupied y-strip
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.06, 0.06)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.06, -0.06)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.06, -0.06)
           
           I will also try to squeeze some in the "gaps" along the x-axis, assuming the y-range of Obj 7 is small enough to fit in the very small gaps, but it is unlikely.
           For example, between Obj 4 and Obj 5, the x-gap is (0.0357, 0.0371). This is extremely small (0.0014), impossible for Obj 7 (half-extent 0.0447).
           Between Obj 4 and Obj 6, the x-gap is (-0.0535, -0.0357). This is (0.0178) also too small.
           The problem statement indicates that if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision not aware of. So, for the sake of diversity, I will provide some slightly more aggressive placements, as well as many around the known empty areas.
           
           Remaining placements focusing on the top/bottom edges of the surface.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           A new object (ID: 8) is requested, which is also square, with side length approximately 0.0921.
           
           This is a very interesting situation. The feedback for ID 4, 5, and 6 shows *multiple* successful placements for the same ID. This implies that the environment is dynamic or that I should consider *all* provided successful placements for a given ID as potential fixed obstacles. The prompt states "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." It doesn't say "the last successful placement". Given the new format of feedback, I will interpret this as all provided placements for objects 4, 5, 6, and 7 are now fixed obstacles.
           
           Let's list all fixed obstacles and their bounding boxes (assuming axis-aligned for simplicity first, then using rotated AABBs if necessary for tighter packing):
           
           Object half_extents:
           - Obj 4: 0.071396 / 2 = 0.0357
           - Obj 5: 0.095826 / 2 = 0.0479
           - Obj 6: 0.073011 / 2 = 0.0365
           - Obj 7: 0.089445 / 2 = 0.0447
           
           List of successful placements for previous objects (center_x, center_y, rotation):
           
           1.  (ID: 4) -- (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> BB4_1: [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357]
           2.  (ID: 5) -- (0.085, 0.0, 0.0) -> BB5_1: [0.0371, 0.1329] x [-0.0479, 0.0479]

           5.  (ID: 7) -- (0.0, -0.08, 0.785) -> Rotated (pi/4), max_half_extent = 0.06324. BB7_2: [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [-0.08 - 0.06324, -0.08 + 0.06324] = [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [-0.14324, -0.01676]
           6.  (ID: 4) -- (0.05, 0.0, 0.0) -> BB4_2: [0.05 - 0.0357, 0.05 + 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357] = [0.0143, 0.0857] x [-0.0357, 0.0357]

           This is a significant amount of fixed obstacles.
           Let's merge the bounding boxes to simplify the occupied space.
           
           Along the x-axis, for y close to 0:
           BB4_1: x in [-0.0357, 0.0357]
           BB5_1: x in [0.0371, 0.1329]
           BB6_1: x in [-0.1265, -0.0535]
           BB4_2: x in [0.0143, 0.0857]
           BB5_2: x in [-0.1329, -0.0371]
           
           Combined x-ranges near y=0:
           From BB4_1 and BB4_2: [-0.0357, 0.0357] U [0.0143, 0.0857] = [-0.0357, 0.0857]
           From BB5_1 and BB5_2: [0.0371, 0.1329] U [-0.1329, -0.0371]
           From BB6_1: [-0.1265, -0.0535]
           
           The central strip along y=0 is very dense.
           x from -0.1329 to 0.1329, y from -0.0479 to 0.0479 is almost completely occupied (with tiny gaps).
           
           Available space:
           Top regions (y > ~0.05):
           BB7_1: x in [-0.06324, 0.06324], y in [0.01676, 0.14324]
           BB6_2: x in [-0.1265, -0.0535], y in [0.0535, 0.1265]
           Bottom regions (y < ~-0.05):
           BB7_2: x in [-0.06324, 0.06324], y in [-0.14324, -0.01676]
           
           New object (ID: 8) has size_x = size_y = 0.092095.
           If placed upright (theta=0), its half-extents are 0.0460475.
           Thus, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0460475 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0460475
           -0.0889525 <= x <= 0.0889525
           Same for y.
           
           For rotated objects (e.g., pi/4), max_half_extent = sqrt(2) * 0.0460475 = 0.06511.
           So, -0.135 + 0.06511 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.06511
           -0.06989 <= x <= 0.06989
           Same for y.
           
           Given the density of objects, I should focus on the remaining corner regions, especially those outside the main central band and the regions occupied by Obj 7 and Obj 6_2.
           
           Let's look at the remaining surface bounds and occupied areas:
           Surface: X in [-0.135, 0.135], Y in [-0.135, 0.135]
           
           Top-left region:
           Potential space to the left of BB6_2 (x < -0.1265) -- too small, or above BB6_2 (y > 0.1265)
           The surface only goes up to 0.135. Obj 8 (upright) needs a Y-range of 0.046 * 2 = 0.092.
           So if its y-center is 0.135 - 0.046 = 0.089. This would have y-range [0.043, 0.135].
           This would fit above BB7_1 and BB6_2.
           X-range: [-0.08895, 0.08895]
           
           Consider placing at y_center = 0.089.
           Its bounding box will be [x_center - 0.046, x_center + 0.046] x [0.043, 0.135].
           Need to avoid BB6_2: x in [-0.1265, -0.0535], y in [0.0535, 0.1265].
           Need to avoid BB7_1: x in [-0.06324, 0.06324], y in [0.01676, 0.14324].
           The y-range of Obj 8 [0.043, 0.135] mostly overlaps with BB6_2 and BB7_1 y-ranges. So we need x-separation.
           
           If y_center = 0.089:
           Avoid BB6_2 if x_center is in [-0.1265-0.046, -0.0535+0.046] = [-0.1725, -0.0075]
           Avoid BB7_1 if x_center is in [-0.06324-0.046, 0.06324+0.046] = [-0.10924, 0.10924]
           Combined: x_center must avoid [-0.1725, 0.10924] for y_center=0.089.
           This would mean x_center < -0.1725 or x_center > 0.10924.
           But Obj 8's max x_center is 0.08895, min x_center is -0.08895.
           So, no axis-aligned placement with y_center=0.089 is possible. This is very tight.
           
           Let's try a y-center for Obj 8 where it is entirely above the other objects.
           Max y_center = 0.08895 (for upright)
           Min y_value of Obj 8: 0.08895 - 0.0460475 = 0.0429
           Max y_value of Obj 6_2: 0.1265
           Max y_value of Obj 7_1: 0.14324
           
           This implies that if Obj 8 is placed at y=0.08895 (max possible), its bottom edge is at 0.0429.
           This is within the y-range of BB6_2 [0.0535, 0.1265] and BB7_1 [0.01676, 0.14324]. So x collision checks are still critical.
           
           Let's refine the collision regions for Obj 8 (half-extent 0.046):
           Obstacle Bounding Boxes (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max):
           BB4_1: (-0.0357, 0.0357, -0.0357, 0.0357)
           BB5_1: (0.0371, 0.1329, -0.0479, 0.0479)
           BB6_1: (-0.1265, -0.0535, -0.0365, 0.0365)
           BB7_1: (-0.06324, 0.06324, 0.01676, 0.14324)
           BB7_2: (-0.06324, 0.06324, -0.14324, -0.01676)
           BB4_2: (0.0143, 0.0857, -0.0357, 0.0357)
           BB5_2: (-0.1329, -0.0371, -0.0479, 0.0479)
           BB6_2: (-0.1265, -0.0535, 0.0535, 0.1265)
           
           Consider placing Obj 8 along the very edges of the surface.
           Max x_center = 0.08895. Max y_center = 0.08895. (for upright)
           Min x_center = -0.08895. Min y_center = -0.08895.
           
           A placement like (0, 0.0, -0.08895, -0.08895) (bottom-left corner)
           BB for this placement: [-0.08895-0.046, -0.08895+0.046] x [-0.08895-0.046, -0.08895+0.046]
           = [-0.13495, -0.04295] x [-0.13495, -0.04295]
           
           Let's check for collision with other BBs:
           - Obj 4: BB4_1 is [-0.0357, 0.0357] x [-0.0357, 0.0357]. No overlap with [-0.13495, -0.04295] in x. No overlap with [-0.13495, -0.04295] in y. (OK)
           - Obj 5: BB5_1 is [0.0371, 0.1329] x [-0.0479, 0.0479]. No overlap in x. (OK)
           - Obj 6: BB6_1 is [-0.1265, -0.0535] x [-0.0365, 0.0365]. No overlap in y. (OK)
           - Obj 7: BB7_1 is [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324]. No overlap in y. (OK)
           - Obj 7: BB7_2 is [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [-0.14324, -0.01676]. Overlap in y ([-0.13495,-0.04295] with [-0.14324,-0.01676]). Overlap in x ([-0.13495,-0.04295] with [-0.06324,0.06324]). YES, COLLIDES!
           My calculation for BB7_2 was [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [-0.14324, -0.01676].
           Obj 8 at (-0.08895, -0.08895) with half_extent 0.046 is [-0.13495, -0.04295] x [-0.13495, -0.04295].
           X-overlap: [-0.06324, -0.04295] -- YES
           Y-overlap: [-0.13495, -0.04295] -- YES
           So a corner placement like (-0.08895, -0.08895) collides with Obj 7_2. This is extremely tight.
           
           Let's rethink: There are 8 fixed obstacles. It might be better to find spaces *between* them, or further to the edges.
           The previous placements show successful placements for Obj 7 at (0.0, 0.08, 0.785) and (0.0, -0.08, 0.785). These are rotated.
           Their rotated AABBs are [-0.06324, 0.06324] for x.
           For Obj 7_1, y is [0.01676, 0.14324]. For Obj 7_2, y is [-0.14324, -0.01676].
           
           The remaining space for Obj 8 is very small. I will target the areas outside of any current object's AABB.
           Given the max bounds of Obj 8 (upright: x,y center up to +/-0.08895, rotated: x,y center up to +/-0.06989).
           
           Let's try to place Obj 8 in a small available gap or corner.
           Consider the top-right corner.
           Max x = 0.08895, Max y = 0.08895.
           BB for Obj 8 (upright) at (0.08895, 0.08895): [0.04295, 0.13495] x [0.04295, 0.13495]
           
           Check for collisions with this BB:
           - BB4_1: no.
           - BB5_1: x overlap [0.04295, 0.1329] but y is [0.04295, 0.13495] vs [-0.0479, 0.0479]. No y-overlap. (OK)
           - BB6_1: no.
           - BB7_1: x overlap [0.04295, 0.06324] (yes). y overlap [0.04295, 0.13495] with [0.01676, 0.14324] (yes). COLLISION with Obj 7_1.
           
           This is extremely difficult. The multiple fixed obstacles are making the free space very fragmented and small.
           I will try to place it in the region of the top-right and bottom-right corners.
           There is a tiny gap between Obj 5_1 and the top edge, and another between Obj 5_1 and the bottom edge.
           
           Let's try:
           X-center around 0.0, Y-center around 0.11
           For Obj 8 at (0.0, 0.11, 0.0), BB: [-0.046, 0.046] x [0.11-0.046, 0.11+0.046] = [-0.046, 0.046] x [0.064, 0.156]
           Y-max (0.156) is greater than surface max (0.135). So cannot place y_center at 0.11.
           
           Max y_center = 0.135 - 0.046 = 0.089.
           So the first set of trials (x_center, 0.089) should be re-evaluated.
           If (0.0, 0.089, 0.0): BB is [-0.046, 0.046] x [0.043, 0.135].
           - Collides with BB7_1 ([-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324]) in both x and y.
           
           My strategy needs to be more precise given the dense environment.
           I will generate placements that fit in the "open" rectangles after subtracting all obstacle bounding boxes from the surface.
           The central strip for y near 0 has 5 objects. The top and bottom strips have 2 objects each.
           
           The entire range [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135].
           Let's consider the region where y > 0.
           Occupied x for y around [0.016, 0.143]: BB7_1 x in [-0.06324, 0.06324]
           Occupied x for y around [0.0535, 0.1265]: BB6_2 x in [-0.1265, -0.0535]
           
           Consider the top-right region, specifically where x > 0.06324 and y > 0.01676.
           Surface corner: (0.135, 0.135)
           Obj 7_1 top-right corner: (0.06324, 0.14324) - too far.
           So a potential region could be x in (0.06324, 0.135) and y in (0.0429, 0.135) for Obj 8.
           Let's try center (0.08, 0.08) for Obj 8 (half_ext 0.046). BB: [0.034, 0.126] x [0.034, 0.126]
           This BB avoids all obstacles except potentially Obj 7_1:
           Obj 7_1: [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324]
           Obj 8 BB: [0.034, 0.126] x [0.034, 0.126]
           X-overlap: [0.034, 0.06324] (YES)
           Y-overlap: [0.034, 0.126] with [0.01676, 0.14324] (YES)
           So (0.08, 0.08) also collides.
           
           This means the free space is very fragmented.
           I need to make sure that the proposed bounding box of object 8 does not overlap with any of the 8 fixed obstacle bounding boxes.
           
           Let's try to fit in the very extreme corners, possibly with a rotation.
           If Obj 8 is rotated by pi/4, its half-extent is 0.06511. Max center for x/y is 0.06989.
           Consider (0.06989, 0.06989, 0.785398).
           BB: [0.06989-0.06511, 0.06989+0.06511] x [0.06989-0.06511, 0.06989+0.06511]
           = [0.00478, 0.135] x [0.00478, 0.135].
           This collides with Obj 7_1 [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324] because:
           X overlap: [0.00478, 0.06324] (YES)
           Y overlap: [0.01676, 0.135] (YES)
           
           The only way is to put the center very close to the edge of the board and outside any obstacles.
           This requires a very small max_x and max_y values of the object's AABB for small rotation angles.
           For example, if theta is 0, the half-extents are 0.0460475.
           Surface edge is 0.135.
           Max center for x or y is 0.135 - 0.0460475 = 0.0889525.
           
           Let's try to place Obj 8 in a very precise spot.
           Consider the area right of Obj 7_1: x > 0.06324, and below Obj 7_1: y < 0.01676.
           This will collide with the central Y=0 strip.
           
           How about the very far top-right corner, avoiding BB7_1.
           BB7_1's rightmost x is 0.06324. So we need x_center - 0.046 > 0.06324 => x_center > 0.10924.
           But max x_center is 0.0889525. So no space to the right of BB7_1 if it is upright.
           
           What if Obj 8 is rotated by 0 or pi/2?
           The valid x_center ranges for the surface are [-0.08895, 0.08895].
           The valid y_center ranges for the surface are [-0.08895, 0.08895].
           
           Let's try to find an empty slot that does not overlap with any of the 8 bounding boxes.
           I will generate positions near the four corners that are not yet occupied, trying various rotations.
           
           Top-right corner free space: x in [0.06324, 0.135] and y in [0.1265, 0.135] (above BB6_2)
           Available x-range: 0.135 - 0.06324 = 0.07176
           Available y-range: 0.135 - 0.1265 = 0.0085.
           Obj 8 needs 0.092 x 0.092, so 0.0085 is too small for y.
           
           This means placing a *new* object is extremely difficult on this single surface with 8 existing objects.
           Perhaps the collision detection for rotated objects is less strict, or I'm missing a small area.
           I will try to place Obj 8 just outside the boundaries of the existing obstacles.
           
           Let's try around (-0.08, 0.08) with different orientations, seeing if it can squeeze between Obj 6_2 and Obj 7_1.
           Obj 6_2: [-0.1265, -0.0535] x [0.0535, 0.1265]
           Obj 7_1: [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324]
           
           There is an x-gap between Obj 6_2 and Obj 7_1 where x is in (-0.0535, -0.06324) if y is overlapping. This isn't a simple interval.
           It's possible that there are no remaining stable placements for this object. However, the instructions say "You never give up."
           
           I will try placements in the corners of the surface that have minimal overlap with existing objects.
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08) failed before.
           Let's try shifting x or y more:
           (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088) -> BB: [0.088-0.046, 0.088+0.046] x [0.088-0.046, 0.088+0.046] = [0.042, 0.134] x [0.042, 0.134]
           Check collision with BB7_1: [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324]
           X-overlap: [0.042, 0.06324] (yes). Y-overlap: [0.042, 0.134] with [0.01676, 0.14324] (yes). Collision.
           
           Maybe a very tiny object could fit. But Obj 8 is relatively large.
           I will try to place it in the gap between the middle x-axis and the top row, in the x-range where there are no objects in the top row.
           The top row has BB7_1 (x: [-0.06324, 0.06324]) and BB6_2 (x: [-0.1265, -0.0535]).
           So, for the top half (y > 0), the x-ranges still open are (0.06324, 0.135] and [-0.135, -0.1265) and (-0.0535, -0.06324) (very small).
           And for y between 0 and (roughly) 0.01676, there is space to the right of 0.06324.
           
           Let's try to fit Obj 8 (half_ext 0.046) in the top-right part of the surface where BB7_1 does not reach.
           BB7_1 extends x up to 0.06324.
           So we need x_center - 0.046 > 0.06324 => x_center > 0.10924.
           Max x_center for Obj 8 is 0.08895. So no axis-aligned placement to the right of Obj 7_1.
           
           This is a scenario where the surface is extremely full. I need to find any small available crack.
           I will try placements that are rotated, as they sometimes allow for fitting in irregular shapes.
           I will target the areas that are geometrically the corners of the overall occupied regions.
           
           Target Area 1: Top-Right. After Obj 7_1 and Obj 6_2.
           Max y of Obj 7_1 is 0.14324. Max y of Obj 6_2 is 0.1265.
           This means above y=0.14324 is no space on the surface.
           So the available y-range is limited.
           
           Target Area 2: Bottom-Right. After Obj 7_2.
           Min y of Obj 7_2 is -0.14324.
           Right of Obj 7_2 x > 0.06324.
           Below Obj 7_2 y < -0.14324. (not possible on surface)
           
           Okay, since direct calculation of free space is proving too complex with the existing obstacles and their AABBs, I will generate a diverse set of placements in the unconstrained areas, assuming the simulator will find the valid ones.
           The space at very high positive y, and very low negative y, on the far left or far right, appears to be the most promising.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) # This is unlikely to work due to density, but testing central locations too.
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08) # failed before
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)
           
           Given the previous failures for Obj 8, and the complexity of the scene, I will systematically try positions near the boundary of the surface while trying to avoid the already identified collision regions.
           
           Let's retry positions in the top/bottom regions, shifting them slightly to avoid the rotated objects (Obj 7).
           Obj 7_1: [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [0.01676, 0.14324]
           Obj 7_2: [-0.06324, 0.06324] x [-0.14324, -0.01676]
           
           For Obj 8, half_extents = 0.046.
           Consider the top-right: x_center > 0.06324 + 0.046 = 0.10924.
           This range for x_center (0.10924 to 0.08895) is invalid.
           So, to the right of Obj 7_1, there's no space for Obj 8 (axis-aligned).
           
           Consider the top-left, to the left of Obj 7_1 (x < -0.06324).
           x_center < -0.06324 - 0.046 = -0.10924.
           This range for x_center (-0.10924 to -0.08895) is invalid.
           So, to the left of Obj 7_1, no space either for Obj 8 (axis-aligned).
           
           This implies that Obj 8 must collide with Obj 7_1 (or 7_2) if placed in the top/bottom sections with x_center around 0.
           This makes finding an axis-aligned position very difficult.
           
           I will attempt a wider range of orientations, and small shifts in x/y in the corner regions, hoping to find a gap.
