           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state involving two rovers (`v12`, `v14`), a storage (`v16`), images received for objectives (`v17`, `v18`) with mode `v11`, and analysis received for rocks (`v2`, `v6`).
           
           Looking at the initial state, we have:
           - Two rovers: `v12` and `v14`.
           - Both rovers are at their initial configurations: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           - Both rovers have free storage `v16`: `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           - There are several rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - The types of rocks are `v2` (for `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and `v6` (for `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           - Objectives are `v17` and `v18`.
           - There is a camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. `v10` is onboard both rovers.
           - A lander `v9` is present for communication.
           - Both rovers have visibility to the lander and to objectives `v17` and `v18` at various configurations and with specific rays.
           - Both rovers are above several rocks at configuration `#o5`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by the following conditions based on its definition:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: This means any rock of type `v2` needs to have its analysis received. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Needs to be achieved for a rock of type `v2`.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: This means any rock of type `v6` needs to have its analysis received. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Needs to be achieved for a rock of type `v6`.
           
           So, the overall plan involves:
           1. Taking images of objectives `v17` and `v18` using one of the rovers.
           2. Sending those images to the lander.
           3. Sampling at least one rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v1`) and one rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`).
           4. Sending the analysis of these sampled rocks to the lander.
           
           Let's assume we use rover `v12` for image tasks and `v14` for sampling tasks for simplicity, but both rovers are capable of both.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           - `v12` needs to `calibrate` camera `v10` for objective `v17`. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           - `v12` needs to `take_image` of `v17` with camera `v10` in mode `v11`. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           - `v12` needs to `send_image` of `v17` with mode `v11` to lander `v9`. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           
           For `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - `v12` needs to `calibrate` camera `v10` for objective `v18`. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           - `v12` needs to `take_image` of `v18` with camera `v10` in mode `v11`. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           - `v12` needs to `send_image` of `v18` with mode `v11` to lander `v9`. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2`:
           - `v14` needs to `sample_rock` for a rock of type `v2`, e.g., `v1`, into store `v16`. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`
           - `v14` needs to `send_analysis` of rock `v1` to lander `v9`. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6`:
           - `v14` needs to `sample_rock` for a rock of type `v6`, e.g., `v5`, into store `v16`. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`. Since `v14` already sampled `v1`, its store `v16` will be `full`. Therefore, `v14` needs to `drop_rock(v14, v16)` first before sampling `v5`.
           - `v14` needs to `send_analysis` of rock `v5` to lander `v9`. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           Note that the `calibrated` predicate is consumed by `take_image`. So, we need to calibrate again if we want to take another image or if the camera was used for other purposes.
           
           Let's check the available action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are listed. This is a critical constraint. If only these actions are allowed, then achieving the goal is impossible as it requires `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. The prompt states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           The goal cannot be achieved because the necessary actions for imaging, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, `calibrate`) are not present in the list of allowed action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` are permitted.
