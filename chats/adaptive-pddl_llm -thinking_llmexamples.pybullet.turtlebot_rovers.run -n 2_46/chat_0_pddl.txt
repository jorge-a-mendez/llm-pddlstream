           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Thought Process:**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I'm given a goal, `new-axiom@0()`, and my task is to devise a plan to achieve it. Breaking down the axiom, I see I need to satisfy several conditions: two rovers at specific configurations, two free storage slots, two images received, a stone and soil type identified, and analyses of both received. The initial state already satisfies the configuration, storage, and object type conditions. Therefore, the essential challenge lies in achieving `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, and `receivedanalysis(v7)`.
           
           My initial strategy involved using two rovers, v12 and v14. I planned to use v12 to capture and send an image of object v17, then analyze stone v3. Concurrently, I'd have v14 capture and send an image of object v18, and then analyze soil v7.
           
           To accomplish this, I needed to leverage the available actions: `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, after carefully scrutinizing the problem statement, I discovered a critical constraint: I'm only allowed to use `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The plan I devised using `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` is not valid. These actions are not in the allowed action list. 
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of only using the allowed actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal state.
