           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.202, -0.33), (0.298, -0.234)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.051, 0.352), (0.145, 0.446)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.027, 0.216), (0.1, 0.289)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, 0.454), (-0.174, 0.547)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.25, -0.282, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.965, -0.261).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.098, 0.399, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.846, 0.533).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.064, 0.253, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.722, 0.692).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.22, 0.5, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.976, 0.216).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.077, 0.228, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.046).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           Alright, the task at hand is to orchestrate a robot to place five objects, v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, onto a target surface, v20.  Each object is currently resting on a supporting surface, v11, at specific poses. The robot has two arms, but only arm v4 is relevant, as the problem specifies the 'kin' relations only for this arm. The robot base, v3, is also important. The 'kin' relation, together with 'move_base' actions, indicate the robot's base configuration (#o3) is necessary to perform actions such as `pick` and `place`.
           
           The primary action here involves manipulating each object, one after another, from its current pose and surface to a specified pose on v20. It's a straightforward pick-and-place operation, achievable through two actions: `pick` and `place`. This relies on the system's ability to safely approach, grasp, move, and place the objects.  Safety is crucial, and it's assumed that unsafe conditions are false unless stated otherwise. The available actions have collision safety preconditions that might make this infeasible.
           
           Now, a key challenge is the continuous values associated with the poses:  I need to provide *unique* values for each object on the target surface, v20.  For the `place` action, the target is at pose `#o2`. I interpret this as *different* continuous values for each object *at the same symbolic pose*.
           
           The initial pose for the robot base is v3, and the initial arm configuration is v5. The "kin" information provides arm and base configurations to pick and place. There are no arm-motion actions provided, so arm movement is encoded in the kin facts. So the plan is as follows:
           
           1.  Move the base from v3 to a configuration `#o3`.
           2.  Pick and Place each object in a specified order using the robot arm v4.
           
           To make the plan robust, I will also provide distinct values for each `#o2` pose used for placing objects on v20.
           
           **Detailed Planning and Considerations**
           
           To define the plan I consider the following.
           
           The move base action is `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The pose values used for picking and placing depend on the `kin` relations that are provided. It uses `bconf` value of #o3. So I must ensure that the move action ensures this bconf is available.
           
           I have five pick and place operations, one for each object. All of the place poses must be distinct for each `obj`. The object sizes are provided in the problem statement as axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB). The geometry and surface dimensions define a packing problem. The target surface, `v20`, is a square of size 0.27m x 0.27m. The objects are smaller. These AABBs give the object dimensions.
           
           I need to calculate collision-free configurations for the robot to move each object. The poses need to be stable (i.e., within surface bounds), and collision free, which requires providing valid continuous values for each object on v20.
           
           **Collision-Free Arrangement**
           
           To achieve the plan, I need to compute the specific pose values for the `place` actions, which involves ensuring stable, collision-free placements on the target surface, `v20`. The objects are approximately 0.1m x 0.1m, and the target surface is 0.27m x 0.27m. The key to the plan involves the arrangement of the objects on surface `v20`.
           
           After extensive calculations, I decided to use the following arrangement. First, I arranged all the objects on a horizontal line. After which I used the remaining space on top.
           
           **Final Plan with Specific Values**
           
           The final plan with all of the steps outlined above is:
           
           1.  Move base from v3 to #o3. `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`
           2.  (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  (place v4 v8 (-0.04, 0.04, 0.781, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  (place v4 v12 (0.04, 0.04, 0.781, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.  (pick v4 v14 v15 #
)
