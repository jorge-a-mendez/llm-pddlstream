User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a square region from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. I will try to find positions that are not directly in front of these obstacles, or very close to the boundaries, and are within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize positions that give a good view of the target, meaning a relatively direct line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 0.5)
           (0.0 1.0)
           (0.0 -1.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous positions failed because (1.0, 0.5) did not have line of sight to the target point (-2.03, 2.03), which is understandable given the target is in the top-left quadrant and the position is in the bottom-right. The other two positions, (0.0, 1.0) and (0.0, -1.0), collided with the large central wall at x=0. I need to be more mindful of the target's location and the fixed obstacles. The target point is in the top-left quadrant. I should try positions in the vicinity that are not obstructed by the fixed obstacles, especially the x=0 wall. I will stay on the left side of the x=0 wall.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 1.0)
           (-2.0 0.0)
           (-1.5 2.0)
