           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, -0.335), (4.535, -0.265)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.352, 0.145), (-4.265, 0.232)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.309, 0.188, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.602, 0.798).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning a Path to a New Axiom**
           
           My goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` positioned `on` another object `v18`, and ensuring `?green` is of a specific `type`.  I've been given an initial state to work with, and I've carefully analyzed the facts and axioms involved.
           
           Based on the initial state, I've identified `v8` as a possible candidate for `?green` because it satisfies the necessary `type` and `stackable` conditions. The goal is to place `v8` onto `v18`. From the axiom definitions, this means I need to find a suitable pose `?p` for `v8` such that it is `supported` by `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see that I can leverage the existing fact `pose(v8, p3)` and `supported(v8, p3, v18)`. This `p3` is a specific pose for `v8` that is *already* supported by `v18`.  This is ideal, and using the specific pose `p3` is preferable to searching for more general pose values that might require continuous parameter assignments.
           
           My plan breaks down into these steps:
           
           1.  **Move the base**: First, the robot's base needs to be positioned appropriately. There is an action to `move_base` to a configuration to pick.
           2.  **Pick up `v8`**: With the base at a valid configuration, I can then pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.  The initial state includes facts about the robot's hand being empty (`handempty(v4)`) and `v8` being graspable.
           3.  **Move base again**: I need to get the base near the target location. This involves another `move_base` action.
           4.  **Place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `p3`**: Finally, with the base in position, I can place `v8` at the predetermined pose `p3` which will satisfy the `on(v8, v18)` goal.
           
           I've carefully checked the preconditions and effects for each action to make sure they are valid. Notably, since the system assumes facts not explicitly stated are false, I can assume "unsafe" predicates are false unless specifically stated. This simplifies the planning process.
           
           I've also verified that the poses and objects involved are valid according to their bounding box data. The specific poses, such as `p3`, are well-defined and acceptable. I will ensure that the final result satisfies the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`. The final sequence of actions, which includes two `move_base`, a `pick`, and a `place` operation seems like the minimal cost solution. Therefore, this plan is accepted as an ideal plan.
