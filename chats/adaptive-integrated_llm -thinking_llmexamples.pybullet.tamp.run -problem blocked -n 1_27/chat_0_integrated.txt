User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.352, 0.145), (-4.265, 0.232)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.309, 0.188, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.602, 0.798).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object, let's call it `?green`, onto a specific surface, `v18`, such that `?green` is of a certain type, `v17`. The crucial part is getting something *on* `v18`. From the initial state and available objects, I identified that either `v8` or `v12` could be `?green`. Both are of type `v17`.
           
           My strategy hinges on the assumption that I can use standard manipulation actions, even if they aren't explicitly listed. Otherwise, the problem seems impossible given the initial state. I need to bring an object currently in the `supported` relationship *onto* `v18`. Since I can't move the base, `v12` is too far away to move, so I should focus on `v8`.
           
           `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, with y-coordinate 0.3, a value outside of the target surface's bounds `v18` with y-coordinate between -0.6 and 0.0. To successfully make the new axiom, my first step is to pick `v8` from its current location (`v9`) using arm `v4` and then place it onto `v18` at a new pose (`#o2`). This place must satisfy the relation of `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.
           
           I must ensure the plan adheres to the problem's constraints. The plan is:
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t1)`. The robot uses arm `v4`, to pick object `v8` from pose `v9`. The arm executes grasp `#o1`, it is at base `v3`, and follows pick trajectory `#t1`.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #t2)`. The robot using `v4`, places `v8` onto the pose `#o2` with the same grasp `#o1`, at base `v3`, using place trajectory `#t2`.
           
           For this plan, the value of the pose `#o2` must be within `v18`'s bounds and have valid support. Thus, I determined the location of `#o2` is **(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)**. It seems reasonable, and it would put the object within the surface `v18`. The initial value `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` would still be satisfied and will be true. After the place action, the `on(v8, v18)` relationship will be satisfied, and the goal will be achieved.
           
           To execute the plan, I need an appropriate grasp, `#o1`, and both pick and place trajectories, `#t1` and `#t2`. Then, I confirm each action's preconditions given the existing state and demonstrate that by performing those actions I can accomplish the goal.
           
           The key assumption is that *I can* and should generate action instances for `pick` and `place` when their templates exist, even if these instances aren't provided explicitly. It relies on the correct selection of # values. Finally, with the value of the pose given to be on v18, I have satisfied the goal with a cost of 2, the minimum possible to achieve a pickup and place.
           
           My final output to the user is a plan with the instantiated parameters and the chosen location for the `#o2` parameter. It will also be required to perform some sort of collision checking as part of the robot's motion planning.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t1) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t2)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of the Goal with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan I proposed is completely invalid. I was trying to leverage `pick` and `place` actions to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on a surface `v18`. From the initial state, I know that object `v8` is of type `v17` and is supported by a surface `v18`. I also know `v12` is of type `v17`.
           
           My strategy was to move `v8` to `v18` from its current position `v9`, requiring me to satisfy the atom `atpose(v8, v18)`. But I can't do that. The problem specifies that the ONLY available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *do* anything useful. It moves the base to the same position. It sets `canmove()` to false and then does nothing to set it back. Even if it did something useful, this action can't help me manipulate any objects. It can't change the position of `v8` from `v9` to `v18`. It also can't change the position of `v12`. I need `pick` and `place` actions to do that.
           
           Since I am restricted to this useless action, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unreachable*. I can't place any object, and therefore I can't put any object on `v18`. The system is basically immobilized. This problem is trivially unsatisfiable with the provided action set. I need to report this back, this is a dead end.
