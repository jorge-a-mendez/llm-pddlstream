           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is clear: I need to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object of a certain type onto a specific surface.
           
           Here's my thought process:
           
           *   **Identifying the Object and Target:** I need to find something that is `type(?, v17)` and place it `on(?, v18)`. Luckily, the initial state gives me two options: `v8` and `v12`. Both are `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. The target surface, `v18`, is defined by the AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, essentially the right side of the robot.
           *   **Initial Object Locations:** `v8` is initially supported by surface `v11` which is AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`. Also `v9` is the pose for `v8` (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and `v12` is at `(-4.309, 0.188, 0.801)`.
           *   **Choosing v8:** My gut tells me to go with `v8` since it's already in the right general area, especially since the y-coordinate of `v18` and `v11` are similar with y-ranges `-0.6 < y < 0.0` and `-0.6 < y < 0.6`. Also the X range is the same.
           *   **Building a Plan:** The core actions will be `pick` and `place`. To get `v8` "on v18", I need to find a new pose (?p) that is both supported on surface v18 (`supported(v8, ?p, v18)`) and has the object `v8` at this new pose, i.e., `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           *   **Available Actions:** I have several `pick` and `place` actions at my disposal and I need to select the right one.
           *   **The Plan in Detail:**
               *   **Move Base Action:**
                   1.  I have `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`. I should ensure the robot is in a valid base configuration to begin. The problem statement defines initial position to be `v3` which is at (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).  So, I set `#o3 = v3`. This will result in zero cost for the base motion step! This avoids any unnecessary base movement, making the process more efficient.
               *   **Pick Action:**
                   2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 v32 #o3 #o4`: I'll use the pose `v9` where `v8` currently is.
               *   **Place Action:**
                   3.  `place v4 v8 p3 v32 #o3 #o4`: `p3` is at (4.5, -0.3, 0.802). I want to place v8 on the desired surface `v18` at `p3`. Note that the robot already has kinematic properties established from the initial pose, as it can reach from `v3` to `p3`. `p3` is within the y-range of v18.
           *   **Cost and Feasibility:**
               *   Since I set `#o3` to `v3`, the `move_base` action cost is zero. `pickcost()` and `placecost()` each have a cost of `1`. The total cost of the plan is therefore 2.
               *   I've carefully checked the preconditions for each action, particularly the collision-related ones (`unsafeapproach`, `unsafepose`, `unsafeatraj`), and ensured they're satisfied.
           *   **Success Conditions:** After the `place` action, the facts `atpose(v8, p3)` and `supported(v8, p3, v18)` will be true. This, combined with the initial fact `type(v8, v17)`, will achieve the goal: `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`, which fulfills `new-axiom@0()`.
           *   **Final Check:** By picking the closest target, the plan is more efficient with the `move_base` action

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan and Rationale**
           
           Alright, let's take another crack at this. After carefully reviewing the provided action definitions and the constraints, I've identified the root cause of my initial error.  The mistake was in using `v3` as the base configuration in the `pick` and `place` actions. The *correct* base configuration parameter for those actions is indeed `#o3`, and I need to ensure that `#o3` is set correctly.  Initially, I was trying to shortcut things by setting `#o3` to `v3` during the `pick` and `place` steps, but that doesn't work. The plan should ensure that `#o3` is set to `v3` at the correct moment.
           
           The revised plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)** - This action activates the base configuration, allowing me to pick and place. Since  `v3` is the starting configuration and I will have a very small, zero cost move to the goal configuration which will be `#o3`.
           2.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 v32 #o3 #o4)** -  Picking up object `v8` from pose `v9`.
           3.  **(place v4 v8 p3 v32 #o3 #o4)** - Placing object `v8` at pose `p3`.
           
           The initial goal is to achieve `on(?green, v18)` given `type(?green, v17)`. The objects present are `v8` is `type(v8, v17)`, which leads to the plan to place `v8` onto pose `v18`. 
           
           Crucially, because `#o3` starts as a bconf that will also be the initial base configuration `v3`, the plan is also simple because the move_base action becomes a no-op, i.e., at no-cost, and the `kin` predicates use `#o3` as the base configuration for `v4` to interact with `v8`, as needed.
           
           Let's check the preconditions and effects.
           *   **move_base:**  It needs `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `atbconf(v3)`. It establishes `atbconf(#o3)`.
           *   **pick:** Needs `atbconf(#o3)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, and others that appear to be satisfied (kinematics, etc.). It makes `holding(v4, v8)` true.
           *   **place:** Needs `atbconf(#o3)`, `atgrasp(v4, v8, v32)`, and the other kinematics. It makes `atpose(v8, p3)` true and `handempty(v4)` true.
           
           Now, for the key point: the `--Poses--:` section should be empty. Only poses starting with '#' that are *also* explicitly involved in the initial state with a `pose(obj, #<name>)` fact need a value specified. Since `#o3` is a continuous base configuration bconf and not a pose, and isn't present in any initial `pose()` facts, there's no continuous value to specify.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Plan: Addressing the "Invalid Action: )" Error**
           
           Okay, so I got the error "invalid actions: )" before, which is really confusing. ')' isn't an action! It feels like a parsing issue, maybe a problem with the outer parentheses or how my output was interpreted. My initial plan seemed correct, with all the actions (`move_base`, `pick`, `place`) listed in the allowed format.  I meticulously re-checked each action instance against the permitted list, and *they all matched perfectly*.
           
           Let's quickly recap the plan: the robot base, currently at `v3`, needs to move to `#o3`. Then, it needs to `pick` object `v8` from pose `v9`, and finally `place` it onto `p3` (which is supported by `v18`). The initial goal state involves `v8` being `on` `v18`. 
           
           I'm confident in the logic and the actions, and the goal `on(v8, v18)` is achievable. All preconditions for each action check out, including kinematic facts, hand status, and base configuration. The robot's initial state includes the necessary supporting facts, and the actions' effects align with the goal. I'm also ensuring to follow the instruction that since `#o3` is a base configuration, not a `pose` object in the initial state, I *should not* specify a continuous value for it.
           
           Now, to minimize any chance of further errors, I'm going to pay extra-close attention to formatting and the surrounding context. I'll make sure the plan is perfectly clean and doesn't contain any extraneous characters, specifically trailing newline characters. Hopefully, that will resolve the issue. Here's the plan again:
