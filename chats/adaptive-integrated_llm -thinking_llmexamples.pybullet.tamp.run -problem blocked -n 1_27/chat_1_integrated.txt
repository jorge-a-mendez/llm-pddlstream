           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).

           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.309, 0.188, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.602, 0.798).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Core Strategy: A Detailed Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that leads to `new-axiom@0()`, essentially ensuring an object *of the correct type* is placed *on the target surface* (`v18`). The initial state provides two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that satisfy the `type` requirement. Both are candidates.
           
           My initial thought process involved considering these objects:
           `Atom type(v8, v17)` and `Atom type(v12, v17)`.
           
           Then, I must make a plan for `on(?green, v18)`.
           `Axiom on(?o: object, ?r: object)` is defined by 
           `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           After analyzing the initial state, the following facts exist:
           `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           So both are supported by the surface `v18` at pose `#o2`. The poses are unknown (which, by problem rules, means *I* need to supply values).
           `AtPose` facts are given as: `Atom atpose(v8, v9)` and `Atom atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           I must consider these facts to make it the case that the goal is true:
           `Atom stackable(v8, v18)` and `Atom stackable(v12, v18)`.
           `Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.
           `Atom atpose(v8, v9)` and `Atom atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           Therefore, placing either object onto the surface `v18` will succeed.
           
           My analysis considered the current poses of the candidates.
           Then, I noted the available arm (`v4`) and the possibility of using either `v8` or `v12`. I opted for `v8` as a possible move, because it is more accessible to the robot base configuration `v3 = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           *   **The Chosen Path: Leveraging `v8`**
           
           My chosen approach is to pick up `v8` and place it on `v18`. This involves two critical actions:
           
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)` - The robot arm `v4` picks up object `v8` from its current pose `v9` using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, trajectory `#o4`.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` - The arm places the object at pose `#o2` onto surface `v18` also using arm `v4`.
               *Here, `#o2` is the only continuous parameter that needs a value to place `v8`.*
           
           I must determine the value of the pose `#o2` for an arrangement within `v18` for `v8` using bounding box information to check that the objects do not collide.
           
           **The Continuous Parameters**
           
           *   `#o2`: The placement position of `v8` onto `v18`.
           *   `#o1`: The grasp of the arm.
           *   `v3`: The base configuration, which seems to remain fixed throughout the solution.
           *   `#o4`: The trajectory for the arm.
           
           The given continuous facts and constraints imply that both `#o3` (base configuration) and `#o4` (arm trajectory) are fixed for all actions. So, `v3` is the base for picking and placing `v8`.
           
           **Determining the Continuous Placement (`#o2`)**
           
           The goal is to provide a pose within the confines of `v18`.
           `v8` has bounding box dimensions of `0.07 x 0.07`.
           `v18` has dimensions along x of `(4.2, 4.8)` and dimensions along y of `(-0.6, 0.0)`.
           Let the object center be at `(4.5, -0.3)`. Then, the object will not collide with the surface.
           The z position will be `0.8`, based on the current height, for which the support is provided by the `supported` predicate.
           
           The value for `#o2`

           Then, I must make a plan for `on(?green, v18)`.
           `Axiom on(?o: object, ?r: object)` is defined by 
           `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           After analyzing the initial state, the following facts exist:
           `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           So both are supported by the surface `v18` at pose `#o2`. The poses are unknown (which, by problem rules, means *I* need to supply values).
           `AtPose` facts are given as: `Atom atpose(v8, v9)` and `Atom atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           I must consider these facts to make it the case that the goal is true:
           `Atom stackable(v8, v18)` and `Atom stackable(v12, v18)`.
           `Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.
           `Atom atpose(v8, v9)` and `Atom atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           Therefore, placing either object onto the surface `v18` will succeed.

           My chosen approach is to pick up `v8` and place it on `v18`. This involves two critical actions:
           
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)` - The robot arm `v4` picks up object `v8` from its current pose `v9` using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, trajectory `#o4`.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` - The arm places the object at pose `#o2` onto surface `v18` also using arm `v4`.
               *Here, `#o2` is the only continuous parameter that needs a value to place `v8`.*
           
           I must determine the value of the pose `#o2` for an arrangement within `v18` for `v8` using bounding box information to check that the objects do not collide.
           
           **The Continuous Parameters**
           
           *   `#o2`: The placement position of `v8` onto `v18`.
           *   `#o1`: The grasp of the arm.
           *   `v3`: The base configuration, which seems to remain fixed throughout the solution.
           *   `#o4`: The trajectory for the arm.
           
           The given continuous facts and constraints imply that both `#o3` (base configuration) and `#o4` (arm trajectory) are fixed for all actions. So, `v3` is the base for picking and placing `v8`.
           
           **Determining the Continuous Placement (`#o2`)**
           
           The goal is to provide a pose within the confines of `v18`.
           `v8` has bounding box dimensions of `0.07 x 0.07`.
           `v18` has dimensions along x of `(4.2, 4.8)` and dimensions along y of `(-0.6, 0.0)`.
           Let the object center be at `(4.5, -0.3)`. Then, the object will not collide with the surface.
           The z position will be `0.8`, based on the current height, for which the support is provided by the `supported` predicate.
           
           The value for `#o2`

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very specific constraint here. The user pointed out my previous plan used illegal actions, and now I'm limited to *only* one action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is essentially a "do-nothing" move, as it doesn't actually change the base's position. It might represent a very slight adjustment, but functionally, it's a no-op.
           
           Now, let's look at the goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state gives me `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`.  So, I need either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.  
           
           Breaking it down, `on(?o, ?r)` requires both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. From the initial state, I already have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This simplifies things: I just need `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           But here's the problem: `v8` is currently at `atpose(v8, v9)` and `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)`.  The only action I'm *allowed* to use is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  I can't `pick` or `place` anything, I can't `clean` or `cook` anything.  The action list I have in my toolbox is severely limited.
           
           Since I can't manipulate the objects' poses (given the action constraints), I can't possibly achieve the goal.  I can't get `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`. This is a dead end. The goal is simply unreachable with these restrictions.
