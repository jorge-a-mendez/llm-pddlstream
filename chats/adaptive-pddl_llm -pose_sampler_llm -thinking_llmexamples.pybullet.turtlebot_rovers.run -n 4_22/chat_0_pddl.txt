           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  I started by digging into the definition of this axiom, understanding its constituent parts. It boils down to a conjunction of several conditions, the key ones being `receivedimage` (multiple instances) and `receivedanalysis` (for both stone and soil types).  Initial state analysis showed that some conditions are already met, but the *crucial* ones related to images and analysis are not.
           
           My initial thought was to use actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis` to satisfy those requirements.  To achieve `send_image` and `send_analysis`, I would have used `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock`.  I planned a sequence involving calibrating the camera, taking images, sending them, sampling rocks, and sending analyses for a solution to get these predicates true.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint - Restricted Actions**
           
           Here's where things got tricky. I was then given a crucial constraint: only a very specific set of actions could be used.  I was only allowed to use `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.
           
           This restriction changes *everything*.  None of the actions required to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` (`take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are present in that small list.
           
           **Infeasibility of the Goal**
           
           With this restricted action set, it becomes immediately clear that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is unattainable. The available actions do not include the necessary actions. The goal requires achieving  `receivedimage` (by actions like `send_image`) and `receivedanalysis` (by actions like `send_analysis`).  The allowable actions cannot satisfy this.
           
           Thus, based on the provided initial state and the limited set of *permitted* actions, there is *no* plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The goal is, therefore, unreachable within the constraints given. I could spend time building a plan or a strategy, but that would be based on an assumption of actions that *are not allowed* to be performed. Thus, there is nothing more that can be built or strategized around the problem at hand, making it a problem that is impossible for me to solve.
