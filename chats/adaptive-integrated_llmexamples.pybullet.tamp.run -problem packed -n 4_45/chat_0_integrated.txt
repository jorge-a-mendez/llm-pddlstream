           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.246, -0.214, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.289, 0.957).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.238, 0.477, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.389, 0.921).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.196, -0.523, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.547, 0.837).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.046, 0.336), (0.144, 0.434)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.198, -0.263), (0.295, -0.166)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.188, 0.427), (0.287, 0.526)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.095, 0.385, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.312).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.242, -0.57), (-0.15, -0.477)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains four graspable objects (v8, v14, v16, v12) currently supported on v11. The goal is to place all four objects on v18. The robot has two arms (v4 and v6) and is currently at base configuration v3. The provided actions only include a `move_base` action that keeps the robot in the same base configuration v3, and therefore does not move the robot. This implies that the robot must be able to reach all objects from its current location to perform pick and place actions. Since no pick or place actions are provided in the list of available actions, it is impossible to move any of the objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
