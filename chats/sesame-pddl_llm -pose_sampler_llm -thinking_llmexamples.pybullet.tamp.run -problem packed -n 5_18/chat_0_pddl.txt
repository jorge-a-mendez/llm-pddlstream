(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my approach. I've got this object, ID 5, dimensions roughly 0.098 x 0.098, and a surface that's a 0.27 x 0.27 square.  The goal is 50 stable placements, meaning the object's AABB has to stay within the surface's AABB.  Since it's nearly square, I can get away with a simpler method.
           
           First, I calculate the object's effective dimensions based on the rotation angle (theta). The critical thing is that while theta covers `[0, 2*pi]` mathematically, the effective dimensions effectively repeat every `pi/2` due to the nature of `abs(cos)` and `abs(sin)`. Thus I only need a few angles. The broadest bounding box comes at 45 degrees, but it's still small enough to fit within the surface. I will use angles `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2` to get a good range.
           
           I then calculate the valid x, y ranges for each `theta`, ensuring the object's center stays far enough from the surface edges. I get those effective dimensions for each `theta` and use them to determine the valid range of x and y.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll use 5 thetas and 10 pairs of (x,y) points for each, making sure they are distributed across the allowable space for each.
           
           I've got the code ready to go. I just need to feed it those surface and object dimensions. The method guarantees all placements will be stable.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, avoiding any collisions with the already-placed object ID 5.  This is a spatial reasoning problem, and I've got a plan.
           
           First, let's understand the scene.  Surface 0 is a square,  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Object 5 is currently in the bottom-left corner with coordinates close to `(-0.086, -0.086)`.  The dimensions of object 4,  `size_x = 0.09713000792959539`, and `size_y = 0.09713000792959536`, are very similar to Object 5.
           
           My strategy hinges on calculating the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of Object 5, which defines the "forbidden zone" for Object 4. To do that, I'll calculate `effective_width`, `effective_height` for different `theta` values. Then calculate `half_ew`, `half_eh`. I'll also calculate the valid surface ranges for x and y which I will use to make sure that the object is within surface bounds.
           
           The critical collision avoidance logic is: the `x` or `y` coordinates of object 4 *must be outside* the AABB of Object 5.  In other words, a placement is valid only if, after the transformation with given `theta`, the effective AABB (or the center of Object 4) does not overlap. I'll need to define the proper coordinates, within those bounds.
           I'll begin by focusing on two clear zones: *to the right* of Object 5, and *above* Object 5.
           
           For collision avoidance,  `(x_upper <= O5_lower_x` OR `x_lower >= O5_upper_x)` OR
           `(y_upper <= O5_lower_y` OR `y_lower >= O5_upper_y)`
           Let's name this for clarity
           O5_lower_x = -0.135
           O5_upper_x = -0.036645235446524475
           O5_lower_y = -0.135
           O5_upper_y = -0.03664523544652445
           
           This translates to `[ O5_upper_x + half_ew]` OR `[O5_upper_y + half_eh]`
           
           In practice, I'll define these regions as ranges that do not collide with object 5.
           I'll then determine the region from the surface borders.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll use 5 different `theta` values:  0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.  I'll perform the following steps for each:
           
           1.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** Determine the effective width and height of Object 4 for each `theta` by using trigonometry.
           2.  **Surface Bounds:** Calculate the valid ranges for the center coordinates (x and y) of Object 4, respecting the surface boundaries.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance (Key Step):**  *Adjust* the valid x and y ranges to exclude any overlaps with Object 5.  I'll ensure that at least one of these conditions is true: the center of the object (with the appropriate `half_ew`, `half_eh`) is to the *right* of the right edge of Object 5 OR the center is *above* Object 5.
           4.  **Sampling and Selection**: Now, for each `theta`, I'll create a grid (10x10) for x and y placements that are suitable. I will create the list of candidate placements. For each (x, y) combination, I will check whether it satisfies the previous calculations to assure a placement that avoids collision. Finally I take 10 unique positions. I might take points from outside Object 5 (top-right), or to the right of it.
           
           For this I will use `np.linspace` to create 10 samples for x and y. Then I'll filter these samples for collision by making sure one of the two conditions is valid.
           
           I'll check a few example cases with different `theta`.
           
           Finally, I will test and make sure that there are exactly 50 total placements,

(Thoughts: **My Goal: Find 50 stable placements for Object 6 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects.**
           
           I'm tackling this by first understanding the constraints: Object 6's size and the shape/size of Surface 0. I also need to account for Objects 4 and 5, which are already in place and represent obstacles.
           
           **My Approach:**
           
           1.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** I'll determine how Object 6's apparent size and shape (its AABB) changes with different rotations (theta). I already know its base dimensions, but rotations require calculating "effective width" and "effective height" using the formula:
               *   `ew_6(theta) = size_x_6 * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y_6 * abs(sin(theta))`
               *   `eh_6(theta) = size_x_6 * abs(sin(theta)) + size_y_6 * abs(cos(theta))`
           
               These are identical since the object is a square; `ew_6` and `eh_6` change smoothly with rotations.
           
           2.  **Determine Valid Placement Zones:** I'll establish the valid ranges for the center point of Object 6 on Surface 0, keeping it fully contained and within the surface boundaries.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** Crucially, I must check if any candidate placement collides with Objects 4 and 5. I will do this by analyzing the AABBs of these obstacles, comparing the regions they occupy in the plane.
           
           4.  **Sampling and Filtering:** I'll generate numerous candidate center points, making sure to spread them across possible placements.
               *   I'll generate evenly spaced points along each axis (x and y) for each rotation (theta) of the object.
               *   Then, I'll filter these candidates, keeping only those that:
                   *   Are within the valid surface range for their given theta.
                   *   Do not collide with the AABB's of objects 4 or 5 at the given position and angle.
           
           5.  **Placement Selection:** Finally, I'll select 10 unique placements for each of the 5 rotations, and these should be spread out to cover the possible locations.
           
           **Specific Implementation:**
           I will set up the search with 20 points in each axis of each object, ensuring enough overlap for collision evaluation. The code generates candidate placement points for Object 6 on the surface 0 at the various rotations (theta). The final set contains 50 collision-free placements on the object.
