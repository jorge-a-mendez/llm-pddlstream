User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` which represents a complex goal involving multiple subgoals:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 must be at configuration v13.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 must be at configuration v15.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Storage v16 on rover v12 must be free.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Storage v16 on rover v14 must be free.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 must be received with mode v11.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 must be received with mode v11.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type v2 must be analyzed and the analysis received.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type v6 must be analyzed and the analysis received.
           
           Let's analyze the initial state and available actions:
           
           *   **Current Rover States:**
               *   `v12` is `atconf(v12, v13)` and `free(v12, v16)`.
               *   `v14` is `atconf(v14, v15)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
               These conditions for `atconf` and `free` are already met in the initial state.
           
           *   **Objectives:**
               *   `v17` and `v18` are objectives.
               *   `v10` is a camera, `v11` is a mode, `v10` is `onboard` `v12` and `v14`, and `supports` `v10, v11`.
               *   Both `v12` and `v14` can image `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
               *   Both `v12` and `v14` can communicate with lander `v9` at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           *   **Rocks:**
               *   Rocks with `type v2`: `v1`, `v4`, `v3`.
               *   Rocks with `type v6`: `v8`, `v5`, `v7`.
               *   Both `v12` and `v14` are `above` all rocks at configuration `#o5`.
               *   `v16` is a store.
           
           *   **Actions:**
               *   `move` actions are available for both rovers to move to their current configurations, which doesn't change their state relevant to `atconf`. No other `move` actions are given, implying no new configurations for movement.
               *   `take_image`: Requires `calibrated(camera, rover)`. No cameras are calibrated initially.
               *   `calibrate`: Requires `imagevisible` and `atconf`. Both rovers can calibrate `v10` to `v17` or `v18`.
               *   `send_image`: Requires `haveimage(rover, objective, mode)`. No images are taken initially.
               *   `sample_rock`: Requires `above(rover, conf, rock)` and `free(rover, store)`. Both rovers can sample all rocks.
               *   `send_analysis`: Requires `analyzed(rover, rock)`. No rocks are analyzed initially.
               *   `drop_rock`: Requires `full(rover, store)`. Both rovers' stores are free.
           
           **Plan Construction:**
           
           The goal requires receiving images of `v17` and `v18` (objective `v17`, `v18` of type `v2` and `v6` are not given. `v17` and `v18` are objectives, so their `type` is not relevant for `receivedimage`). It also requires receiving analysis of a rock of `type v2` and a rock of `type v6`.
           
           Let's break down the necessary steps:
           
           1.  **Received Images:**
               *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
                   *   Calibrate a camera (e.g., `v10` with `v12` for `v17`).
                   *   Take an image of `v17` with `v10` using `v12`.
                   *   Send the image from `v12` to `v9`.
               *   To get `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
                   *   Calibrate a camera (e.g., `v10` with `v14` for `v18`).
                   *   Take an image of `v18` with `v10` using `v14`.
                   *   Send the image from `v14` to `v9`.
           
           2.  **Received Analyses:**
               *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` where `type(?stone, v2)`:
                   *   Sample a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v1`, `v4`, or `v3`) with either rover (e.g., `v12` samples `v3`).
                   *   Send the analysis from that rover (`v12`) to `v9`.
               *   To get `receivedanalysis(?soil)` where `type(?soil, v6)`:
                   *   Sample a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v8`, `v5`, or `v7`) with either rover (e.g., `v14` samples `v7`).
                   *   Send the analysis from that rover (`v14`) to `v9`.
           
           The configurations `v13` and `v15` for the rovers are already satisfied, as are the `free` states of the stores.
           
           Let's try to use rover `v12` for `v17` and a type `v2` rock, and rover `v14` for `v18` and a type `v6` rock.
           
           *   **Rover v12 actions:**
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v17` at `#o3`.
               *   Take image of `v17` with `v10` from `v12` at `#o3`.
               *   Send image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` at `#o0`.
               *   Sample `v3` (type `v2`) with `v12` at `#o5`.
               *   Send analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` at `#o0`.
           
           *   **Rover v14 actions:**
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v18` at `#o3`.
               *   Take image of `v18` with `v10` from `v14` at `#o3`.
               *   Send image of `v18` from `v14` to `v9` at `#o0`.
               *   Sample `v7` (type `v6`) with `v14` at `#o5`.
               *   Send analysis of `v7` from `v14` to `v9` at `#o0`.
           
           All `move` actions are provided as moving to the current configuration, so they don't help change the robot's location. The configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are given in the initial state and are assumed to be reachable from the rovers' current configurations for the specific predicates they are used in. The ray visibility is handled by the continuous parameter calculation.
           
           The plan will utilize the given configurations and actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16) , (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3) , (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided valid actions are:
           *   `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Rover v12 moves from configuration v13 to v13. This action doesn't change the state of `atconf(v12, v13)`, which is already true.
           *   `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Rover v14 moves from configuration v15 to v15. This action doesn't change the state of `atconf(v14, v15)`, which is already true.
           *   `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Rover v12 drops a rock from store v16. Precondition: `full(v12, v16)`. Currently, `free(v12, v16)` is true, so this action is not applicable.
           *   `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Rover v14 drops a rock from store v16. Precondition: `full(v14, v16)`. Currently, `free(v14, v16)` is true, so this action is not applicable.
           
           The goal requires:
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` (True in initial state)
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)` (True in initial state)
           3.  `free(v12, v16)` (True in initial state)
           4.  `free(v14, v16)` (True in initial state)
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7.  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           8.  `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The only available actions are `move` actions that don't change the rovers' configurations and `drop_rock` actions which are not applicable because the stores are currently free. None of the available actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve these, actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are required, but they are not in the list of valid actions for this particular problem.
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of valid actions.
