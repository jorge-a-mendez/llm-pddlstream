           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.259, -0.351), (-0.169, -0.262)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.038, -0.316), (0.061, -0.217)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.2, -0.227), (0.297, -0.13)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.214, -0.307, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.167).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.011, -0.267, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.386, 0.923).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, -0.178, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.956, 0.293).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on object v16. Currently, v8 is on v11 at pose v9, v12 is on v11 at pose v13, and v14 is on v11 at pose v15. The robot arm v4 is at configuration v5 and the base is at configuration v3. Both arms are empty. Object v16 is a small surface (0.27 x 0.27). Object v11 is a large surface (0.6 x 1.2). The other objects v10 is also a large surface (size not provided, but indicated to be large by the stackable predicate). The robot needs to pick up each object from its current location and place it onto v16. Since there's only one arm available for this, and the goal requires all three objects to be on v16, we need to pick and place each object individually. The continuous parameter #o2 is a pose on v16 which can be used for placing all three objects. Since v16 is small, we'll need to choose different placements for each object on v16 to avoid collisions between the objects themselves.
           
           First, we will pick up v14 from v15 (on v11) and place it on v16 at a new pose, #o2_v14.
           Then, we will pick up v8 from v9 (on v11) and place it on v16 at a new pose, #o2_v8.
           Finally, we will pick up v12 from v13 (on v11) and place it on v16 at a new pose, #o2_v12.

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on object v16. Currently, v8 is on v11 at pose v9, v12 is on v11 at pose v13, and v14 is on v11 at pose v15.

Since v16 is small, we'll need to choose different placements for each object on v16 to avoid collisions between the objects themselves.
           
           The previous attempt failed because the chosen poses for v8 and v12 on v16 were not stable. Let's re-evaluate the bounding boxes and choose new stable poses within v16.
           
           v16 AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) (width 0.27, height 0.27)
           v11 AABB: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))
           
           Object AABBs:
           v11: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))
           v8: ((-0.259, -0.351), (-0.169, -0.262)) - This is its initial pose, the object itself has a bounding box. The actual object dimensions are not explicitly given, so I will assume that the AABB values provided for the object in the initial state are the object's dimensions relative to its own center. Let's assume the effective size of the object v8 is around 0.09 x 0.089.
           v16: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           v14: ((-0.038, -0.316), (0.061, -0.217)) - Assuming dimensions 0.099 x 0.099.
           v12: ((0.2, -0.227), (0.297, -0.13)) - Assuming dimensions 0.097 x 0.097.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           Let's try to place them in a line on v16, making sure they fit within the surface.
           The center of v16 is (0, 0).
           v16 ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           
           Assuming object sizes are roughly 0.1 x 0.1 for v8, v12, v14.
           We can place them at:
           v14: (0.0, 0.0) -> (center of v16)
           v8: (-0.08, 0.0) -> offset to the left
           v12: (0.08, 0.0) -> offset to the right
           
           Let's try these new poses.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v30) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on object v16. Currently, v8 is on v11 at pose v9, v12 is on v11 at pose v13, and v14 is on v11 at pose v15. The robot arm v4 is at configuration v5 and the base is at configuration v3. Both arms are empty. Object v16 is a small surface (0.27 x 0.27). Object v11 is a large surface (0.6 x 1.2). The robot needs to pick up each object from its current location and place it onto v16.
           
           The previous plan failed because the `atbconf` precondition was not satisfied. This means that the base configuration `v30` was expected, but the robot's base was at `v3`. The `kin` predicates in the initial state connect the pick/place actions with specific base configurations. All `kin` predicates in the initial state for arm `v4` use the base configuration `#o3`. Therefore, before any `pick` or `place` action, the robot's base must be at `#o3`. The initial `atbconf` is `v3`. We need to insert a `move_base` action to move the robot from `v3` to `#o3` before the first `pick` action. Since the `kin` facts are all tied to `#o3`, we only need to move the base once. After placing the last object, we could move back to `v3`, but it's not strictly necessary for the goal.
           
           The objects will be placed on v16 using different regions of v16 to avoid collisions.
           v16 AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) (width 0.27, height 0.27)
           Let's keep the object dimensions around 0.1x0.1.
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           Proposed placements:
           v14: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) - centered
           v8: (-0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) - left of center
           v12: (0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) - right of center
           
           These positions should ensure that the objects (assuming 0.1x0.1) are within the bounds of v16 (0.27x0.27). For example, v8 at (-0.08, 0.0) would occupy from (-0.08-0.05, 0.0-0.05) to (-0.08+0.05, 0.0+0.05), which is (-0.13, -0.05) to (-0.03, 0.05). This is within the -0.135 to 0.135 range for v16.
