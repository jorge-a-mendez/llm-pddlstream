           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on(v18)`.  I see that they're currently on `v11`.  My initial thought is to break this down. For each object, like `v8`, to be `on(v18)`, it needs to be *supported* by some pose on `v18` and *at* that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that `v8` is currently supported by pose `v9` on `v11`. There's also a `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` fact, which means `#o2` is a valid pose for `v8` on `v18`.  So, the task seems to involve moving `v8` from pose `v9` on `v11` to the pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Now, the crucial point:  the *only* available action is `move_base`.  There are no `pick` or `place` actions allowed.  This is a big problem.  To move `v8` (or any of the other objects) from `v11` to `v18`, I would need to pick them up and place them down.  I've confirmed that the same logic applies to `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. They're also currently on `v11`, with valid poses on `v18`, but I lack the means to move them.
           
           Essentially, I need to get each object `atpose(#o2)` where `#o2` is a pose supported by `v18`. I see that the `atpose` facts directly relate to the initial positions, namely all the object's `atpose` fact relates to their respective position on `v11`.  Since I only have `move_base`, I can only change my own configuration, not the objects' configurations. Therefore, the goal is simply unreachable with the provided action set. I'm essentially stuck because I can't manipulate the objects themselves. I'm limited to moving my base configuration which is not helpful in this situation.
