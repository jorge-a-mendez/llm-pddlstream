           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.412, -0.33, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.842, 0.539).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).

           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan**
           
           I'm aiming to achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which simplifies to `on(v12, v18)`.  This means placing object `v12` on object `v18`.  From the initial state, I know that object `v12` is of type `v17` and that I have the information `type(v12,v17)`, so there are no further implications from this axiom.
           
           To do this, I need `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. From the given state, I know that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which implies I need to achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13`.  My plan involves two steps:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to grasp `v12` from its current location, `v13`. The `pick` action requires the robot arm `v4`, object `v12`, the current pose of the object `v13`, and some supporting parameters `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`. Crucially, I have to ensure the preconditions of pick are met, especially the absence of `unsafeapproach` and `unsafeatraj`, which I'll assume are true since I do not have a more specific predicate like `cfreeapproachpose`.
           2.  **Place:** Use the `place` action to put `v12` at the target pose `#o2`. This, too, has preconditions, most importantly the absence of `unsafepose`, `unsafeapproach`, and `unsafeatraj`.
           
           For the continuous values, the crucial element is determining an appropriate pose for `v12` when placed on `v18` (`#o2`). I will assume the robot arm is not moving and that it is already in the correct location (`#o3`).
           
           I've carefully considered the dimensions of `v18` to find a safe and feasible position. I choose a continuous parameter such that `v12`'s position on `v18` is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Regarding costs, the `move_base` action would cost 0 because I assume the base doesn't have to move. So, the total cost for the plan is just the `pick` and `place` cost, which I assume to be 1 each.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: An Impossible Plan**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed because it required `atbconf(#o3)`, and that wasn't true in the initial state. Let's dig deeper.
           
           The initial state is pretty sparse when it comes to the robot's base configuration.  I see `canmove()`, indicating the robot *could* move, and the arm configurations are explicitly stated as well. However, crucially,  `atbconf(#o3)` is absent. That means the robot isn't *at* base configuration `#o3` initially. The presence of `bconf(#o3)` only tells us that `#o3` *is* a valid base configuration.
           
           Now, looking at the `pick` and `place` actions, they both *need* `atbconf(?q)`.  Where `?q` is `#o3` in my situation.  The *only* way to make `atbconf(#o3)` true, without some implicit understanding of the scenario, is via the `move_base` action.
           
           But here's the kicker: the only `move_base` action available, `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`, *requires* `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition!  So, to move *to* `#o3`, the robot must *already* be at `#o3`.  This is a circular dependency.
           
           Let's remember the crucial problem statement point: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*".  If `atbconf(#o3)` isn't there, it's *false*. And there's no way to establish that fact given the available actions.
           
           I re-read the part about continuous parameters (`#` objects).  `#o3` *is* a continuous parameter, a base configuration. But that doesn't implicitly make `atbconf(#o3)` true.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is that there's no way to *get* the robot to a known `atbconf`. In a usual setting, it's implicitly true, that the robot starts at one. But because `atbconf(#o3)` is explicitly *false*, and there's no available action to reach it, the `pick` and `place` actions cannot be executed. The `move_base` is also useless because it needs `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Therefore, under a strict reading of the initial state, the goal is *unreachable*. I've verified that the goal requires actions like `pick` and `place`, and these actions' preconditions cannot be established. No matter what I try, the circular dependency on `atbconf(#o3)` is a roadblock.  The problem appears to be unsolvable as given. I'm sure it's an oversight. I would request a re-interpretation of the initial state to consider an implicit `atbconf`, to achieve the solution.
