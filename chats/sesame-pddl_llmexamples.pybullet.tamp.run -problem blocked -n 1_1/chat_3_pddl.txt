           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are initially empty. There are two graspable and stackable objects, `v12` and `v15`. `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and supported by `v11`. Both `v12` and `v15` can be placed on `v10` at pose `#o2`. `v12` can also be placed on `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, is equivalent to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)`. This means we need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The `on(v12, v18)` axiom states that `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. From the initial state, we have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. Therefore, to achieve the goal, we need to make `atpose(v12, #o2)` true.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13` (`atpose(v12, v13)`). So, we need to pick up `v12` from `v13` and then place it at `#o2`.
           
           Looking at the available actions, we have:
           1. `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`: This allows picking `v12` from `v13`.
           2. `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`: This allows placing `v12` at `#o2`.
           
           The preconditions for `pick` are met: `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is true, `atpose(v12, v13)` is true, `handempty(v4)` is true, `atbconf(#o3)` is true, and there are no unsafe conditions related to `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj`.
           
           After picking, `v4` will be holding `v12`. Then, for `place` to be executed, its preconditions must be met: `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is true, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` will be true (from the pick action), `atbconf(#o3)` is true, and there are no unsafe conditions related to `unsafepose`, `unsafeapproach`, or `unsafeatraj`. These conditions are met.
           
           Therefore, the plan is to pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I overlooked that the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition for `pick` might not be directly satisfied if the robot needs to move its base first. However, in this specific case, `atbconf(#o3)` *is* explicitly stated in the initial state indirectly via `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` and the fact that there are no `atbconf` predicates in the initial state, implying that the robot is at `atbconf(#o3)` by default if no other base configuration is mentioned. Let's re-examine the initial state for `atbconf`.
           
           The initial state does not explicitly state `atbconf(#o3)`. However, the `kin` and `basemotion` predicates involve `#o3`. In PDDL, if a fact is not explicitly stated, it is considered false. Therefore, `atbconf(#o3)` is not true initially.
           
           The only action that can achieve `atbconf(?q2)` is `move_base(?q1, ?q2, ?t)`. For this, we need `atbconf(?q1)`. Since no `atbconf` is given in the initial state, it means the robot is not at any known base configuration. This situation indicates that the planning problem is ill-posed or that there's an implicit initial base configuration not explicitly stated in the provided PDDL facts.
           
           Given the available actions, `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` suggests that the robot *can* move to `#o3` (or effectively confirm it's at `#o3` if it's already there). If we assume the robot starts at `#o3` by virtue of it being the only `bconf` mentioned in context of `kin` and `basemotion`, then my previous plan would be valid. However, if we strictly adhere to the "not explicitly stated means false" rule, then `atbconf(#o3)` is false.
           
           If `atbconf(#o3)` is false, and there's no `atbconf(?q)` for any `?q` in the initial state, then `move_base` cannot be executed because its precondition `atbconf(?q1)` would never be met. This would make the entire goal unreachable, as `pick` and `place` both require `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the initial state more carefully for `atbconf`. The initial state *does not* contain `atbconf(#o3)`. This means the robot's base configuration is unknown or not set. Without an initial `atbconf` and without an action to achieve an initial `atbconf` state (like moving from an unstated configuration to a known one), no actions requiring `atbconf` can be taken.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable under the strict interpretation of PDDL initial states where unstated facts are false.
           
           The initial state lists `bconf(#o3)`. This means `#o3` is a base configuration, but not necessarily that the robot *is at* that configuration. There is no `atbconf(?q)` in the initial state.
           
           Given the provided actions and initial state, no plan can be formed because the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) is not initialized, and there is no action to initialize it. The `move_base` action requires an existing `atbconf` to move from.
           
           If I *must* provide a plan, there is an implicit assumption being missed about the initial `atbconf`. Assuming `atbconf(#o3)` is true initially for the sake of generating a plan (which contradicts strict PDDL interpretation, but is often a practical assumption in such cases where the initial `atbconf` is the same as the `bconf` for the `kin` actions). If this assumption is made, then my previous plan stands.
           
           However, since I was corrected, I must adhere strictly. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The robot is not at any base configuration, i.e., `atbconf(?q)` is false for all `?q`. The `pick` and `place` actions require `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition. The `move_base` action requires `atbconf(?q1)` as a precondition to change the base configuration. Since no `atbconf` fact is true in the initial state, no action that requires `atbconf` can be executed. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
