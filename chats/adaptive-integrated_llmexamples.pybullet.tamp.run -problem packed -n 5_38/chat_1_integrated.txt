           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.191, 0.402, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.391, 0.92).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).

           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, -0.317), (-0.185, -0.229)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.022, -0.468), (0.098, -0.392)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.007, -0.297), (0.105, -0.199)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.241, 0.353), (-0.142, 0.452)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.015, 0.323, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.858, 0.513).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.229, -0.273, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.154, 0.988).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.06, -0.43, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.047).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.056, -0.248, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.945, -0.328).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) that are currently on a surface (v11) and need to be moved to another surface (v20). The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), but only arm v4 seems to have valid kinematics defined for picking and placing the objects. All objects are graspable.
           
           The goal is to move all five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) to be `on` the surface `v20`. This requires picking each object from its current pose and placing it on a new pose on `v20`. There are several continuous parameters (#o0, #o1, #o2, #o3, #o4) that need to be determined. #o0 is a base motion trajectory, #o1 is a grasp, #o2 is a pose, #o3 is a base configuration, and #o4 is an arm trajectory.
           
           Given the initial state, the robot arm `v4` is `handempty` and `ataconf(v4, v5)`. The base is `atbconf(v3)`. The only available `move_base` action is from `v3` to `v3`, which means the base will not move during the task. This implies that all pick and place operations must be reachable from base configuration `v3`.
           
           The objects are currently at the following poses:
           - `v8` at `v9` (on `v11`)
           - `v12` at `v13` (on `v11`)
           - `v14` at `v15` (on `v11`)
           - `v16` at `v17` (on `v11`)
           - `v18` at `v19` (on `v11`)
           
           For each object, we need to:
           1. Pick the object from its current pose.
           2. Place the object at a new pose on `v20`.
           
           Since the `kin` predicates involve `#o1` (grasp), `#o2` (target pose on `v20`), `#o3` (base conf), and `#o4` (arm traj), these continuous parameters will be used for each pick and place operation. The given `kin` facts are for arm `v4`, with `bconf #o3` and `atraj #o4`. It is also given `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`. Since the base won't move, we will use `v3` for `#o3` and the given `#o0` for the base trajectory if `move_base` is needed (though it isn't relevant to pick/place here).
           
           The objects' bounding boxes are:
           - `v11`: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))
           - `v20`: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) (This appears to be a smaller surface, potentially a tray or a smaller table. The objects will need to be placed within these bounds).
           
           Let's assume a generic grasp `#o1` and arm trajectory `#o4` can be computed by the TAMP solver. We need to find collision-free poses for each object on `v20`. Given that `v20` is centered around (0,0), and has a size of 0.27x0.27, we can place the objects around its center to ensure they are `supported`. The current poses are already provided for the pick actions, and we will use those. The place poses will be `#o2` for each object, and we need to provide a value for `#o2` for each object. We need to ensure that the poses are within the bounds of `v20` and do not collide with each other.
           
           To place multiple objects on `v20` without collision, we can arrange them in a small grid or line within `v20`'s bounding box. For simplicity, I'll place them slightly offset from each other on `v20`. The objects are small enough to fit.
           
           Let's try picking and placing the objects one by one:
           1. `v8` from `v9` to a pose on `v20`.
           2. `v12` from `v13` to a pose on `v20`.
           3. `v14` from `v15` to a pose on `v20`.
           4. `v16` from `v17` to a pose on `v20`.
           5. `v18` from `v19` to a pose on `v20`.
           
           The continuous parameters `kin` predicates for placement on `#o2` for all objects use the same `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4`. This is a simplification; in a real setting, these would be recomputed for each pick/place. However, following the problem statement, we must use the provided `kin` facts.
           
           I will use five distinct values for `#o2` for each object being placed on `v20`.
           The `bconf #o3` will be set to `v3` since `kin` facts state `kin(v4, ..., #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `atbconf(v3)` is true.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan was invalid because it attempted to use pick and place actions, but these actions were not present in the list of valid action instances. The only valid action instance provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           This means that the robot can only move its base from `v3` to `v3` using a trajectory `#o0`. It cannot perform any pick, place, clean, or cook actions.
           
           The goal is to have `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`. This requires physically moving objects from their current location (`v11`) to `v20`. Since there are no pick or place actions available, and the `move_base` action doesn't manipulate objects, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given valid actions.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
