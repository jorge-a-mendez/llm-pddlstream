(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a nearly square object on a rectangular surface. A stable placement means the object, after rotation, fits completely within the surface bounds. I know the object's dimensions and the surface's dimensions, allowing me to calculate the object's effective size after rotation.
           
           The key is that for a nearly square object, the bounding box size remains almost the same across various rotations. The widest possible box is attained at pi/4 (45 degrees), and, although I check that, I decide to focus on aligning the object with the main axes, which is enough to provide the needed coverage of the surface and its rotations.
           
           I chose a simple strategy: to focus on two distinct rotations for the object: 0 and pi/2 radians. Then, I generate a 5x5 grid of positions for the object's center within the valid surface bounds for each rotation. This creates a balanced distribution of placements and ensures full coverage of the surface at the two orientations. For `theta = 0`: the grid is [-0.086, -0.043, 0, 0.043, 0.086] and a similar grid is used for `theta = pi/2`. This combined approach should generate the 50 unique positions. This method ensures coverage in different orientations and locations, ensuring a diverse and stable set of placements.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 4: A Collision-Free Strategy**
           
           Alright, I've got a new request: place object ID 4 on surface 0, and importantly, avoid colliding with the already-placed object ID 5. I need to generate 50 stable placements. I've got the object geometry details, the surface boundaries, and the placement of object 5. Let's break this down.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 4 is a square with a known width and height, as is object 5. Object 5 is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface. Surface 0 is a square as well.
           
           I’ve calculated the dimensions of the bounding boxes for object 4 and object 5, and I understand that I need to ensure they don't overlap. I know that for valid placements of object 4, the center must be inside surface bounds while keeping clear of the placement of object 5.
           
           Now for the logic, I have to ensure object 4 *either* sits to the right of object 5 or is positioned above it. Therefore, I've calculated the boundaries of the non-colliding regions. It's essentially the whole surface bounding box excluding a rectangle with a corner in the bottom-left.
           
           I need 50 valid placements, so I’ll generate a 5x5 grid inside of a region (Region 1). This is the area where object 4 will exist *exclusively* to the right of object 5.  Then, I'll generate a 5x5 grid (Region 2) in the area above object 5 but not to the right. To ensure that placements do not overlap I'm using the surface collision limits as boundaries.
           
           I can do this, the algorithm will generate 50 unique placements that meet the requirements. It’s critical I use a proper grid step here, or I will end up with overlaps, and therefore collisions. Finally, the surface index is always 0, and rotation is consistently 0.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 6) on surface 0, ensuring that no collisions occur with two previously positioned objects, object 5 and object 4. I'm operating within a defined surface area, with dimensions of `[-0.135, 0.135]` in both the x and y directions.
           
           First, I established the bounding boxes of the existing objects. Object 5 is located at approximately `(-0.086, -0.086)` with a bounding box of `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.038, -0.038)]`. Object 4 is located at about `(0.012, -0.086)`, with a bounding box of `[(-0.038, -0.135), (0.061, -0.036)]`. The key observation here is that Object 4's bounding box is directly adjacent to Object 5's, forming a combined area.
           
           Given object 6's near-square shape, I simplified the analysis by considering only rotations of 0 and 90 degrees. I calculated the half-extents to be approximately 0.047. I then calculated the boundaries of valid placement for object 6 within the constraints of the surface and avoiding collisions. The combined area occupied by objects 4 and 5 is, in effect, a new bounding box.
           
           My analysis revealed that the available space for object 6 is primarily above the occupied region, because any attempt to place object 6 to the right of the occupied region results in overlap. The combined AABB of the two placed items, combined with the surface dimensions, essentially splits the surface into two regions. 
           
           The primary valid placement area for object 6 center is a rectangle above the existing objects. 
           
           With `theta = 0`, I found the center coordinates `(x, y)` have valid ranges as follows. 
           For X: `[-0.088, 0.088]`
           For Y: `[0.011, 0.088]`
           
           I'm confident that 50 evenly spaced placements can be generated inside the determined rectangle in the top region. I decided on a grid for my 50 placements of 5 rows and 10 columns. I have to apply my collision checks to ensure that they are valid.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, the task is clear. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 4, 5, and 6. I know object 7 is nearly square, so I'll stick with no rotation (theta = 0) to keep things simple and maximize the available area.  I’ve crunched the numbers: object 7's half-extents, the surface dimensions, and the existing object positions are all known.
           
           My strategy involves:
           
           1.  Determining the valid center range for object 7 on the surface, ignoring other objects.
           2.  Defining the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects 4, 5, and 6.
           3.  Visualizing the occupied regions and finding "safe" regions where object 7 can be placed without collision.
           4.  Implementing a robust collision check function to evaluate potential placements.
           
           **Identifying Valid Placement Regions**
           
           I started by calculating the valid center ranges on the surface for object 7, if there were no obstacles. Then, I calculated the AABBs of the three existing objects to visually map their layout. I can clearly see the “L-shape” formed by the objects. The “L” shape means that simple safe boxes won’t work, so I have to calculate.
           
           I identified the combined “bottom” region and the “left-middle” region and use those. I need to find points in the surface that are outside those regions to avoid collision. I calculated the collision regions for each individual object and then took the complement of those. I can create a robust collision-checking function to filter out these invalid options.
           
           **Calculating a Safe, Contiguous Region (Region A)**
           
           After checking to the right of all the objects, I realized it won’t fit. The most straightforward free region is:
           *   The top right part of the surface where `y_c7 - hh7 >= Combined_bottom_max_y` AND `x_c7 - hw7 >= Combined_left_max_x`.
           
           **Refining the Approach - Checking the Collision**
           
           The previous approach to find a large empty region didn't fully work, so I'm now taking a different angle. I’ll make a denser grid and check each potential center point against the AABBs of objects 4, 5, and 6. For a point to be valid, `(xc7 + hw7 < x_min_i)` or `(xc7 - hw7 > x_max_i)` or `(yc7 + hh7 < y_min_i)` or `(yc7 - hh7 > y_max_i)` must be true for all i in `{4, 5, 6}`.
           
           I now have a region which has:
           `x_A_min = -0.00127346742419358`
           `x_A_max = 0.09506870142859038`
           `y_A_min = 0.00362707814780485`
           `y_A_max = 0.09506870142859037`
           I am going to make a 10x5 grid and test if they collide by hand to verify this approach.
