(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, size 0.09897...) on a surface. This surface is defined by an AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135) -- I'll call it surface 0.  Since the object is square, the rotation angle `theta` doesn't affect the size of its bounding box.  I need to find `surf_idx`, `theta`, `x`, and `y` for 50 placements.  For a square, theta can be any value, as the AABB will remain the same.
           
           The surface is centered at (0,0). To be stable and contained, the object's center (x, y) must stay within a smaller square defined by the surface bounds minus half the object's size.  After calculating the bounds (-0.0855..., 0.0855...) for both x and y.
           
           So, I'll generate a grid of points within that smaller square. A 7x7 grid gives 49 points.  I can use a 7x7 grid and simply add the very center `(0.0, 0.0)` for a 50th placement.
           
           The step size for x and y will be the width of the valid range (0.1710...) divided by 6 (for a 7x7 grid, i.e., 6 steps).  This gives me a step size of roughly 0.0285.  I'll start at the minimum x and y bounds and step by that amount to create the grid coordinates.  Rotation is 0 for all points.  
           
           I will generate a grid of points within the valid area, all with `theta=0`. For the 50th placement, I'll take the very center (0,0) with a theta of pi/4, because it's square and rotation does not affect the AABB, so I can use it.  Now, I have my solution: 49 grid points + the central point, all with stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Collision Avoidance Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We've got a new object, ID 4, that needs to be placed on a surface without colliding with a pre-existing object, ID 5. We've got confirmed feedback indicating the placement of ID 5, at `(0, 0.0, -0.08551160797121375, -0.08551160797121375)`, did *not* collide, but that's irrelevant here since this is a new object request. So, for Object 4, it's all about avoiding the existing object and staying within the surface bounds.
           
           The surface is defined by the AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Object 5's size is `size_x = 0.09897678405757249`, `size_y = 0.09897678405757249`, and it's already in the scene. I calculated its AABB to be `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.036023215942427505, -0.036023215942427505))`. Object 4 is almost the same size (`size_x = 0.09819607829524213`, `size_y = 0.09819607829524207`).
           
           My strategy is as follows:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** Object 4's center must be within the valid x and y range on the surface, which is approximately `-0.086` to `0.086`.
           
           2.  **Collision Avoidance with Object 5:** I've meticulously calculated the non-colliding zone to the *right* and *above* the existing object's AABB. Since Object 5's position is fixed, I can calculate a safe zone.
           
               *   To be safe, Object 4's center *must* be greater than `0.01307482320519356` in the x direction and `0.01307482320519353` in the y direction to avoid collision.
           
               *   I'll generate several placements within a grid in the upper-right quadrant, as this area is guaranteed to be non-colliding.
           
           I've generated a grid of `8x8` points (64 points in total)  for placement `(x, y)` from `x = [0.01307482320519356 to 0.08590196085237893]`, and `y = [0.01307482320519353 to 0.08590196085237893]`. This grid, with a spacing of about `0.01`, ensures that I will have more than enough candidate placements that are collision free and are guaranteed to be within the bounds of the surface.  This should provide a good range of placements while avoiding collisions.  Rotation will be set to 0.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I've got to find 50 spots to put this new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, and *avoid* hitting the two other things already there (IDs 4 and 5).  I've got the size and location data for everything.  Surface 0 is a square, and I need to make sure the new object's center stays *inside* that square when placing.
           
           First, I looked at where the object's center *must* be to fit on the surface, taking into account its half-extents.  Then, I determined that, I need to prevent collisions and I need to determine the area that's *already* occupied. I created a bounding box for the objects and determined the *free space* around them.
           
           So, Object 6 *must* be either to the top-left or bottom-right of the combined occupied space so it cannot collide. The available region has been split to the region to the top-left, and the region to the bottom-right.
           From calculations, I've got two line segments I can use, which are not colliding, to place the object:
           *   A vertical line segment in the top-left section
           *   A horizontal line segment in the bottom-right section
           
           Since the object is a square and rotations don't matter, I have two regions. I am going to make 25 points along each line segment for 50 total placements.
           
           The first vertical segment `cx = -0.08209852189786284`, `cy = 0.01005208999300782` to `cy = 0.088924694044564675` (y coordinates separated by about 0.003 units)
           
           The second horizontal segment: `cy = -0.08209852189786283`, `cx = 0.010052089993007835` to `cx = 0.08892469404456466` (x coordinates separated by about 0.003 units)
           
           And that *should* give me 50 collision-free spots.  I've checked the calculations *multiple* times, and I believe I've got a sound plan.
