(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, and I need to define each placement as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The object is a small, roughly square piece (0.07 x 0.07). Since it's nearly square, rotations won't change its bounding box extents, so a `theta` of 0 is fine. Surface 0 is defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Therefore, `surf_idx` will be 0 for all placements.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the center (x, y) of the object.  The surface has a width of 0.6 and a height of 0.6.  The half-size of the object is 0.035 in both x and y.  Thus, the placement needs to be at least half a size from each edge of the surface.
           
           This means:
           *   `x` must be between `4.2 + 0.035 = 4.235` and `4.8 - 0.035 = 4.765`
           *   `y` must be between `-0.6 + 0.035 = -0.565` and `0.0 - 0.035 = -0.035`
           
           With these boundaries in mind, I need to generate 50 unique placements within this space.  I could do this randomly, but for stability, a structured approach is best. Since the space is relatively small, but the object is very small, I need a good balance between coverage and number of placements.
           
           I am choosing to create a grid of points as it allows greater control.  I want to create a dense grid but avoid placing the objects too close. To get the grid size right, I'll calculate the step size. I will try a 7x8 placement, and then pick the first 50 points. With this approach, I would have good coverage.
           
           To start, my values for x range from 4.235 and 4.765 and values for y range from -0.565 to -0.035. I am dividing into 7 intervals for both, giving me 8 points. 
           
           Here are the first 50 stable placements, presented as requested:

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, I've got a new task. I need to find 50 stable placements for a new object, ID 10, on surface 0.  This object is roughly a square with dimensions around 0.098 x 0.098.  The surface is defined by the coordinates `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The tricky part?  I have to avoid collisions with the objects already placed on the surface.  These are objects with ID 5, and I have their successful placements to work from.
           
           To do this, I started by approximating the bounding boxes (AABBs) of the existing objects (ID 5).  Since they are also close to square and placed at a rotation of zero, I can just use their center coordinates plus or minus half their side length (0.035) to define the AABB bounds. From the provided list of ID 5 centers, I've calculated their AABBs.
           
           Now, for placing ID 10, I first calculated the valid range for the center of this new object on surface 0.  The `x` coordinate must be between 4.249175 and 4.750825.  The `y` coordinate must be between -0.550825 and -0.049175. I'll use theta = 0 for the object, since this produces the smallest AABB and is consistent with the square shape.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to make sure the center-to-center distance between ID 10 and any existing ID 5 is greater than or equal to the sum of their half-extents (0.035 + 0.049175 = 0.084175). Using this information, I can check against all the AABBs of objects in ID 5 to determine if the next placement is valid.
           
           I started by creating a grid of potential placement points using the available surface space. To ensure adequate coverage while avoiding existing placements, I set the step size to 0.08, slightly less than the object size of 0.098.
           
           I realized the grid placements are densely clustered near the ID 5 objects, especially the vertical columns where ID 5 objects are placed. By carefully examining a range of `x` values (from 4.249175 to 4.750825) and `y` values (-0.550825 to -0.049175), I determined where a placement would collide with an existing ID 5 object.
           
           Through a systematic process, I found that the first two columns ( x = 4.249175 and 4.299175) would collide because there were existing objects at (4.235, y) and (4.31, y). Then, I could start a sequence of valid placements at 4.349175, checking against the pre-determined collision range.
           
           I then identified 8 placements for x = 4.349175, 11 more at x = 4.399175, 11 more at x = 4.449175, and 11 more at x = 4.499175, finishing with 9 placements in column x=4.549175. This gives me my list of 50 valid placements without collisions.
