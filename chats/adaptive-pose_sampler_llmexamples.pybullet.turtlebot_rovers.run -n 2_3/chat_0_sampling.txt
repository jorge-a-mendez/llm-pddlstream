User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains several rectangular obstacles. There's a large central cross-shaped obstacle (AABB 5, combined with the other small boxes). There are also four large "corner" obstacles (AABBs 7, 8, 9, 10). AABBs 0-4 are the boundaries of the environment. There are also smaller, irregularly placed obstacles throughout the scene. The robot base must be within the overall x and y limits.
           
           My strategy is to find points on a circle of radius 1.5 (a bit less than the max radius of 2 to allow for some buffer) around the target point. I will then adjust these points to be within the environment boundaries and away from known obstacles. Since the target point is at (0 0), I'll try to place the robot in open areas. The area around (0 0) looks quite cluttered. I will try to place the robot in different "quadrants" or sectors around the target to ensure diversity.
           
           Target point: (0 0)
           Max range: 2
           
           Candidate 1: I will try a point on the positive X axis. (1.5 0).
           Candidate 2: I will try a point on the negative X axis. (-1.5 0).
           Candidate 3: I will try a point on the positive Y axis. (0 1.5).
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0)
           (-1.5 0)
           (0 1.5)
