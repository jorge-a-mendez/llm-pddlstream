           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning on Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. My goal is clear: get objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 all placed onto v18. Initially, they're sitting on v11.  To achieve this, I need to use 'pick' and 'place' actions to move them.
           
           First, I examined the preconditions for these actions.  Crucially, both 'pick' and 'place' require a 'kin' fact, which defines the robot's kinematic configuration for interacting with an object (arm, object pose, grasp, base config, and arm trajectory).  I meticulously reviewed the initial state, and I noted that NO 'kin' facts are explicitly stated there. The task description emphasizes, "Any fact not explicitly stated is *false*."
           
           So, by the rules I'm operating under, all the required 'kin' facts are *false*, which immediately blocks my ability to even start planning pick and place actions.  Furthermore, the instructions stated I can only use the 'valid action instances'. The list only contained the base motion action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This clearly does not allow me to move anything.
           
           Therefore, since the plan requires 'pick' and 'place' actions, and the only permitted actions can't achieve that, I concluded that the goal is currently unreachable.
