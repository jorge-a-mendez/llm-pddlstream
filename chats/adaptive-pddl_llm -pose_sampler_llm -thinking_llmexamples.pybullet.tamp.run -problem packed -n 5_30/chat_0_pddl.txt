           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Placement Request**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object on a square surface. The object is 0.08248254397507515 units wide, and the surface spans -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. Stability requires that the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains entirely within the surface. The object can be rotated, changing its AABB dimensions.
           
           First, I consider the varying AABB sizes due to rotation.  A square object rotated by 0, π/2, π, or 3π/2 has the same AABB size. Rotation by π/4 causes a larger AABB because the square is presented at its maximum diagonal,  √2 times larger. The object is a square so calculations are somewhat easier, at least!
           
           The approach will be to generate a diverse set of placements spanning multiple rotations and surface locations. I will sample different values for rotation (theta) and center the object within the surface using x and y coordinates.
           
           Here's my strategy:
           
           1.  **Define Rotation Angles:** I choose 16 angles, evenly distributed across the 2π space.
               The angles are: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, π/2, 5π/8, 3π/4, 7π/8, π, 9π/8, 5π/4, 11π/8, 3π/2, 13π/8, 7π/4, 15π/8
           2.  **Calculate Valid Center Range:** For each angle, I calculate the AABB's half extent.   Then I calculate the valid *x* and *y* ranges.  These are restricted to ensure the object stays within the surface. I define M = 0.135 - half\_extent which gives the allowed center bounds.
           3.  **Generate Placement Coordinates**: For each of the angles, I will apply a uniform-spacing strategy. For each angle, I will generate three (x, y) coordinates with the general form `(0, 0)`, `(M * 0.6, 0)`, and `(0, M * 0.6)`.  I'll perform 2 extra steps. This will make it possible to fill my placement requirement.
           4.  **Create the placements and check.**
           5.  **Placement Refinement**: If required adjust rotation angles to better cover the space.
           
           This approach will yield 50 distinct object positions, satisfying the request. The code follows.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing this new object (ID 4) onto Surface 0 while avoiding a collision with the already-placed object (ID 5).  I've got the feedback, object dimensions, and surface bounds laid out.  My goal is to generate 50 stable, unique, and non-colliding placements.
           
           Object 5 is at the origin with no rotation, and I've got its half-side length.  Object 4 is also a square, slightly bigger.  The surface is a square with known dimensions.  The key is to use the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each object to check for collisions, and I *must* ensure there's no overlap between these AABBs.
           
           First, I've confirmed I can only safely rotate Object 4 by multiples of 90 degrees (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2). Any other rotation will lead to inescapable overlap given the object's geometry and relative size.  For these rotations, I calculate the `h_theta4`, the "half-extent" of Object 4's AABB. This depends on object size and the given rotation,  The surface has a maximum extent `M_theta4`.  I also need the minimum separation distance (`min_sep`) from the center to avoid a collision.
           
           I determined that, for the valid angles, Object 4's *center* must be sufficiently far away from Object 5's center, more specifically, a minimum distance of `min_sep`, to avoid intersection.  This value is based on Object 5's size plus half of Object 4's bounding box.  I set the condition that the absolute value of Object 4's position in X or Y must exceed `min_sep`.   The surface bounds ensure Object 4 fits.
           
           Then, I identified a set of positions (x,y) for each valid rotation where collision is guaranteed avoided. To generate 50 total placements I created a grid of offsetted points with each offset set to the minimal safe distance from the center, so all points are guaranteed non-intersecting and within the bounds.
           
           Using an offset value equal to the center placement distance and half the bound offset I generated the total set of 50 unique placements.
