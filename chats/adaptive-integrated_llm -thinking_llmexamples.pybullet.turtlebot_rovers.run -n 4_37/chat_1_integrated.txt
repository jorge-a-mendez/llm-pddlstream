           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Axiom Achievement**
           
           Okay, here's my game plan to tackle `new-axiom@0()`: I've got a list of requirements, and I'm going to methodically address each one. My main goal is to acquire images and analyses of certain geological targets.
           
           First, I need to get those images. I've got two rovers, *v12* and *v14*, both with cameras, capable of taking images in mode *v11*.  My initial move is to get *v12* to a strategic observation point, *#o3*. This involves navigating from its starting position, *v13*,  to *#o3*.  From there, I'll direct *v12* to:
           
           *   Calibrate and capture images of objectives *v17, v18, v19, and v20*.
           *   Subsequently, move to *#o0* for transmission.
           *   Then, relay the images.
           
           Next up is analysis. I've got to analyze *rocks* of type *v2* and *soil* of type *v6*.  I've chosen *v14* for this task.  My initial move is to get *v14* to an analysis location, *#o5*.  Here's the plan:
           
           *   Sample a rock of type *v2* (like rock *v1*).
           *   Transfer *v14* to *#o0* for transmission.
           *   Relay the analysis of the first rock.
           *   Once finished, I return to *#o5*.
           *   Sample the *soil* of type *v6* (like soil *v5*).
           *   Transfer *v14* to *#o0* for transmission.
           *   Relay the analysis of the second rock.
           
           Regarding continuous parameters,  I understand that I must provide specific values for the '#' configurations used in the image/communication visibility predicates.  I've decided on `(-1.5, -1.75, 3.14)` for *#o0*, which facilitates rover communication to the lander. And for the strategic image location *#o3*, I have chosen `(0.0, 0.5, 1.57)` to support imaging for all the geological targets I require. These values represent realistic coordinates and orientations for the actions I need to perform. I am also aware, per the documentation, that the system will likely fill in other missing variables, but these variables are necessary for my high level plan.

           *   Sample a rock of type *v2* (like rock *v1*).
           *   Transfer *v14* to *#o0* for transmission.
           *   Relay the analysis of the first rock.
           *   Once finished, I return to *#o5*.
           *   Sample the *soil* of type *v6* (like soil *v5*).
           *   Transfer *v14* to *#o0* for transmission.
           *   Relay the analysis of the second rock.
           
           Regarding continuous parameters,  I understand that I must provide specific values for the '#' configurations used in the image/communication visibility predicates.  I've decided on `(-1.5, -1.75, 3.14)` for *#o0*, which facilitates rover communication to the lander. And for the strategic image location *#o3*, I have chosen `(0.0, 0.5, 1.57)` to support imaging for all the geological targets I require. These values represent realistic coordinates and orientations for the actions I need to perform. I am also aware, per the documentation, that the system will likely fill in other missing variables, but these variables are necessary for my high level plan.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Plan Re-Evaluation and New Configuration Proposal**
           
           Okay, the previous plan hit a snag due to collisions with the defined continuous configurations. I need to revisit my choices for `#o0` (communication with the lander, `v9`) and `#o3` (imaging objectives, `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`).
           
           First, focusing on `#o0`. The lander `v9` is at a specific location, and my previous attempt to place `#o0` within `v9`'s bounding box resulted in a collision. The initial state and the problem instructions, require me to identify the collision-free configurations.
           
           To avoid this, I'll place `#o0` *outside* of `v9` but within communication range (4 meters). A position directly east of `v9` at `(-0.9, -2.0, 3.14)` seems like a good choice. This keeps me at a collision-free location while being within range of the lander for communication. This location is reachable for both rovers.
           
           Next, I'll address `#o3`. The collision here was with a thin barrier (`v21`) positioned at x=0. The original choice for `#o3` was too close to this obstacle. The imaging objectives are clustered at high positive y-values. Based on the guarantees within the initial state, I know there exists one specific configuration of `#o3` that is valid for each rover.
           
           After careful consideration of the objectives' positions and the barrier's location, I am choosing `(0.1, -1.0, 1.57)` as the collision-free ` #o3` coordinate. This will ensure that both rovers are able to successfully image the objectives without collision.
           
           Given the guarantees within the problem, I *can* determine if those targets are within the image range, but I don't necessarily have to verify it. By definition, I just need to specify a valid position.
           
           I need to confirm all the collision-free movements, so:
           *   Rover `v12` must move from its starting location to `#o3`. Then from `#o3` to `#o0`.
           *   Rover `v14` will move from its starting point to a fixed location, and then on to `#o0`.
           
           The new coordinates, I believe, will resolve the collision issue and satisfy the task's requirements.
           
           My plan remains the same in general: `v12` will image, and `v14` will sample. I just had to fix where they go.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Configuration Strategies**
           
           Okay, based on the provided feedback, I need to revisit the configurations for rovers `v12` and `v14`.  The primary issue is that my previous suggestions for `#o0` and `#o3` were either unreachable or in collision with obstacles.  Specifically:
           
           *   **#o0 (Communication):**  The previous location I suggested for `v14` to communicate with the lander `v9` was deemed "not reachable." This means I need a new configuration that's both reachable and allows for clear communication.
           *   **#o3 (Imaging):** The suggested location for `v12` to image targets `v17, v18, v19, v20` was colliding with the wall `v21`. So x must be > 0.05. I also need to ensure `imagevisible` constraints are met.
           
           Let's start by reevaluating the problem's geometric constraints and the defined "motion" and "imagevisible" predicates.  The rover's path planning process, motion predicates, and reachability are not directly under my control, I can only select the target configurations that the planner must then try to hit.
           
           First, I need to choose a new location for `#o3`. Rover `v12` has to be able to see targets `v17, v18, v19, v20` and the previous suggestion was invalid because it collided. The wall `v21` is at `x = 0`.  Therefore, `v12` must be to the positive side of `v21` (x>0.05). If `x=0.1` the rover body overlaps `v21`. Assuming robot is 0.2m wide, I should target at *least* x>0.15. The targets are spread out in y, but generally, at y>1.8. The prior attempt also did not meet the 2m range limit of `imagevisible`. I will pick `x=0.2`.
           The imaging poses should be close to the origin but facing towards the targets, within the 2m range limit.  It's very difficult to meet all these conflicting conditions given a 0.1m obstacle. But the fact that imagevisible is in the initial state implies a position exists. I am assuming the 2m range is sufficient to take into account the ability of the rover camera to be adjusted.
           I can then use `(0.2, -1.0, 1.57)` which will face approximately towards the objectives.  This should be a relatively collision-free position. The distance from `v12` starting point to `(0.2, -1.0)` is 1.09m, so, reachable.
           
           Next, I need to choose a new location for `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`.  The previous location `(-0.9, -2.0, 3.14)` was reported as "not reachable." The proximity to the starting location is key for reachability.  `comvisible` range is 4m, and this must work for `v12` *and* `v14`.
           The lander `v9` is approximately at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.  To enhance the reachability, I can choose a location very close to `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)`, which is `v15`.  The distance from `v15` to the `v9` is approx 0.92 m, which is in range.  I will choose `-1.0, -1.8, 3.14)`.  This also aligns with a more westward facing rover, facing towards the landing module.
           
           Given the geometry and the problem statement, I'm confident with these revised configurations that maximize reachability and collision-free operations.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Configurations for Mission Success**
           
           Okay, so the initial configurations for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) are causing some issues. Let's break down the problem and find solutions that work within the mission constraints.
           
           **The Goal:** We're aiming to fulfill the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which requires four images, one stone analysis, and one soil analysis, all communicated successfully.
           
           **Current Blockers:**
           
           *   **`#o0` for `v14`:** The proposed position `(-1.0, -1.8, 3.14)` is deemed "not reachable." This is likely due to the rover's limitations. Since `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, being *too* close for a full rotation or displacement seems to be the culprit. We know that for communication to the lander at `v9` we need to be near the lander. The lander's AABB is described, and this gives us boundary to work with. I'm going to set `(-1.3, -1.5, 3.14)` as the new target. This places `v14` near the lander, and the distance is manageable for both rovers to get to their respective spots.
           *   **`#o3` for `v12`:** A collision is reported with a wall at `x=0`. The previous position of `(0.2, -1.0, 1.57)` is too close to the wall. I'll move this target point to `(0.5, -1.0, 1.57)`, which will ensure a safe distance of 0.5 meters from that wall. Distance from `v12` start is reachable. There is no occlusion.
           
           **The Plan Stays the Same:**
           
           We'll stick with the general strategy:
           
           1.  `v12` images and sends.
           2.  `v14` analyzes, sends, and drops the stone.
           3.  `v14` analyzes, sends, and drops the soil.
           
           **Revised Configurations:**
           
           *   `#o0`: Communication position for both rovers is set to `(-1.3, -1.5, 3.14)`.
           *   `#o3`: Imaging position for `v12` will be set to `(0.5, -1.0, 1.57)`.
           
           With these adjustments, we should have a feasible plan that meets all mission objectives.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy: Navigating the Impossibility of Achieving the 'new-axiom@0()' Goal in 'rovers'**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've been tasked with crafting a plan to reach the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. This goal is quite specific, demanding that I achieve a set of conditions relating to rover positions, image reception, and analysis of various objects (rocks and soil). Specifically, I need both rovers in position, both stores free, images of objectives successfully received, and analyses performed on both stone and soil types.
           
           The challenge lies in the initial state I'm presented with and the feedback I've received from previous attempts. Two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at set starting positions with the aim of capturing images, transmitting them to the lander, and receiving the analyses, all without collisions or obstacles hindering them.
           
           I know I have two rovers at different locations, the objectives are also in different locations. My goal is for each rover to be free from obstacles and reach all of the objectives. It is my task to find the right configuration for that to happen.
           
           The biggest issue I see is this *wall* (`v21`) that is blocking the line of sight between the rovers and the objectives. Each previous attempt with parameter sets for configurations `#o3` and communication settings `#o0` has resulted in "collision" or "occlusion" errors, repeatedly. It is crucial to me to avoid these collisions, however, the structure of the prompt is requiring a singular configuration.
           
           I need to focus on this persistent occlusion issue.
           
           The feedback keeps saying "target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion." This points to the wall (`v21`). If I place `v12` on one side of the wall, it cannot see objectives on the other side. This is a problem!
           
           The prompt's insistence on using `#o3` (a single continuous configuration object) for all the visibility requirements makes this even more complex, since they would likely need different ones. The problem is also in its ambiguity around the geometric constraints. I must find a `#o3` coordinate that provides an "occlusion-free line-of-sight" to all the target objects. However, I believe that due to the structure of `v21`, the geometry of the scene might not permit it.
           
           I've considered trying to "see over" `v21`, which is geometrically a short obstacle. This doesn't seem to work, since the feedback is explicit.

Model:     **My Strategy: Navigating the Impossibility of Achieving the 'new-axiom@0()' Goal in 'rovers'**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've been tasked with crafting a plan to reach the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. This goal is quite specific, demanding that I achieve a set of conditions relating to rover positions, image reception, and analysis of various objects (rocks and soil). Specifically, I need both rovers in position, both stores free, images of objectives successfully received, and analyses performed on both stone and soil types.
           
           The challenge lies in the initial state I'm presented with and the feedback I've received from previous attempts. Two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at set starting positions with the aim of capturing images, transmitting them to the lander, and receiving the analyses, all without collisions or obstacles hindering them.
           
           I know I have two rovers at different locations, the objectives are also in different locations. My goal is for each rover to be free from obstacles and reach all of the objectives. It is my task to find the right configuration for that to happen.
           
           The biggest issue I see is this *wall* (`v21`) that is blocking the line of sight between the rovers and the objectives. Each previous attempt with parameter sets for configurations `#o3` and communication settings `#o0` has resulted in "collision" or "occlusion" errors, repeatedly. It is crucial to me to avoid these collisions, however, the structure of the prompt is requiring a singular configuration.
           
           I need to focus on this persistent occlusion issue.
           
           The feedback keeps saying "target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion." This points to the wall (`v21`). If I place `v12` on one side of the wall, it cannot see objectives on the other side. This is a problem!
           
           The prompt's insistence on using `#o3` (a single continuous configuration object) for all the visibility requirements makes this even more complex, since they would likely need different ones. The problem is also in its ambiguity around the geometric constraints. I must find a `#o3` coordinate that provides an "occlusion-free line-of-sight" to all the target objects. However, I believe that due to the structure of `v21`, the geometry of the scene might not permit it.
           
           I've considered trying to "see over" `v21`, which is geometrically a short obstacle. This doesn't seem to work, since the feedback is explicit.
           
           I believe there's a contradiction between the initial `imagevisible` predicates, which imply a single `#o3` *should* work, and the reality of the occluding wall.

           My strategy needs to be focused on finding the right "#o3" parameter to make my task simpler. I also must find the best settings and positioning of my rovers.
