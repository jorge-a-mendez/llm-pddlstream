           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan that fulfills the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. Upon careful examination, it's immediately apparent that a significant obstacle prevents this goal's achievement: the limitations imposed by the available `move` actions.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal is a conjunction of several conditions. Four are initially satisfied (rover configurations and free stores), so I shift my focus to the image and analysis goals.
           
           *   **Image Acquisition:** To satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates, I need to deploy the `send_image` action. This action necessitates the `haveimage` precondition, which, in turn, is satisfied by the `take_image` action. The challenge lies in the spatial configurations. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, essential for `take_image` and `send_image`, respectively, are tied to specific, unachievable configurations. Specifically, the rovers (`v12` and `v14`) must be at `#o3` and `#o0`, respectively.
           *   **Analysis Acquisition:** Similar challenges exist with `receivedanalysis` predicates. To fulfill those I must deploy `send_analysis` after having achieved `analyzed`. To `analyzed` I need to be above the object. That is accomplished using `sample_rock`. The spatial prerequisites for `sample_rock` are `above` predicates (related to `#o5` for sampling) and `send_analysis` are bound to a configuration `#o0` (for communication). Again, neither configuration is reachable.
           
           The provided `move` actions restrict both rovers to their initial configurations (`v13` and `v15`). These locations are incompatible with the configurations where imaging and analysis are possible. In essence, the rovers are spatially constrained, preventing them from accessing the necessary configurations to fulfill the preconditions of crucial actions.
           
           Given the initial state and available action instances, there is absolutely no plan that enables the rover to change its configuration to the needed configurations to complete the take, send image or sample actions. Therefore, `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
