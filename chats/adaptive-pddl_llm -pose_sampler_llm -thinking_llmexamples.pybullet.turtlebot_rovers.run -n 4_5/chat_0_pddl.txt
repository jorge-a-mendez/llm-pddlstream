(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge in the Rovers Domain**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a task in the rovers domain, and I need a plan to do so. After careful analysis of the axiom, I realize this means I need to acquire images and analyses of certain objects (stones and soil). While some preconditions are already met, the crux of the problem lies in the acquisition of images and analysis data.
           
           I initially examine the actions available to me, and it becomes immediately clear that my position (currently at `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12,v13)`) is suitable for the first half, which is the reception and analysis of images. Rover `v14` appears to be the more suitable rover, and I will be using camera `v10`, mode `v11`, and store `v16`, along with communications ray `#o1`.
           The first phase consists of capturing images of objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           To do so, I need to use `take_image` by first `calibrate` the camera on the rover.
           My initial thought process was: I will need to take the images. First, I must `calibrate` the cameras. Because, the pre-conditions of the action can't be met if the images are not first `calibrate`d.
           
           The images must be sent to the lander `v9`. `v14` already has this capability.
           
           The challenge comes from interpreting continuous parameters in the problem, particularly those denoted with a `#`.
           Since the task requires the images to be from certain objects, I must make sure that `v14` can acquire them.
           The problem provides facts like `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, which suggests a "viewing" configuration.
           I am running into difficulty because I cannot explicitly change the rover to a specific `#oX` config.
           After some thought, the key observation is that the present problem setup implies an assumption on continuous parameters: the current configuration, `v15` or `v13`, can serve as the configuration in all preconditions. If that is true, my path becomes much simpler.
           
           Now the solution is much clearer,
           I should take the `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.
           I will take photos and send them.
           Then I must sample and send the analysis.
           First, I will sample a stone, send the analysis, drop the sample to free the store and then I will sample the soil, and send the analysis.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v20 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v20 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v20 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v4 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v4), (sample_rock v14 v15 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Re-Evaluation of the Problem**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user pointed out that the actions I attempted weren't valid. I need to go back and meticulously review the problem, especially the provided list of *valid action instances*. I need to be *absolutely* sure I'm only using those.
           
           The prompt is crystal clear: "You will then generate a list of actions that achieve the goal. It is critical that the preconditions of each action are satisfied after the previous action is executed. You are only allowed to use the provided actions. It's essential to stick to the format of these basic actions. When creating a plan, replace the arguments of each action with specific objects. ... You will also receive a list of valid action instances (applications of actions to specific objects). **Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan.**"
           
           The valid actions I'm given are:
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           The desired state I'm aiming for is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the following conditions being true:
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` (true)
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)` (true)
           3.  `free(v12, v16)` (true)
           4.  `free(v14, v16)` (true)
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)` (false)
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)` (false)
           7.  `receivedimage(v19, v11)` (false)
           8.  `receivedimage(v20, v11)` (false)
           9.  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (false)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (false)
           
           To reach a state where `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are true, I need to execute `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, *none* of those actions are in the allowed actions list! The only actions I can use are `move` (which effectively does nothing because the configs are the same) and `drop_rock`.
           
           The `drop_rock` action has a precondition that requires `full(?v, ?s)` to be true. Right now, `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, meaning the rovers are *not* full. So I can't even use `drop_rock` at the start. And even if I *could*, dropping a rock wouldn't get me any closer to the goals of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Therefore, given the *extremely* limited actions provided, the goal is unreachable. I need to be able to use actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` in order to progress. With the actions provided, I'm stuck. It's a dead end.
