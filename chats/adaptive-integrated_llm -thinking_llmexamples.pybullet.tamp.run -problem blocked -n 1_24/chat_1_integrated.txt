User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.603, -0.583), (-4.512, -0.491)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.558, -0.537, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.831, 0.556).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan of Action: Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` to be true. Initially, I know that `?green` could be either `v12` or `v8`. The key here is to make either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` a true statement.
           
           The axiom `on(?o, ?r)` is defined by two other criteria, `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So to make either of the `on()` statements true, I need to place either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`. From the initial state, I know that both `v12` and `v8` are supported by surfaces, so this is feasible.
           
           Focusing on achieving `on(v8, v18)`, this means placing `v8` on `v18`. I need to find a way to make `atpose(v8, #o2)` true, which is where the available actions come into play.
           
           I have actions to move the base, to pick, and to place. The `move_base` action, is pretty much a no-op as the user can't move the base in this environment. I'm focusing on pick and place actions, and the robot's base configuration is already set to `v3`.
           
           The initial state provides me with the means to move `v8` with a hand and place it on a pose `#o2`. Using the available kin relationships, there's a specific configuration that is necessary to lift `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2`. I need to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` and place it at the target position `#o2`. The initial state gives me the tools to define a pick from pose `v9` on base `v3` and an arm trajectory `#o4` and  a `place` action at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           Here's my two-step plan:
           
           1.  **(Pick)** Use the pick action to lift `v8` using arm `v4`, from pose `v9`, with grasp `#o1`, and the robot base at `v3` using motion trajectory `#o4`.
           2.  **(Place)** Use the place action to set `v8` down on `#o2`, with the same hand configuration, grasp and base config.
           
           My main assumption in executing this plan is to treat collision checks with the *simplest interpretation*. I'm assuming that any "not explicitly stated" facts are false, unless specified otherwise, specifically relating to collisions. There are no explicit collision conditions in the initial state, so I'm assuming collision-free conditions for approach and placement.
           
           For the value of the pose I'll use to place object v8, `#o2`, which must reside on the surface `v18`. I am going to place it with z=0.8, x=4.5, y=-0.3. This aligns with the bounding box I have for v8 to fit on v18.
           
           This will put `v8` on the surface of `v18`, so it is now on `v18`. Then by placing it, I fulfill the definition of on(?green, v18). By the initial state, I know the type of v8 (or type(v17)) so the requirements of the goal `new-axiom@0()` are met, and the plan is complete.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, I've got a new set of valid actions: a single `move_base` operation, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This drastically changes the game. Let's re-evaluate the objective and initial state.
           
           The core goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing either `on(?green, v18)`. Since I know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` are both true in the initial state, the only two viable options are `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`. Remember, `on(?o, ?r)` is an axiom: it requires both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are both true. So, the crucial piece is getting `atpose` correct. Currently, I have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. I'd need to manipulate these objects; either move `v8` to `#o2` or move `v12` to `#o2`. Standard *pick* and *place* actions would do the trick here.
           
           Here's the problem: The only available action is this `move_base` command. It has preconditions like `basemotion`, `atbconf`, and `canmove()`. All of those are initially true, and the action's primary purpose is to update the robot's base configuration. The `move_base` action specifically *does not* alter the `atpose` predicate of any object. It changes the robot state.
           
           In short, my target objective depends entirely on changing the *object poses*. The single available `move_base` action *cannot* achieve this. Without the necessary `pick` and `place` actions to physically move the objects, I can't construct a plan to reach the desired state. With the given actions, this goal is utterly unreachable.
