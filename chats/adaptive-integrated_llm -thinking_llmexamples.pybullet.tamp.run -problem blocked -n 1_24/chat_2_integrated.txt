User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.603, -0.583), (-4.512, -0.491)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.558, -0.537, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.831, 0.556).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal: `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which in this instance translates to placing an object, let's call it "?green", onto a surface, labeled `v18`. Crucially, this object also needs to be of a specific type. I've chosen to work with `v8` as `?green`, as it satisfies the necessary type constraint.
           
           To achieve this, I'll need to use the arm, `v4`. Currently, `v8` is at location `v9`.  The initial plan is to:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` - The robot's base needs to reposition itself to configuration `#o3` (I assume based on some initial state).
           2.  **Pick:** `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` - This picks up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place:** `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` - Finally, place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           **Detailed Reasoning and Validation:**
           
           *   **Understanding the Goal:** I first broke down the goal, identifying the required relationship (`on`) and constraints (`type`).
           *   **Object Selection:** I selected `v8` since it's confirmed to be of the correct type (`v17`) via the initial state.
           *   **Prerequisites for Placement:** For the placement to succeed, `v8` needs to be "supported" by the target surface `v18`. I confirmed that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state. I had to choose a continuous value for `#o2` so `v8` is stably placed on `v18` in a non-collision state.
           *   **Collision Detection:** I considered possible collisions: while checking for collisions, I made sure there were no overlaps with `v15` which lies elsewhere on `v11`. Placing `v8` at `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` is collision-free.
           *   **Pose Determination:** I determined `#o2` as a specific 3D location and orientation on surface `v18`  (specifically at  `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`)  using the surface's AABB (`((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`).
           *   **Action Preconditions and Effects:** I confirmed that all the necessary preconditions for each action were met or could be achieved (e.g., `atbconf(#o3)` needs to be true for picking, which can be accomplished by moving the base).
           *   **No Collisions:** With `z=0.8` (or base of the objects resting on the surface, with a slight offset due to their width), the object `v8` is within the confines of `v18` and avoids collision with other objects by their AABB checks.
           *   **Goal Satisfaction:** After these actions, the `on(v8, v18)` relationship will be true, satisfying the goal along with the type information.
           
           In essence, I have created a valid, collision-free plan to achieve the specified goal, leveraging the initial state, axioms, and available actions to move `v8` onto the target surface `v18`. This is achieved by combining the `pick` action, the `move_base` action, and the `place` action, which puts the objects on the desired surface without any collisions.
           
           The plan and continuous value of the `#` objects should now satisfy the original objective.
