User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.603, -0.583), (-4.512, -0.491)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.558, -0.537, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.831, 0.556).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal Due to Restricted Action Instances**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which necessitates establishing the condition `on(?green, v18)` alongside `type(?green, v17)`. Analyzing the initial state, I identify `v8` and `v12` as viable candidates for `?green`.  To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, I must move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Initially, I opted to employ `v8` as `?green`, aiming to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           Achieving `on(v8, v18)` requires that I determine a pose `?p` wherein `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` are true. My exploration of the initial state reveals the existence of the critical fact,  `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, which simplifies the planning process.  My proposed plan involved the following actions: (1) picking up `v8` from its current location, `v9`,  and (2) placing `v8` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           The standard pick action would require `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty` and other preconditions to be satisfied and the place action has corresponding requirements. However, I encountered a major problem with the constraints on allowed actions.  The instructions explicitly state, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Furthermore, the only permitted action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           After careful re-reading and repeated consideration, I've concluded that the stated goal is, in fact, unachievable given the constraint on action instances. Because this sole permitted action merely moves the base to the same location, it does not allow for `pick` and `place` operations, which are essential to modifying object locations to satisfy the goal. I am prevented from implementing the necessary sequence of pick-and-place actions due to this strict limitation on permitted action instances.  Thus, given the action instance restriction, the task is unattainable.
