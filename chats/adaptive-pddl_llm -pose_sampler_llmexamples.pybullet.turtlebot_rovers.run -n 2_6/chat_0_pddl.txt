User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has a central open area, with obstacles near the boundaries. There are also some smaller obstacles scattered within the general area. I will try to place the robot in a circle of radius 2 around the target point. I need to avoid the large obstacles that form a frame around the boundaries, and also avoid the horizontal obstacle at x=0. I will generate points that are at a reasonable distance from these obstacles.
           
           Target point: (0.0, 0.0)
           Positions:
           (1.414 1.414)
           (-1.414 1.414)
           (1.414 -1.414)
