           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()` and Why It's Unachievable**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this `new-axiom@0()` goal, and it breaks down into a bunch of requirements: getting images of some objects, sending them, getting analyses of some soil and rocks, and sending those. Now, looking at the initial state, the `atconf` and `free` predicates are already satisfied. That's good. But I need to achieve the remaining ones: a bunch of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           I've identified which rocks and soil samples I need to analyze and which rovers have a clear view to take a picture of those objectives. Both rovers (v12 and v14) can see all the targets. Excellent. I figured out I'll use rover v12 for v17 and v19, and rover v14 for v18 and v20. Then I looked at the rocks and soil samples to pick which rovers to use. I can see both rovers can access the samples. I also took note that the camera needs calibration for taking pictures with each rover, and that needs to be done right before taking the actual picture.
           
           So far, so good. Then I started to form a plan. To get an image, I need to calibrate, take the image, and send it. To get an analysis, I need to sample, send the analysis, and drop the sample since the final state mandates it is empty. It's a linear plan.
           
           But here's the kicker: the instructions are very specific. I'm only allowed to use a few actions: move the rovers (but not to a new location) and drop rocks. I can't calibrate, take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses.
           
           I went over this carefully. The action instances I need are not provided. The move actions are practically useless, and the drop actions depend on the storage becoming full from a missing sample action.
           
           This means, I think, that with those restrictions the given goal is impossible to achieve. The goal can't be reached. I need to explain clearly that the lack of the correct action instances makes the goal unreachable. The list does not include the actions necessary to achieve either `receivedimage` nor `receivedanalysis`. I must state that given *only* the provided actions and initial state, none of the required predicates in the goal can become true. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved. I need to explain *why* the provided moves are useless and why the drop actions are impossible, since no `sample_rock` is provided. So, my conclusion: The provided list of actions is insufficient to achieve the goal.
