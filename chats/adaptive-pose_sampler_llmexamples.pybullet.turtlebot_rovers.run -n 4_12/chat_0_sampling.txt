User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square (AABB 0) with a side length of 5 units, centered at the origin. There are thin rectangular obstacles along the perimeter (AABBs 1, 2, 3, 4) suggesting a wall. A long, thin obstacle (AABB 5) runs vertically along the y-axis at x=0, effectively dividing the space into two halves. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some of which are quite small (AABBs 6-22). My strategy will be to generate points on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target, and check for collisions with the known obstacles. I will prioritize points that are not too close to the obstacles. For {target_point}, which is at the center of the scene, I will try to find positions that are not obstructed by the large central pillar (AABB 5). I will also try to keep a reasonable distance from the other, smaller obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.5 0.0)
           (1.5 0.0)
           (0.0 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous target point was (0.49820849299430847, 1.9766266345977783). The proposed positions (-1.5, 0.0) and (1.5, 0.0) had no line of sight, likely due to obstacles between them and the target. The position (0.0, 1.5) collided with the central pillar (AABB 5), which makes sense given its x-coordinate of 0. For the new target point, I will try to generate positions closer to it, and on different sides of it, to maximize the chances of finding a clear line of sight. I will avoid positions with an x-coordinate of 0 due to the central pillar.
