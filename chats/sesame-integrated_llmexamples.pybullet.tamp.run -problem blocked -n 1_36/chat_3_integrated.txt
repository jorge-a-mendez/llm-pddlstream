User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.35, 0.242, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.318, 0.948).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.399, 0.193), (-4.301, 0.291)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))
           ((pick v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom for `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, we need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`.
           The predicate `on(?o, ?r)` is true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           From the initial state, we have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v12, #o2)`.
           Therefore, the plan is to move `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13` (i.e. `atpose(v12, v13)`).
           We need to pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1. Pick `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           2. Place `v12` at `#o2` using arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           All the required preconditions for these actions are present in the initial state or are satisfied by previous actions.
           Specifically, `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` are in the initial state.
           `atpose(v12, v13)` and `handempty(v4)` and `atbconf(#o3)` are in the initial state.
           After picking, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` becomes true.
           Then for placing, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` and `atbconf(#o3)` are true.
           After placing, `atpose(v12, #o2)` becomes true, which satisfies `on(v12, v18)` since `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is also true.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v12 v18): (4.5 0.1 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf(#o3)` was not explicitly in the initial state. However, `bconf(#o3)` is in the initial state, and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` is also in the initial state. This implies that `#o3` is a valid base configuration. The `move_base` action is available to move to and from this configuration, but it would only be necessary if the robot was not already in `#o3`. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, we must assume the robot's current base configuration is not `#o3`. There is no `atbconf` predicate given in the initial state. This suggests the robot starts at a default base configuration not specified, and needs to move to `#o3` first. However, there are no `atbconf` predicates in the initial state, and therefore, it is impossible to satisfy the precondition `atbconf(?q1)` for `move_base` action or any other action that requires a base configuration.
           
           This indicates that `atbconf(#o3)` must be a starting condition to pick or place, but it's not given in the initial state. If the robot is not at any base configuration, it cannot perform any action that requires `atbconf`. This problem cannot be solved under the given initial state because the robot is not at any base configuration. If we assume that `bconf(#o3)` implicitly means `atbconf(#o3)`, then the original plan would be valid. Since the validator says `atbconf(#o3)` is not satisfied, it implies that `bconf(#o3)` does not automatically mean `atbconf(#o3)`. Since there is no action to set the initial `atbconf`, and no `atbconf` is present in the initial state, no action that requires `atbconf` can be executed.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
