           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of achieving `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which I've broken down as needing an object of type `v17` to be *on* `v18`. Initially, I identified that `v8` and `v12` are objects of type `v17`. My immediate thought was to try to move one of them onto `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see `v8` is currently *on* `v11` and stackable on `v18`, with an `atpose` fact.  Similarly, `v12` is *on* `v14` and stackable on `v18`. To achieve my goal, I need to manipulate these objects using *pick* and *place* actions.
           
           However, a constraint hit me like a wall. The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options.  Since the problem statement explicitly states that *only* the provided action instances are valid, any *pick* or *place* action becomes illegal, thus making the plan invalid.  I confirmed the preconditions for *pick* and *place* actions, and the initial and goal states.  I re-examined the initial facts to ensure I hadn't missed anything.
           
           Realizing the implication of this constraint, I confirmed that I have an *on* fact. To use that fact, I would need a *pick* and a *place* action. Without *pick* and *place*, I cannot manipulate the objects in the world. I don't see any other axioms or facts that would allow me to change the state of `on(?green, v18)` with only a `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, because I am restricted to the `move_base` action, the goal of placing an object *on* `v18` cannot be achieved. It is unreachable, given the current constraints.
