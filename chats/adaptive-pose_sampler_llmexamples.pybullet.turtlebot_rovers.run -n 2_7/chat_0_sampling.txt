User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene consists of several axis-aligned bounding boxes. Many of these define a large outer boundary from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There are also several internal obstacles. Notably, there's a vertical wall at x=0 that spans the entire y-range, effectively splitting the environment into two main halves. Other smaller obstacles are scattered throughout.
           
           Given the target point at (0.013401567935943604, -0.6558223962783819), which is very close to the x=0 wall, I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point. This means the robot can be on either side of the x=0 wall, or even very close to it. I will try to find positions on both sides of the wall and also a position close to the target point, within the allowed range and avoiding collisions with known obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 -0.6)
           (-0.5 -0.6)
           (0.01 -1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My apologies for the previous failures. It seems the target point has changed significantly, and my previous positions were not suitable. The new target is (2.0488388538360596, 2.094397783279419). This point is located in the upper-right quadrant of the environment.
           
           From the feedback, I learned that (0.01, -1.5) collided with obstacle 0, which is `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. This confirms the vertical wall at x=0. My proposed positions (0.5, -0.6) and (-0.5, -0.6) had no line of sight to the previous target. Given the new target is in the upper right, those positions are still likely to be occluded.
           
           For the new target point (2.0488388538360596, 2.094397783279419), I need to find positions within a radius of 2. This means x can range from approximately 0.04 to 4.04 and y from 0.09 to 4.09, but considering the overall environment limits of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y. So, the search space for the base position will be roughly x in [0.04, 2.5] and y in [0.09, 2.5].
           
           I'll focus on positions in the upper-right region, close to the target, and avoid the x=0 wall. I will also consider the smaller obstacles in this region, such as obstacle 7 `((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))` and obstacle 19 `((2.0047562029974477, 2.050315132440807), (2.0929215046746714, 2.138480434118031))`. The target itself is very close to obstacle 19.
           
           To ensure line of sight, I'll try to place the robot in a clear area around the target, perhaps slightly away from obstacle 7 and 19.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed again. The new target is (-0.3814053237438202, 2.1587820053100586). This point is located in the upper-left quadrant, very close to the x=0 wall and also near some smaller obstacles in the upper region.
           
           From the previous feedback, (1.5, 1.5) had no line of sight to the *previous* target (2.048, 2.094). My previous logic for the second request was focused on that upper-right target. Now, with the target shifted to the upper-left, positions like (1.5, 1.5), (1.0, 2.0), and (2.0, 1.0) are very likely to be occluded by the x=0 wall (obstacle 0) or too far from the new target.
           
           The new target (-0.3814053237438202, 2.1587820053100586) is near the left side of the x=0 wall. The max range of 2 means the x-coordinate of the base can be between approximately -2.38 and 1.62, and the y-coordinate between 0.15 and 4.15 (clamped to 2.5).
           
           I need to consider the obstacles in this region. Obstacle 0 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` is crucial, as the target is just to its left. Also, there are obstacles in the upper-left:
           8: `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`
           10: `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`
           20: `((-0.42333132765757914, 2.1168560013963), (-0.33947931983006124, 2.2007080092238174))` - this obstacle is extremely close to the target point itself.
           
           To get line of sight, I should place the robot slightly away from obstacle 20 and potentially avoid being directly in line with obstacle 10 and the target if that creates an occlusion. I will try positions that are on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target, and within the max range.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 2.0)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point remains at (-0.3814053237438202, 2.1587820053100586). My previously proposed positions for this target (-1.0 2.0), (-0.5 1.0), and (-2.0 2.0) were not in the feedback, which suggests they might still be valid or were not tested. However, since I am asked for new positions, I will assume the previous ones might have failed for reasons unknown to me or that the system is looking for different valid positions.
           
           The target is still in the upper-left quadrant, just to the left of the central vertical wall (x=0). The region of interest is still around x in [-2.38, 1.62] and y in [0.15, 2.5].
           
           I must consider obstacles:
           0: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (the main central wall)
           8: `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))` (upper-left obstacle)
           10: `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))` (another upper-left obstacle, very close to the target)
           20: `((-0.42333132765757914, 2.1168560013963), (-0.33947931983006124, 2.2007080092238174))` (extremely close to the target)
           
           Given the target is at (-0.38, 2.15) and obstacle 20 is around (-0.42 to -0.33, 2.11 to 2.20), the target is actually *inside* or very close to the boundary of obstacle 20. This is unusual, as targets are usually not inside fixed obstacles. However, the problem statement only says the *robot* cannot collide. Line of sight might be tricky due to this.
           
           I will try positions that are not directly obstructed by obstacles 8, 10, or 20, and that are on the left side of the x=0 wall. I will spread out the positions to offer diverse viewing angles. I will slightly adjust the previous "good" positions to see if they are still valid, and add new ones.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 1.5)
           (-0.7 2.4)
           (-1.5 1.0)
