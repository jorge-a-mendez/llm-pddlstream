           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking down this goal, it requires the conjunction of several conditions, primarily focusing on receiving images and analyses of rock and soil samples.  Specifically, I need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for some stone type), and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for some soil type).  Importantly, I already have initial conditions of `atconf` and `free` predicates.
           
           Upon examining the available actions, I'm presented with an incredibly restrictive set: only `move` and `drop_rock` actions.  Critically, these actions do *nothing* to directly affect the crucial `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates I need to achieve the overall goal. The `move` actions merely reposition the rovers within their current configuration, which is effectively a no-op given the state. The `drop_rock` actions also cannot be applied since the stores are free, but the preconditions require them to be full.
           
           Given the initial state, the only provided actions are effectively no-ops. These actions are either meaningless or cannot be taken, so the goal cannot be achieved. The predicates that are not in the initial state (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) can not be achieved with these actions. The actions to make these happen, like taking images, analyzing samples, or sending them have not been provided. Therefore, I conclude that, given the extremely limited set of allowed actions, the goal is definitively *unachievable*.  The constraint that "any action not in the given list is not allowed" is the critical factor here, sealing the fate of this plan.
