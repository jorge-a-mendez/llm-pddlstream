           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing images and analyses.  Upon dissecting the problem, I immediately recognize that I'm hamstrung by a critical constraint: the permitted actions are severely limited.  The rovers, specifically *v12* and *v14*, are firmly entrenched in their starting positions: *v12* at *v13* and *v14* at *v15*.  The provided `move` actions are self-referential; they fail to alter the rovers' respective locations.  This represents a pivotal impasse.
           
           To accomplish the imaging component (`receivedimage`), actions like *calibrate*, *take_image*, and *send_image* become essential.  However, each of these relies on the `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicate, where `?q` is a crucial configuration defined by the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts.  For instance, to capture an image of *v18*, rover *v12* must be at configuration *#o3*.  Yet, because *v12* remains fixed at *v13* due to the limited actions, reaching *#o3* is impossible. This same predicament extends to *v14*, and also to the preconditions for sending images.  The rovers are stuck and cannot comply with the *comvisible* fact to enable transmission to the lander.
           
           Similarly, achieving the analysis component (`receivedanalysis`) necessitates *sample_rock* and *send_analysis* actions.  *sample_rock* requires the rover to be `atconf` a certain configuration needed to "see" a rock. For example, sampling rock *v3* with *v12*, demands *v12* be at *#o5*. However, since *v12* cannot budge from *v13*, this prerequisite is unattainable.
           
           The fundamental issue is the lack of mobility.  The rovers are confined to their starting points. Consequently, they are incapable of reaching the required configurations, thus preventing any successful interactions needed to satisfy the goal predicates.  My conclusion is that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable, given the provided initial state and action list.
