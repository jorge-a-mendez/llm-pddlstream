           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which states `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)`, which means `?green` must be `v12`. We also have `stackable(v12, v18)`. So the goal simplifies to achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           We know `on(v12, v18)` is equivalent to `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.
           In the initial state, we have `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. We also have `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           This means we need to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` to pose `#o2`.
           
           The plan will involve picking up `v12` from `v13` and placing it at `#o2`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf(#o3)` was not satisfied. Looking at the initial state, `atbconf(#o3)` is not explicitly stated. The only action that affects `atbconf` is `move_base`. However, the initial state contains `atbconf(?q)` as a precondition for `pick` and `place` actions, and the `kin` predicates explicitly use `#o3` for the base configuration. This implies that the robot is initially at base configuration `#o3` or can move to it. Since `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` is given, it means the robot is already at `#o3` or can move to it. If it were a different `q` value, a `move_base` action would be required. Since the `kin` facts are associated with `#o3`, it implies that the robot is at `#o3` and can perform the pick and place actions without an explicit `move_base` action if it were to remain at `#o3`.
           
           Let's re-examine the initial state. `atbconf` is not explicitly stated. However, `kin` predicates provide the base configuration `#o3` for picking and placing. If the robot is not at `#o3` initially, it needs to move there. There's a `move_base` action available: `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)`. This action seems to suggest moving from `#o3` to `#o3`, implying the robot is already there or is performing a stationary base motion. Given the `kin` facts involve `#o3`, the most logical interpretation is that the initial `atbconf` *should* be `#o3` for these `kin` actions to be valid without an explicit prior `move_base` to establish `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           However, since the automated checker says `atbconf(#o3)` is not satisfied, it implies it's not present in the initial state *and* it's not being achieved. This suggests that the initial state is missing `atbconf(#o3)`. Without `atbconf(#o3)` being true, neither pick nor place can be executed. And the only `move_base` action `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` would require `atbconf(#o3)` to be true first, leading to a circular dependency.
           
           This makes the goal unachievable given the provided initial state and allowed actions, as the robot cannot perform any `pick` or `place` action due to the missing `atbconf(#o3)` precondition.
           
           The problem statement mentions: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." and "Never assume that any precondition is true by default: it must either be explicitly stated in the initial state, or be achieved by a previous action (and not undone by another action)."
           
           Since `atbconf(#o3)` is not in the initial state, it's false. No action can achieve `atbconf(#o3)` from a state where it's false, because `move_base` itself requires `atbconf(#o3)` (or some other base configuration `?q1` which is also not in the initial state).
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           The goal is unreachable because `atbconf(#o3)` is a precondition for both `pick` and `place` actions, and it is not present in the initial state. There are no available actions that can establish `atbconf(#o3)` as `move_base` also requires an initial base configuration, which is also not provided.
