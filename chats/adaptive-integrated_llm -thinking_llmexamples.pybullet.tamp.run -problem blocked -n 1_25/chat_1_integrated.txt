User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.57, 0.102), (-4.478, 0.194)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.524, 0.148, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.551, 0.834).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Geometric Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires placing an object of type `v17` onto surface `v18`. I know that the object must be either `v8` or `v12`, as these are the only objects of type `v17`. To achieve the goal, I must place *either* `v8` *or* `v12` onto surface `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see that I can derive `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v14)`, and `on(v15, v11)`. The plan requires me to get `v8` or `v12` to `v18`, so I must achieve either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`. Achieving `on(?obj, ?surface)` means `?obj` has to be at a particular pose `#o2` supported by the surface.
           
           To create a plan, I need to look at my tools. I can either: `(pick ...)` and `(place ...)` or move the base using `(move_base ...)`
           
           Based on the initial state, I can pick and place objects and move the robot base. I see that `v8` is currently supported by `v11` at pose `v9`, while `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v14`.  I need `v8` or `v12` to be supported by surface `v18`. From the initial state and kinematic relationships, it looks like `#o3` and `v3` are the relevant base configurations for my tools.
           
           To place `v8` on `v18`, I must satisfy its preconditions. The preconditions involve the robot configuration, the robot’s grip, and whether the current pose is safe for placement and approach. Given the kinematic inverse, the correct configuration must also involve the `#o3` configuration. It also states the object needs to be contained by the surface it's on.
           
           If I were to pick `v8` at pose `v9` and try to place it on `v18` at pose `#o2`, I would need to find the specific location for `#o2`, which in turn would need `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v8, #o2)` to be true.
           
           I have information on Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the objects and the surface.  `v8` has an AABB, `v12` has an AABB, and `v18` has an AABB.  I need to use these for a valid placement.  For a valid placement, I need to choose an XY location for `#o2` such that `v8` fits within `v18`.  Given the current configuration, for any valid placement of `v8` or `v12` *on* `v18`, there must be an overlap between the XY ranges of the AABB for `v8` or `v12` and the AABB for surface `v18`.
           
           Unfortunately, the XY dimensions of surface `v18` do *not* contain the dimensions of `v8` *or* `v12`. Because the AABBs indicate that `v8` (or `v12`) can't possibly fit within `v18`, this would mean I cannot satisfy the constraint to `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` -- the only options to satisfy the goal. If there is no overlap in the XY dimensions, then a stable placement is impossible.  Therefore, I cannot devise a plan to achieve the goal, as it's impossible to satisfy `new-axiom@0()` given the geometry of the scene.
