           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, -0.335), (4.535, -0.265)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.57, 0.102), (-4.478, 0.194)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.524, 0.148, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.551, 0.834).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My goal is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which requires me to get an object of a specific type (v17) to be "on" another object (v18).  I can see that both object `v8` and `v12` are of this type. My plan needs to involve either `v8` or `v12`, or both, being placed on `v18`. From the initial state I see that either `v8` is on `v11` at a `pose v9` or `v12` is somewhere at `pose v13`, where `v11` contains a part `v18`. `v8` is supported by two objects, the current pose v9, or a different object #o2. `v12` has similar supporting objects in the initial state.
           
           To satisfy the `on` predicate, I need to find the `supported` preconditions. I will use the "on" definition of `supported` and `atpose`. `v18` already supports v8 at `p3`. I need to move the `v8` from its current pose `v9` to `p3`. This will require some actions from the robot manipulator, or arm v4. From the kin relations (pick and place) I see that I can pick up `v8` from pose `v9` and place it at `p3`.  Therefore, I will choose to pick up `v8` and place it at `p3`, which is supported by `v18`.
           
           My plan will be a sequence of actions from a robot with an arm to move `v8` on to `p3`.
           1.  **Move Base:**  The base must move from its initial configuration (v3) to a configuration (#q0) from which the arm can pick up `v8` from pose `v9`.  This is a move_base action.  I believe the interpretation of canmove is correct and it is a mutex, but I will assume after each base or arm motion canmove is set to true.
           2.  **Pick Up:** The arm (v4) will pick up object `v8` from its current position `v9` with a pick action. I believe the interpretation of canmove is correct and it is a mutex, but I will assume after each base or arm motion canmove is set to true.
           3.  **Move Base:** The base must move from the previous config (#q0) to another (#q1) for the arm to place `v8` at the goal position `p3`. This is a move_base action.  I believe the interpretation of canmove is correct and it is a mutex, but I will assume after each base or arm motion canmove is set to true.
           4.  **Place:**  The arm (v4) will place object `v8` at the desired position `p3` using a place action.
           
           The key considerations for this plan are ensuring the robot base and arm can perform the movements (using the "kin" relations, basemotion relation, etc.) and that `canmove()` is true when it is needed. I believe the standard interpretation is the correct approach to ensure this can be handled.
           
           The initial conditions and preconditions are satisfied. Since `canmove()` starts in the initial state, I will interpret the semantics as after each action finishes, `canmove()` is set to true. The plan's effectiveness relies on an implicit state transition after each base or arm action to set `canmove()` to true.
