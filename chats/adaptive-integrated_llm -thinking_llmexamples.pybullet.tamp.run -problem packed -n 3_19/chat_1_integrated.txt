User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.203, -0.025), (0.294, 0.066)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.281, -0.498), (-0.201, -0.418)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.249, 0.02, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.829, 0.56).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.119, -0.394), (0.208, -0.305)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.458, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.759, 0.651).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.164, -0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.815, 0.579).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement**
           
           My goal is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. They're currently situated on `v11`, and I need to maneuver them to their final resting place. The 'on' predicate is key here, tied to the concepts of support and pose. To achieve `on(vX, v16)`, I must find a way to make sure `supported(vX, ?p, v16)` and `atpose(vX, ?p)` hold true for each of those objects. The planner has provided available support relations for placement on v16. However, there are no constraints on base movement, thus I will keep the base at v3. 
           
           The strategy is simple: I'll use the available robot arm, `v4`, to pick each object from its initial location and place it on `v16`. Since both arms are initially 'handempty,' and only `v4` has a corresponding `kin` predicate, and I will be using v4 to pick and place. There are no restrictions to base movement, and no move_base predicate is required. This problem requires no planning for movement of the robot. This means I'll be working in place and I have the kinematics for each action.
           
           Now, the placement on `v16` is where it gets interesting. I need to handle a case where each object is supported at a given pose, this should mean I will be providing a distinct continuous value for the pose for each of the objects. Since `v16` has dimensions, it is not a dummy surface; so, it is okay to directly provide a pose on `v16`.
           
           The given AABB are:
           -   v16 has an AABB of  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           -   v8 AABB = ((0.203, -0.025), (0.294, 0.066))
           -   v14 AABB = ((-0.281, -0.498), (-0.201, -0.418))
           -   v12 AABB = ((0.119, -0.394), (0.208, -0.305))
           
           The robot is able to perform both picking and placing actions based on provided kinematic information.
           
           For `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, I will pick them from `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, then put them at distinct calculated positions on v16. The calculations for those poses are collision-free and they take into account the AABB of all objects.
           
           Here's the planned action sequence and associated poses:
           
           **--Plan--**:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           **--Poses--**:
           (#o2 v8 v16): (-0.0895 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v12 v16): (0.0005 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v14 v16): (0.085 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           
           This plan ensures I achieve the final state by correctly ordering `pick` and `place` steps for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` using the robot arm `v4`. The continuous values associated with the pose placeholder `#o2` are unique for each object on `v16`. The poses have been placed to keep collision-free space.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very specific action to work with: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  It seems the system is only letting me move the robot's base, which, for all intents and purposes, doesn't actually *do* anything useful.
           
           My goal, as I understand it, is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) all positioned *on* a specific surface (`v16`).  Looking at the initial state, it's clear these objects are currently resting on `v11`, a surface presumably near their starting poses.
           
           The action I'm given, `move_base`, is effectively a no-op. It moves the base... to the *same* position.  It doesn't pick up or place any objects. It only resets `canmove` to true and false. It's essentially just resetting the base from an error state. Given the current setup, and without any way to manipulate the objects (pick them up, move them, place them), there's simply no way to change the state to meet the goal condition. The required `on(object, v16)` predicates are unattainable with this limited action set.  I need actions that allow for object manipulation, namely pick and place actions.
