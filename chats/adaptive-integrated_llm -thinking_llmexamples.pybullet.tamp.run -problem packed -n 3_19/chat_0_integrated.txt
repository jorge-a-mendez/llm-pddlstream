User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.203, -0.025), (0.294, 0.066)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.249, 0.02, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.829, 0.56).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.119, -0.394), (0.208, -0.305)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.458, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.759, 0.651).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.281, -0.498), (-0.201, -0.418)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.164, -0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.815, 0.579).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom canmove()
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)

           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)

           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning About an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I understand it. I'm given a goal: to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  This translates to ensuring they're all supported by and *at* a specific pose on `v16`. My initial state tells me these objects are currently on `v11`. It looks like they're all stackable on `v16`, which is good.  I also have robot arms and a base configuration.
           
           The critical issue is the *actions* I'm allowed to use.  I'm given a very specific list of "valid action instances." The ONLY instance allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. That's it. It effectively does nothing of value.
           
           To achieve my goal, I need to *pick* the objects from `v11` and *place* them on `v16`. This requires `pick` and `place` actions that I don't have.
           
           I checked for continuous parameters as the prompt directs, thinking perhaps I'm meant to build my own "pick" and "place" actions from that information. This gave potential grasps and poses. But then I re-read the crucial instruction. The instructions are super clear: I *must* only use actions on the valid list.
           
           The rule explicitly says, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The provided list consists solely of the useless move action. I do not have pick or place actions.
           
           The definition of "on" requires an object to be *at* a supported pose on the surface. Since I can't move the objects, I can't meet this condition.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the goal is *unreachable*. I cannot construct a valid plan that achieves the desired state. I need to explain *why* it's unreachable. The "valid action instances" simply don't include the necessary `pick` and `place` actions for the current objects. I can't build any valid plan. I'm unable to pick, or place the objects on `v16` using the given action list. This makes the goal impossible.
