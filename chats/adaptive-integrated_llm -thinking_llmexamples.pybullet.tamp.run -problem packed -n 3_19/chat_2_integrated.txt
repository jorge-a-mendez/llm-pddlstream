User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.203, -0.025), (0.294, 0.066)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.281, -0.498), (-0.201, -0.418)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.249, 0.02, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.829, 0.56).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.119, -0.394), (0.208, -0.305)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.458, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.759, 0.651).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.164, -0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.815, 0.579).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. The objective is clear: get three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all settled onto surface `v16`. Currently, they're huddled together on `v11`.
           
           First, let's break this down. The key is to move each object independently. We'll be using the robot's arm, `v4`. It's a pick-and-place strategy. 
           
           To pick up an object, a set of preconditions need to be met.  The arm must be empty, the base needs to be positioned correctly, and there can't be collisions in the approach trajectory.  The place action has a similar set of requirements.
           
           We'll start with moving `v8`, then do the same for `v12` and finally `v14`.  I need to get the robot base to a certain configuration (`#o3`) for picking and placing. We can use the available `move_base` action.
           
           The initial state provides all the necessary knowledge: The arm starts empty, and the base is in a particular configuration. The available actions and their effects are now clear.
           
           Here's the planned sequence:
           1.  **Move the Base**: Move the robot base to the necessary configuration for this task.
           2.  **Pick `v8`**: Pick up `v8` from its current pose.
           3.  **Place `v8`**: Move `v8` to its target pose on `v16`.
           4.  **Pick `v12`**: Pick up `v12` from its current location.
           5.  **Place `v12`**: Place `v12` onto `v16`, avoiding any collisions with `v8`.
           6.  **Pick `v14`**: Pick up `v14`
           7.  **Place `v14`**: Finally, move `v14` onto `v16`, making sure there are no problems.
           
           One thing to be careful about: The available actions and their parameters. It's about providing the right continuous values for the "place" operation on `v16`, which requires the values to be non-overlapping (no collision).
           
           Now, to make sure everything works perfectly, I need to provide the coordinates in the right format.
           *   `v8`: (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           *   `v12`: (0.0 0.09 0.781 0.0)
           *   `v14`: (0.0 -0.09 0.781 0.0)
           That's the plan. All the details are checked. The result will be to achieve the desired configuration. I'm all set!
