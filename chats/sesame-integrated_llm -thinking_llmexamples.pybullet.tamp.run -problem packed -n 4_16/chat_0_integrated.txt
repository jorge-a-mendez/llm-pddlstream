           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.02, -0.334), (0.076, -0.238)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.227, -0.471), (-0.128, -0.372)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.143, 0.326), (0.217, 0.4)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.049, 0.496), (0.049, 0.594)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.028, -0.286, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.966, -0.258).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.178, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.938, 0.347).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.18, 0.363, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.027).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.0, 0.545, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.952, 0.306).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. The main objective is to position four specific objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto a designated surface, v18. Initially, these objects are resting on another surface, v11, each at a specific pose. To make this happen, I'll leverage the "on" axiom, derived from the "supported" and "atpose" predicates. This essentially means I've got to arrange each object at a stable and collision-free location on v18.
           
           Initially, the robot's arm (v4) is idle, and its base is at v3. The robot's kinematic relationships (kin predicates) tell me where to grasp and place objects, and the available actions include pick, place and `move_base`. Given the initial configuration, I'll need to use the `move_base` action if the base needs to be re-positioned.  The common base configuration for all the object transfers from v11 to v18 will be denoted as #o3.
           
           Let's break down the process. I will need to pick each object, one at a time, from its current location, and then carefully place it on v18.
           
           The initial plan is to:
           1.  Move the base to the target configuration (#o3)
           2.  Pick v8
           3.  Place v8 at a calculated pose on v18.
           4.  Pick v12
           5.  Place v12 at a calculated pose on v18.
           6.  Pick v14
           7.  Place v14 at a calculated pose on v18.
           8.  Pick v16
           9.  Place v16 at a calculated pose on v18.
           
           Before I commit to this plan, I need to make sure the preconditions are met at each step of the way. Notably, I've got to compute valid poses (#o2) for each object on v18. The problem asks that each `#o2` pose be unique for each object.
           
           I'm interpreting the object AABBs relative to the origin of the object - that the given AABB values reflect an object's footprint if it were centered at (0, 0). I will interpret the pose coordinates as the world coordinates of the object's center. To fulfill the plan, I need to make the poses for each object to be stable placement within v18, and I will be using the coordinate system as stated.
           
           I've determined I can place all of them without rotation on v18:
           
           - v8: (0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v12: (-0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v14: (0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v16: (-0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With this information, I can proceed with a high degree of confidence.
