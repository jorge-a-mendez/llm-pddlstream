           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  To break it down, I need to make sure each object is both supported and positioned on v16.  Essentially, I need to move each object (v8, v12, and v14) from their current position on `v11` to the desired location on `v16`.
           
           My first thought is, this involves picking up each object and then placing it down.  The state I'm given, however, only lists one possible action: `move_base`.  This action, based on its definition, has no effect on an `on` relation between objects. In fact, the only actions that *can* change the position of objects relative to one another are `pick` and `place`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that the objects are currently `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, and `on(v14, v11)`.  In order to move them, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions, which are not available.  The problem description is very clear: I'm only allowed to use the actions provided.
           
           I've carefully re-read the setup.  The task specifically says any actions not in the given list are forbidden.  Thus, the goal is unachievable given the available actions.  The lack of necessary actions is a hard constraint.  Even if I were to outline the steps - pick up, move arm, place - I lack the fundamental building blocks to build a valid plan.  There's no way to modify the positions of the objects using the one permitted action, and that's the bottom line.
