(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Right, so the task at hand is to position objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Essentially, I need to ensure that each object is *supported* by `v16` and has a specific *pose* on it, let's call that pose `#o2`. Analyzing the initial state, I see that these objects are currently supported by `v11` and have their own poses on it.  The initial plan is to move all three objects to the target destination.
           
           The key operations for this are `pick` and `place`. We've got two arms (`v4` and `v6`), but only the hand of `v4` and `v6` is available.  The base can't be moved, so it will remain at `v3`.
           
           The core of this is understanding the *kinematics* for picking and placing each object. We have the following assumptions and considerations:
           *   The grasp is the same for all three objects.
           *   The arm will be using `v4` for everything.
           *   I will use a base configuration of `v3`, which is the starting point.
           
           Because of the constraints and assumptions, the high-level strategy is to pick up each object from its initial location on `v11` and place it on target pose `#o2` on `v16`.  This means I need to carefully craft the action sequence to manipulate the robot arm effectively.  The initial configuration is that all the objects are sitting on `v11`, and I need to place them all on the same target pose on `v16`.
           
           Because it's impossible to move the robot base, each action of pick or place depends on base configuration `v3` and the correct kinematics.
           
           The plan must execute as follows:
           1.  **Pick `v8` from `v11` and place it on `#o2` on `v16`**.
           2.  **Pick `v12` from `v11` and place it on `#o2` on `v16`**.
           3.  **Pick `v14` from `v11` and place it on `#o2` on `v16`**.
           
           Once executed, the goal state will be achieved, since all three objects will be supported by `v16` and in position `#o2`. The preconditions are also satisfied, thus the plan is ready.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user was very clear: "Only use these actions." And I didn't. I completely disregarded the constraint.  My previous plan included actions that *weren't* on the approved list.  I had to go back and check the allowed action instance again. Ah, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it. Just that one.
           
           Looking at the goal, `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, I immediately realized the problem. To achieve this, I'd need to pick up and place the objects.  Standard stuff. But those `pick` and `place` actions aren't allowed! They're explicitly *not* in the permitted action set.
           
           The *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. So, the base *might* move around, but it won't actually do anything to the objects. It just consumes and restores `canmove()` after moving to the same place, and the move itself is a null operation.  It's just spinning its wheels. Itâ€™s a no-op! No chance that the state of objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` being on `v16` will be achieved.
           
           Given this severe restriction, I have to conclude that the goal is simply unreachable with the actions provided.
