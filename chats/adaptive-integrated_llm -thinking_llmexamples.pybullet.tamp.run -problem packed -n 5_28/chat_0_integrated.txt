User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.198, -0.398), (-0.111, -0.311)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.293, 0.454), (-0.202, 0.546)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.191, 0.017), (0.287, 0.112)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.296, -0.574), (-0.197, -0.475)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.155, -0.355, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.598, 0.801).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.099, 0.331), (0.196, 0.428)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.248, 0.5, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.553, 0.833).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.239, 0.065, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.253, 0.968).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.246, -0.525, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.353, 0.936).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.148, 0.379, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.883, 0.469).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. My objective is to place a group of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto another object, v20. It's clear that v20 is a small surface based on its AABB dimensions. Currently, all these objects are resting on v11, a larger surface.  The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), initially both empty and in their home configuration. The base is also in a known state.
           
           The core of the problem lies in the actions I'm *allowed* to use. The only valid action instance is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which is effectively a no-op. I'm given the option of `pick` and `place` actions in the domain, but they aren't available as instantiated actions in the given list of valid instances, meaning I *cannot* use them.
           
           The goal hinges on changing the `atpose` predicate of each object to a state on `v20`. For example, to get `on(v8, v20)`, I'd need to find a pose for v8, which is supported on v20.  However, without `pick` and `place`, I can't move these objects from their initial poses (on v11) to anywhere else, let alone onto v20. The `pick` and `place` actions are the only actions capable of changing the `atpose` state.
           
           I'm constrained by the rule: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Since `pick` and `place` are absent from the list, the goal is simply unattainable. It's a classic case of an unsolvable problem given the limited actions.  The requirement to place these objects onto a new surface cannot be fulfilled with the restriction that only base movement is allowed.
