           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.525, 0.123), (-4.437, 0.211)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, 0.167, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.16, 0.987).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to New-Axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to get an object of a certain type onto a specific surface – that's the gist of `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I see I need to manipulate an object (`?green`) to be "on" surface `v18`. Since I'm presented with two potential objects, `v8` and `v12`, both meeting the type criteria, I'll *assume* it's better to choose `v8`, since its initial pose `v9` is close to the surface, and its geometry seems simpler. From here, I will move v8 to a new position `#o2`.
           
           Examining the starting setup, I see `v8` is presently on a different surface `v11` at pose `v9`.  The initial setup also shows that there is a defined robot hand, base and arm kinematics, configurations, and a trajectory plan.
           
           Given the existing available actions, a logical path materializes: a base movement, then a pick action followed by a place action. It is better to move the base because `pick` and `place` require a specified robot base configuration `atbconf(#o3)`. Before I can make the arm motions, it looks like `atbconf(v3)` has to be converted to `atbconf(#o3)`, and this is where I need to start. So let's look at the plan to get there.
           
           The base motion can be accomplished by using the `move_base` action.
           
           -   The `move_base` action will move the base from initial configuration `v3` to target configuration `#o3` which has the robot's kinematics at the right position to perform a pick and place.
           -   Now, `v8` at pose `v9` can be picked with the arm and gripper with the `pick` action.
           -   The last action will be to `place` `v8` at the target pose `#o2`. The initial set-up suggests that the place target is surface `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the pre-conditions, it is clear that I'll need to assume some things about continuous parameters like collision and trajectory safety, but I'm able to safely execute my actions given the parameters. After moving, I would get to the target state which would fulfill the condition `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           The final puzzle piece is the pose value for `#o2`. To make `v8` be `on(v18)`, I must situate it correctly on the table. The existing data points to putting it somewhere in the center of `v18`. From the AABB data, this leads me to place v8 at (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0). This completes my analysis.
