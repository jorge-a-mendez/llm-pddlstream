User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.468, -0.484), (4.506, 0.739)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.525, 0.123), (-4.437, 0.211)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, 0.167, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.16, 0.987).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q0', '#t4'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t1', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan to Achieve the Goal `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having object `?green` be both *on* a surface and of *type* `v17`. After analyzing the initial state, I've determined that `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`, but for simplicity, I'll focus on `v8`. Therefore, my plan aims to place `v8` *on* `v18`.
           
           To achieve this, I need to use the `on(?o, ?r)` axiom, which requires that `v8` is *supported* by some pose that is *atpose* `v8`. The initial state provides the necessary kinematic configurations and poses for `v8`. Specifically, to `on(v8,v18)` I need `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.  The initial state contains `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, so I need to place `v8` *at* the pose `#o2`.
           
           Crucially, `v8` is currently at pose `v9`.  Therefore, I need to pick `v8` from pose `v9` and place it at `#o2`. The issue is, there's another object (`v15`) at a pose, and there exists a risk of a collision.
           
           **Initial Plan and Obstacles**
           
           My initial plan was straightforward: move the base to a suitable configuration, pick `v8` from `v9`, and place it at `#o2`. However, I need to avoid picking an object if there exists another graspable object.
           
           **The Problematic Predicate and its Implications**
           
           The `pick` action has a critical precondition: `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. The `new-axiom@0` axiom states that `new-axiom@0(?o)` is true if *any* graspable object exists other than `?o`. Given that `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are all graspable, the negation of this axiom (a precondition for picking) is **always** false for `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`.  This meant that my simple "pick and place" strategy would not work because it would fail at the `pick` action.
           
           **The Solution: Clearing the Obstacle**
           
           To resolve this, I need to clear the way for `v8`. Since a collision occurs if I pick `v8` directly. I need to move `v15` from its current location. Therefore, my revised plan becomes:
           1. **Move Base:** I need to position the robot's base at configuration `#o3` which has a specific coordinate. My coordinate for `#o3` is `(4.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           2. **Move the base to a safe place config:** I am using this action, with a base config value that is at (4.0, 0.0, 0.0), which I am assigning the name `#o3`.
           3. **Pick v15:**  I will need to use a pick action `pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           4. **Place v15:** Next, I will place this object at some safe pose on surface v11 via a place action with the command `place v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The pose I am using for `v15` is `(4.7, -0.5, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           5. **Pick v8:**  Finally, I will pick object `v8` using action `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           6. **Place v8:** I can now place object v8 at #o2 using action `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` with `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           This plan satisfies the goal `new-axiom@0()` as after the final action, the object `v8` will be on a surface and it's type will be `v17`.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan and Rationale**
           
           Alright, after meticulously reviewing the feedback and iterating on the plan, I've arrived at a robust solution. The key issue was a collision between object 'v15' and table 'v18' when 'v15' was placed temporarily.  My initial attempt to place 'v15' at (4.7, -0.5, 0.8) on table 'v11' caused this collision. The collision stems from the fact that 'v18' partially overlaps 'v11', and the initial placement of 'v15' was within the (x,y) boundaries of 'v18'.
           
           Therefore, I needed to relocate 'v15' to avoid this collision.  I chose a new temporary location on 'v11' at coordinates (4.7, 0.4, 0.8, 0.0), which is outside the 'v18' area, ensuring no overlap and no collision.
           
           Furthermore, I have clarified the use of the '--Poses--:' section. The key is that the section specifically lists *object poses* used by the planner. The base configuration 'o3', while crucial to the plan's execution, is not an object pose. It is a base configuration for the 'move_base' action. I am also sure that the chosen base position (4.0 0.0 0.0) is reasonable.
           
           Here’s the refined plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` - Move the robot's base to a position where it can reach the target objects and surfaces, with a base position of (4.0 0.0 0.0) where #o3 = (4.0 0.0 0.0).
           2.  **Pick:** `pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Pick 'v15' from its initial pose 'v16'.
           3.  **Place (Temporary):**  `place v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Place 'v15' at the temporary pose `#o2` on table 'v11', with #o2 v15 v11: (4.7 0.4 0.8 0.0).
           4.  **Pick:**  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Pick the target object 'v8' from its starting position 'v9'.
           5.  **Place (Final):**  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Place 'v8' at its final pose `#o2` on the target surface 'v18', with #o2 v8 v18: (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0).
           
           This plan addresses the collision issue and aligns with the required format. The continuous values for `#o2` are provided for each relevant object and surface. The plan ensures that the 'v15' object does not cause any collisions. The goal, ultimately, is to place the object 'v8' on surface 'v18' to fulfill the intended axiom.
           
           Therefore, the plan is ready for execution, addressing all identified issues and optimizing the path for successful completion.

           1.  **Move Base:**  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` - Move the robot's base to a position where it can reach the target objects and surfaces, with a base position of (4.0 0.0 0.0) where #o3 = (4.0 0.0 0.0).
           2.  **Pick:** `pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Pick 'v15' from its initial pose 'v16'.
           3.  **Place (Temporary):**  `place v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Place 'v15' at the temporary pose `#o2` on table 'v11', with #o2 v15 v11: (4.7 0.4 0.8 0.0).
           4.  **Pick:**  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Pick the target object 'v8' from its starting position 'v9'.
           5.  **Place (Final):**  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Place 'v8' at its final pose `#o2` on the target surface 'v18', with #o2 v8 v18: (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0).
           
           This plan addresses the collision issue and aligns with the required format. The continuous values for `#o2` are provided for each relevant object and surface. The plan ensures that the 'v15' object does not cause any collisions. The goal, ultimately, is to place the object 'v8' on surface 'v18' to fulfill the intended axiom.
           
           Therefore, the plan is ready for execution, addressing all identified issues and optimizing the path for successful completion.
