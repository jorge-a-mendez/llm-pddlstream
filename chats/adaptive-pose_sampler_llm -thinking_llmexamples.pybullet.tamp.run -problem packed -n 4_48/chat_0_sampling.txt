(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: 50 Stable Configurations**
           
           Alright, I've got this. The goal is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 6, which is a square (dimensions 0.0728x0.0728), on surface 0. Surface 0 is a square AABB defined by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't influence its bounding box, so I can set theta to 0 for simplicity.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center (x, y) such that it remains within the surface's boundaries. I calculated the half-width and half-height (both 0.0364) and determined that the center's x and y coordinates must fall within -0.0985 and 0.0985.
           
           To achieve 50 unique placements, I'll use a grid-based approach. I'll create a 7x8 grid, which will provide 56 potential placement points. This grid is defined by equally spaced x and y values within the valid ranges I calculated. The x values go from -0.0985 to 0.0985, increasing by ~0.0328. The y values also range from -0.0985 to 0.0985, increasing by ~0.0282.
           
           I'll then select any 50 of these points to produce the requested output. For each point, the corresponding surface index will be 0, and theta will be 0.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that the previous placement for Object 6 was successful, meaning it didn't collide with anything fixed. Not relevant here, since no fixed obstacles. Now, I need to figure out where to place Object 5, which is a bit trickier because it needs to avoid colliding with Object 6, which is already in place.
           
           First, I calculated the valid area for Object 5 on Surface 0, taking into account the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries. Basically, I found the allowable X and Y ranges for the object's center point. The object is square and there is no specified theta, so I can keep the theta = 0 for all calculations.
           
           Next, I determined the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of the already-placed Object 6, to define the no-go zone. Now, the main challenge is to find 50 different locations for Object 5 that fit within Surface 0, but *don't* overlap with Object 6's AABB.
           
           To solve this, I systematically thought about the following:
           
           1.  **Define the Collision Condition:** I figured out the exact coordinates where Object 5 would collide with Object 6's AABB. I did this by making sure no part of the AABB would overlap.
           2.  **Define the Collision Free Region:** I then calculated the areas where the *center* of Object 5 could not reside so that it wouldn't collide with Object 6.
           3.  **Generate Candidate Points:** I devised a grid-based approach to generate potential placements. I created a grid of points within the valid surface area, with rows and columns and the intention of checking these points for collisions.
           4.  **Collision Check:** Finally, for each grid point, I performed a collision check using the defined collision conditions and excluded the colliding points.
           5.  **Placement Selection:** I knew that Object 6 was in the bottom left, so I needed the grid points to not be in the bottom left either. The final 50 valid placements are created to be non-overlapping with the object already placed.
           
           From this systematic approach, I will determine the final non-colliding locations for the remaining 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **1. Placement Problem: Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to place Object ID 4 on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with Object ID 6 or Object ID 5, and get 50 stable placements. I've got the AABB for Surface 0 and the dimensions of Object 4, which I can use to figure out the valid range for the center of Object 4 on the surface, keeping it *within* the surface bounds.
           
           **2. Collision Zones and Constraints**
           
           Now, I'm thinking about the obstacles. Object 6 and Object 5 have already been placed. I need to calculate the *collision zones* around them. These zones are basically the areas where the center of Object 4 can't be because a collision would occur. I need to take the dimensions of Object 4 into account and 'dilate' the existing objects by Object 4's half dimensions to get this 'collision zone'.
           
           **3.  Grid-Based Placement and Collision Checking**
           
           I'm thinking of creating a 2D grid of points within the valid area of Surface 0. Then, I can iterate over this grid and check if each grid point falls *inside* either of the collision zones I calculated. If a point is collision-free, I'll add that to my list of valid placements. I decided on a 10x10 grid. I need a robust method to filter out collision placements from all points on the grid.
           
           **4. Filtering Collisions and Final Placement Count**
           
           I realized that all collisions that exist with Object 6 also are collisions with Object 5.
           I iterated through the grid, now equipped with the collision zones. The logic works fine. Based on my calculation, only 45/100 points collide. This means there are 55 valid points. Selecting the first 50 points from the grid, that satisfy all of the non-collision conditions should be fine. I'll output the first 50 valid placements for Object 4! This way, the user can get a list of 50 collision-free placements on Surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Alright, my goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, making sure they don't collide with the obstacles already placed: IDs 6, 5, and 4. I'll take a methodical approach, starting with the geometry.
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement area on Surface 0. It's a simple rectangular region with bounds defined. Then, I calculate Object 7's dimensions and its "half-dimensions" since I'm working with center coordinates.
           
           Next, I figure out the boundaries for Object 7's center. I simply use the surface boundaries, subtracting the "half-dimensions" to avoid overstepping. This defines the overall space Object 7 can occupy.
           
           Now, the trickier part: avoiding collisions. For each of the existing objects (6, 5, and 4), I determine the *collision zone* – the area around each object that Object 7's center *cannot* occupy. To do this, I create the AABB for each object, and dilate them by Object 7's "half-dimensions". Since Object 7 is going to be a square and I know it's a fixed position, the rotation is 0. Then I intersect these collision zones with the surface bounds.
           
           The code generates two arrays called x_grid_coords and y_grid_coords that can be used to scan for valid placement points.
           
           I then use a 20x20 grid, rather than a 10x10, to look for valid placements. This grid generates coordinates that will be checked to see if they fall inside a collision zone.  I iterate through each of the three collision rectangles, checking the coordinates in the grid.
           
           Finally, by checking the grid points against the valid placement zones, I've got a list of center coordinates for Object 7. I need 50 points, and the algorithm identifies many more. I'll then select the first 50 points.
