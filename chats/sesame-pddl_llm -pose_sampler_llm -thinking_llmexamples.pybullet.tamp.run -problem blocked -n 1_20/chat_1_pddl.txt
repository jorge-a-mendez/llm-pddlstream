(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the `new-axiom@0()` Goal in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain.  I know that's a new axiom, so it likely represents a specific configuration I need to achieve.  First, I need to understand what this axiom actually means.  Looking at the definition, it's a conjunction of two atoms: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  This tells me I need an object that has a specific type and that's *also* placed on a specific other object.
           
           Now, I need to figure out which objects fit the bill in the initial state.  I quickly see that both `v8` and `v12` are objects of type `v17` based on the given information.  `v15` isn't relevant, as it doesn't have the appropriate type. So, my focus is on getting either `v8` or `v12` to be `on(v18)`.
           
           Next, I need to check the current state of those objects.  I see that currently neither `v8` nor `v12` are `on(v18)`.  Both are at some other locations, supported by other objects.  This means I'll need to use a `place` action, as this would be the action that would change the `on` predicate.
           
           To get `on(?, v18)`, an object needs to be placed at a pose that is supported by `v18`.  I find that `v8` can be supported by `v18` at pose `#p0` and `v12` is supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.  Therefore, I have a choice. I decide to pursue the plan of moving `v8` onto `v18` since it's the first option I see and the choice doesn't matter, as either plan that works would be sufficient.
           
           The current state says `v8` is at pose `v9`. The robot arm, `v4`, is currently handempty. My action sequence will be to pick `v8` up from `v9` and place it at `#p0`. To perform that sequence, I would first need to solve for any preconditions that are not satisfied in the initial state. The plan requires the `atbconf` of the base to change to match the `atbconf` needed for picking `v8`. Then, once that has been fixed, the robot can now pick `v8`. Then, to satisfy the `atbconf` required to place `v8`, I also need to move the base again and make sure that `v4` holds `v8`. Finally, after that, I can perform the place action, which will satisfy the requirements for `on(v8, v18)`. With `type(v8, v17)` already in the initial state, I will have satisfied the conjunction required for `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           To be thorough, I quickly consider an alternate route using `v12`. I see that the same sequence of base moves and arm manipulations would work, moving `v12` instead of `v8`. The choice doesn't fundamentally change the plan, so the initial option to move `v8` is a valid option.
           
           In summary, the necessary plan is a sequence of base and arm motions that will allow the robot to pick `v8` and move it to pose `#p0`. After placing `v8` at `#p0`, I can verify that `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied. That concludes this plan.
