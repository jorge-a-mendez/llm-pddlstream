(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I've got a task: place 50 instances of object 5, which is 0.07 x 0.07, stably on surface 0, defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Since this is a simple surface and a small object, I can go straight to a grid-based approach.
           
           First, I need to calculate the valid placement area on the surface. Taking into account the object's half-size (0.035), the object's center needs to be within the rectangle defined by x: 4.235 to 4.765 and y: -0.565 to -0.035.  The angle will be zero, as rotation won't change the object's effective footprint.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I'm going to create a grid within this usable area.  I figured a 7x8 grid, for a total of 56 placements, and then I'll just take the first 50.
           
           I'll calculate the x and y step sizes to evenly distribute the points within their ranges.
           
           For x, I will use 7 points from 4.235 to 4.765.  The step size is (4.765 - 4.235) / 6 = 0.0883333333.  The coordinates are 4.235 + i * step for i in range(7).
           
           For y, I will use 8 points from -0.565 to -0.035.  The step size is ((-0.035) - (-0.565)) / 7 = 0.0757142857.  The coordinates are -0.565 + j * step for j in range(8).
           
           Each placement will have the following:
           
           *   `surf_idx`: 0
           *   `theta`: 0
           *   `x`: taken from the calculated x-coordinates.
           *   `y`: taken from the calculated y-coordinates.
           
           I will simply output the first 50 results from this grid. All is stable since the grid point locations respect the bounding box. The object is stable in the new locations relative to the surface AABB.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My current thought process:**
           
           Okay, here's a new request. I need to place object ID 10, which is almost square, on surface 0.  I've got the extents:  `(0.09330833158205998, 0.09330833158206053)`. Let's call these `obj10_size_x` and `obj10_size_y`. I need to generate 50 stable placements. I'll need to calculate half-extents, the valid ranges on the surface, and account for the existing objects.
           
           First, I calculate the half extents of the object:  `obj10_half_x` and `obj10_half_y`, so `0.04665416579102999` and `0.046654165791030265` respectively.
           
           Then, calculate the valid range for the object's center on the surface given the surface bounds: `(4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)`.  This gives valid ranges of `4.246654 <= center_x <= 4.753345` and `-0.553345 <= center_y <= -0.046654`.
           
           Since the object is close to square, I won't worry about rotation.  I'll use `theta = 0`.  My plan is to generate a grid of potential placements within the valid ranges, and then check for collisions. I'll need a grid that creates around 50 placements.
           
           The x-range is approximately `0.5067`, and the y-range is also approximately `0.5067`.  I could use `7 steps` in `x` and `7 steps` in `y`, but that's only 49 placements, so I'll try an 8x8 or 9x8 to get over 50. I'll calculate the step sizes for each range.
           
           Now, I *must* avoid collision with the placements of the existing *object* with ID 5 (the ones that *are* already present). The provided list shows the existing object 5 placements.  I'll define a function to check for collisions, using the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) collision method.
           
           I'll iterate through each possible grid point and check for AABB collisions with each of the existing placements from object 5.  This means that any potential grid point that falls within the "collision zone" of any of the existing objects will be marked as invalid.
           
           Collision check parameters are:  `hx_10 = 0.04665416579102999` (obj10 half), `hy_10 = 0.046654165791030265`, `hx_5 = 0.035`, `hy_5 = 0.035`,  `sum_hx = 0.08165416579102999`, and `sum_hy = 0.081654165791030265`.  If the absolute difference between `center_x` for obj10 and obj5 is less than `sum_hx`, and the absolute difference between `center_y` is less than `sum_hy`, then collision.
           
           I recomputed and made a more careful examination, and it seems the *existing* placement *5* objects are close together along the first few y-coordinates.  Because of this density, many potential object 10 placements would collide.
           
           If I adjust to an 8x8 grid to accommodate all valid object 5 positions, I think it will be easier.
           
           I'll check for an 8x8 grid of positions, so x and y have 8 values each. 
           If the x-value doesn't overlap object 5, it's valid.
           If the x-value does overlap an existing object 5, there may be *y* collisions.
           
           The resulting 8x8 grid:  `x_coords = [4.24665416579103, 4.319038689850735, 4.391423213910441, 4.463
