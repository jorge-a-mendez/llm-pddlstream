           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.406, -1.192), (-1.302, -1.089)).
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.065, -0.609), (2.194, -0.48)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.653, 0.342), (0.784, 0.472)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.096, -0.668), (-1.992, -0.564)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.639, -0.793), (-1.533, -0.687)).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.294, -0.084), (1.396, 0.018)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.432, 2.123), (-0.351, 2.204)).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.219, 1.926), (-2.121, 2.024)).
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two landers (v9), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18). There is one camera (v10) which supports mode v11. Both rovers have the camera onboard and are free in store v16.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies that we need to satisfy several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover needs to take images of objective v17 and v18 in mode v11, and then send them to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: We need to sample a rock of type v2 and send its analysis.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: We need to sample a rock of type v6 and send its analysis.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the `receivedimage` goals:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
               - Rover v14 can take an image of v17 (`imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`). It also has camera v10 which supports mode v11. So we can use `calibrate` and `take_image`.
               - Then, rover v14 can send the image (`comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`).
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               - Rover v14 can take an image of v18 (`imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`). It also has camera v10 which supports mode v11. So we can use `calibrate` and `take_image`.
               - Then, rover v14 can send the image (`comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`).
               - Alternatively, rover v12 can also take image of v18 (`imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`) and send it.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`:
           - For `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
               - Rocks of type v2 are v1, v3, v4.
               - Rover v12 is above v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 at configuration #o5. Rover v14 is also above v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 at configuration #o5.
               - Let's choose `v4` as the rock of type `v2`. Rover v12 is at `atconf(v12, v13)`. To sample `v4`, rover v12 needs to be at `#o5`. This requires a move action. However, there is no `move` action that takes v12 from v13 to #o5 in the available actions.
               - Let's check rover v14. Rover v14 is at `atconf(v14, v15)`. To sample `v4`, rover v14 needs to be at `#o5`. There is no move action from v15 to #o5.
               - This is a critical issue. The `above` predicate is stated for `#o5` but there are no `motion` actions available to reach `#o5`. The only available `motion` actions are `(motion v14 v15 #o2 v15)` and `(motion v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, which mean staying in the current configurations. This implies that the rovers cannot move to the configurations where they are "above" the rocks. This also means that they cannot move to take pictures at `#o3` or send data at `#o0` if those are different from their current configurations `v13` and `v15`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations.
           - `conf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `conf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `conf(v12, #o5)` for `above` predicates
           - `conf(v12, #o0)` for `comvisible` predicates
           - `conf(v12, #o3)` for `imagevisible` predicates
           - `conf(v14, #o5)` for `above` predicates
           - `conf(v14, #o0)` for `comvisible` predicates
           - `conf(v14, #o3)` for `imagevisible` predicates
           
           The problem states that if a configuration starting with '#' is the second argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` and `conf(rover, #name)` is in the initial state, we must provide a continuous value.
           However, for `above`, the configuration `#o5` is only listed as `conf(v12, #o5)` and `conf(v14, #o5)`, but not necessarily where the rover is currently `atconf`. The only `atconf` are `v13` and `v15`. Since there are no `move` actions to move from `v13` or `v15` to `#o5`, the rovers cannot be `above` any rock. Therefore, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions cannot be performed. This makes the goal of `receivedanalysis(?r)` unreachable.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
