           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a near-square object (ID 7) on a square surface (ID 0).**  The object's x and y dimensions are almost identical, and the surface is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I need to determine the `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` values for these 50 placements.  The surface index will always be 0.  Since the object is nearly square, I can primarily focus on varying the x, y positions and slightly varying the rotation angle (`theta`) to show some diversity, although it won't drastically impact stability.
           
           To achieve this, I first calculate the valid range for x and y. I need to make sure the bounding box of the rotated object fits within the surface's boundaries. The most restrictive boundaries occur when the object is rotated by 45 degrees (pi/4). Therefore, I'll calculate the allowed range for x and y at theta = pi/4 to ensure all generated points are within the surface bounds.  Using these boundaries, I will create a grid of 5 x-coordinates and 5 y-coordinates within that range.  Then, I'll combine these x, y coordinates with 2 theta values: 0 and pi/4. This will create 50 unique placement configurations and provide some diversity in rotation.
           
           I'll use `x_coords = [-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]`, `y_coords = [-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]`, and `thetas = [0.0, math.pi / 4]`. This will give me a total of 5 * 5 * 2 = 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to find 50 stable and non-colliding placements for a new object (ID 6) on a surface. I've already confirmed the placement of object 7, and I need to avoid it. So, I need to consider its position and size.
           
           First, I need to know that object 7 is at `(-0.08, -0.08)` and its AABB is approximately `[(-0.116, -0.116), (-0.043, -0.043)]`.
           
           Next, I look at object 6. It's almost square, just like object 7. I know it can rotate at two angles, `0` and `pi/4`. I will compute the effective bounding boxes depending on the angles.  With that information, I need to ensure the placement does not collide with object 7.
           
           I will use my AABB collision check, making sure to avoid the range of object 7's AABB. I'll define my grid for valid `x` and `y` coordinates and then filter the ones that are valid for `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.
           
           So, I'm generating a list of possible centers, transforming those centers to the AABBs and then checking for any overlaps. The overlap check will use the bounding box calculations to identify and filter the valid placements to 50 locations.
           
           For the `theta = 0` I can use `[-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]`.
           
           For the `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), I will use `[-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]`. This will give me `7*7 + 5*5` potential placements from which I can identify the collision, and then filter valid placements to 50.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 5) on a 2D surface (surface 0). I need to account for two existing fixed obstacles (ID: 7 and ID: 6) and avoid collisions with them.  My expertise in this domain allows me to efficiently tackle this geometric problem.
           
           I begin by establishing the geometric context: the surface dimensions and the precise extents and locations of the fixed objects.  Object 7 is a rectangle at approximately (-0.08, -0.08) and Object 6 is centered near (0.0, -0.09). I'll calculate Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for these obstacles for fast collision checks.
           
           **Strategy and Implementation**
           
           The approach will involve systematically sampling the possible placements for the new object. For each position and orientation (theta), I'll:
           
           1.  Calculate the object's AABB based on its dimensions and current orientation. I am going to pre-calculate the boundaries by applying `cosine` and `sine` values.
           2.  Check if this candidate AABB lies entirely within the bounds of surface 0.
           3.  Then, check the candidate AABB for intersection with the AABBs of objects 7 and 6.
           
           If the candidate AABB is both within the surface boundary and free of collisions with the obstacles, it is a stable placement, and I'll record it.  This process will continue until 50 stable placements are identified.
           
           **Calculations and Optimization**
           
           I determine object 5's possible positions for a theta value of 0 and $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
           Since `size_x` and `size_y` values are nearly equal for the object (0.09892 and 0.09892), I can use their average for efficient calculation.
           Valid `(x, y)` locations will depend on rotation by using cosine and sine, therefore I will calculate `x` and `y` center constraints for each rotation angle.
           To improve the efficiency of collision checks I will use `AABB vs AABB` checks. I'm going to choose a grid of positions and orientations for these placements.  I have pre-calculated the obstacle AABBs using the provided data.
           
           Since some of the area of the object is taken up, I plan to create a grid of (x,y) positions for each rotation. I am prioritizing a sampling area which accounts for the area taken up by the existing objects.
           Since `theta = \frac{\pi}{4}` is the most restrictive of the 4 angles, I will define a center grid: `x,y = [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06]` to provide diversity in placement.
           
           **Execution and Refinement**
           
           For each combination of `x,y, theta` from the grid, I will execute the bounding box collision checks using my pre-calculated AABB coordinates. If the check indicates a collision with fixed obstacles, I reject the placement and move on.
           
           The main method will be, I get an AABB, `check collision` with obstacle AABBs, and if it collides then discard. Continue this process until 50 stable placements are found.
           
           I believe this will quickly yield the desired placements while accounting for the constraints and potential overlaps imposed by the fixed obstacles.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) onto Surface 0, ensuring 50 stable placements, while considering three pre-existing, fixed obstacles (IDs 7, 6, and 5).  The surface is a rectangular area: `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.
           
           My immediate thought is to consider the space available, taking into account the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of the existing obstacles and the dimensions of the new object.  The new object is nearly square, with extents of about `0.0743` in both the x and y directions. I'll need to calculate its *effective* dimensions, especially when rotated. This involves a little trigonometry to account for the object's orientation.
           
           I'll calculate the AABBs for each of the three existing obstacles, paying attention to their placement on the surface:
           
           *   **Object 7 (ID 7):** Positioned at (-0.08, -0.08), nearly at the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Its AABB will be a square.
           *   **Object 6 (ID 6):** Located at (0, -0.09) in the center of the surface but closer to the bottom edge.
           *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** Located at (-0.08, 0.08), nearly at the top-left corner of the surface.
           
           I'll use the collision check function to avoid placement overlap, which requires precise bounding box arithmetic, and the efficient computation of collision outcomes. I will use the established logic to prevent AABB overlap.
           I'll create a structured grid (likely, a Cartesian space) to test candidate placement points within the allowed surface area while at two orientations (`0` and `pi/4`).  I will then iterate over this grid and apply the aforementioned collision check.
           
           I will use two angles of rotation, `0` and `pi/4` (45 degrees), to provide diversity. Since the object is almost square, I expect these to cover the possible rotation cases.  At `0` degrees, the half dimensions are simply the object's half extents. At `pi/4`, I have to use the formula of the square root of 2 times the object's half size. With these rotations calculated I will check for the effective bounds that I must respect.
           
           I will then use the x and y dimensions to compute my placement grid. To avoid collision, I will constrain my search to just the appropriate portion of the surface.
           
           With 10 points in each coordinate dimension, that is, x and y, I will generate 100 placements.
           
           The placement algorithm has been tested with correct collision and placement checks. I will just execute the code to generate the stable points and ensure that there are at least 50 valid placements without collisions.

Model:     **Initial Assessment & Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) onto Surface 0, ensuring 50 stable placements, while considering three pre-existing, fixed obstacles (IDs 7, 6, and 5).  The surface is a rectangular area: `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`.
