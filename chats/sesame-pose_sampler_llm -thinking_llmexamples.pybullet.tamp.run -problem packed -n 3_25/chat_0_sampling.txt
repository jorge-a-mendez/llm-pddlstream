(Thoughts: **My Strategic Placement Plan**
           
           Okay, here's the approach I'll take. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for the object (ID 5) on surface 0, which is an AABB defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I'm going to leverage my understanding of AABBs and collision detection to efficiently solve this.
           
           First, I need to understand the object's geometry. The text specifies the object has dimensions `(0.089397487834674, 0.08939748783467394)`. These are effectively the dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), which I'll call `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y`.  A key assumption here, which I'll test later, is that these dimensions *don't* change with rotation. The wording "dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box" strongly implies the object's AABB is always axis-aligned, making the rotation angle (`theta`) more of a presentation detail rather than something that affects stability in this simplified scenario.
           
           To ensure the object is *contained* on surface 0, the center of the object (x, y) must stay within a safe range on the surface. Specifically, `x` has to be in the range `[-0.090301256082663, 0.090301256082663]` and `y` has to be in the range `[-0.09030125608266303, 0.09030125608266303]`. I'll confirm this visually. I will now generate a set of placements with this in mind.
           
           To achieve diversity and cover the surface space, I'll create a grid-like placement strategy. Since the object is nearly square, varying the `theta` may not significantly impact the containment requirements (if my earlier assumption is true). If I get collisions later, that suggests my assumption is wrong and I need to take the `theta` into consideration.
           
           I'm opting for a 5x5 grid (25 positions) and will then combine these with two different `theta` values (0 and pi/2). That gives me 25*2=50 positions total. I'll construct a 5x5 grid using the following x and y values:  `-0.090301256082663`, `-0.0451506280413315`, `0.0`, `0.0451506280413315`, and `0.090301256082663`, respectively.
           
           The final placements can then be generated by iterating x, then y, then theta.
           
           I am confident this approach will generate the required stable placements for the object.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for Object 4 on a flat surface, avoiding collision with Object 5 which is already placed. I know Object 5's AABB position is  `[-0.135, -0.0456...]` in X and `[-0.135, -0.0456...]` in Y. Object 4's dimensions are almost square (0.0864x0.0864), and it's rotation-agnostic, at least initially.
           
           My first step is to calculate the valid placement area for Object 4's center. Given the surface bounds of Surface 0, which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and object 4's size, I derive valid ranges for its center's X and Y coordinates. I need to take Object 5's position into account during this placement attempt.  I also need to create candidate points in the non-colliding surface area.
           
           Object 4's rotation becomes relevant. While the initial AABB will be the object's dimensions, I'll need to recalculate that based on rotation.
           
           Considering rotations, I'll test rotations of 0, pi/2, and pi/4, as I need diverse placements. Using the `x_center_candidates` and `y_center_candidates` lists that cover most of the surface area, I will loop through `theta` (0, pi/2, pi/4)
           
           For each rotation:
           
           1.  I calculate the new AABB dimensions based on the object size and the `theta`.
           2.  I use these values to create the current object's AABB using the candidate centers.
           3.  I use an `is_colliding` function to compare the AABB I generated in step 2 to object 5's AABB, to check whether these generated points overlap.
           4.  If there is no overlap (non-colliding), then I add it to the final list.
           
           After some analysis, I predict that many points in the first and second quadrants may be rejected. However, with three rotation angles and the candidate points covering the full surface area, I expect to generate at least 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a new object, Object 6, to place on Surface 0.  I need to avoid collisions with the previously placed Objects 5 and 4.  The surface is a simple rectangle.
           
           **1. Analyze the Space and Obstacles:**
           
           *   I'll start by figuring out where I *can't* put Object 6. I know the positions and AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of Objects 5 and 4. I'll need to figure out their union to define an obstacle region.
           *   I’ll calculate the AABBs for Object 6 with its current dimensions, and consider different rotations (0, pi/2, pi/4, and maybe other angles). The widest extents will be at pi/4 due to the square-like shape.
           
           **2.  Generate Candidate Placements:**
           
           *   I'm going to create a set of potential placements (x, y coordinates and rotation angle) within the surface. I’ll make sure the candidates are spaced out reasonably evenly across the valid area. I’ll use a denser grid to generate more placements (I'll refine the number of candidates as needed).
           *   For each candidate, I'll calculate the actual AABB of Object 6 for that specific rotation and position.
           
           **3.  Collision Detection and Filtering:**
           
           *   Then, for each candidate AABB, I'll rigorously check for collisions against both Object 5 and Object 4's AABBs.
           *   If there are no collisions and Object 6's AABB is contained within Surface 0, it's a valid placement and I will add it to my list.
           * I'll continue this process until I have found at least 50 unique valid placements.
           
           **4. Iterate and Refine**
           
           * To refine the candidates, I need to compute precisely the valid range within the surface using Object 5's and 4's AABB's. The strategy is to filter out the colliding candidates
           * From the computation, I will know which candidates need filtering.
           * Based on these steps, I can decide a good strategy to place Object 6 on the given surface.
           
           This should give me a good set of collision-free positions for Object 6! I'll keep adjusting this strategy if I run into any unexpected difficulties.
