           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placing the Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is a small square (7cm x 7cm), and the surface is a rectangle.  To keep things simple, I'll start with the object at 0 degrees rotation, meaning the sides are parallel to the surface edges. This simplifies my calculations for the object's boundaries, making sure it's fully inside the rectangle. I'll then vary the x and y coordinates of the object's center within the valid area of the surface. To ensure diversity, I'll also try a few placements with a 45-degree rotation, which will reduce the valid area slightly.  For the 0 degree rotations, I created a grid of 9 x 5 points, and then selected the corners and center for the 45 degree rotations. I'm confident these placements will be stable and fully contained within the surface, as they were carefully calculated.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 10**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 10, a square, on a surface without colliding with object ID 5, which is already placed. I've been given the size of object 10 and the location of object 5, along with the dimensions of the surface.
           
           First, I calculate object 10's half-size to determine the valid placement range on the surface. Object 5's position is known, and I need to avoid overlap.
           
           To avoid collision with object 5, I identify two distinct regions where object 10 can be placed:
           1.  **Right of Object 5:** I'll position the object horizontally beyond object 5's bounds, using the x-axis for separation.
           2.  **Above Object 5:**  I'll position the object vertically above object 5's bounds, using the y-axis for separation.
           
           I calculate valid ranges for the x and y coordinates by accounting for the half-size of object 10.
           I define the boundaries to be collision-free.
           
           I generate 50 points based on the above constraints.
           45 are aligned, and the last 5 are rotated by pi/4.
           
           This gives a total of 50 unique, collision-free placements.
