(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Selecting Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding three good positions for a robot base relative to a target point.  I need to ensure these positions meet some specific criteria: they must be within 2 units of the target, lie within the boundaries of the environment (-2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y), and crucially, avoid collisions with fixed obstacles while maintaining a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           First, I examined the environment's structure based on the provided fixed obstacle definitions. I identified that we are essentially working in a rectangular room with the central vertical obstacle (a thin wall at x=0) as the main challenge.  This central wall splits the space, and to avoid line-of-sight issues, the robot and the target need to be on the *same side* of this wall.
           
           For the given target at (1.0, 1.0), I determined the robot must be located at x > 0.05. I then brainstormed possible robot locations. To ensure diversity, I thought about placing candidate points along the cardinal and diagonal directions in respect to the target point, trying to generate diverse candidates. This is where I started to check for collision.
           
           After that, I made sure my candidate positions were in an appropriate distance from the target point and they were within my boundaries. The boundaries define my maximum range. To avoid collisions, I check the positions against the AABB definitions, and if they intersect, I modify. I considered that obstacles that were close to the boundaries might prevent collision, but to prevent it, I had to place my positions a bit farther away from these obstacles.
           
           Finally, I checked my positions to confirm that I satisfied all of the requirements. Specifically, line of sight was checked to ensure that the candidate positions and the target lay on the same side of the "central wall".
           
           Therefore, I have a three diverse and valid solutions.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Reassessment for a Challenging Target**
           
           I've got a new target, `(-0.3059, 2.0716)`, and this one presents a unique problem.  My previous attempts were based on an older target point, and they didn't account for the current scene geometry. After analyzing the scene, I've identified the target point is *inside* obstacle 10, a small square near the top-left of the room. This makes things tricky because it's impossible to have a clear line of sight to a target that is already considered to be "colliding." This essentially guarantees that any standard "line-of-sight" check would fail.
           
           My strategy needs to be adjusted. I still need to provide a set of potentially valid base positions, but the definition of "valid" is now less clear. I'm going to attempt to identify positions *very close* to the target, and *outside* of obstacle 10, hoping for some leniency in the line-of-sight check, or a deeper understanding of what the program considers a "collision" to mean in this context.
           
           I've gone through a careful analysis of the environment. I know that:
           
           *   The target is in the left half of the room (x < 0) and the robot must also be positioned in this half.
           *   The robot must be within a maximum distance of 2 from the target.
           *   It cannot collide with obstacles.
           
           Given the target’s location within obstacle 10, I've decided to place the robot *right next to* the obstacle in three different locations:
           1.  **To the Left:** `(-0.8, 2.0716)`:
               This is left of the target and obstacle 10, with a distance of `0.4941`. This location should avoid any collision with obstacles and provides a safe spot based on room bounds and is away from the wall.
           2.  **Below:** `(-0.3059, 1.65)`:
               With the x coordinate matching the target, and a y slightly below the obstacle `((-0.3059, 2.0716)`, which has a distance of `0.4216`. After evaluating, the point meets all room bound requirements.
           3.  **Above:** `(-0.3059, 2.3)`:
               With the x coordinate matching the target, and a y slightly above the obstacle `((-0.3059, 2.0716)`, which has a distance of `0.2284`. The location avoids any other potential obstacles and all room bound requirements.
           
           These three positions allow for three varying positions around the target point, and are well within the room constraints, and should avoid collision with the obstacle. I'm hoping that being *close* to the target will be enough, given the strange situation with the target being *inside* an obstacle.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Positioning for Target Acquisition**
           
           Okay, let's break down this complex spatial reasoning. I'm tasked with placing a robot to effectively view a target point while avoiding collisions. My recent attempts have highlighted some key challenges: specifically, the target's tendency to reside within obstacle AABBs, making line-of-sight tricky, and my past collision detection assumptions weren't precise enough to account for the robot's physical dimensions.
           
           The new target is (0.3415, 2.1303). It's in the right half of the room (x > 0), and—a familiar pattern—it's located within obstacle 9, the rectangle with corners (0.25, 1.75) and (0.75, 2.25).  This means direct line-of-sight is impossible and proximity will be problematic. I have to position the robot so it can see this point within a limited range (2), while also ensuring it stays clear of all obstacles. My previous, failed attempts showed that getting too close to an obstacle, even if the robot's center is *just* outside, often results in a collision.
           
           I've learned to anticipate this and apply a 'buffer' or 'clearance' around each obstacle. Given that the robot might be a square of 0.2 units (radius of 0.1), I must position the robot such that no part of the robot's square ever overlaps any part of the obstacle. The collision model checks for overlap in both x and y-ranges.
           
           So, let's create a more strategic plan.  I need to find valid robot positions:
           
           *   **(1) Outside obstacle 9:**
               - I can't go through the obstacle. I will attempt to place the robot in regions where line of sight will be clear.
               - Right (0.9, 1.6): This point provides a good line of sight to the target and a sufficient distance from other obstacles.
               - Below (0.4, 1.6) : I found the robot is outside obstacle 9 and to the right of the central wall. This is a possible position.
               - A position (1.9, 1.2): I found it's in the region I can use with an extra safe distance.
           
           I will use these three proposed robot positions for this target.
