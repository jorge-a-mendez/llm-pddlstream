User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x=0, and several smaller obstacles scattered around. Some obstacles are along the outer walls, and some are in the interior. Given the target point {target_point}, I need to find positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at this point. I'll prioritize positions that are not too close to the obstacles or the walls.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0] + 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 1.5})
