           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.025, -0.531), (0.056, -0.45)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).

           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.164, 0.295), (-0.088, 0.37)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.2, 0.386), (0.292, 0.478)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.015, -0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.996).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.013, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.553, 0.833).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.126, 0.332, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.039).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.246, 0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.838, 0.545).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically move four distinct objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) from their initial positions on table v11 to a designated surface, v18. I understand that the goal state is achieved when all four objects are successfully placed on v18, which requires ensuring both `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true for each object. The initial state provides the necessary details: the objects' current locations on v11, the properties of the objects (stackable), and the characteristics of the robot arm (v4) and its base (v3).
           
           Given the existing knowledge, I've identified the optimal plan: I will utilize the robot's pick-and-place capabilities to move each object. The key steps are: first, ensuring the robot base is configured at #o3 (which must be confirmed, since all picking/placing actions use this base); and then, executing a sequence of pick-and-place operations for each object.
           
           To execute this plan, I need to address several key considerations. Firstly, it is imperative to define distinct, collision-free locations within the acceptable range of v18 for each object (v8, v12, v14, and v16). Since the system requires a continuous value for `#o2` for each object, even if they share the symbolic name, I will carefully select coordinates that allow for each object to be placed on v18 without collision. Furthermore, since the initial robot base configuration is v3 and the system utilizes #o3 for the actions, a base motion is necessary before proceeding with the pick-and-place actions. The problem statement does not provide a value for #o3.
           
           Based on the initial information, I will construct my plan to fulfill the requirements:
           
           1.  **Robot Base Relocation:** Move the robot base from v3 to base configuration #o3.
           2.  **Object Relocation (Repeated)**:
               *   **Object v8**: Pick v8 from its initial location on v11 (specifically pose v9) and place it on v18 at the predetermined position within v18's constraints.
               *   **Object v12**: Pick v12 from its initial location on v11 (pose v13) and place it on v18 at its corresponding location.
               *   **Object v14**: Pick v14 from its initial location on v11 (pose v15) and place it on its designated location on v18.
               *   **Object v16**: Pick v16 from its initial pose on v11 (pose v17) and place it on its corresponding location on v18.
           
           By meticulously executing these pick-and-place actions, the plan will efficiently achieve the intended goal state, culminating in the successful relocation of all four objects onto the target surface, v18, resulting in `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.
