           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a surface defined as the AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  "Stable" here means the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries. Based on the problem description, I'm assuming that the provided dimensions are the object's AABB dimensions, and these dimensions *remain constant regardless of rotation*.  This is the most common interpretation and simplifies calculations.
           
           To ensure stability, I'll need to consider:
           
           1.  **Surface Index:**  Only surface 0 is relevant here.
           2.  **Rotation (theta):**  The rotation around the object's center (before rotation) can be any angle, so long as it *visually* rotates the object within its fixed AABB, since the dimensions are fixed.  I'll use a range of `theta` values for variety.
           3.  **Center Coordinates (x, y):**  These coordinates define the center of the object's AABB. I'll need to calculate the valid ranges for `x` and `y` to ensure the object stays within the surface bounds.
           
           Given the surface bounds and the object's dimensions, the center point must satisfy the following constraints:
           
           *   `x`:  Must be between `4.235` and `4.765`.
           *   `y`:  Must be between `-0.565` and `-0.035`.
           
           To generate 50 distinct placements, I'll use a grid-like approach within these valid ranges.  I'll use five evenly spaced `x` values and ten evenly spaced `y` values. Then, to make sure there are diverse orientations, I'll assign each pair of `(x, y)` coordinates a unique rotation angle (`theta`) from a set of eight values: `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi, 5*pi/4, 3*pi/2, 7*pi/4`. This ensures a variety of *visual* orientations for the object without affecting its underlying stable placement. I'll make sure to provide the precise coordinates as calculated.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Generating Placements for Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a new task: place Object ID 10 on Surface 0.  I remember that a previous placement of Object ID 5 at (0, 0, 4.235, -0.565) was successful. I'll note that down for future collision avoidance learning, though it's not relevant here since this is a new object.
           
           I need to create 50 stable placements for Object ID 10. The object is roughly square, with dimensions ~0.09 x ~0.09 (and precisely 0.09025712403064645, 0.09025712403064623).  This means the half-extents are approximately 0.045, and precisely `0.09025712403064645/2`, which I'll use in the calculation later. The surface bounding box is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  So, it's a matter of finding the correct (x,y) coordinates within this surface's bounds, while taking object size into account.
           
           First, I need to calculate the valid placement range for the object's center. To be fully within Surface 0, the object's center must be offset from the edges.  Given the object's half-extents, the valid x range is [4.2 + 0.045, 4.8 - 0.045], or [4.245128562015323, 4.754871437984677]. Similarly, the y range is [-0.6 + 0.045, 0.0 - 0.045], resulting in [-0.5548714379846769, -0.045128562015323115].  I will be using these correct values to generate x and y positions.
           
           I'll generate a grid of positions within those ranges for the 50 placements. To achieve this, I will use 5 x coordinates and 10 y coordinates. The precise calculations are:
           
           `num_x_steps = 5`
           `num_y_steps = 10`
           
           `x_step = (x_range_max - x_range_min) / (num_x_steps - 1) = 0.509742875969354 / 4 = 0.1274357189923385`
           `y_step = (y_range_max - y_range_min) / (num_y_steps - 1) = 0.5097428759693537 / 9 = 0.05663809732992819`
           
           So, for x, I'll have: `[4.245128562015323, 4.372564280997661, 4.5, 4.627435718992338, 4.754871437984677]`
           And for y: `[-0.5548714379846769, -0.4982333406547487, -0.44159524332482054, -0.3849571459948923, -0.3283190486649641, -0.2716809513350358, -0.2150428539951076, -0.1584047566651794, -0.10176665933525121, -0.045128562015323115]`
           
           I will use these coordinates.
