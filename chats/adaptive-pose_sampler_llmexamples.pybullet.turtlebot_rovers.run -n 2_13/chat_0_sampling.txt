User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is defined by a set of AABBs. A large AABB `0` defines the outer boundary of the environment. A series of thin AABBs `1` to `4` form walls around this boundary. There's also a vertical wall `5` at x=0. The other AABBs `6` to `20` are various smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment.
           
           I need to find 3 base positions (x, y) for the robot that are within a distance of 2 from the target point {target_point}, and within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. I also need to consider the fixed obstacles provided. I will try to generate positions that are diverse and spread around the target point, and avoid obvious collisions with the fixed obstacles. Since I am not given the full geometry and will receive feedback, I will prioritize a diverse set of initial guesses. I will consider the target point and try to place the robot in different directions around it, keeping the maximum range in mind. I will also be mindful of the large obstacles like the central wall at x=0.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point.x + 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x - 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x} {target_point.y + 1.5})
