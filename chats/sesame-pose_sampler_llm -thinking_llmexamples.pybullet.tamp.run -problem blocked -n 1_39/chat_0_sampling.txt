(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on how I'm going to find 50 stable placements for the object with ID 5 and dimensions (0.07, 0.07) on surface 0, which has the bounds ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  My goal is to create a diverse set of placements.
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement area for the object. Because the object is 0.07 x 0.07, regardless of its rotation, I need to make sure its center point is within a smaller rectangle inside surface 0, to keep the object fully inside the surface at all times. So the valid x-coordinates for the object's center must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and the y-coordinates must be between -0.565 and -0.035.
           
           Since the object is square, the best approach for generating diverse placements is to vary the rotation (`theta`).  While the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of a square doesn't change with rotation, rotating it still increases diversity.
           
           I considered the idea of a grid to generate the points. I plan to use 7 x values and 8 y values, giving me 56 points, since I need 50. I will keep 49 x,y points, using the grid method. The x_coords I need is 4.235 + (0.53/6) * i, for i = 0 to 6. And the y_coords I need is -0.565 + (0.53/7) * j, for j= 0 to 7. I will use the first 50 points from the grid.
           
           For the theta values, I'll alternate between several values for diversity, starting with 0. I will use 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4, repeating this cycle for the x,y coordinates until I reach 50 valid locations.
           
           In summary, my placement strategy is to grid the allowable surface with a slight overlap (56 vs. 50), ensuring the object is within the surface boundaries, and then to rotate the object at 0, 45, 90, 135 degree angles to make a set that is diverse. I will now create and return this list of (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I've carefully analyzed the feedback on previous object placements, particularly regarding rotation and stability. The key insight is that the object's effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) changes with rotation, and this must be accounted for to ensure stability on the surface. For square-like objects, like the new object with ID 10, the rotated AABB is larger when rotated by 45 degrees.
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for the new object. I will utilize the following plan:
           
           1.  **Define AABB Calculation:** I'll use the formulas:
               *   W = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|
               *   H = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|
               to calculate effective AABB dimensions (`W`, `H`) based on initial dimensions (`w`, `h`) and rotation angle (`theta`).
           
           2.  **Surface and Object Information:** I know the surface dimensions `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` and the object's dimensions (`0.0965936656`, `0.0965936656`).
           
           3.  **Stability Conditions:** I'll ensure that the object's center `(cx, cy)` satisfies:
               *   `surface_min_x + W/2 <= cx <= surface_max_x - W/2`
               *   `surface_min_y + H/2 <= cy <= surface_max_y - H/2`
               These conditions guarantee the entire AABB is within the surface bounds.
           
           4.  **Angle-Specific Ranges:** I've determined that the valid ranges for `cx` and `cy` are more restricted for rotations of `pi/4`. I will create placements that take into account this information.
           
               *   For `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`, I can use a wider valid range for center coordinates, placing with a slightly coarser grid to cover the surface well.
           
               *   For `theta = pi/4` and `theta = 3*pi/4`, I must tighten the bounds of the center coordinates. I will place a smaller number of these placements to maximize the area coverage.
           
           5.  **Placement Generation:** I will create two groups to generate the points:
           
               *   **Group A (theta=0, pi/2):**  I'll define x and y ranges and generate coordinates to place the object in the middle of each range. I'll take a grid of coordinates, with x going from 4.248 to 4.751 and y going from -0.551 to -0.048.
                   *   20 Placements, 10 each for the above rotations.
           
               *   **Group B (theta=pi/4, 3*pi/4):** These placements will have slightly more constrained ranges, so I'll generate fewer of them, with a finer grid. I'll place in a grid with x going from 4.268 to 4.731 and y going from -0.531 to -0.068.
                   *   10 Placements, 5 for each.
           
           6.  **Collision Avoidance:** At this stage, I am not given any information about other objects already in the scene. I am asked for the position to place this object (ID 10) on a surface, so I will take the above into consideration and not consider collision. I have the understanding that there is only one object for now.
           
           7.  **Output:** I will generate a list of 50 stable placements, each defined by `(theta, cx, cy)`.
