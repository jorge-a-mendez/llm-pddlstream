           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal: Atom new-axiom@0(), which boils down to getting an object of type v17 onto the surface v18. I'll summarize my thinking step-by-step.**
           
           1.  **Analyze the Goal:**  The ultimate goal is to get something that's both type v17 and on v18. I've got two objects of type v17 (v8 and v12) to choose from. Let's start by trying to place v8.
           
           2.  **Define "On":** To get something *on* something else, it needs to be *supported* in the correct *pose*.
           
           3.  **Current State of v8:** Right now, v8 is supported by v11, but it *can* be supported on v18 at a specific pose (#o2).
           
           4.  **The Plan:** I'll need to move v8 from where it is to v18. This means:
               *   **Move Base:**  First, I'll need to move the robot base to the correct configuration (#o3), ready for the pick and place.
               *   **Pick:** Then, I'll use the robot arm (v4) to *pick* up v8 from its current pose.
               *   **Place:** Finally, I'll *place* v8 onto v18 at the correct pose (#o2).
           
           5.  **Move Base details:** The base is currently at v3 and must be moved to bconf #o3, which is the configuration needed for the pick and place.
           
           6.  **Pick Details:**  To pick up v8, I need to make sure I *can* pick it (arm empty, base config correct, and no unsafe conditions). It's supported (v8, #o2, v18) and thus the approach pose, safe.
           
           7.  **Place Details:** To place v8, I need to make sure the grasp is firm, the base config is still good, and it's safe to *place* the object at the target pose.
           
           8.  **Pick and Place: Checking and Correcting for Hazards**: I need to check the preconditions like the arm configuration to make sure it's possible.  There are several *negated* atoms I'm checking, like `unsafeapproach` and `unsafepose` (safety flags, and for which there are not initial state `unsafe` atoms to contradict). I will also have to make sure the current configuration works.
           
           9. **Action Sequence and Goal Satisfaction:** With this sequence, the plan should then move the base, pick the object, place the object, which satisfies the goal, and makes `(on v8 v18)` and `type(v8,v17)` true.
           
           10. **Precondition Analysis:** I've carefully checked all the preconditions for the *move\_base*, *pick*, and *place* actions. My analysis confirms that the sequence is valid, and should achieve the goal state because none of the unsafe predicates are true in the state.
           
           11. **Cost and Completeness:**  I am not considering the cost, which is the sequence of the given actions.  As for domain constraints, the `type` predicate is important for the constraints, as it needs to be true.  The continuous parameters are well-defined by the action definitions and available initial state facts. This solution should work as intended.
