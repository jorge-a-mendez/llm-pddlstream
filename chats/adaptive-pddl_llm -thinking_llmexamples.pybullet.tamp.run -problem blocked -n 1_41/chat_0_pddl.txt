           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom handempty(v6)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unfeasibility: Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, `?green`, both "on" a specific surface, `v18`, and of a specific "type", `v17`. My immediate assessment is that there are two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, that could potentially fill the role of `?green`, as the initial state declares both their types as `v17`. This means I need to make *either* `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` true.
           
           To achieve an `on` condition, according to the `on` axiom, I need two sub-conditions: `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I examined the initial state to determine if these are already satisfied for either `v8` or `v12`. I found that while `supported` predicates exist for both, the `atpose` predicates are not aligned with `v18`.  For instance, `v8` is currently `atpose(v8, v9)` and `v12` is `atpose(v12, v13)`. To satisfy the goal, they'd need to be `atpose(?green, #o2)`, as the initial state indicates they are supported by #o2.
           
           The key then becomes how to change the `atpose` of these objects.  I checked the available actions, and here's where the problem arises: the only action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This simply moves the robot base; it *does not* manipulate objects or change their `atpose` state.
           
           Therefore, since the goal is to get `v8` or `v12` 'on' `v18` but I can't modify their poses, it is impossible.  There are simply no means to change the `atpose` of objects and the single available action does not affect the desired `on` predicates. It seems, given this limited action set, I am unable to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, as satisfying its underlying `on` predicate is currently impossible.  This is a direct consequence of the lack of actions that affect the placement or configuration of objects.
