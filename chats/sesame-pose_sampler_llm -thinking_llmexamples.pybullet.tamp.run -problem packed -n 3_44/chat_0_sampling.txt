(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, I need to come up with 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size: 0.0895 x 0.0895) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). A stable placement means the object stays entirely within the surface.
           
           First, I know that for any rotation *theta* of the square, its effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains a square. Since the object's dimensions are equal, the calculations simplify, and I just need to consider the effective side length.  The effective side length depends on the angle *theta*:  `effective_side = object_size * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I've calculated that the *maximum* effective side occurs at 45 degrees (pi/4 radians) and is around 0.1266.  This means my object can never reach the very edge of the surface.  Also, I know that for the rotation angle theta, theta+pi/2, theta+pi and theta+3*pi/2 all give the same effective AABB.
           
           To ensure the object stays on the surface, its center needs to be within a smaller square defined by the surface bounds minus half the maximum effective side.  I've figured out the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates of the object.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll systematically vary the rotation angle *theta* and the (x, y) position. I'll use 10 different angles, from 0 to 2*pi, generating a set of different effective AABBs. Then, for each angle, I will select various (x, y) coordinates to make up a set of 5 placements.  This will give me the required 50 placements.  I have done the calculations, and I'm ready with the 50 values (surface index, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Object Placement Constraints and Collision Avoidance**
           
           I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 6), a square with dimensions slightly smaller than a previous object (ID 5), onto a surface. The key is to avoid collision with object 5, which is already placed at the origin. I understand this as I have placed an object with ID `i` before, so now I need to place an object with ID `j` to avoid the collision.
           
           I know object 5 is at the origin and its dimensions. Object 6 is also a square, so I need to place it without overlapping object 5. The surface boundaries are defined. The surface is square at `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Since both objects are squares, an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) approach seems appropriate for collision detection. Object 5 is at origin. Now, I have to pick 50 stable placements, and considering stability and orientation, I'll spread those over a few angles.
           
           The first step is to calculate the effective side for various orientations `theta` since that affects the AABB size. I can find the AABB for both objects. 
           
           To avoid collision, I need to place object 6's AABB outside object 5's AABB. Simple. If I calculate the size of the objects. It's just a matter of calculating the center point. I know, from the bounds, the minimum and maximum coordinates.
           
           To clarify my non-collision reasoning, if I consider object 5 AABB. I am saying, I will need to place object 6 such that their AABB do not overlap.
           
           Since object 5 is at origin. The easiest strategy seems to push object 6 in one of the quadrants such that it does not overlap. But I have to find the correct coordinates, to maximize the region I can utilize in the surface. To calculate the effective side, which depends on theta and the dimensions. Then I have to find the max and min coordinates, for the same. Then to find the valid coordinates.
           
           At `theta=0`, the calculations make things easiest. Since the calculations will be a simple `object_half_size_5` comparison. However, I have to ensure the `object6` dimensions are taken into consideration for its rotation.
           
           I can make this easier. I can find the distance I need to put in my calculations.
           I've considered that `theta=0` should be the best, and then others.
           
           I know I have 50. I will try to consider 4 angles for different rotations. So, I will calculate for each angle and divide the points across. With 4 angles, I have to place 13 objects for most of the angles.
           
           To determine valid placements, I need to consider both surface boundaries and the non-collision constraint. Object 5 is a fixed obstacle. So, I must not overlap AABB. In general, object 5's AABB is easy to compute, so, I have to consider the non-overlapping region. The general idea is if `x` is greater than or less than a certain coordinate, then there is no overlapping. 
           
           In this scenario, I have to consider all angles. In many cases, AABB overlaps, when `theta` is `pi/4` (or `3pi/4`, etc), so it is not feasible to place an object.
           
           So, I have to divide the area to maximize coverage and also make sure AABB does not overlap. After looking into angles, I can only use `0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2`, if not, the angles have overlapping issues. For those 4 angles, I will have 13 points each. I can select those points to increase the coverage.
           
           For these angles, I am now clear on calculating where the object should be placed without an AABB overlap.
           
           I am dividing the points, I will use `x` is in `[R, max_c]` or `[-max_c, -R]`, and `y` can be anything in `[-max_c, max_c]`. 
           
           Thus, for each angle, I will put 13 points as I have described.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable objects (ID 4) on surface 0, which is a square. I know the size of the surface and the object (square).  I've got some previously placed objects, object 5 and object 6, that I need to avoid colliding with.
           
           I've calculated the key values - the surface bounds, the object's dimensions, and the half-side lengths. I also need to account for rotation, which will change the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the object, and hence how much free space I have.
           
           My primary constraint is the surface containment - the center of the object (x4, y4) must remain within the surface boundaries, and I've worked out the "max_c4", the maximum offset from the origin.
           
           Also the collision avoidance - using the AABB. Since object 5 is centered at the origin, I calculated the safe zone for (x4, y4) to avoid collision.  I also have to stay out of the object 6 area.
           
           I have decided to restrict rotations to multiples of 90 degrees (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) because, for other angles the object will always collide with object 5.
           
           For each rotation I need to calculate the bounding boxes and safe zones. For theta = 0, this gets me a more restrictive placement area. The goal is to place as many objects as possible without collisions.
           
           I've determined that the placement possibilities is restricted to two small corner regions on the left side of the surface.  This is because object 6 is close to the right. And for each angle, the placement window is extremely small (0.011 x 0.011).
           
           In order to place 50 objects in those regions, I am setting up a grid within the two rectangles. A 3x3 grid will give me 18 placements per rotation, but this will have a total of 18*4 = 72 placements so I will select 50 of them. In this grid the x and y coordinates will range from the min safe values to the max safe values, with uniform steps.
           I'm going with a strategy to distribute the object placements using 13 positions for 0, 13 for pi/2, 12 for pi, 12 for 3pi/2.
           
           By placing several points within a rectangle, I can achieve the minimum distance between the objects, and thus ensure stability.
