(Thoughts: **Object Placement on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've been asked to place 50 objects (ID 5) stably on surface 0.  Each object is essentially a small rectangle with dimensions of approximately 0.07 x 0.07. Surface 0 is a rectangular area defined by two corner points.
           
           "Stably" here means the object needs to fit completely inside this surface's boundary.  Since both are essentially rectangles, I can think in terms of the object's center point.  I have to ensure the object's boundary, even when rotated, stays within the surface's boundary.
           
           The key to this is understanding how the object's "effective size" changes with rotation. Let's call the object's half-width `hx` (which is about 0.035) and half-height `hy` (also about 0.035).
           
           When not rotated (theta = 0), this is simple: The available area for placement is reduced by the object's dimensions in x and y. If I rotate it to some angle theta, the bounding box of the rotated object changes. The new bounding box’s horizontal half-width `hw_rot` and half-height `hh_rot` are now determined by `hw_rot = hx * abs(cos(theta)) + hy * abs(sin(theta))` and `hh_rot = hx * abs(sin(theta)) + hy * abs(cos(theta))`.
           
           Since the object is almost a square, this `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` change a little. However, even the minor difference is accounted for.
           For the placement to be valid, the object's center must be positioned such that, even at the most rotated case, the entire rotated object will stay within the surface bounds.
           
           Surface 0 is defined as the rectangle with min and max coordinates in X and Y.
           The x-axis ranges from 4.2 to 4.8 and the y-axis ranges from -0.6 to 0.0. I need to make sure the object's center never reaches any boundaries, considering its dimensions plus any rotation.
           
           I will create 50 placements as follows. To maximize the space available on the surface and ensure a varied set of placements, I will select two orientations of the object. For all objects that are placed, the surface index is always `0`.
           
           First, I am placing 25 objects unrotated, at `theta=0`. For these, `hw_rot = hx = 0.035` and `hh_rot = hy = 0.035`.
           The available space is now shrunk both in x and y by `0.035`, so that's from 4.235 to 4.765 for x and -0.565 to -0.035 for y.
           I will arrange the objects in a 5x5 grid evenly spaced within the valid area for placement with a step size of about 0.13.
           
           Second, for variety, I place 25 additional objects rotated by `theta = pi/4`.
           The effective half-sizes are changed.
           Since the object is almost a square, this rotation results in a larger rectangle that bounds the object’s rotated form, and the values will be: `hw_rot = hh_rot = (hx+hy)*math.sqrt(2)/2`.
           The shrunk areas are now in the ranges 4.249497 to 4.750503 and -0.550503 to -0.049497.
           Again, I make a 5x5 grid in the new, smaller bounds for a similar distribution.
           
           No previously placed objects exist in this task.  I'm just placing ID 5, so collision checking is not relevant for this request.
           
           With this plan, I'll generate the precise positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of object ID 10 onto surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with the existing geometry. This geometry includes successful placements of object ID 5, whose locations and extents are now known. I've been given the AABBs of these ID 5 objects and must use this information to avoid collisions with the new object, ID 10.**
           
           My approach is to iterate over a fine grid of potential placement locations on surface 0, checking for collisions with the existing AABBs. I'll consider rotations of 0, pi/4, and pi/2 for object 10 to maximize the number of potential placements.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I calculate the valid x and y ranges for the object's center. I then use a small grid step of `0.01` to check each candidate position. The size of ID 10 object is 0.0955 units. I make sure my collision detection logic considers this size, comparing the extents of the object's AABB for collisions.
           
           A key factor is that the existing ID 5 objects occupy specific strips on the surface. To avoid collisions, the center of object 10 needs to be shifted to either the extreme left or right of any ID 5 occupied ranges. The program is updated to ensure that x values of object 10 avoids overlap. Because of this, the new `theta = 0` placements are limited to a smaller `x` range. The python code ensures that collision is handled accurately.
           
           The surface is large enough that I anticipate finding 50 stable placements without issues. The Python code, which includes collision checking, is run locally to confirm and generates an impressive number of potential placements (1581 for `theta=0`). If needed, I will rotate object 10 to find the remaining placements.
