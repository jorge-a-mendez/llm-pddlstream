(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, side length ≈ 0.097) on a square surface (centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27). The key is to ensure the object's Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) fits within the surface's AABB for any given rotation.
           
           Because both the object and surface are square, the object's rotation only affects its effective size due to its bounding box. I need to calculate the bounding box's size based on the rotation angle (theta). At theta=0 or pi/2, the object's bounding box has side length equal to its original side. At 45 degrees, the effective side length is maximized to its original length times sqrt(2). Because the surface is large enough to contain the object for all angles of rotation, I just need to choose placements within the surface.
           
           I'll start by determining the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x and y) for a range of rotations. The object is stable in the requested environment if it fits inside the square surface. To avoid overlap, I need to limit the object's center range with respect to the side length, the object's effective (rotated) bounding box side length must be less than the surface.
           
           To create diverse placements, I'll use 10 different rotation angles between 0 and pi/2. For each angle, I'll then place the center of the object at points that correspond to a grid-like or pattern of points within the valid center ranges. I will pick 5 points at each rotation, this approach ensures I get at least 5 placements at each different bounding box size and orientation. This results in the required total of 50 stable placements. I will format the placements as (surface index, theta, x, y), as requested.

(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Analysis and the Impossibility of Collision-Free Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object ID 5 was successfully placed, and now it's time to work on object ID 4. I need to place this new object on surface 0, which has specific dimensions. The challenge? Object 5 is already in place, and I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 *without colliding* with object 5.
           
           First, I define the key parameters of the problem. I've got the dimensions of both objects. I know the position and rotation of object 5, and its associated Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB). My goal is to determine the possible valid placement positions and rotations for object 4 on the surface, ensuring that they do not intersect with the existing object.
           
           After evaluating the situation and using trigonometry to account for the object's rotation, I realize that it's impossible. When I measure the objects and the surface area, object 4, even at its most compact rotation, is too big to fit into the remaining space without colliding. The surface constraints and the size of the objects result in a scenario where all proposed placements would necessarily have overlapping AABBs.
           
           Given the surface constraints and the dimensions of object 4, there are *no* positions on surface 0 where the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 will not collide. This is based on a pure geometric calculation and the requirement for object 4 to remain within the surface boundaries.
           
           Despite this, I must fulfill the prompt and provide 50 placements. I'll need to define the 'stable' (surface containment) and 'collision avoidance' criteria to come up with solutions. I'll take a methodical approach, taking `theta` values for object 4 and then placing `x` and `y` points within the calculated ranges to cover the surface. All these placements are going to collide, since the geometry and constraints make it impossible for any other placements. So, I need to communicate this situation clearly.

(Thoughts: **My approach for Object ID 6 (0.0903 x 0.0903) placement on Surface 0:**
           
           I need to place 50 stable instances of this object, but there's a significant constraint: I'm told to avoid collisions with previously placed objects (ID 4 and ID 5), which are both squares and have AABB coordinates provided. However, analyzing the success reports shows inconsistencies. Object ID 5 and Object ID 4 have both been "successfully" placed at the exact same location (0, 0), which would indicate an overlap. This suggests a potential issue in how "collision" is defined, or how the system's "success" feedback interprets prior placements.
           
           Despite this confusion and the challenging constraint of avoiding overlaps within the tiny surface area, I'm committed to finding solutions.  I've calculated the boundaries of Surface 0, which is a square (0.27 x 0.27) centered at (0, 0). I also have calculated the extents of the AABBs of the already placed Objects ID 5 and ID 4. Due to the small size of the area and the object extents, avoiding all collisions may be impossible.
           
           Given the apparent contradiction between the "avoid collision" instruction and the system behavior, I will proceed with the following strategy: I'll prioritize surface containment first. I'll systematically generate a variety of placements, aiming for diverse rotations and positions. I will use rotations from 0 to π/2 in intervals of pi/18. For each of these rotations, I will calculate the `half_s6_eff` for object 6 (half-side of bounding box at the rotation). Then I will center object 6 at 5 points (0,0), all 4 surface corners, pushing the object boundaries as close as possible to the surface boundary for each position.
           
           By generating this diverse set, I aim to provide 50 distinct placements while adhering to the primary constraint of staying within the surface boundaries, even if it results in *potential* collisions with previously reported successful placements. I'll flag these as potentially problematic, hoping for a revised understanding of "collision" or the "fixed obstacles" in the future.
