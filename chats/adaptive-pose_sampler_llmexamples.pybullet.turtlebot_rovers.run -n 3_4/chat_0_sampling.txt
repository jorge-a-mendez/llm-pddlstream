User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including at the corners, some in the middle, and some thin rectangular ones. I need to find 25 positions for the robot base that are within 4 units of the target point {target_point} and within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. I will try to sample positions around the target point, prioritizing areas that appear more open and avoiding the known obstacles.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts had issues with being out of range, out of bounds, or colliding with the vertical wall at x=0 (object 5). For the new target point {target_point}, I will focus on positions closer to the target and avoid the x=0 line. Since the target is at x=-1.9, I will generally look for positions in the negative x-half of the room.
