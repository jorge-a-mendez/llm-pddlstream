User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.513), (-0.191, 0.593)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.146, 0.38), (0.234, 0.468)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.166, 0.214), (-0.069, 0.311)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, 0.015), (-0.213, 0.099)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.231, 0.553, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.081, 0.997).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.233, 0.345), (-0.147, 0.431)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.19, 0.424, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.81, 0.586).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.118, 0.262, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, -0.291).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.255, 0.057, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.624, 0.782).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.19, 0.388, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, 0.129).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so here's the situation: I'm tasked with moving five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current locations to be "on" object v20.  The "on" predicate is straightforward: it means an object needs to be both *supported* by v20 and *at a valid pose* on v20.  Initially, all the target objects are supported by and at poses on v11, and my goal is to get them supported by and at poses on v20.
           
           I've carefully examined the initial state. Each object has an `atpose` and `supported` predicate related to its initial state. The challenge is to alter this so each object now has `atpose` and `supported` predicates related to its new state `v20`.
           
           The provided world description is clear.  v20 is a small square (good for precision). v11 is a large rectangle (meaning some potential for layout). The key point is that the `supported(?o, #o2, v20)` predicate *already holds*. This strongly suggests that there exist valid poses on v20 for each object that are collision-free.
           
           The robot setup is also straightforward. Two arms, v4 and v6, both empty and in initial configurations.  The base is at v3, and `canmove()` is true (which is expected).  Crucially, the *only* allowed action instance I'm given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a clear indicator of the problem.
           
           My analysis boils down to this:  `pick` and `place` actions are *not* included in the available action instances.  Since I need to manipulate objects, I need these actions to change object locations. I need them to change the `atpose` predicates. Without `pick` and `place`, I can't modify the initial state.
           
           The instructions are explicit: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Therefore, as an expert in this field, I can confidently conclude that, given *only* the provided action, the problem is *unsolvable*. I am locked into a no-op base move, and cannot achieve the required state changes.
