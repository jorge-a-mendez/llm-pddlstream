           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, 0.513), (-0.191, 0.593)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.146, 0.38), (0.234, 0.468)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.166, 0.214), (-0.069, 0.311)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, 0.015), (-0.213, 0.099)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.231, 0.553, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.081, 0.997).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.233, 0.345), (-0.147, 0.431)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.19, 0.424, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.81, 0.586).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.118, 0.262, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, -0.291).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.255, 0.057, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.624, 0.782).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.19, 0.388, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, 0.129).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to tackle this object-moving puzzle:**
           
           I've got a robot arm, `v4`, that's currently empty, and five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) sitting on a large table, `v11`. My goal is to get all those objects onto a designated surface, `v20`. The robot base can't move, it's locked in place at `v3`.
           
           The initial setup gives me a huge hint: `kin` facts. These "kin" facts are like golden tickets! They tell me exactly how `v4` can pick up each object from its current location and place it on `v20`.  Crucially, the robot is only allowed to pick up and place.
           
           My strategy is straightforward: a series of "pick" and "place" actions for each object. First, I'll pick up `v8` from its spot on `v11`. Then, I'll place it on a specific location on `v20`. I'll repeat this for v12, v14, v16, and v18.
           
           Here's the detailed breakdown for each object to be moved:
           
           **Object Placement Poses**:
           -   `v8`: I'll define a new pose `#o2_v8` on surface `v20` with coordinates: (-0.085, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v12`:  I'll define a new pose `#o2_v12` on surface `v20` with coordinates: (0.085, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v14`:  I'll define a new pose `#o2_v14` on surface `v20` with coordinates: (0.0, -0.085, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v16`: I'll define a new pose `#o2_v16` on surface `v20` with coordinates: (0.0, 0.085, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v18`: I'll define a new pose `#o2_v18` on surface `v20` with coordinates: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           For each object's move, the plan will be:
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, <object>, <current_pose>, #o1, v3, #o4)`. The grasp is represented by `#o1`, and the arm trajectory by `#o4`.
               *   Preconditions: `kin(<robot_arm>, <object>, <object_current_pose>, #o1, v3, #o4)`, `atpose(<object>, <current_pose>)`, and `handempty(v4)`.
               *   Effects:  The robot is now atgrasp(<robot_arm>, <object>, #o1), atbconf(v3) and canmove(). Object's current pose is no longer true and handempty is now false.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, <object>, <#o2_object>, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Preconditions: `kin(<robot_arm>, <object>, <#o2_object>, #o1, v3, #o4)`, `atgrasp(<robot_arm>, <object>, #o1)`, `atbconf(v3)`.
               *   Effects:  `atpose(<object>, <#o2_object>)`, `handempty(v4)`, `canmove()`, and negated atgrasp.
           
           No base movement is needed since canmove is always true from the start and also because the movement is from v3 to v3 with a `move_base` action.
           
           The key to this plan is using the given `kin` facts, the precise placement coordinates I defined for `v20`, and making sure I'm following the constraints about those facts and how the robot functions.  I think this will be an effective, safe, and efficient plan to move the objects.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan was a bust. It's clear why; the only allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That just moves the robot's base to the same location, which is useless for the task at hand. The explicit instruction is: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           My goal is to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto surface v20.  Right now, they're sitting on surface v11.  To get them onto v20, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions at the very least, right? I need to model this.
           
           Let's quickly review the preconditions for `pick` and `place`:  They both rely on having the robot at a suitable configuration (using `kin`, `atbconf`), and not having unsafe configurations or trajectories.  They also require the hand to be empty and the object to be at a pose. The goal states to get the objects on surface v20.
           
           But here's the kicker: The allowed actions *specifically* exclude any `pick` or `place` actions.  The restricted action set completely prevents any manipulation of objects.  Since I need to *move* these objects to achieve the goal, and I'm *not* allowed to, it's a dead end.  The goal is simply unachievable with the provided action constraints.
