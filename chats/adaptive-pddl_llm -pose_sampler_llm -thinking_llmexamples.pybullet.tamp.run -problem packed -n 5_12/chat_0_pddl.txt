(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID 6**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6) on surface 0. My primary consideration is that this is a square, so its bounding box dimensions remain constant regardless of rotation.  The key is to keep the object's center within a specific area on the surface.
           
           First, I calculate the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y). Given the object's side length (0.0986657...) and the surface's dimensions, I determine the minimum and maximum x and y values the object's center can have while still being entirely within the surface.  This results in a valid range of approximately [-0.085667, 0.085667] for both x and y.
           
           To achieve diverse placements, I create a 7x7 grid of evenly spaced points within this valid range.  Since the object is square, the rotation angle (theta) doesn't influence the bounding box containment, so I set the theta to zero for the majority of the placements. This gives me 49 placements.
           
           For the 50th placement, I use the center of the surface (0, 0) and a rotation of pi/4 (45 degrees) to add some variation in the dataset.  The object's stable placement condition remains the same regardless of the rotation, which helps with generating diverse samples.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placement Locations for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 6 at the specified location. Now, I need to figure out where to put Object 7, which is a square with a known size. I've calculated the half-extent of Object 7.
           
           My strategy is to define the boundaries of the available surface and make sure it doesn't collide with Object 6. So, I have calculated the valid x and y center coordinates, taking into account the surface bounds and the size of Object 7. This gives me a "working zone" for placement. I calculated the valid ranges for the center coordinates for object 7.
           
           Object 6 has a specific size and location, so I've determined its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which is just its minimum and maximum x and y coordinates. The plan is to create a grid of possible positions for Object 7 within its acceptable area. I'll check each position on this grid to ensure that Object 7's AABB doesn't overlap with Object 6's AABB, as that would mean a collision.
           
           I started by creating a 7x7 grid to find suitable, non-colliding locations for object 7. And in the grid, I discovered collision points. So, I must change the grid.
           
           To avoid collision, it's necessary to make some calculations. I found the placement zones where it is safe to place object 7: `x_c >= 0.001935810840418005` or `y_c >= 0.001935810840418005`.
           
           Now, I decided to use a 10x10 grid with smaller steps to find valid points. In the new grid, I'll filter out the points inside the forbidden region and I'll extract 50 positions for the object.
           
           I have enumerated all the placement coordinates for the new points. I have carefully picked the locations based on the new conditions. Now, with all of this done, I will have all 50 possible locations. And finally, I will have the final position, safe and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5: A Detailed Analytical Approach**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically position 50 instances of a square object (ID 5) on surface 0, ensuring they are stable and, crucially, avoid any collisions with two pre-existing objects (ID 6 and ID 7). Object 5 is a square with a known side length, and its placement must remain within the confines of surface 0, a defined rectangular area.
           
           First, I precisely calculated the valid placement range for object 5's center, based on surface 0's boundaries and the object's dimensions. This established the permissible X and Y coordinate ranges for the object's center to ensure it remains entirely on the surface.
           
           Next, I meticulously defined the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for both object 6 and object 7. Their centers, dimensions, and orientations were clearly established (with rotations being zero, meaning the AABBs align perfectly with their rectangular extents).  These bounding boxes are crucial as they define the "no-go" zones where object 5 cannot be placed without collision.
           
           The core of my process involved defining the precise conditions for collision. I determined that the AABB of object 5, when placed, must not overlap with the AABBs of objects 6 and 7. The collision conditions were then formalized mathematically: the center of object 5, positioned as (x, y), must *not* fall within certain ranges defined by the other objects' positions and dimensions.
           
           After translating these mathematical constraints into practical limitations, I identified the "no-go zones" within surface 0. These zones are regions where object 5's center is guaranteed to result in a collision.
           
           To find valid placements, I set up a grid of potential locations covering the valid surface area. I then methodically checked each point (x, y) on the grid against the established no-go zones (defined by the presence of ID 6 and ID 7). The objective was to locate 50 points (X, Y) that were not in those zones.
           
           By carefully selecting coordinates for my potential placements using logical reasoning and a grid of potential locations within our target region, I successfully identified a strategic and non-colliding layout for all 50 instances of object 5 on surface 0.
