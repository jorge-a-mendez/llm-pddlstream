           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, `v3` to `v18` and continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`.
           There are two arms: `v4` and `v6`. Both are initially empty.
           There are three graspable objects: `v8`, `v15`, and `v12`.
           `v8` is currently at `pose v9` and is supported by `v11`. It is also stackable on `v10` and `v18`.
           `v15` is currently at `pose v16` and is supported by `v11`. It is also stackable on `v10`.
           `v12` is currently at `pose v13` and is supported by `v14`. It is also stackable on `v10` and `v18`.
           The robot is at base configuration `v3`.
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, can be satisfied by `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)`. Thus, we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           `on(v8, v18)` can be satisfied if `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So, the goal becomes `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           Currently, `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)`. We need to change its pose to `#o2`.
           However, the only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action does not allow for picking or placing objects. It only moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3`, which does not change the state of `v8`.
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of available actions.
