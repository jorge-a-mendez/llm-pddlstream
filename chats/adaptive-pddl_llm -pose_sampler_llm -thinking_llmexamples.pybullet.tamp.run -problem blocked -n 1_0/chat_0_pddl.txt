           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a given surface (`surf_0` defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`). A placement is considered stable if the object's global Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) is entirely within the surface's AABB.  Since the problem uses the AABB of the rotated object, I've interpreted "stable" as the rotated object's AABB must fit inside the surface's AABB.
           
           Because the object is essentially a square, the effective dimensions (width and height) of its global AABB will be equal, regardless of the rotation angle.  Specifically, the side length of the rotated AABB is 0.07 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|). The maximum size occurs at a rotation of 45 degrees (or multiples of 45, etc.), giving a maximum side of ~0.099.
           
           I need to generate a list of 50 tuples (surf_idx, theta, x, y).  I am using `surf_idx = 0` (surface 0) and varying `theta`, `x` and `y`.
           
           The `x` and `y` range of placements must fully contain the rotated object's AABB, and fit within the surface's AABB:
           - **x** values:
              - x_center_min = surf_min_x + S_prime_half
              - x_center_max = surf_max_x - S_prime_half
              - Where  S_prime_half = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / 2.0
           - **y** values:
              - y_center_min = surf_min_y + S_prime_half
              - y_center_max = surf_max_y - S_prime_half
           
           I'm generating 8 theta values covering a full 2*pi range, as well as 3 x positions and 3 y positions, and selecting the first 50 stable placements. I selected a 3x3 grid because, given the relatively small size of the square object and large surface compared to the object, I can create the placements by combining the generated values of theta, x and y.
           
           The approach: I am iterating to generate different theta values, for each theta, I can generate x and y ranges. Because all of the potential generated AABBs can fit on this small surface, I can simply vary theta, x, and y in the correct way to get a list of 50 stable placements on the surface, regardless of the angle, and any combination of x and y.
