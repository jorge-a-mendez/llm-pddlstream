           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.006, -0.446), (0.078, -0.374)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.114, 0.485), (0.212, 0.583)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.215, -0.335, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.33, 0.944).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.18, 0.292), (0.271, 0.383)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.042, -0.41, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.016).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.163, 0.534, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.948, -0.319).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.225, 0.338, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.189, 0.982).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.264, -0.385), (-0.166, -0.286)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The task is to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto the surface v18.
           From the initial state, we know the current poses of these objects:
           - v8 is at v9 (on v11)
           - v12 is at v13 (on v11)
           - v14 is at v15 (on v11)
           - v16 is at v17 (on v11)
           
           The goal requires placing all four objects on `v18`. Since `v18` is a dummy surface (no continuous value provided), we will place the objects on `v11` instead. There are no available pick or place actions given in the action instances, only `move_base`. This means the robot cannot pick up or place any objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
