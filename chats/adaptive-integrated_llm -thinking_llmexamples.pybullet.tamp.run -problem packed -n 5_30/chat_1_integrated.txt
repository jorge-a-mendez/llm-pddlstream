User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.127, 0.335), (0.197, 0.406)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.264, 0.26), (-0.172, 0.352)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.088, -0.455), (-0.014, -0.381)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.142, -0.581), (0.234, -0.489)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.162, 0.37, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.711, 0.704).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.181, 0.397), (-0.082, 0.496)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.218, 0.306, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.832, 0.555).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.051, -0.418, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.028).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.188, -0.535, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.2).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.131, 0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.375, 0.927).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Move Objects**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from where they are now to *on* object v20. This *on* relationship is key; it hinges on the *supported* and *atpose* predicates.  Essentially, for each object, I need to find a suitable pose (a location and orientation) that's supported by v20 and then execute a *place* action to achieve that *atpose*.
           
           First, a quick look at the initial conditions: all the objects are stacked on v11 right now.  Each has its own *atpose* and *supported* facts.  The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), initially in a specific configuration with empty hands. The crucial *move_base* action is effectively a no-op, as it keeps the base at the same configuration (v3).  No actual movement will be involved based on this, which is good because it keeps the plan simple.
           
           Since all objects start on v11 and need to end up on v20, a straightforward pick-and-place strategy will work here.  For each object: pick it up from its current pose, and place it at a new pose on v20.  The *kin* facts are like the key to the toolbox, since they are crucial for picking each object from its initial pose on v11. From there, I'll need to use the place action with a new location for each object on v20.
           
           The robot's arm, v4, is the tool of choice, and the grasp, `#o1`, remains consistent throughout. The base configuration, `v3`, is provided in the initial state so I can assume it is where the base should be.  I'll place each object at a `#o2` pose. These `#o2` poses need to be collision-free. Each object will be placed in a grid for neat placement on v20. The problem statement says the same label `#o2` is used for all objects, but these are different numeric values. I need to generate poses on the surface that meet the conditions.
           
           Now for the collision check.  I'll assume that the given AABBs of the objects are well-defined and any collisions will occur if AABBs intersect. I will place objects in a way that minimizes and avoids collisions.
           
           After carefully checking all object dimensions and taking the size of the surface into account, I will stack the objects. I will place the biggest item in the middle. The other smaller objects will go in the corners. I calculated and checked the bounds of the placement and confirmed there are no collisions. With that I generate the plan with the placement locations.
           
           In summary, the plan goes as follows: pick, place, pick, place for all five objects, then the plan is finished. The goal is complete and the items are successfully placed.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I was looking at this plan and immediately realized I made a fundamental error.  The user pointed out that I'm using `pick` and `place` actions, but the problem explicitly states that *only* the actions in the `valid action instances` list are allowed. And the *only* valid action instance provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           Wait a minute... that *completely* changes everything.  If I can only use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, then I'm essentially stuck in one place!  I can't pick up, place, clean, or cook anything, which is necessary to reach the goal of moving objects to surface `v20`. The move_base action itself has no effect as the source and destination are the same node!  It just consumes `canmove()` and then makes it true again, which is a no-op! And it costs 0, because the distance is 0.
           
           The problem statement is crystal clear: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  I need to double-check my understanding.  Yep, the instructions are very strict.  They also say "To help you understand the robot's possibilities, you will also receive a list of valid action instances (applications of actions to specific objects). Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           So, even though `pick` and `place` are probably defined in the domain, unless there's a *specific instance* of them in that `valid action instances` list, I can't use them. Since there are no instances of `pick` or `place`, the goal is simply *unreachable* with the given constraints. I have to communicate that.
