(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get 50 stable placements, represented as (surf\_idx, theta, x, y), for this square object (side length ~0.077) on a square surface. The surface is surface 0, and its boundaries are clearly defined.
           
           First, I need to figure out the stable region for the object's center. Given the object's size and the surface's boundaries, I can calculate the safe range for the (x, y) coordinates of the center. Basically, the center has to stay a half-width away from each edge of the surface. This narrows down the valid (x, y) range to a square area within the surface, where x and y values are between -0.096 and +0.096 (approximately).
           
           Since the object is square and the problem states to consider the dimensions of its AABB, I realized that the rotation *theta* is not as crucial here. Because it's a square, any rotation doesn't actually change the AABB dimensions. The dimensions stay at approximately 0.077. So, for the geometry I don't strictly *need* to vary theta, and I can use *theta = 0*. However, I will alternate *theta* between *0* and *pi/2* for diversity in placement, even though it's not strictly necessary.
           
           Now, the plan is to sample the valid (x, y) range. I want 50 points, so a 5x10 grid seems efficient. I will divide the valid x and y ranges into 5 and 10 equally spaced segments, respectively. I will calculate the appropriate steps for both x and y to create a regular grid across the permissible center positions.
           
           After that, I'll generate the grid with 50 points, alternating theta every time for diversity. The `surf_idx` will remain 0.
           
           So the final output will be 50 tuples, each containing the surface index (0), a theta (alternating between 0 and pi/2), and an (x, y) coordinate pair within the calculated boundaries.

(Thoughts: **Placing a New Object While Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've successfully placed a previous object (ID 4) at a specific location on a surface (Surface 0). Now, I need to place a new, square object (ID 5) with dimensions `w5` and `h5` on the same surface without it colliding with the existing object.
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement area for object 5. Surface 0 is a rectangular area, so I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates where the center of object 5 can be located. Given that the existing object's placement is valid, I will use that placement to inform any potential collisions.
           
           I know the dimensions of object 5, so I can calculate the minimum and maximum center coordinates on Surface 0.
           
           However, I need to account for the space occupied by the previous object. I'll need to define an AABB, or axis-aligned bounding box, for object 4. This will give me the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that object 4 occupies.
           
           I'll use a standard collision detection check for two AABBs. It's relatively straightforward: if the x and y ranges overlap, then the objects are colliding.  I'll use this information to create a negative space that object 5 needs to avoid.
           
           I then translate these geometric checks into specific coordinates the new object must avoid. Essentially, I will use the established bounds to help build a valid region for the center placement of the new object on the existing surface.
           
           Finally, I'll generate 50 valid placements for object 5 by creating a grid in the valid space and avoiding the area where a collision might occur. To ensure variety, I'll incorporate rotations of 0 and pi/2.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing 50 stable instances of this new object (ID 6) on Surface 0, avoiding those pesky existing objects (IDs 4 and 5).  First, I've got to understand the scene. Surface 0 is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin. The new object is almost square, with dimensions approximately 0.088 units. Object 4 is in the bottom left corner, occupying an area, and object 5 is near the center, and these are my primary obstacles.
           
           My approach will be to calculate the valid placement space for ID 6. I know the surface boundaries, and I'll use those to define the valid range for the center of the object.  Then, I'll carve out exclusion zones around objects 4 and 5. By calculating the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each object, I can easily determine these exclusion areas. The coordinates of the safe zones is crucial.
           
           Specifically, I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates where object 6 can be centered without colliding, considering both existing objects.  I've already done the math, and I know that the entire safe region is in the area above `-0.0099673743095835` on the y-axis.  This is because it will place the new object above both existing objects.
           
           To ensure even distribution, I'll generate a grid of points within this safe region. Then I'll calculate the x and y step sizes to generate an even grid. Since the object is almost square, I will alternate rotation angles of 0 and 90 degrees to make sure I get a good variety of placements.
