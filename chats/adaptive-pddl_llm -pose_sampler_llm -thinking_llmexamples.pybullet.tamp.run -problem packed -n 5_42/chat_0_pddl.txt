(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, size 0.08889781428095778) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  The core task is to determine (surf\_idx, theta, x, y) for each placement, ensuring the object fully remains within the surface.
           
           Given the object and surface sizes, I first calculate the object's rotated bounding box (AABB) extents for a given rotation (theta). Specifically, using the square's symmetry, I simplify the rotated bounding box extents to a single half-extent (`half_ext = 0.5 * obj_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`) which is enough to calculate a valid `x, y` for a given `theta`. The range for `theta` is `[0, 2*pi)`, and, because the square's symmetry repeats every pi/2, I focus on distributing `theta` across that range.
           
           To generate 50 diverse placements, I'll use 10 different angles (from 0 to 2*pi) and 5 distinct placements for each angle:
              1.  Center (0,0)
              2.  Bottom-left corner
              3.  Top-right corner
              4.  Left center
              5.  Top center.
           
           For each `theta`, I calculate the valid *x* and *y* range based on the rotated object's bounding box and the surface bounds.  The placement strategy combines rotational diversity with spatial distribution across the surface. This approach ensures a reasonably even distribution of stable placements. The `(0,0)` will always be valid, and will provide a base point from which to generate other placements.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Placement Strategies for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I've got a new task: placing a new object, ID 6, on a surface while avoiding collision with a previously placed object, ID 4.  Here's the situation: Object 4 is a square at the origin, with a side of roughly 0.088, and it's been successfully placed.  I know it's there.  Now, I need to place Object 6, also a square, but with a slightly larger side length of about 0.098. The surface is a square bounded by +/- 0.135.
           
           My first thought is straightforward: check for AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collisions. I know Object 4's AABB is the same as its physical square shape since its rotation is zero. Object 6's AABB will depend on its chosen rotation angle, which I'll call `theta`.
           
           I've carefully calculated that for any rotation angle, the "effective" size of Object 6's AABB is always less than the surface's extent. So, in theory, Object 6 can *always* fit on the surface, regardless of its rotation.
           
           However, the real challenge is collision avoidance.  I've got a detailed AABB collision check in mind. I need to make sure that the AABBs of Objects 4 and 6 don't overlap. Since Object 4's AABB is easy, it's a fixed box with sides of `0.088`. The real trick is determining the safe placement range for the center of Object 6 given its rotation.
           
           Initially, my calculations suggested that with an unrotated or 45-degree-rotated object 6, if placed anywhere that its bounds touch the surface boundary it must collide with the object 4. This is a problem because if I used my AABB check, then it seems that no placement is possible. 
           
           I *have* to provide 50 placements. So I had to rethink the problem.
           
           Given the constraints, I assumed, at first, that the "geometry of the object" referred to its *rotated* AABB. This implies I use that rotated AABB for both surface-containment (as described previously) *and* for collision checks. My math says there is no space to do this.
           
           So, I had to come to the conclusion that if I assume this scenario, all 50 placements will fail.
           
           I have two choices:
           1. I could assume that the simulation is not checking the geometry so carefully, in that it has some "margin" or tolerance. This seems strange if I have to provide 50 and it's been made explicit that I must avoid collision.
           2. I try the interpretation where the object's geometry is its original AABB size, regardless of its rotation.
           
           So, I must generate 50 potential placements.
           
           Given the limitations, and the high probability of collision, I will generate placements based on the following strategy:
           I'll use 10 rotation angles, evenly spaced between 0 and 2pi (the same ones as before). For each angle, I will use its valid x and y range from the surface's boundaries. I will prioritize the edges and corners to provide diverse points with little hope of success in terms of the collision.

(Thoughts: **I've got this!** I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for a new, square object (ID 5) on a flat surface (Surface 0). There are existing square objects (ID 4 and ID 6) that I need to avoid as obstacles, both placed at the origin with zero rotation.  Their presence means I can't just slap down ID 5 anywhere.
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field. Surface 0 is a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at (0,0). Object ID 4 has dimensions of 0.088m x 0.088m and object ID 6 is 0.098m x 0.098m.
           
           I've determined that object 6, being the larger of the two, effectively blocks a 0.098m x 0.098m region at the center. I'll need to work around that. Object 5 is a square with 0.079m x 0.079m dimensions.  Its rotation matters because the effective bounding box changes as it rotates.  At zero rotation (k*pi/2), the bounding box is a square; at 45 degrees, the bounding box becomes a diamond, hence it is always possible to fit object 5 on surface 0 if there are no collisions.
           
           I've realized the key is understanding the forbidden space.  The center of the surface is blocked by the two objects already placed there. I want to calculate the maximum safe displacement for object 5 based on its rotation angle (theta) around that center hole to avoid the prior objects. Because objects 4 and 6 are placed at zero rotation, this simplifies things: the 45-degree angle would be the most difficult since that causes the highest bounding box.
           
           The strategy is to find placements for theta values very near the "obvious" values (0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2), because at those angles the rotated bounding box for object 5 fits the surface.
           
           Then, I'll generate points that lie just outside the forbidden central region. I'll create placements on all edges by taking the minimum point, the maximum point on the surface, and some "in-between" corners. I'll need to generate a significant number of viable locations to fulfill the requirement for 50 placements. I'm confident I can make this work!
