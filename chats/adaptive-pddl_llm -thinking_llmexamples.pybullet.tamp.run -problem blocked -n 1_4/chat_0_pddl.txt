User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)

           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom controllable(v4)

           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of why I can't fulfill this request.  My goal is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making an object be "on" something else and have a certain "type".  To make this true,  I need an object that's both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see two possible candidates for `?green`:  `v8` and `v12`. Both are correctly typed as `v17`. To satisfy the "on" condition, an object must be supported and at a particular pose.
           
           I analyze `v8` and `v12` in turn:
           I observe that I have the relationships:
           *   `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`
           *   `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`
           
           Crucially, the only available action is `move_base`. But `move_base` doesn't alter the pose or support relationships between objects; it just changes the robot's base configuration.  To get `v8` (or `v12`) "on" `v18`, I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions, which I can't.
           
           Since the problem explicitly restricts me to only use `move_base`, and it doesn't affect object "on" status, the goal cannot be achieved. I need those missing pick and place actions, and the problem constraints don't allow it. It's a fundamental problem of available actions versus the required task.
