           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Analysis**
           
           My objective is to generate a plan to achieve the goal state where objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 are "on" object v20. This translates to each object being supported by v20 and at a specific pose. Analyzing the initial state, all these objects are currently on object v11.  My understanding is that I must move each of these objects from v11 to v20. This requires that I must `pick` and then `place` each object.
           
           **Constraints and Limitations**
           
           The system imposes a critical constraint: I am only allowed to use action instances explicitly provided in the list. The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies the robot base does not need to be moved.
           Significantly, there are no `pick` or `place` actions allowed.
           
           **Unachievability of the Goal**
           
           Considering the actions, `move_base` doesn't help me move any objects.  The absence of `pick` and `place` action instances means I cannot manipulate any objects. Because these actions are required to transition any object from `on(..., v11)` to `on(..., v20)`, I conclude the goal is unattainable given the constraints.
