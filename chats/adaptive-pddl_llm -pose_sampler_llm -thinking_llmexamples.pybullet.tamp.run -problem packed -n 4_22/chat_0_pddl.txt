(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Nearly Square Object**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a nearly square object (ID 5) on surface 0, a square surface centered at the origin. Stability requires the object to be entirely within the surface boundaries.  Since the object's dimensions are almost identical (`w` and `h` are very close), I've simplified by treating them as equal to `s = 0.096067`.
           
           To determine valid placements, I need to account for rotations (`theta`). When rotated, the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) changes, and its new width (`W`) and height (`H`) are calculated based on the rotation and the original dimensions: `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`. This changes how much space is needed for the object in each direction.
           
           The surface 0 has the bounds of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. For a valid placement, the object's center `(x, y)` must fall within the range defined by `surf_lower_x + W/2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - W/2` and `surf_lower_y + H/2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - H/2`. For surface 0, this translates to ranges around the center.
           
           I've decided to vary both the rotation and position of the object's center. Considering that the AABB is almost always a square, the widest bounding box occurs at 45-degree intervals. The narrowest at 0 degrees and multiples of 90 degrees. I will then pick values for x and y that would explore the valid range. 
            
           To generate diverse placements, I've chosen a few representative rotation angles: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, `pi/2`, and `5*pi/8`. For each angle, I will select various `(x, y)` positions. At each angle, I will select 9 placement spots. The final result will be a list of 50 stable placements for the object.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 4 on Surface 0: A Collision-Free Strategy**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement of object ID 5 at the provided coordinates. Now, the task is to place object ID 4, a square with sides of approximately 0.0898, on the same surface (Surface 0).  The surface itself is a square bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Crucially, I need to avoid any collision with object ID 5, which is already positioned.
           
           Object 5 is located at approximately (-0.0869, -0.0869) with dimensions about 0.096 x 0.096, and I've already confirmed its AABB.  To ensure no overlap, I've calculated the boundaries of object 5's AABB; it occupies most of the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since I'm dealing with a square, I can maximize placement area by initially considering rotations of 0 and 90 degrees (pi/2).  For simplicity and to maintain a compact AABB, I'll start with a 0-degree rotation (theta = 0).
           
           With this rotation, the valid ranges for the center of object 4 become approximately  -0.090 to 0.090 in both X and Y.  To guarantee non-collision, I’ll leverage the fact that Object 5 AABB occupies the bottom-left of the surface and try to place Object 4 in the top-right corner. The placement (x: 0.09, y: 0.09, theta: 0) clearly avoids any collision.
           
           To generate 50 stable placements, I will strategically place the object at multiple angles, while checking to see that the AABB's of objects 4 and 5 do not intersect. Since the AABB is always within a rotated square, to guarantee that no AABBs will touch, I have to ensure the objects stay far enough apart.
           
           For a general angle of theta, I must recompute the object side lengths.
           
           I have found a placement algorithm that works. I am placing 45 objects in the top-right to avoid the bottom-left where object 5 lies, along with 5 more object at the top-left to generate the required 50 placements.  I will then select points in x and y that have a value that's further to right/top such that a collision would be impossible, and then choose a variety of rotations. 
           
           This multi-angle, top-right focused strategy will help me generate a diverse and collision-free set of 50 placements for object ID 4.  The final result will be 50 tuples (rotation, x position, y position) each safe and stable.

(Thoughts: **Thought Process for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this object placement problem, tailored to my expertise. I've been given a request to place "Object ID 6" on "Surface 0," and I have information about two previously placed objects, "Object ID 4" and "Object ID 5."  My goal is to find valid locations for Object 6 while avoiding collisions and staying within the surface boundaries.
           
           **1. Understanding the Setup**
           
           I begin by grasping the constraints: Surface 0 is a square, and I have its bounding box. I also know the dimensions of Object 6, which is nearly square itself.  The key is to use the existing placements of Object 4 and Object 5 as obstacles. I also know the rotation angle (theta) of object.
           
           **2. AABB Calculation and Space Definition**
           
           I need to create bounding box for the object to make checking if object is inside surface and checking if AABB are colliding very simple. The rotation of the objects is at 0 degrees.
           
           **3.  Collision Avoidance Strategy**
           
           My core strategy is to identify *valid regions* where Object 6 can be placed without overlapping existing objects.  I'll start with the surface bounds and then subtract the space occupied by Object 4 and Object 5 to find these clear areas.
           
           I know how to calculate bounding boxes, which are also known as AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) based on the object's center coordinates (x,y), its dimensions, and rotation angle (theta = 0).
           
           **4. Rotational Considerations**
           
           I will also consider the rotation of object. I will consider `theta = 0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, `pi/2`.
           
           For rotation, object's dimensions will vary, meaning I need to adjust the placement ranges dynamically for each rotation angle. 
           
           **5. Implementation and Point Generation**
           
           To determine valid placement ranges, I start with the surface bounds and exclude the space taken by the pre-placed objects. 
           
           Then I pick some points from these regions, making sure these points are diverse and evenly distributed.
