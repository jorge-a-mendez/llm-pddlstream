               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all "on" `v18`. Translating this into my internal representation, that means I need to arrange these objects so they are supported by, and at a specific pose on, `v18`. I see that currently, all four objects are on `v11`.  My usual approach is to use `pick` and `place` actions to rearrange things, but I also need to make sure I am in the correct base configuration to perform each `pick` and `place`.
           
           I see that `v18` has a support pose `#o2` for all the objects, so I know I can place them there if I can pick them up.  I also have `kin` facts that tell me what robotic arm I can use, which pose I can pick up from and place down at, which grasp to use, the base configuration needed and the arm trajectory needed. My initial analysis shows all the `kin` facts require base configuration `#o3` (specifically from the parameter `?q` in `kin`).
           
           However, looking at the initial state, I see I'm currently at base configuration `v3`. I need a way to move to `#o3`. There is a `move_base` action instance, but it's really confusing. It's `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It doesn't actually change the base configuration to `#o3`, and basically, it just consumes `canmove()`. No other `move_base` options are given.
           
           I now see the problem clearly. I have no way to get the robot to the base configuration required by the `pick` and `place` actions (`#o3`), because the provided `move_base` action instance doesn't achieve that, which means I can't satisfy the preconditions of `pick` and `place`. Since there's no way to reach the required base configuration, I have no way to execute any action that can move the objects from `v11` to `v18`. Therefore, I must conclude that the goal is currently unachievable, as I currently understand the problem state.
