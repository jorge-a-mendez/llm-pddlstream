           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Comprehensive Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to several key sub-goals, which I can tackle with the available rovers and resources:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:** I need to capture images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using the `v11` mode.
           2.  **Rock Analysis:** I need to analyze a stone (type `v2`) and a sample of soil (type `v6`) and transmit their analyses.
           
           **My Strategy:**
           
           *   I'll utilize two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each equipped with a camera and a store. Both rovers currently are in specific initial configurations, `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`, and are ready to be utilized.
           
           **Part 1: Image Acquisition (using rover `v12`)**
           
           1.  I'll position `v12` at a strategic location, `#o3`,  where its camera can view all three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, and `v19`).
           2.  I'll calibrate the camera and capture an image for each objective using the `take_image` action and the `v11` mode.
           3.  Then, I'll move `v12` to `#o0` (the communication point) to send the images to the lander `v9` using the `send_image` action.
           4.  Finally, I will return `v12` to its original configuration, `v13`.
           
           **Part 2: Rock Analysis and Transmission (using rover `v14`)**
           
           1.  I'll move `v14` to location `#o5`, which is a specific spot where it is above both the stone `v1` and the soil sample `v5`.
           2.  Using `v14`'s store, I will sample the stone,  then I will sample the soil using the `sample_rock` action.
           3.  Now, `v14` is full with the stone, so I'll transmit the rock analysis. I'll move `v14` to `#o0` to allow the sending of the data to the lander using the `send_analysis` action.
           4.  I will drop the rock sample and move back to location `#o5` for the second sampling.
           5.  I'll repeat the process for the soil sample (`v5`).
           6.  Finally, I'll return `v14` to its original configuration, `v15`.
           
           **Specific Actions:**
           
           *   I will execute a planned sequence of actions to cover all of the goal requirements.
           *   I will use a continuous parameter to define the rovers' location with the "#" objects.
           *   `#o0` is set to `-1.9, -2.0`, it serves as a communication point.
           *   `#o3` will represent a strategic location for `v12` to view objectives, I assume a valid one exists.
           *   `#o5` will serve as a configuration where both rovers can analyze both samples (stone `v1` and soil `v5`) and is part of the initial state.
           
           In short, it's a matter of directing the rovers to specific locations, using their sensors to capture images and samples, and then sending the data back to base. Then, returning all rovers to the initial configurations. It appears that the problem is well-defined and can be solved using the above steps.

           2.  I'll calibrate the camera and capture an image for each objective using the `take_image` action and the `v11` mode.
           3.  Then, I'll move `v12` to `#o0` (the communication point) to send the images to the lander `v9` using the `send_image` action.
           4.  Finally, I will return `v12` to its original configuration, `v13`.
           
           **Part 2: Rock Analysis and Transmission (using rover `v14`)**
           
           1.  I'll move `v14` to location `#o5`, which is a specific spot where it is above both the stone `v1` and the soil sample `v5`.
           2.  Using `v14`'s store, I will sample the stone,  then I will sample the soil using the `sample_rock` action.
           3.  Now, `v14` is full with the stone, so I'll transmit the rock analysis. I'll move `v14` to `#o0` to allow the sending of the data to the lander using the `send_analysis` action.
           4.  I will drop the rock sample and move back to location `#o5` for the second sampling.
           5.  I'll repeat the process for the soil sample (`v5`).
           6.  Finally, I'll return `v14` to its original configuration, `v15`.
           
           **Specific Actions:**
           
           *   I will execute a planned sequence of actions to cover all of the goal requirements.
           *   I will use a continuous parameter to define the rovers' location with the "#" objects.
           *   `#o0` is set to `-1.9, -2.0`, it serves as a communication point.
           *   `#o3` will represent a strategic location for `v12` to view objectives, I assume a valid one exists.
           *   `#o5` will serve as a configuration where both rovers can analyze both samples (stone `v1` and soil `v5`) and is part of the initial state.
           
           In short, it's a matter of directing the rovers to specific locations, using their sensors to capture images and samples, and then sending the data back to base. Then, returning all rovers to the initial configurations. It appears that the problem is well-defined and can be solved using the above steps.

(Thoughts: **Final Configuration Strategy and Rationale**
           
           Alright, after a rigorous review of the problem constraints and PDDL rules, here's my definitive strategy for defining the continuous configurations:
           
           *   **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):** I've determined that a single value for `#o0` will work for communication. The location (-1.3, -1.75) places the rover in a position to communicate with the lander (`v9`) without colliding with it or the wall (`v20`). This satisfies the `comvisible` requirements.
           
           *   **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`):**  Here's the key. I realized that while the problem statement implies a single `#o3` configuration, the geometry makes it impossible to see all three targets within the 2-unit imaging range from a *single* point. Instead of assuming a problem inconsistency, I'm interpreting the initial state's `imagevisible` predicates as a cue to generate *distinct* `#o3` values for each target (v17, v18, v19). The rule about providing distinct values for each rover-target pair when needed strengthens this interpretation. I will label the configurations as `#o3` for simplicity within the plan and use suffixes to disambiguate them in the configuration list as `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, and `#o3_v19`. I've calculated specific coordinates to ensure imaging within range of each objective.
           
           *   **Sampling Configuration (`#o5`):** Since `#o5` is not directly involved in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, I won't need to specify coordinates for it. The problem statement says I only need to provide coordinates for configurations that are arguments to those predicates. The values for `#o5` must be pre-determined, as the initial state provides `above` predicates.
           
           This approach guarantees collision-free configurations, line-of-sight for imaging and communication, and addresses the "reachable" criteria by planning motions. I am now confident that this will result in a valid and executable plan.

(Thoughts: **Refined Configuration Plan for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, after a thorough re-evaluation, I've come up with a revised plan to address the previous issues. It boils down to a more strategic distribution of tasks between the two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and new continuous configurations for communication and imaging.
           
           **Key Changes:**
           
           *   **Imaging Roles:** Rover `v12` will be tasked with capturing images of targets `v17` and `v19`. Rover `v14` will focus on imaging `v18`. This split helps leverage their initial positions and simplifies the plan.
           *   **Communication:**  I've chosen a single communication point, `(-1.0, -1.0)`, which I'm calling `#o0_common`. This location is within the communication range of the Lander (`v9`) and reachable by both rovers, while also avoiding collisions and respecting the reachability constraints.
           
           **Specific Coordinates and Reasoning:**
           
           1.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0_common`):**  `(-1.0, -1.0)`
               *   This point is designed to avoid collision with both the Lander `v9` and the obstacle `v20`.
               *   It's within the 4-meter communication range of the Lander, as indicated by the initial parameters.
               *   This is now the single communication point for both rovers.
           2.  **Imaging Configurations (`#o3`) for `v12`:**
               *   For `v17`:  `#o3_v17_pose = (1.8, 1.0)`.
                   *   This position is designed to be within the 2-meter imaging range of `v17` and reachable from `v12`'s starting position at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
                   *   Collision-free with the relevant obstacles, as previously checked.
               *   For `v18`:  `#o3_v18_pose = (-1.0, 1.0)`.
                   *   This is *crucial*. Given the "not reachable" errors of the prior approach, and given `imagevisible` constraints, I've interpreted this is an achievable location to view `v18` from, even if it might involve traversing through areas outside the direct path.
                   *   Within the 2-meter range.
               *   For `v19`:  `#o3_v19_pose = (0.8, 1.0)`.
                   *   This location is within 2 meters of `v19`.
                   *   Collision-free, given my prior assessment.
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:**
               1.  Move to `#o3_v17_pose` and image `v17`.
               2.  Move to `#o3_v18_pose` and image `v18`.
               3.  Move to `#o3_v19_pose` and image `v19`.
               4.  Move to `#o0_common`, and send all the captured images.
               5.  Return to `v13`.
           
           *   **Rover `v14`:**
               1.  Move to `#o5` to sample `v1` and `v5`.
               2.  Move to `#o0_common`, send the rock analyses, and drop the samples.
               3.  Move to `v15` to complete the plan.
           
           This is a much cleaner and simpler plan, with each rover fulfilling its respective role, and a clear set of configurations that satisfies all the constraints, including image visibility and rover movement, while still respecting the overall geometric setup.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Refined Configuration Selection for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous configuration choices aren't working. It looks like some of my earlier selections either collided with obstacles or weren't reachable.  I need to revisit my scene analysis and come up with new configurations for the communication and imaging tasks.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Scene:**
           
           I've got Rovers `v12` at position `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  My goal is still to get image data and perform soil analysis, just like before. Key scene elements include: Lander `v9`, a small object `v21` near `(-0.8, -0.9)`, and the thin wall obstacle `v20` running along the y-axis at x=0. I have two specific requirements: get pictures from targets, and get sample readings from specific spots. The same five goals: reach the points indicated and take pictures.
           
           **Troubleshooting Communication and Imaging Points:**
           
           1. **Communication Point (#o0):**  My previous attempt for this point ((-1.0, -1.0)) hit the new obstacle `v21`. The goal is to set up a point where the rovers can send data.  My comm point for both `v12` and `v14` will be `(-1.7, -1.0)`. This point looks safe: it's outside the zones of the wall `v20`, the tiny obstacle `v21`, and the lander `v9`. Plus, its about 1 meter from `v9`, well within the 4m communication range. Reachability is something I need to keep in mind, and while it might seem like it, it is, in fact, possible given the `motion` predicates.
           
           2. **Imaging Points (#o3):** My previous imaging points `(1.8, 1.0)`, `(-1.0, 1.0)`, and `(0.8, 1.0)` were flagged as unreachable. This is odd because the initial state tells me I *can* take a picture. This tells me that I've been trying to choose points that are too far from where the rover is. The `v12` starts on the `x > 0` side of the wall, and the targets it needs to image are `v17` at approx `(2.2, 2.1)`, `v18` at approx `(-1.9, 2.0)` and `v19` at approx `(0.5, 2.0)`. The `imagevisible` predicates in the initial state mean the rovers should be able to photograph.  Here's what I'm going to do:
               - **For v17:**  I'll use `(2.0, 0.5)`. This is clearly on the correct side of the wall. Its about 1.63m from `v17` and collision-free.
               - **For v19:** I'll use `(0.5, 0.5)`. This is a fine position at about 1.48m.
               - **For v18:**  This is where it gets tricky, as this is on the *other* side of the wall. My earlier efforts might have hit a roadblock in the geometry solver. I *have* to pick a reachable location, and I will use `(-1.8, 0.5)`. Since `imagevisible` is true, the `motion` predicates in my problem statements allow for this.
           
           **Plan for Rover Actions:**
           
           To summarize, here's the planned sequence:
           
           *   **v12:**
               1.  Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(2.0, 0.5)` (#o3\_v12\_v17).
               2.  Take an image of `v17`.
               3.  Move from `(2.0, 0.5)` to `(0.5, 0.5)` (#o3\_v12\_v19).
               4.  Take an image of `v19`.
               5.  Move from `(0.5, 0.5)` to `(-1.8, 0.5)` (#o3\_v12\_v18).
               6.  Take an image of `v18`.
               7.  Move to `(-1.7, -1.0)` (#o0\_v12\_v9).

Model:     **Refined Configuration Selection for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous configuration choices aren't working. It looks like some of my earlier selections either collided with obstacles or weren't reachable.  I need to revisit my scene analysis and come up with new configurations for the communication and imaging tasks.
           
           **Re-evaluating the Scene:**
           
           I've got Rovers `v12` at position `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  My goal is still to get image data and perform soil analysis, just like before. Key scene elements include: Lander `v9`, a small object `v21` near `(-0.8, -0.9)`, and the thin wall obstacle `v20` running along the y-axis at x=0. I have two specific requirements: get pictures from targets, and get sample readings from specific spots. The same five goals: reach the points indicated and take pictures.
           
           **Troubleshooting Communication and Imaging Points:**
           
           1. **Communication Point (#o0):**  My previous attempt for this point ((-1.0, -1.0)) hit the new obstacle `v21`. The goal is to set up a point where the rovers can send data.  My comm point for both `v12` and `v14` will be `(-1.7, -1.0)`. This point looks safe: it's outside the zones of the wall `v20`, the tiny obstacle `v21`, and the lander `v9`. Plus, its about 1 meter from `v9`, well within the 4m communication range. Reachability is something I need to keep in mind, and while it might seem like it, it is, in fact, possible given the `motion` predicates.
           
           2. **Imaging Points (#o3):** My previous imaging points `(1.8, 1.0)`, `(-1.0, 1.0)`, and `(0.8, 1.0)` were flagged as unreachable. This is odd because the initial state tells me I *can* take a picture. This tells me that I've been trying to choose points that are too far from where the rover is. The `v12` starts on the `x > 0` side of the wall, and the targets it needs to image are `v17` at approx `(2.2, 2.1)`, `v18` at approx `(-1.9, 2.0)` and `v19` at approx `(0.5, 2.0)`. The `imagevisible` predicates in the initial state mean the rovers should be able to photograph.  Here's what I'm going to do:
               - **For v17:**  I'll use `(2.0, 0.5)`. This is clearly on the correct side of the wall. Its about 1.63m from `v17` and collision-free.
               - **For v19:** I'll use `(0.5, 0.5)`. This is a fine position at about 1.48m.
               - **For v18:**  This is where it gets tricky, as this is on the *other* side of the wall. My earlier efforts might have hit a roadblock in the geometry solver. I *have* to pick a reachable location, and I will use `(-1.8, 0.5)`. Since `imagevisible` is true, the `motion` predicates in my problem statements allow for this.
           
           **Plan for Rover Actions:**
           
           To summarize, here's the planned sequence:
           
           *   **v12:**
               1.  Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(2.0, 0.5)` (#o3\_v12\_v17).
               2.  Take an image of `v17`.
               3.  Move from `(2.0, 0.5)` to `(0.5, 0.5)` (#o3\_v12\_v19).
               4.  Take an image of `v19`.
               5.  Move from `(0.5, 0.5)` to `(-1.8, 0.5)` (#o3\_v12\_v18).
               6.  Take an image of `v18`.
               7.  Move to `(-1.7, -1.0)` (#o0\_v12\_v9).
