           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This demands a state where certain conditions about imaging and analysis are met. Breaking down the `new-axiom@0()` precondition, I find that the key challenge lies in satisfying predicates like `receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`, and various type predicates. I'll need to figure out how to take images of specific "stone" and "soil" objects and then have them analyzed.
           
           **Initial State Analysis and Available Actions**
           
           Inspecting the initial state reveals that I have rovers, a lander, stores for samples, and "objective" and "mode" entities. The critical aspects in the initial state are the current rover configurations denoted by `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The available actions seem to involve "moving," taking images, sending images, and sending analyses. The initial state fact `conf(rover, #name)` and the instruction indicate I must provide continuous values for specific configurations (denoted by the '#' notation) in the scene. There's also the additional caveat that only specific instances of actions are allowable in my plan. Crucially, the move actions (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` effectively serve as no-ops.
           
           **Identifying Targets and Dependencies**
           
           I identify that the objective is to image entities `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and analyze rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil). The predicates `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)` must be satisfied, along with receiving analysis for all stone and soil samples. Now, I have to figure out the right sequence of actions and the suitable sensor settings (with "#o3", "#o0") for taking images and doing analyses. The image actions have a `mode` parameter for the analysis. For analysis, I must use `v16`.
           
           **Planning for Image Acquisition**
           
           I establish that rover `v12` will image the targets. The sequence of actions will be as follows:
           1.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)` and `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)` to image the objectives
           2.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)` to send the image to lander `v9`.
           I repeat this process for the other image targets `v17` and `v18`.
           
           **Planning for Rock Analysis**
           
           The actions for rocks will be performed by `v14`.
           The planned sequence for stone rock `v1`:
           1.  `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`
           2.  `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           3.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           The sequence will be repeated for `v3`, `v4` (stone), and `v5`, `v7`, `v8` (soil).
           
           **Continuous Value Assignments and Geometric Constraints**
           
           Based on the instructions, I have to provide values for configurations that I am using in my plan. The configurations needed are: #o0, #o3 and #o5. The problem states that the maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`. However, because the move action is limited to the current base configuration, I assume that `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5` refer to the base configuration that the rover is currently in (e.g. `v13` for `v12` at initial state). This implies that if it has a line of sight to the target from the initial configuration, it can be imaged.
           
           I have found, however, that the rover needs to be in a configuration that will provide the target a line of sight and be in the proximity of 2.0 to image, and 4.0 to communicate. This is in conflict with the constraint of the rovers only performing no-op actions. The objects are too far away from the rover's initial configuration to satisfy the preconditions.

           3.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
