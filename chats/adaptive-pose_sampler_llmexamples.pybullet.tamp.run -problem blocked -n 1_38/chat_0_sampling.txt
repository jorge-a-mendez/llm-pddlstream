           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single rectangular surface, `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The object has dimensions `(0.07, 0.07)`. I need to place the object on surface 0 such that it is fully contained within the surface's x and y bounds, and it doesn't collide with any previously placed objects. Since this is the first object, there are no existing collisions to consider.
           
           The surface 0 has a width of `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6` and a height of `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`. The object has a side length of 0.07. Since the object is square, its orientation does not change its effective footprint for containment. I can place the object at various (x, y) coordinates within the surface, ensuring that the object's extents are always within the surface's bounds.
           
           For a placement `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, `x` and `y` represent the center of the object.
           The x-range for the object's center on surface 0 is `4.2 + 0.07/2` to `4.8 - 0.07/2`.
           The y-range for the object's center on surface 0 is `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.0 - 0.07/2`.
           
           This means the x-center range is `4.235` to `4.765`.
           The y-center range is `-0.565` to `-0.035`.
           
           I will generate placements by varying x and y within these ranges, and trying different orientations (though for a square object, rotation doesn't change the bounding box, but it's good practice to vary it).

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received feedback that the placement `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)` for object ID 5 was successful. This means there is an object with ID 5 at that position.
           
           Now I need to place a new object with ID 10. The object has dimensions `(0.0975, 0.0975)`. The available surface is `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           The x-range for the object's center on surface 0 is `4.2 + 0.0975/2` to `4.8 - 0.0975/2`.
           The y-range for the object's center on surface 0 is `-0.6 + 0.0975/2` to `0.0 - 0.0975/2`.
           
           This means the x-center range is `4.24875` to `4.75125`.
           The y-center range is `-0.55125` to `-0.04875`.
           
           I must ensure that the new object (ID 10) does not collide with the previously placed object (ID 5) at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`.
           Object 5's AABB is `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`.
           Object 10's AABB, if centered at `(x, y)`, would be `(x - 0.0975/2, y - 0.0975/2)` to `(x + 0.0975/2, y + 0.0975/2)`.
           
           I will try to place the new object as far as possible from the previously placed object. Since the previous object is in the lower-left corner, I will start by placing the new object in the upper-right corner and then move inwards.

Model:     I have received feedback on successful placements for two objects:
           - Object ID 5: `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)` on surface 0. Its AABB is `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`.
           - Object ID 10: `(0, 0.0, 4.75125, -0.04875)` on surface 0. Its AABB is `(4.7025, -0.0975)` to `(4.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Now I need to place a new object with ID 6. The object has dimensions `(0.07, 0.07)`.
           There are three surfaces available:
           - `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`
           - `1: ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`
           - `2: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           
           Notice that surface 2 is entirely contained within surface 0. Any placement on surface 2 is also a placement on surface 0. Given the previous successful placements were on the original smaller surface `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, it seems like `0` might refer to the larger surface, and `2` might be the original one. I should prioritize placing on `1` if possible to avoid existing objects, and then consider the other surfaces, being careful about collisions with objects 5 and 10.
           
           Let's analyze the available space.
           Object 6 dimensions: `(0.07, 0.07)`.
           
           **Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`**
           - x-range for center: `4.2 + 0.07/2` to `4.8 - 0.07/2` => `4.235` to `4.765`
           - y-range for center: `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.6 - 0.07/2` => `-0.565` to `0.565`
           This surface is larger than the area where objects 5 and 10 are located. There's new space above `y=0.0`.
           
           **Surface 1: `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`**
           - x-range for center: `-4.8 + 0.07/2` to `-4.2 - 0.07/2` => `-4.765` to `-4.235`
           - y-range for center: `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.6 - 0.07/2` => `-0.565` to `0.565`
           This surface is entirely separate from where objects 5 and 10 are, so it's a good candidate for easy placement.
           
           **Surface 2: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`**
           - x-range for center: `4.2 + 0.07/2` to `4.8 - 0.07/2` => `4.235` to `4.765`
           - y-range for center: `-0.6 + 0.07/2` to `0.0 - 0.07/2` => `-0.565` to `-0.035`
           This surface is the original smaller surface where objects 5 and 10 were placed. It has very limited space left.
           
           I'll prioritize placing on Surface 1 as it guarantees no collision with existing objects. Then I will consider surface 0, utilizing the new space in the positive y-direction.
