(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on a single surface (surface 0). The object is small and nearly square, while the surface is much larger. Since stability is implied by containment within the surface boundaries, I'll focus on ensuring the object's bounding box stays within the surface's bounds.
           
           To find these placements, I'll analyze the surface dimensions and object dimensions. I know surface 0's bounds, so I can calculate the surface's dimensions (0.27 x 0.27).  Object 5 is approximately 0.089 x 0.089.  The object is therefore much smaller than the surface, providing ample space for placements.
           
           Because the object is almost square, rotations don't drastically change its effective bounding box. I'll consider the bounding box of the rotated object, and its dimensions `W_rot` and `H_rot`, depending on the rotation angle `theta`. The maximum AABB will happen at `theta = pi/4`.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to place the object's center within a safe area on the surface. For a given rotation, this safe area is smaller than the surface's overall area, and smaller the larger the rotation. To simplify calculations, I will first calculate the dimensions `W_rot` and `H_rot` for `theta= pi/4`. I will set `x_coords` and `y_coords` within the safe bounds for the most restrictive case and use `theta=pi/4`.
           
           To systematically cover the available space, I'll use a 7x7 grid of center points within that safe range and use `theta = pi/4` to ensure all these placements are valid.  For this to total to 50, I will use a different angle for a single placement. For the final placement I will use the center of the surface `(x=0, y=0)` with an unrotated placement (theta=0).
           
           This method efficiently creates 50 valid, stable object placements for the given scenario. The plan is straightforward and the approach is robust.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable, Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           Alright, I've got the feedback on Object 5's successful placement, which tells me I can work in the corner of Surface 0. Now it's Object 4's turn. I've got its size, and it's a perfect square. The goal is 50 stable placements, and I need to avoid hitting Object 5, which is already set at a 45-degree angle in the bottom-left.
           
           I need to make sure the placements I generate are within the surface boundaries. First, I analyzed the dimensions, calculating the valid ranges for the center of the square based on its half-extents. Then, I needed to make sure Object 4 will not collide with the AABB of Object 5.
           
           I found Object 5's coordinates to be in the lower-left, and I know I can avoid a collision by ensuring that Object 4's AABB doesn't overlap with this region.
           So, I devised a simple strategy: to place Object 4 with `theta = 0` (or multiples of pi/2) and place the new objects in the positive x, y area relative to the origin, right and above the bounding box of Object 5.
           
           After calculating the safe zone and ensuring the x coordinate is greater than 0.0402 and y greater than 0.0402, I will generate a grid of 50 stable and collision-free placements. Finally, I will check that the number of returned values is exactly 50 and all of them are valid and ready to be used.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to place Object 6 a total of 50 times on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into either Object 4 or Object 5, which are already in place. The surface is a simple square, and Object 6 is also square-shaped. My initial thought is to figure out the free space available on the surface, accounting for the existing objects.
           
           First, I calculate the occupied area. Object 5 is a rotated square, so I need to find its rotated AABB. With some trigonometry, I figure out its dimensions, then calculate the coordinates of its bounding box. Object 4 is simply a square, so its bounding box is straightforward to calculate.  By combining these, I've got a good idea of what's already taken.  This gives me the coordinates: the combined occupied area is approximately `[-0.135, 0.08942] x [-0.135, -0.00902]`.
           
           Knowing the occupied space, I can plan where to put Object 6. I'll need to figure out its maximum dimensions when rotated, but for now I'm thinking about keeping it at a 0-degree angle. Since Object 6's a square, its bounding box size is simple. I can keep it in the surface space `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]` for Object 6 with a little bit of space.
           
           I need to avoid the occupied region, so I'm going to focus on placing Object 6 "above" that region. To do that I'm going to shift the y-axis a bit. Then I can create a grid and add 50 placements. It will look like 10 points along the x-axis, 5 along the y-axis, and all with a 0-degree rotation.
