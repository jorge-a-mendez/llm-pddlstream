           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievement in the pr2-tamp Domain**
           
           My primary objective is to find a plan to satisfy the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` in this specific `pr2-tamp` domain. To achieve this, I need to find an object `?green` that is both `on v18` and has a `type v17`.  I identify that possible objects for `?green` are `v8` and `v12`, as they are the only objects with the required `type`. Looking at the initial state, neither `v8` nor `v12` are currently `on v18`. This means I will have to *place* one of these objects to meet this condition.
           
           To place an object, I'd need to first *pick* it up.  I've reviewed the preconditions for both `pick` and `place` actions. However, here's where the problem arises: **The only action available to me is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`**. This action essentially moves the robot from one base configuration to the *same* base configuration. The `move_base` action removes the fact `canmove()`, which is a prerequisite for both `pick` and `place`.
           
           Since I can only `move_base` and I can't `pick` or `place` any objects, I'm stuck. It's impossible to manipulate the objects and get either `v8` or `v12` "on v18" with the limited actions provided. Therefore, I conclude that the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently **unachievable** given the current action instances and initial state.
