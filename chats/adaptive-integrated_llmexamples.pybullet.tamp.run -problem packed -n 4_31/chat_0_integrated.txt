User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.243, -0.426), (-0.149, -0.332)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.152, -0.551), (0.25, -0.453)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, -0.013), (-0.194, 0.084)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.196, -0.379, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.228, 0.974).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.26, 0.396), (-0.161, 0.495)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.201, -0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.899, 0.438).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.242, 0.036, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.279, 0.96).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.21, 0.445, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.926, 0.378).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that need to be moved to be on the surface v18. The current location of these objects is on surface v11. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, which are currently empty. There is only one base motion available, which keeps the robot at its current base configuration (v3). This means all picking and placing actions must be performed from the current robot base position.
           
           The goal is to place objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 on surface v18. All these objects are currently on surface v11. Since the only available action is `move_base` that just moves the robot to the same position it is already in, it is not possible to achieve the goal. No pick or place actions are provided in the available action instances. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
