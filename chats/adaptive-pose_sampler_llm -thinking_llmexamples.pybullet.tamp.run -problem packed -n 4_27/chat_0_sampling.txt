(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my approach to placing this object. I'm dealing with a square object of size `0.08099671679078385` by `0.08099671679078385` on a square surface that is centered at `(0,0)` and spans from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. My goal is to find 50 stable placements, and I'm treating the specified coordinates as the object's AABB dimensions when it is *not* rotated (i.e., at `theta = 0`).
           
           Since it's a square, rotation simplifies things somewhat. The AABB at 0 and π/2 are same. The most impact on stability is when rotation = pi/4, because this will increase the surface area required to fit the rectangle.
           
           First, I calculate the allowable range for the object's center based on the surface size and object's dimensions. For `theta = 0`, the half-width and half-height of the object are `s/2 = 0.040498358395391925`.
           So, the object can range on surface from `-0.0945` to `0.0945` (this is the valid placement range).
           
           To ensure adequate coverage, I'll generate a 7x7 grid of placements within this range, giving 49 placements with the object's center at `theta = 0`. For 7x7 grid points I generate coordinates as x_coord = [-0.0945, -0.063, -0.0315, 0, 0.0315, 0.063, 0.0945].
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll place the object at the surface center at `theta = pi/4`.
           The AABB dimensions at theta = pi/4 is  `s / sqrt(2) = 0.05727279644341935`. With half of that, the rotation = pi/4 AABB ranges from [-0.0777, 0.0777]. The center `(0,0)` is always a stable solution in the space, as its within the range.
           
           The following positions will meet all the parameters.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Object Placements**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, and now I need to place object 5 without any collisions. Object 4 is located at `(0, 0.0, -0.09450164160460808, -0.09450164160460808)`, and I need to use this information to calculate the AABB's of all objects to avoid collisions. Object 5 is a square with side length 0.08988042148032285 and the surface is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I begin by calculating the AABB of object 4. Then, based on the placement and size of object 4, the range in which object 5 can be placed is calculated. The AABB of object 4 is from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.05400328320921615, -0.05400328320921615)`. Next, I need to find all viable placements for object 5. The range for the center of object 5, when rotated at theta = 0, is calculated, so that it sits within the surface boundaries.
           
           I'm considering collision with object 4 by comparing their AABBs. I need to avoid overlap to prevent collisions. A convenient location appears to be the top-right corner; therefore, I test placement at `(0.09005978925983858, 0.09005978925983858)`, and calculate the AABB of object 5 there, to check it does not overlap with the object 4 AABB, and confirm that there is no collision.
           
           Then, I decide to generate 50 stable placements, prioritizing the unused surface area, so I determine the safe region for the center of object 5, accounting for the object 4 collision region to be avoided. With this forbidden region identified, the valid area for object 5, without rotation, can be defined.
           
           I then move to generate a grid for object 5, to find 50 stable placements. I try to create an 8x8 grid, 64 total locations to test, within the valid range, and filter points that could collide, defined as a collision if `x < -0.009063072469054725` AND `y < -0.009063072469054725`. This region is around the bottom-left corner of the surface and inside the collision of object 4. I identify 48 safe placements with theta = 0 using this approach.
           
           Next, I consider placement with `theta=pi/4`. The effective size and safe placement ranges are recomputed. The surface range for object 5, at `theta=pi/4` is `-0.07145 to 0.07145`. Then, I must re-check for collisions with object 4, based on the rotation.
           
           I determine valid placements, 5 in total.
           I create a 3x3 grid, compute the safe area, and use it to refine the algorithm and identify these safe placements.
           These are added to the list of 48 theta = 0 locations, for a total of 50.
           
           I have finalized my grid and placement strategy; 48 placements with theta = 0, and 2 additional placements with theta = pi/4 to get to 50 locations, to maximize safe, stable placements for object 5.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, which is a square region centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27. I need to avoid collisions with two existing objects: object ID 4 and object ID 5.
           
           First, I established the boundaries of the scene and the dimensions of the new object (side = 0.0907). Then, I calculated the permissible area within Surface 0, considering the need to avoid the obstacles. I needed to ensure that object ID 7's AABB did not intersect with the AABBs of objects ID 4 or ID 5. To do this, I set up a grid for potential placements, which would let me systematically assess if placing object ID 7 at theta = 0, or by extension, theta = pi/2, would create a collision. I performed precise calculations to define the safe regions on the surface, including accounting for object size and rotation. The forbidden regions for object 7 depend on its orientation, but the key constraints are collision checks. I decided the easiest plan would be to start with theta = 0, because it is the most stable and can occupy more positions.
           
           To begin, I mapped out the permissible area on the surface, accounting for the object's dimensions and the need to avoid existing objects. I calculated a grid with 8x8 squares, with a step size of roughly 0.025. Then I checked which squares were occupied by object 4 and object 5. The calculations showed that the objects restricted object 7 from being placed in 24 squares. I was then left with 40 possible points.
           
           I generated 40 stable placements with the object at theta=0. Then I added 3 placements with theta = pi/4 which were non-overlapping. Finally, I assigned theta = pi/2 to 7 more distinct points for diversity.

(Thoughts: **Final Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with objects 4, 5, and 7. The object is a square of side length 0.097.
           
           First, for 32 placements, I'll set the rotation angle (theta) to 0. I've calculated a grid for the x and y center coordinates, and the "safe" x-coordinates are `[0.012, 0.037, 0.061, 0.086]`. I'll pair each of these x values with each of the y values from the grid: `[-0.086, -0.061, -0.037, -0.012, 0.012, 0.037, 0.061, 0.086]`, for a total of 32 placements. This grid avoids the collision zones due to objects 4, 5, and 7.
           
           Next, I need 18 more placements. I'll switch to a rotation of pi/4. I've worked out the effective extent with this orientation, and the safe x range begins at 0.0244 and goes up to 0.066. The full y range (from -0.066 to 0.066) is also available. I'll create a 3x3 grid within this range, giving 9 placements. I'll take a copy and place these 9 with `theta = -pi/4`, for a total of 50.
           
           This should give a solid set of stable placements without any overlap.

Model:     **Final Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with objects 4, 5, and 7. The object is a square of side length 0.097.
           
           First, for 32 placements, I'll set the rotation angle (theta) to 0. I've calculated a grid for the x and y center coordinates, and the "safe" x-coordinates are `[0.012, 0.037, 0.061, 0.086]`. I'll pair each of these x values with each of the y values from the grid: `[-0.086, -0.061, -0.037, -0.012, 0.012, 0.037, 0.061, 0.086]`, for a total of 32 placements. This grid avoids the collision zones due to objects 4, 5, and 7.
           
           Next, I need 18 more placements. I'll switch to a rotation of pi/4. I've worked out the effective extent with this orientation, and the safe x range begins at 0.0244 and goes up to 0.066. The full y range (from -0.066 to 0.066) is also available. I'll create a 3x3 grid within this range, giving 9 placements. I'll take a copy and place these 9 with `theta = -pi/4`, for a total of 50.
           
           This should give a solid set of stable placements without any overlap.
