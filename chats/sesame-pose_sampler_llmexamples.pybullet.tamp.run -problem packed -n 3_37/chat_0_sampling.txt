           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0888 x 0.0888. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many stable placements. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its AABB, so we can primarily focus on finding valid (x, y) coordinates.
           
           To be stable, the object's bounding box must be entirely contained within the surface's bounding box. For surface 0, this means:
           - `lower_x_surf <= x_obj_center - 0.5 * size_x_obj`
           - `upper_x_surf >= x_obj_center + 0.5 * size_x_obj`
           - `lower_y_surf <= y_obj_center - 0.5 * size_y_obj`
           - `upper_y_surf >= y_obj_center + 0.5 * size_y_obj`
           
           Given `size_x_obj = 0.08883107388320738` and `size_y_obj = 0.08883107388320732`, and surface 0 bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`:
           
           The half-extents of the object are approximately `0.0444`.
           
           For x-coordinates:
           `-0.135 <= x_center - 0.0444` => `x_center >= -0.135 + 0.0444 = -0.0906`
           `0.135 >= x_center + 0.0444` => `x_center <= 0.135 - 0.0444 = 0.0906`
           So, `-0.0906 <= x_center <= 0.0906`.
           
           For y-coordinates:
           `-0.135 <= y_center - 0.0444` => `y_center >= -0.135 + 0.0444 = -0.0906`
           `0.135 >= y_center + 0.0444` => `y_center <= 0.135 - 0.0444 = 0.0906`
           So, `-0.0906 <= y_center <= 0.0906`.
           
           I will generate placements within these valid x and y ranges, varying both position and orientation (even though orientation doesn't change the AABB for a square object, it's good practice for general object shapes). I will aim for a diverse set of placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I still have the same single square surface 0 with bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with `size_x = 0.07476150509918958` and `size_y = 0.0747615050991896`.
           
           The half-extents of object 5 are approximately `0.03738`.
           
           For x-coordinates for object 5:
           `-0.135 <= x_center - 0.03738` => `x_center >= -0.135 + 0.03738 = -0.09762`
           `0.135 >= x_center + 0.03738` => `x_center <= 0.135 - 0.03738 = 0.09762`
           So, `-0.09762 <= x_center <= 0.09762`.
           
           For y-coordinates for object 5:
           `-0.135 <= y_center - 0.03738` => `y_center >= -0.135 + 0.03738 = -0.09762`
           `0.135 >= y_center + 0.03738` => `y_center <= 0.135 - 0.03738 = 0.09762`
           So, `-0.09762 <= y_center <= 0.09762`.
           
           I also have a previously placed object (ID: 4) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` on surface 0, which has `size_x = 0.08883107388320738` and `size_y = 0.08883107388320732`. This object's AABB extends from approximately `(-0.0444, -0.0444)` to `(0.0444, 0.0444)`.
           
           Now, when placing object 5, I need to ensure it does not collide with object 4. The no-collision rule means that the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 should not overlap.
           AABB of object 4: `x_range = [-0.0444, 0.0444]`, `y_range = [-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           AABB of object 5 (if centered at 0,0): `x_range = [-0.03738, 0.03738]`, `y_range = [-0.03738, 0.03738]`
           
           If object 5 is placed at (0,0), it would collide with object 4. Therefore, I need to choose `(x, y)` coordinates for object 5 such that its AABB is outside of object 4's AABB, while still being within the bounds of surface 0.
           
           For example, if I place object 5 to the right of object 4:
           `x_center_5 - 0.03738 >= 0.0444` => `x_center_5 >= 0.0444 + 0.03738 = 0.08178`
           If I place object 5 to the left of object 4:
           `x_center_5 + 0.03738 <= -0.0444` => `x_center_5 <= -0.0444 - 0.03738 = -0.08178`
           Similarly for y-coordinates.
           
           I will generate placements for object 5 that avoid the central area occupied by object 4, and still respect the surface boundaries.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I am working with the same single square surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with `size_x = 0.09398225667139079` and `size_y = 0.09398225667139076`.
           The half-extents for object 6 are approximately `0.04699`.
           
           For x-coordinates for object 6:
           `-0.135 <= x_center - 0.04699` => `x_center >= -0.135 + 0.04699 = -0.08801`

           So, `-0.08801 <= x_center <= 0.08801`.
           
           For y-coordinates for object 6:
           `-0.135 <= y_center - 0.04699` => `y_center >= -0.135 + 0.04699 = -0.08801`

           So, `-0.08801 <= y_center <= 0.08801`.

             - `size_x = 0.08883107388320738`, `size_y = 0.08883107388320732`
             - Half-extents: `0.044415`

           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)`
             - `size_x = 0.07476150509918958`, `size_y = 0.0747615050991896`
             - Half-extents: `0.03738`
             - AABB centered at `(0.09, 0.0)`: `x_range = [0.09 - 0.03738, 0.09 + 0.03738] = [0.05262, 0.12738]`
             - AABB centered at `(0.09, 0.0)`: `y_range = [0.0 - 0.03738, 0.0 + 0.03738] = [-0.03738, 0.03738]`
           
           Object 6 needs to be placed without colliding with Object 4 or Object 5.
           Object 4 is in the center. Object 5 is to the right of the center.
           The combined x-range occupied by existing objects on the x-axis for y=0 is approximately:
           `[-0.044415, 0.044415]` (Object 4)
           `[0.05262, 0.12738]` (Object 5)
           
           So, potential areas for Object 6 are:
           1. To the left of Object 4: `x_center + 0.04699 <= -0.044415` => `x_center <= -0.044415 - 0.04699 = -0.091405`
              Combined with surface bounds: `-0.08801 <= x_center <= -0.091405` (This doesn't work, upper bound is smaller than lower bound).
              Wait, the object 6 bounds are `-0.08801 <= x_center <= 0.08801`.
              So for object 6 to be entirely to the left of object 4: `x_center_6 + 0.04699 <= -0.044415` => `x_center_6 <= -0.091405`.
              This means the valid range for `x_center_6` becomes `[-0.08801, -0.091405]`, which is empty. This implies object 6 is too large to fit entirely to the left of object 4 *if it were placed on the same y-level as object 4*, AND still within the surface bounds.
              Let's re-evaluate the maximum possible x for object 6 if it's placed to the left: `x_center_6 + 0.04699 <= -0.044415`. The right edge of object 6 must be less than the left edge of object 4. The `x_center_6` must then be less than `-0.044415 - 0.04699 = -0.091405`.
              However, the maximum x_center for object 6 allowed by the surface is `0.08801`. The minimum x_center for object 6 is `-0.08801`.
              So, if `x_center_6` needs to be less than `-0.091405`, and the minimum allowed `x_center_6` is `-0.08801`, then there's no space on the left when considering the full AABB. This calculation suggests it's impossible to place object 6 entirely to the left of object 4 if their y-ranges overlap significantly.
           
           2. To the right of Object 5: `x_center - 0.04699 >= 0.12738` => `x_center >= 0.12738 + 0.04699 = 0.17437`
              This is outside the surface bounds for x: `0.135`. So this is not possible.
           
           This implies I must place Object 6 above or below the existing objects, or in a remaining corner if there's enough space.
           Let's consider placing it above or below.
           The overall occupied y-range for objects 4 and 5 is approximately `[-0.044415, 0.044415]` (from Object 4, which is wider in y than Object 5's y-extent at (0.09,0.0)).
           
           To place object 6 *above* the existing objects:
           `y_center - 0.04699 >= 0.044415` => `y_center >= 0.044415 + 0.04699 = 0.091405`
           Combined with surface bounds: `y_center <= 0.08801`.
           Again, `0.091405 <= y_center <= 0.08801` is an empty range. This means object 6 is too large to be placed entirely *above* object 4 and still within surface bounds.
           
           To place object 6 *below* the existing objects:
           `y_center + 0.04699 <= -0.044415` => `y_center <= -0.044415 - 0.04699 = -0.091405`
           Combined with surface bounds: `y_center >= -0.08801`.
           Again, `-0.08801 <= y_center <= -0.091405` is an empty range.
           
           This means placing object 6 adjacent to objects 4 and 5 (completely non-overlapping AABBs) is not possible, as it would extend beyond the surface boundaries due to its size.
           
           However, the no-collision rule refers to *any* collision, not necessarily full adjacency. This is tricky.
           Let's re-evaluate if there's any remaining space.
           The maximum object 6 AABB can go is `x_center = 0.08801`, `y_center = 0.08801`.
           Object 4 AABB: `x_range = [-0.0444, 0.0444]`, `y_range = [-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           Object 5 AABB: `x_range = [0.05262, 0.12738]`, `y_range = [-0.03738, 0.03738]`
           
           Consider placing Object 6 in the top-left corner.
           AABB of Object 6 if its center is `(x_c, y_c)`:
           `[x_c - 0.04699, x_c + 0.04699]`
           `[y_c - 0.04699, y_c + 0.04699]`
           
           If `x_c` is negative and `y_c` is positive, we try the top-left.
           Valid range for `x_c`: `[-0.08801, 0.08801]`
           Valid range for `y_c`: `[-0.08801, 0.08801]`
           
           Let's try a placement for Object 6 with `x_c = -0.06`, `y_c = 0.06`.
           Object 6 AABB: `x_range = [-0.06 - 0.04699, -0.06 + 0.04699] = [-0.10699, -0.01301]`
           Object 6 AABB: `y_range = [0.06 - 0.04699, 0.06 + 0.04699] = [0.01301, 0.10699]`
           
           Check for collision with Object 4:
           Object 4 AABB: `x_range = [-0.0444, 0.0444]`, `y_range = [-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           Object 6 x_range `[-0.10699, -0.01301]` and Object 4 x_range `[-0.0444, 0.0444]` overlap.
           Object 6 y_range `[0.01301, 0.10699]` and Object 4 y_range `[-0.0444, 0.0444]` overlap.
           Since both x and y ranges overlap, a collision occurs.
           
           My previous reasoning about non-overlapping AABBs was correct. It seems difficult to place object 6 without colliding given the current configuration and object sizes. However, I must find a stable placement. I will try to place it in a corner or side such that its AABB only barely touches the previously placed objects, or is close to them without overlapping.
           
           Let's try to place it as far up-left as possible, still within surface bounds and avoiding the currently placed objects.
           Object 4: `[-0.0444, 0.0444]` x `[-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           Object 5: `[0.05262, 0.12738]` x `[-0.03738, 0.03738]`
           
           The highest y-coordinate without overlap for Object 6:
           `y_center_6 - 0.04699` must be `> 0.0444`. So `y_center_6 > 0.0914`. But `y_center_6` max is `0.08801`. This shows it cannot be completely above Object 4.
           
           What if it is placed slightly overlapping the surface's edge, but still reported as valid? No, it states "fully contained within the bounds of the surface".
           
           Could it be that my interpretation of "no collision" is too strict and allows touching? The problem statement states "whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene." AABB overlap implies collision.
           
           Let's rethink the bounds and available space.
           Surface 0: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`
           Max half extent for object 6: `0.04699`
           Valid center for object 6: `x in [-0.08801, 0.08801]`, `y in [-0.08801, 0.08801]`
           
           Object 4 AABB: `[-0.0444, 0.0444] x [-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           Object 5 AABB: `[0.05262, 0.12738] x [-0.03738, 0.03738]`
           
           If I place object 6 at `x_c = -0.08801` (leftmost possible center), then its AABB `x_range = [-0.08801 - 0.04699, -0.08801 + 0.04699] = [-0.135, -0.04102]`.
           If I place object 6 at `y_c = 0.08801` (topmost possible center), then its AABB `y_range = [0.08801 - 0.04699, 0.08801 + 0.04699] = [0.04102, 0.135]`.
           
           Let's try `(x_c, y_c) = (-0.08801, 0.08801)` for object 6.
           Object 6 AABB: `[-0.135, -0.04102]` x `[0.04102, 0.135]`
           Does this collide with Object 4?
           Object 4 AABB: `[-0.0444, 0.0444] x [-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           x-ranges: `[-0.135, -0.04102]` and `[-0.0444, 0.0444]`. These overlap: `[-0.0444, -0.04102]`
           y-ranges: `[0.04102, 0.135]` and `[-0.0444, 0.0444]`. These overlap: `[0.04102, 0.0444]`
           Both x and y ranges overlap, so this placement still collides with Object 4.
           
           This implies there might be no valid placement for object 6. However, the problem states "You never give up." and "you will always try to find a new placement." I must continue searching. Perhaps the "no collision" feedback is more about the objects not "falling off" or being truly unstable, and touching is allowed, but the problem says "collides with any of the fixed obstacles". And my internal state about fixed obstacles includes previously placed objects.
           
           Given the sizes, the "middle" of the surface is quite congested. Object 4 takes up a `0.0888` square at the center. Object 5 takes up `0.0747` at `(0.09, 0.0)`. Object 6 is `0.0939`.
           The total width of surface 0 is `0.27`.
           Object 4 x-range: `[-0.0444, 0.0444]` (width ~0.0888)
           Object 5 x-range: `[0.0526, 0.1274]` (width ~0.0748)
           Object 6 width is `0.0939`.
           
           Let's reconsider the "no collision" rule. If it truly means no AABB overlap, then these objects are too large to fit three of them on surface 0 such that their AABBs are disjoint.
           The total width if they were placed side by side: `0.0888 + 0.0747 + 0.0939 = 0.2574`. This is less than 0.27. So theoretically, they could fit side by side if their centers were aligned.
           For example, if object 4 at (0,0), then object 5 right of it, and object 6 left of object 4.
           Object 4: `[-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           Object 5 needs to be right: `x_center - 0.03738 >= 0.0444` => `x_center >= 0.08178`. Max `x_center` for object 5 is `0.09762`. So `x_center = 0.09` works. `[0.09 - 0.03738, 0.09 + 0.03738] = [0.05262, 0.12738]`.
           Object 6 needs to be left: `x_center + 0.04699 <= -0.044415` => `x_center <= -0.091405`.
           But min `x_center` for object 6 is `-0.08801`. This still fails.
           
           This is a critical point. If AABB overlap is truly forbidden, I cannot find a placement.
           However, if "collides with fixed obstacles" means that the new placement is geometrically stable in the environment (e.g. doesn't try to occupy the exact same physical space as a previously placed object *that is now physically on the surface*), then maybe my calculation of "collision" based on AABB intersection is too strict in edge cases or that these objects are not truly "fixed obstacles" in the sense of the environment geometry.
           
           The prompt states: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This implies my learning about other objects being "fixed obstacles" for collision checking is correct.
           
           I am forced to assume that if there are any remaining valid placements, they must be extremely tight.
           Let me be extremely precise with the coordinate calculations.
           Surface bounds: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           Object 6 half-extents: `hx6 = 0.09398225667139079 / 2 = 0.046991128335695395`
           `hy6 = 0.09398225667139076 / 2 = 0.04699112833569538`
           
           Object 6 center `x` range: `[-0.135 + hx6, 0.135 - hx6] = [-0.0880088716643046, 0.0880088716643046]`
           Object 6 center `y` range: `[-0.135 + hy6, 0.135 - hy6] = [-0.08800887166430462, 0.08800887166430462]`
           
           Object 4 half-extents: `hx4 = 0.08883107388320738 / 2 = 0.04441553694160369`
           `hy4 = 0.08883107388320732 / 2 = 0.04441553694160366`
           Object 4 AABB: `[-hx4, hx4]` x `[-hy4, hy4]` centered at `(0,0)`.
           `[-0.04441553694160369, 0.04441553694160369]` x `[-0.04441553694160366, 0.04441553694160366]`
           
           Object 5 half-extents: `hx5 = 0.07476150509918958 / 2 = 0.03738075254959479`
           `hy5 = 0.0747615050991896 / 2 = 0.0373807525495948`
           Object 5 AABB: `[0.09 - hx5, 0.09 + hx5]` x `[0.0 - hy5, 0.0 + hy5]` centered at `(0.09, 0.0)`.
           `[0.05261924745040521, 0.12738075254959479]` x `[-0.0373807525495948, 0.0373807525495948]`
           
           Let's try to place Object 6 in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           `x_center_6 = -0.0880088716643046`
           `y_center_6 = -0.08800887166430462`
           Object 6 AABB:
           `x_range = [-0.135, -0.041017743328609205]`
           `y_range = [-0.135, -0.04101774332860922]`
           
           Collision with Object 4:
           Object 4 x-range: `[-0.04441553694160369, 0.04441553694160369]`
           Object 6 x-range: `[-0.135, -0.041017743328609205]`
           They overlap in `[-0.04441553694160369, -0.041017743328609205]`.
           Object 4 y-range: `[-0.04441553694160366, 0.04441553694160366]`
           Object 6 y-range: `[-0.135, -0.04101774332860922]`
           They overlap in `[-0.04441553694160366, -0.04101774332860922]`.
           Both overlap, so this is a collision.
           
           It means the objects are large enough that the corner placements (the places furthest from the already placed objects) still overlap with them.
           
           Given the constraints, I will try to place object 6 with its edge touching one of the existing objects, but not overlapping. This requires very precise calculations.
           E.g., right edge of obj6 touching left edge of obj4.
           `x_center_6 + hx6 = -hx4`
           `x_center_6 = -hx4 - hx6 = -0.04441553694160369 - 0.046991128335695395 = -0.09140666527729908`
           But the allowed x_center for obj6 is `[-0.0880088716643046, 0.0880088716643046]`.
           `-0.0914` is outside `[-0.0880, 0.0880]`. This means an object with width `0.0939` cannot fit to the left of object 4 (width `0.0888`) and remain on surface 0 (width `0.27`) if object 4 is centered. The total required width would be `0.0939 + 0.0888/2 + 0.27/2 = 0.0939 + 0.0444 + 0.135 = 0.2733` for its right edge to be at -0.0444 and its left edge at -0.135.
           `x_center_6 + hx6 <= -0.0444155`
           `x_center_6 <= -0.0444155 - hx6 = -0.0444155 - 0.0469911 = -0.0914066`
           But the minimum x_center for obj6 is `-0.0880088`. So there is no x_center that satisfies both being on the surface and to the left of obj4.
           
           This is a scenario where the objects are too large for disjoint placement on the given surface.
           I must find a placement that is "stable" and "does not collide". If my calculations indicate no such placement exists, but I am prompted to provide 50, I will provide some "best effort" placements. It's possible that the "no collision" refers to something other than strict AABB disjointness, or there is some floating point tolerance.
           
           I will attempt placements that are as close as possible to fitting without collision, pushing towards the edges of the surface. If these fail due to collision, then the prompt implies the overall geometry is too constrained for this object. However, I will always try to find a placement.
           I will generate placements towards the extreme corners/edges, assuming there might be some small tolerance, or that my previous "collision" calculation was slightly off due to rounding, and maybe there's a sliver of space. If I have to try something that looks like it collides, it will be the only option left.
           
           I will try to place Object 6 just outside the AABB of Object 4 and Object 5, but still within surface bounds.
           Let's try to place Object 6 in the remaining "top-right" corner area, where Object 5 extends into the right half and Object 4 into the top.
           Consider `x_c` slightly less than max, `y_c` slightly less than max.
           `x_c = 0.08`
           `y_c = 0.08`
           Object 6 AABB:
           `x_range = [0.08 - 0.04699, 0.08 + 0.04699] = [0.03301, 0.12699]`
           `y_range = [0.08 - 0.04699, 0.08 + 0.04699] = [0.03301, 0.12699]`
           
           Collision with Object 4: `[-0.0444, 0.0444] x [-0.0444, 0.0444]`
           Object 6 x_range `[0.03301, 0.12699]` and Object 4 x_range `[-0.0444, 0.0444]` do not overlap in x. So no collision with Object 4.
           
           Collision with Object 5: `[0.05262, 0.12738] x [-0.03738, 0.03738]`
           Object 6 x_range `[0.03301, 0.12699]` and Object 5 x_range `[0.05262, 0.12738]` overlap: `[0.05262, 0.12699]`
           Object 6 y_range `[0.03301, 0.12699]` and Object 5 y_range `[-0.03738, 0.03738]` do not overlap in y.
           So no collision with Object 5.
           
           This looks like a valid placement! My previous calculations were too conservative, or I missed the exact space.
           The key was that Object 6 `x_range = [0.03301, 0.12699]` overlaps with Object 5 `x_range = [0.05262, 0.12738]`, but their y-ranges `[0.03301, 0.12699]` and `[-0.03738, 0.03738]` do not. So no collision.
           Similarly, for Object 4, Object 6's x-range `[0.03301, 0.12699]` doesn't overlap with Object 4's x-range `[-0.0444, 0.0444]`.
           
           So, `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)` appears to be a stable and non-colliding placement for object 6. I will try variations around this point and other corners.
