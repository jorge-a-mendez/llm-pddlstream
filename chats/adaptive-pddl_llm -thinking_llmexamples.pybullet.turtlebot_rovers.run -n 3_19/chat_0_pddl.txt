           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. We're aiming to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of conditions related to image reception, rock analysis, and store availability.  The initial state provides some key facts, but we need to actively acquire the missing pieces.
           
           The initial state tells us both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are at known configurations (`atconf`). Both rovers have access to a camera (`v10`), the mode is `v11`, and both stores are free. We just need to take images, analyze rocks, and make sure we have both free storage units to satisfy the free condition as well as the analyze/receive conditions.
           
           My analysis reveals five main tasks: getting three images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v19, v11)`); analyzing a stone; and analyzing some soil. I've broken down each goal into smaller sub-goals, and identified the necessary actions and their preconditions based on the available information.
           
           To address the image requirements, `v14` will be the designated imaging rover, as it won't impact `v12` operations. Each image will require: calibration, image capture, and transmission to the lander (`v9`). This forms a sequential image capture process.
           
           Next, we must analyze and transmit some rocks. To do this, I will have `v12` sample and analyze one rock. This causes `v12` to lose the free attribute of its store. Rover `v14` needs to analyze soil; I will have that rover, after taking images, retrieve soil using store `v16`. Since `v12`'s store is `full`, it cannot be used again without `drop_rock`. To resolve this, I have added the drop action for both rovers after sending analysis.
           
           With this process, the plan will satisfy all goal conditions, leaving both stores free after each analysis and successfully getting all of the images.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Reachability with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, I've got it. The user pointed out that I used some invalid actions, so I need to stick to the provided list: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.  I'll re-evaluate the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the initial state, keeping in mind *only* these actions.
           
           The goal requires, among other things, that I have received images of three different objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) in mode `v11`, and that I've received analyses of both a stone and a soil sample.  My initial state *doesn't* include these image and analysis receipts.
           
           Now, checking the allowed actions, `move` actions don't help at all with getting the images or analyses. They only adjust the location of the rovers, but I already satisfy the location requirements of the goal (rovers at correct configurations). The `drop_rock` actions have a precondition `full(v12, v16)` or `full(v14, v16)`, which is currently false because both stores are free. Even if those preconditions were met, dropping a rock *doesn't* help me achieve the image/analysis goals.
           
           The actions I *need* to achieve those parts of the goal are `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  **Those actions are NOT in the permitted set.**
           
           Therefore, I've concluded that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given set of valid actions. It's impossible.
