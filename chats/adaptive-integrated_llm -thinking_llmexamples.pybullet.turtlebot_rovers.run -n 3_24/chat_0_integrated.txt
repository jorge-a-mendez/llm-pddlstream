           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan: An Impossible Mission**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I'm staring at a PDDL problem, and it's got me stumped. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to taking and sending images of objectives, analyzing rocks (both stone and soil), and sending those analyses. Easy enough, right? Wrong.
           
           Let's break it down: To get those images sent, I need to *calibrate*, *take* the image, and *send* it. For the rock analyses, I need to *sample* the rock and then *send* the analysis. Preconditions are key, and the trouble starts there.
           
           I've got two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. They're stuck at their starting positions: `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`. Fine. The problem is, to take those pictures, `v14` needs to be at a special "image-taking" spot, `#o3`. To send the data, I need them at ` #o0`, and I need to be at `#o5` for the analyses.
           
           Here's the rub: I'm only allowed a tiny set of actions, and none of them let me *actually move*.  My available actions are no-op moves, meaning they just keep the rover where it is (v13 to v13 or v15 to v15). No fun.  I'm *explicitly* told not to use any other actions.
           
           I can *see* the objectives from `#o3` (which, let's be honest, is probably not where the rover is right now). I can see the communication equipment from  `#o0`, and I know there's rock close by at `#o5`. But all these are out of reach! These special configurations are given in `conf(rover, #name)` where `#name` is `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`, all distinct from initial configs `v15` or `v13`. I need to *be* at these positions (`atconf(rover, #name)`) to do anything useful, but I can't *get* there!
           
           So, I'm stuck. My rovers are rooted. I can't take pictures. I can't analyze rocks. I can't fulfill the goal. The problem is, quite simply, unsolvable under the given constraints. I'm hitting a roadblock, and there's no way around it.
