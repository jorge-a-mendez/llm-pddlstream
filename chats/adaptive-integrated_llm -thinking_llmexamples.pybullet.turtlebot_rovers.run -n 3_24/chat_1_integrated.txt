           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Strategy for Achieving a Complex Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This is a conjunction of several conditions, primarily related to image acquisition and analysis. My objective is to formulate a plan to satisfy these conditions.
           
           The initial state reveals a few things: two rovers (`v12` and `v14`), a store (`v16`), and various rock and soil samples. The key to the plan involves using rover `v14` to perform image and analysis tasks.  The plan will be built using a series of actions (moving, calibrating, taking pictures, sending images/analyses) based on the conditions and preconditions given.
           
           **Phase 1: Image Acquisition**
           
           I need to get images of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) in mode `v11` using camera `v10`. The initial state gives me a head start:  `v14` can, in principle, image the three objects.  To achieve this, `v14` needs to move to an intermediate configuration. So, my initial plan involves rover `v14` moving to the specific pose, calibrating the camera, and taking images.
           
           *   Move `v14` to the designated image configuration (`#o3`).
           *   Calibrate `v10` for each objective.
           *   Take an image of each objective using `v10`.
           
           Now, I've got to somehow communicate these images.  For this, I need to get the images to a lander, `v9`. So, the final step in phase 1 is to have `v14` move to the comms point.
           
           *   Move `v14` to a comm point (`#o0`).
           *   Send the images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` to the lander (`v9`).
           
           **Phase 2: Analysis**
           
           I also need to analyze some rocks: `v3` (a stone) and `v5` (soil). I'll use rover `v14` and its store (`v16`) again for this. Because `v14` is now at `#o0` for sending the images, I move rover `v14` to `#o5` to be above the rock.
           
           *   Move `v14` to the sampling configuration above the rocks (`#o5`).
           *   Sample `v3` and place it in the store (`v16`).
           *   Because the store now has rock `v3`, I need to drop the rock to clear the store.
           *   Sample `v5` and place it in the store (`v16`).
           *   Now that I have a rock and soil sample, and I have analyzed them, I move `v14` back to ` #o0` to send the analyses.
           *   Send analyses of `v3` (stone) and `v5` (soil) to `v9`.
           *   Drop rock (v5) to make the store v16 free again.
           
           **The Challenges & Specifics**
           
           The key to my approach is using `v14` for both image and analysis tasks.
           Given the stated facts and geometry, there is a pose, or configuration, for the rover that enables it to perform the required actions.
           To finalize the approach, I've had to consider and define the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.   These configurations have to be set because the problem states, if these arguments are used as configurations for the rover, they must be set. The final step of the plan is to return rover `v14` back to its initial configuration `v15` so that the goal state of `new-axiom@0()` is maintained.
           
           This plan should successfully satisfy all the requirements.

           *   Move `v14` to the designated image configuration (`#o3`).
           *   Calibrate `v10` for each objective.
           *   Take an image of each objective using `v10`.
           
           Now, I've got to somehow communicate these images.  For this, I need to get the images to a lander, `v9`. So, the final step in phase 1 is to have `v14` move to the comms point.
           
           *   Move `v14` to a comm point (`#o0`).
           *   Send the images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` to the lander (`v9`).
           
           **Phase 2: Analysis**
           
           I also need to analyze some rocks: `v3` (a stone) and `v5` (soil). I'll use rover `v14` and its store (`v16`) again for this. Because `v14` is now at `#o0` for sending the images, I move rover `v14` to `#o5` to be above the rock.
           
           *   Move `v14` to the sampling configuration above the rocks (`#o5`).
           *   Sample `v3` and place it in the store (`v16`).
           *   Because the store now has rock `v3`, I need to drop the rock to clear the store.
           *   Sample `v5` and place it in the store (`v16`).
           *   Now that I have a rock and soil sample, and I have analyzed them, I move `v14` back to ` #o0` to send the analyses.
           *   Send analyses of `v3` (stone) and `v5` (soil) to `v9`.
           *   Drop rock (v5) to make the store v16 free again.
           
           **The Challenges & Specifics**
           
           The key to my approach is using `v14` for both image and analysis tasks.
           Given the stated facts and geometry, there is a pose, or configuration, for the rover that enables it to perform the required actions.
           To finalize the approach, I've had to consider and define the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.   These configurations have to be set because the problem states, if these arguments are used as configurations for the rover, they must be set. The final step of the plan is to return rover `v14` back to its initial configuration `v15` so that the goal state of `new-axiom@0()` is maintained.
           
           This plan should successfully satisfy all the requirements.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break this down.** The previous plan failed because some configurations were colliding with obstacles or unreachable. My task is to refine those configurations, specifically for the rover's positions `#o3`, `#o0`, and ensure that it can carry out the plan with the correct actions.
           
           I started by analyzing `#o3`, the position from which the rover (`v14`) takes images. The original plan had `v14` at (0.06, 1.887) for `#o3`. However, this collided with a wall (`v20`) at x=0. To fix this, I re-evaluated the targets (`v17, v18, v19`), and given the constraints, I need to place `#o3` so that the rover doesn't collide with the x=0 wall while maintaining a line of sight to all of the objectives at once, and in the camera mode. I considered x coordinates both positive and negative, realizing the targets are on both sides of the wall at x=0. Since the problem statement *gives* `imagevisible` predicates, a solution *must* exist. I calculated that by moving the robot out, it wouldn't collide with the x=0 wall, allowing the rover to take the images. So I will test with a new coordinate for the robot, I want to use (0.25, 1.887) and make sure that it meets the conditions for unobstructed line of sight.
           
           Next, I worked on `#o0`, the configuration for the rover to communicate with the lander (`v9`). The previous value (-1.9, -2.0) collided with the lander. So, I calculated the lander's AABB and the rover's AABB at its previous configuration. I determined that the rover needs to be *near* the lander, but not *inside* it, keeping the necessary communications range within its limits. I'll test the new coordinate (-1.588, -2.0), this coordinate puts the rover close to, but not overlapping the lander.
           
           For `#o5`, the position "above" objects, I understood that I *should not* specify a value as that is managed by the system and defined by motion predicates that are in place already. The problem stated that in such a situation, I *need not* provide a configuration.
           
           Now that the critical coordinates have been redefined, I can proceed with the plan, which ensures all the conditions are met for successful image retrieval, communication, and return to base. The crucial bit here is using the problem description as my guide.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been asked to devise a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. This requires me to ensure several conditions are met, including the rover's initial and final configuration, that images and analyses are received, and that the appropriate soil and stone types are analyzed. The initial state setup provides a good foundation, setting up the basic positions of key components.
           
           I've analyzed the initial state and identified the objects of interest: Rovers, a camera, lander, objectives, and the analysis of rocks and soil. The core of my plan revolves around using rover `v14` to gather the necessary data. I'm focusing on ensuring `v14` eventually returns to its initial configuration `atconf(v14, v15)` and its store `v16` becomes free. The images and analyses are handled through the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           After a deep dive, I realized that I had to provide the coordinates of two key configurations: `#o3` for viewing the image targets (v17, v18, v19) and `#o0` for communication with the lander. I need to make sure the rover's position is not colliding with other objects. My past attempts to set the configuration caused issues with collision, mostly with `v21` and `v9` due to incorrect coordinates.
           
           I analyzed my previous erroneous configuration to see what went wrong. The initial plan put `v14` at (0.25, 1.887). However, `v14` (the rover) was colliding with `v21` (an obstacle). I must re-evaluate `#o3`. Now I recognize that the initial conditions that includes the fact `imagerange(v14, #o3, v17)`, etc, imply that the rover must be within the defined range (2 units) of all of these objectives, but not necessarily at a spot that is in range for *all* of the three targets.
           
           I meticulously examined the positions of obstacles like `v20` and `v21` and the AABB bounding boxes of my rover `v14`. After going through several points I found that `(0.95, 1.887)` is collision-free for the rover and is within range of the various image targets. Then I looked at the AABB of `v9` (the lander). I initially placed the rover at `(-1.588, -2.0)`. Rover AABB for `(-1.588, -2.0)` was colliding with `v9`. I tried placing it to the right of `v9`. After a bit of coordinate fiddling, I landed on `(-1.9, -2.55)` for the communication position (#o0) . This location is outside the lander's AABB.
           
           To ensure there is no collision with `v9`, I needed to move it to a position entirely outside its bounding box. Now I'm confident that `#o3 = (0.95, 1.887)` and `#o0 = (-1.9, -2.55)` resolve the collision problem for the rover. The images and analyses actions should complete all of the remaining goals.

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for New Axiom Goal**
           
           Alright, let's nail this down. We're looking at achieving `new-axiom@0()`, and it's a multi-stage process in the `rovers` domain. The initial state is straightforward: `v14` is ready, `v12` is chilling, and we've got our targets and resources in place. My main concern is that the rover needs to do a series of actions, starting with imaging and ending with returning to the initial conditions.
           
           First, the key is to ensure the plan I'm using is valid. It looks like it is, but it involves several steps.
           
           **First stage:**
           
           *   **Imaging:** Rover `v14` moves to a specific configuration `#o3` (`(-0.5, 1.9)`) to capture images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I believe the distance to these targets makes sense. I need to make sure the motion there is clear.
           *   **Communication:** I need to make sure I can communicate. Next, it needs to move to `#o0` (`(-2.6, -2.0)`) to ensure communication with the lander. The movement is important here because the rover needs a clear path.
           
           **Second stage**
           
           The imaging and communication are crucial. Once the pictures are taken, the rover needs to collect the rocks, dropping the previous contents before continuing, so it is important to sample. It is important to drop the contents.
           
           **Third Stage:**
           
           *   **Sampling:** Rover then moves to `#o5` for sampling, with `v3` for stone and then `v5` for soil. Here, as I am instructed, I won't specify its exact coordinates in the plan.
           *   **Sending Analysis:** We must move back to `#o0` to send the sample data to the lander and complete that step of the process.
           
           **Final Stage:**
           
           *   **Final Actions:** To complete the sequence, and get back to the proper `rover state, the rover will need to move back to the initial configuration and drop any further contents.
           
           Regarding the coordinates, I have to find good configurations. Based on the problem's criteria, I choose `#o3 = (-0.5, 1.9)` for image capture to avoid collisions with obstacles. For communication, the coordinates I want, are, in my opinion, the best coordinates for the objective, so the rover will be able to transmit the required information. So the configuration I will go with is `#o0 = (-2.6, -2.0)`. These configurations allow for the completion of the required process.
           
           This plan appears logically sound, and I am confident that it will lead to the solution. I just need to make sure the commands are placed in the correct order to ensure the action is performed properly.

For communication, the coordinates I want, are, in my opinion, the best coordinates for the objective, so the rover will be able to transmit the required information. So the configuration I will go with is `#o0 = (-2.6, -2.0)`. These configurations allow for the completion of the required process.
           
           This plan appears logically sound, and I am confident that it will lead to the solution. I just need to make sure the commands are placed in the correct order to ensure the action is performed properly.

(Thoughts: **A Revised Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is set: get those images and analyses sent, the rocks sampled, and everything neatly back in place. We've got two rovers, but `v12` is staying put, so `v14` is the workhorse. Initial state analysis confirms we're starting with `v12` and `v14` at their designated configurations, stores free, and all necessary objects (rovers, cameras, lander, rocks) identified.
           
           The strategy is clear: `v14` will handle everything. First, we need to take images, so we'll *calibrate* the camera, then use *take\_image* for each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). After imaging, communicate to `v9` via *send\_image* and *send\_analysis*. Sampling and sending are handled by *sample\_rock*, *drop\_rock*, and the *send* actions.
           
           Now, the tricky part – the configurations.  The previous attempt had collision problems with `#o3` and `#o0`, so we'll need to revise those coordinates.
           
           **For `#o3`:** The collision with object `v23` at `(-0.5, 1.9)` meant we need to find a new position for the imaging phase. The imaging area seems cramped, but the line-of-sight and range conditions must be satisfied.  Given the obstacles, I'll attempt placing `#o3` at `(2.0, 1.9)`.  The AABB is clear, and the reachability from `v15` is within a reasonable distance (around 4.72 units). The problem statement specifies the `imagerange` predicate, so the system will handle the specific imaging conditions at the target locations. The goal is to avoid collisions.
           
           **For `#o0`:** The collision with object `v24` at `(-2.6, -2.0)` during communication means another new configuration. Positioning at `(-2.9, -2.0)` will clear the objects in the original position, is well within the reach of `v14`, and the communication range is sufficient.  `v14` will go in that location, so the lander can receive the communication.
           
           **So, the updated plan is:**
           
           1.  Move `v14` from its starting point `v15` to `#o3 (2.0, 1.9)`.
           2.  Calibrate `v10` and take images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` sequentially.
           3.  Move to `#o0 (-2.9, -2.0)`.
           4.  Send images.
           5.  Move to `#o5`, as defined by the system.
           6.  Sample `v3` and `v5` (stone and soil).
           7.  Send the analysis.
           8.  Drop the store (final condition).
           9.  Return to `v15`.
           
           The continuous parameters are as follows:
           *   `#o3`: `(2.0, 1.9)`
           *   `#o0`: `(-2.9, -2.0)`
           
           This revised plan avoids previous collision issues and should successfully satisfy all initial and goal conditions.  It's a straightforward sequence of actions designed to complete the task efficiently.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been wrestling with this `new-axiom@0()` problem.  The initial plan was on the right track, but I kept hitting a snag with the continuous values for the `#o3` and `#o0` parameters, specifically regarding collisions and reachability.  I needed to find collision-free locations for the rover to capture images and communicate, and that's where I was stuck.  I knew the goal:  get some images, analyze some rocks and soil, and transmit everything. Simple, right?  But getting the robot to move safely without crashing... now *that* was the challenge.
           
           I started by re-evaluating the continuous configurations, taking into account the rover's physical dimensions (about 0.36 by 0.36) and the obstacle AABBs. I *really* had to zoom in on these AABBs. It turned out I had mis-interpreted the collision detection at first, which caused me to keep bumping into walls and rectangular shapes.  I needed to calculate each location's AABB for collisions.
           
           Previously, attempts at `#o3` (image capture locations) were hitting obstacles at y=1.9. So, I needed to re-plan. I then focused on getting the robot away from these, by calculating a collision-free location along the x-axis, using AABB ranges. After several unsuccessful attempts, I determined `(1.25, 1.9)` was safe.
           
           Next, I worked on the communication location, `#o0`.  I needed a spot where the robot could reach the Lander (v9) while avoiding the vertical and horizontal walls. This one was trickier. I first miscalculated the AABBs which had me thinking the robot would collide, but after careful review, I realized I had missed the intersection. So, after finding `(-0.5, -2.0)`, there was no overlap, so this should work.
           
           With the new configurations for `#o3` and `#o0`, the plan now looks solid. I am confident that these locations will be reachable and collision-free. I updated the plan steps, making sure everything is reachable and doesn't get stuck.  I've double-checked all the moves, the communications and the sampling.  It's a complete plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, including the final drop-off and return to the starting position. I just had to nail down those pesky positions!
