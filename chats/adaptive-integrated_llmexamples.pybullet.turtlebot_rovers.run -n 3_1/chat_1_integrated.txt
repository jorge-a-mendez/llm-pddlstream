           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that the following conditions are met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means an image of objective v17 needs to be taken and sent.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means an image of objective v18 needs to be taken and sent.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This means an image of objective v19 needs to be taken and sent.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: This refers to rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4).
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4) need to be sampled and their analysis sent.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: This refers to rocks of type v6 (v7, v8, v5).
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means rocks of type v6 (v7, v8, v5) need to be sampled and their analysis sent.
           
           The plan will involve a combination of `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions. Rover `v14` and `v12` are available. Both have `v10` camera and `v11` mode. `v16` is the store.
           
           For `receivedimage`:
           - `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are objectives. Rover `v12` is at `v13` and rover `v14` is at `v15`. Both rovers can image all three objectives from configuration `#o3`.
           - We can use `v14` to take and send images for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2` rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`):
           - `v14` is `atconf(v15)` and can `above` rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           - `v12` is `atconf(v13)` and can `above` rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           - Since both rovers have `#o5` available to sample all rocks, we can use `v14` to sample the type `v2` rocks.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6` rocks: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`):
           - We can use `v14` to sample the type `v6` rocks.
           
           The plan will prioritize using rover `v14` since it is at `v15` which is close to `#o5` (for sampling) and `#o3` (for imaging) and `#o0` (for communication).
           
           Detailed Steps:
           1. `calibrate` `v14` at `#o3` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           2. `take_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` using `v14` at `#o3`.
           3. `move` `v14` to `#o0` to send images.
           4. `send_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` using `v14` at `#o0`.
           5. `move` `v14` to `#o5` for sampling.
           6. `sample_rock` for `v1`, `v3`, `v4` (type `v2`) and `v5`, `v7`, `v8` (type `v6`) using `v14` at `#o5`. The store `v16` is free. This needs to be done iteratively, one rock at a time, and dropped to free up the store.
           7. `move` `v14` to `#o0` to send analyses.
           8. `send_analysis` for all sampled rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           However, the problem states that `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true initially, and `sample_rock` makes the store `full`. We need to use `drop_rock` to free the store for subsequent samples. Since the goal only requires `receivedanalysis` and `free` stores at the end, we can sample, send analysis, and then drop the rock to keep the store free for the next sample.
           
           Let's refine the sampling and analysis steps:
           - Calibrate `v14` for imaging (needed once).
           - Take images for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           - Move `v14` to a communication configuration `#o0`.
           - Send images for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           - Move `v14` to a sampling configuration `#o5`.
           - For each rock (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`):
               - `sample_rock`
               - `move` to `#o0`
               - `send_analysis`
               - `move` back to `#o5`
               - `drop_rock` (This frees the store and we can fulfill the `free` condition for `v14`).
           
           This approach seems too complex due to the need to move back and forth to send analysis for each rock. A simpler approach would be to sample all rocks, then move to a communication configuration and send all analyses, and then drop all rocks to ensure `free` stores. However, a single store (`v16`) can only hold one sample at a time (`full` predicate). So, we must sample, send analysis, then drop, one by one.
           
           Let's consider the specific action instances.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15`.
           To image: `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`.
           To communicate: `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           To sample: `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`.
           
           Plan sequence:
           1. Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3` to calibrate and take images.
           2. Calibrate the camera on `v14`.
           3. Take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           4. Move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o0` to send images.
           5. Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           6. Move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           7. For each rock (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8):
               a. Sample the rock.
               b. Move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0` to send analysis.
               c. Send analysis for the rock.
               d. Move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5` to drop the rock.
               e. Drop the rock.
           
           This ensures `free` stores at the end and all `receivedanalysis` and `receivedimage` goals are met.
           
           Let's check the objects and types:
           Type v2 rocks: v1, v3, v4.
           Type v6 rocks: v7, v8, v5.
           All rocks need analysis.
           
           Final check on goal `new-axiom@0()`:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` - initial.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` - initial, but `v14` will move. We need to move `v14` back to `v15` at the end or ensure `v15` is its final configuration. Given the structure of the goal axiom, `atconf` simply means the robot is *at* that configuration, not that it *must end there*. The axiom `new-axiom@0()` only requires that `atconf` be true *at some point in time* for the variables `v12` and `v14` with their specific configurations `v13` and `v15`. Since they are true in the initial state, they are considered satisfied for the axiom.
           - `free(v12, v16)` - initial.
           - `free(v14, v16)` - initial. We will ensure this by dropping rocks after analysis.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` - Achieved by taking and sending images of `v17`.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)` - Achieved by taking and sending images of `v18`.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)` - Achieved by taking and sending images of `v19`.
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` - Achieved by sampling and sending analysis for `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` - Achieved by sampling and sending analysis for `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           The use of continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 for configurations needs to be handled for `v14`.
           
           The robot `v14` starts at `v15`.
           To image: move from `v15` to `#o3`.
           To sample: move from `#o3` to `#o5`.
           To communicate: move between `#o3` (from imaging), `#o5` (from sampling), and `#o0`. Let's use `#o0` specifically for communication to the lander `v9`.
           
           The problem description for `new-axiom@0()` mentions that `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are part of the axiom. This implies these must be true *at the point in time* the axiom evaluates. If the rover `v14` moves away from `v15`, the axiom is false at that time. However, the common interpretation of PDDL goals is that they must be true *at the end of the plan*. If the plan ends with `v14` at `v15`, then this condition is met. If the goal is that these be true *always*, the problem would be unsolveable. Given the typical interpretation of PDDL, the goal must be met by the final state. So, `v14` should move back to `v15` at the end.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters are collision-free and valid. The coordinates for these will be provided in the configurations section.

           40. `drop_rock v14 v16`
           41. `move v14 #o5 #o2 v15` (Move back to original configuration)
           
           To compute configurations:
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. We need a single configuration for `v14` that can see all three objectives.
               - `v17` (1.848, 2.076)
               - `v18` (0.642, 1.869)
               - `v19` (-1.943, 2.0)
               A central point near (0, 2) could work for `v14` from its starting area (-1.0, -1.75). For example, (0.0, 1.0) might be a good candidate within 2 units. A bit further away could be better to cover all. Let's try (0.0, 0.0)
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A point closer to `v9` than `#o3` and `#o5` for communication. Say (-1.5, -2.0)
           - `#o5` for `above(v14, #o5, v4)`. `v4` is at ((-0.645, 0.782), (-0.566, 0.861)). `v1` is at ((1.375, 0.843), (1.479, 0.948)). `v3` is at ((0.692, -1.235), (0.797, -1.13)). `v5` is at ((1.94, -1.553), (2.082, -1.412)). `v7` is at ((-2.192, 0.543), (-2.056, 0.679)). `v8` is at ((-0.612, -1.143), (-0.479, -1.01)).
               `#o5` needs to be a single configuration from which `v14` is `above` all rocks. This implies a centralized location that allows for reaching all rocks. Given the scattered nature of rocks, a configuration in the middle of these might be needed. (0.0, 0.0) might be a good starting point to check. Let's assume a configuration around (0.0, 0.0) allows `above` to be true for all listed rocks for `v14`. For example, (0.0, 0.0).
           
           Let's pick coordinates for the continuous parameters:
           For `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `v14` at `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75). Targets are generally north-east. Let's try a point in the north-east quadrant, around (0.0, 1.0).
           For `#o0` (communication to `v9`): `v9` is southwest. Let's try (-1.5, -2.0).
           For `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): Rocks are scattered. A central point is needed. (0.0, 0.0) is a reasonable guess to be above several rocks within reach.
           
           Let's check AABBs to verify positions:
           `v1` ((1.375, 0.843), (1.479, 0.948))
           `v3` ((0.692, -1.235), (0.797, -1.13))
           `v4` ((-0.645, 0.782), (-0.566, 0.861))
           `v5` ((1.94, -1.553), (2.082, -1.412))
           `v7` ((-2.192, 0.543), (-2.056, 0.679))
           `v8` ((-0.612, -1.143), (-0.479, -1.01))
           A single `#o5` cannot satisfy `above` for all rocks if it means directly over them. The `above` predicate likely means the robot is in a configuration where it can manipulate the rock, not necessarily directly above the rock's center. Given that `above` is defined for a single `#o5` for all rocks for both `v12` and `v14`, it implies `#o5` is a general configuration from which sampling is possible for all listed rocks within a certain range. Let's assume (0.0, 0.0) is such a configuration.
           
           Let's use `v14` for all operations as `v12` is not strictly needed.
           The coordinates must be provided for *each* unique (rover, target object) pair for `imagevisible` or `comvisible` using a `#` configuration.
           - `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           - `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           Since the same `#o3` is used for all three, we only need to specify one value for `#o3` for `v14`.
           - `conf(v14, #o0)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, v4)` (and others). We need a value for `#o5` for `v14`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` resulted in collisions. Let's re-evaluate them considering the provided obstacle `v20` and the target object `v9`.
           
           Obstacle `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)). This is a thin wall or line segment along the y-axis at x=0.
           
           Let's find new collision-free configurations for `v14`.
           
           **For `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`):**
           - `v17`: ((1.848, 2.076), (1.937, 2.165))
           - `v18`: ((0.642, 1.869), (0.723, 1.949))
           - `v19`: ((-1.943, 2.0), (-1.869, 2.075))
           The previous `#o3` (0.0, 1.0) was in collision with `v20` (the wall at x=0).
           We need a single configuration for `v14` to image all three. These targets are all in the upper part of the map (positive y). A configuration like `(0.0, 1.0)` is right on the wall `v20`.
           To avoid `v20` (x=0), we can choose a configuration with x > 0 or x < 0.
           Let's try a configuration with x > 0 to be closer to `v17` and `v18`. For `v19` (x=-1.9), a positive x for the rover means it's crossing the wall `v20` if `v19` is on the other side.
           Given `v19` is at x=-1.9, and `v17`, `v18` are at x=1.8 and x=0.6, it's impossible to have a single configuration `v14` on one side of the `v20` wall and image all three.
           The problem statement says `imagevisible` is true. This implies such a configuration exists.
           Since `v14` is initially at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), moving it to a configuration with x < 0 might be better, to image `v19`, and then potentially moving to a config with x > 0 for `v17`, `v18`. However, the plan should use a single `#o3` for all images as indicated by the action instances provided. This is a strong constraint.
           
           Let's consider that the targets `v17`, `v18`, `v19` span across the x=0 line. If a rover is on one side, it might be occluded from targets on the other side by `v20`.
           However, the initial state defines `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This implies that *from a single configuration* `#o3`, `v14` can see all three. This is only possible if `#o3` is such that the line of sight to all three targets avoids the `v20` wall, which means the wall does not fully obstruct line of sight. Given the wall is at x=0, and targets are (0.6, 1.8), (1.8, 2.0), and (-1.9, 2.0), a configuration with small absolute x value (but not 0) and higher y might work if the ray `(rover, target)` is not blocked.
           Let's try (0.1, 1.0) for `v14` to image all three, which is just slightly to the right of the wall `v20`.
           The `imagevisible` predicate considers occlusion. If the wall truly obstructs line of sight, then the initial state is inconsistent if a single `#o3` is given for all. Assuming the provided `imagevisible` predicates are valid, `v20` must not fully obstruct line of sight from a valid `#o3`.
           Let's assume the wall `v20` is thin enough or short enough in Z that an image from a point like (0.1, 1.0) is possible.
           
           **For `#o0` (communication to `v9`):**
           - `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           The previous `#o0` (-1.5, -2.0) was in collision with `v9` itself. This is a common error: the robot cannot be *inside* the target it's communicating with.
           We need a point near `v9` but outside its AABB. `v9` extends from -2.4 to -1.4 in x and -2.3 to -1.6 in y.
           Let's try a point like (-1.0, -2.0) which is slightly to the east of `v9` and is also reachable from `v14`'s general operating area. This is also relatively far from `v20` (x=0).
           
           **For `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks):**
           - `v1` ((1.375, 0.843), (1.479, 0.948))
           - `v3` ((0.692, -1.235), (0.797, -1.13))
           - `v4` ((-0.645, 0.782), (-0.566, 0.861))
           - `v5` ((1.94, -1.553), (2.082, -1.412))
           - `v7` ((-2.192, 0.543), (-2.056, 0.679))
           - `v8` ((-0.612, -1.143), (-0.479, -1.01))
           The previous `#o5` (0.0, 0.0) was in collision with `v20`.
           Similar to `#o3`, we need to move away from x=0.
           A point like (0.1, 0.0) or (0.5, 0.0) could work to avoid the wall.
           The rocks are scattered. A configuration like (0.5, 0.0) would be on the right side of the wall. This might make `above` for `v7` (x=-2.1) impossible.
           Again, the initial state implies a single `#o5` makes `v14` `above` all these rocks. This suggests that `above` might refer to a larger operational reach than just being directly over it. If `above` means in range for sampling, then one side of the `v20` wall might not allow access to all rocks on both sides.
           Given `above(v14, #o5, ...)` is true for all these rocks, we need to pick an `#o5` that allows access to all of them.
           Let's try a point in the vicinity of many rocks. Many rocks are in the positive x, or negative x but not too far from x=0.
           A point like (0.1, 0.0) or (-0.1, 0.0) still seems reasonable given the large spread of rocks. Let's try (0.1, 0.0).
           
           Let's assume the previous plan logic is correct and just update the configurations.
           
           Updated configurations:
           - `#o3`: (0.1, 1.0) for `v14` to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           - `#o0`: (-1.0, -2.0) for `v14` to communicate with `v9`.
           - `#o5`: (0.1, 0.0) for `v14` to be `above` all rocks for sampling.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous attempt to find collision-free configurations was unsuccessful. It seems the obstacles and reachability are quite challenging.
           
           Let's re-examine the issues:
           - **`#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): (0.1, 1.0) is in collision with `v20`**. The wall `v20` is at x between -0.05 and 0.05. A configuration at x=0.1 is very close to this wall. The problem also states that `v19` is at (-1.943, 2.0), while `v17` and `v18` are at positive x values. This makes a single imaging configuration across the x=0 wall very difficult without occlusion. However, the initial state *guarantees* that `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` are true for *some* `#o3` and `#o4`. This implies either the wall `v20` is not tall enough to obstruct, or there's a point far enough away that the line of sight clears the wall.
           
           Let's assume the wall `v20` is a very thin barrier at x=0. Given its AABB from z=0 to z=0.1, it's very low. A rover would likely be able to image over it or around it if its camera is high enough.
           
           Let's try a configuration for `#o3` with a larger absolute x value to clearly be on one side of `v20`, say at (0.5, 1.0) or (-0.5, 1.0).
           If we choose (0.5, 1.0), it may be difficult to see `v19` at (-1.943, 2.0) across the wall `v20`.
           If we choose (-0.5, 1.0), it may be difficult to see `v17` (x=1.8) and `v18` (x=0.6) across the wall `v20`.
           This suggests the rover must be on one side of the wall `v20` to image all targets. This is only possible if the targets are effectively on one side from the robot's perspective, or the wall does not obstruct. Given the initial state, we must find a single `#o3`.
           Let's choose `x=0.2`, so `(0.2, 1.0)`. This is clearly outside the wall `v20` (x between -0.05 and 0.05).
           
           - **`#o0` (communication to `v9`): (-1.0, -2.0) is not reachable.** `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration at (-1.0, -2.0) should be highly reachable from (-1.0, -1.75). This suggests there's some other obstacle blocking it, or the specified AABB for `v9` (from -2.4 to -1.4 in x and -2.3 to -1.6 in y) is blocking it. Let's re-check `v9`'s AABB. (-1.0, -2.0) is inside the x-range of `v9` and also the y-range of `v9`. So, the previous coordinate was colliding with `v9`.
           We need to be *outside* `v9`. `v9` is like a big box in the southwest. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9`'s bounding box is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           A point like (-0.5, -1.75) would be to the east of `v9` and should be reachable from `v15`. It is also far from `v20`. Let's try (-0.5, -1.75).
           
           - **`#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): (0.1, 0.0) is in collision with `v20`**. Same issue as `#o3`.
           We need to move away from x=0 for `#o5`. Let's try a configuration slightly further from the wall `v20`, say `(0.2, 0.0)`.
           
           Let's retry with these updated configurations.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The issue with collisions with `v20` and reachability for `#o0` persists. Let's analyze the geometry more carefully.
           
           Obstacle `v20` is a thin wall from `x=-0.05` to `x=0.05` spanning `y=-2.5` to `y=2.5`.
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **1. Configuration `#o3` (imaging):**
           Targets are `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0).
           My previous attempts (0.0, 1.0), (0.1, 1.0), (0.2, 1.0) for `#o3` were all on the positive side of `v20`, but close to it. The continuous planner seems to indicate that even `x=0.2` is too close or causes a collision with `v20`. This means the robot's physical extent might be larger than its point coordinate.
           A point with a larger x-value for `#o3` would be required to avoid `v20` if `v14` is on the positive side. Let's try `x=0.5` or `x=1.0`.
           However, having `v14` at `x=0.5` or `x=1.0` and trying to image `v19` at `x=-1.9` will mean the ray `#o4` passes through or near `v20`. The `imagevisible` predicate includes occlusion. If `v20` occludes the view to `v19`, then a single `#o3` may not exist on the positive side of `v20`.
           
           The initial state guarantees `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This is a strong constraint. It implies that a single `#o3` position for `v14` exists from which it can see all three targets, *without* `v20` blocking the view. This is only possible if:
           a) The camera is high enough to see over `v20` (which has `z` up to 0.1).
           b) `v14` can position itself such that `v20` is not between it and any of the targets.
           c) `v14` can be in a position where the line of sight (ray) does not intersect `v20` for any of the targets.
           
           Given `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, it is on the negative side of `v20`. Let's try to keep `v14` on the negative side of `v20` for imaging.
           A point like `(-0.5, 1.0)` would be on the negative side of `v20`. From `(-0.5, 1.0)`:
           - To `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): clear line of sight.
           - To `v17` (1.8, 2.0): ray must cross `v20`.
           - To `v18` (0.6, 1.8): ray must cross `v20`.
           This indicates that the "imagevisible" condition implies `v20` does not obstruct. So, we need to pick a position that is collision-free for the robot itself.
           Let's choose `(-0.2, 1.0)`. This is on the negative side of `v20` (x range -0.05 to 0.05), so it should not collide with it. It's also closer to `v19`.
           
           **2. Configuration `#o0` (communication):**
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Rover `v14` initial: `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `#o0` needs to be near `v9` but not inside it, and reachable from `v15` or other path points.
           My previous choice `(-0.5, -1.75)` was outside `v9`'s bounding box.
           `v9`'s max x is -1.395. So `x = -0.5` is to the right.
           `v9`'s min y is -2.346, max y is -1.654. `y = -1.75` is within this range.
           The issue was "not reachable". This implies an obstacle in the path from `v15` (or `#o3` or `#o5`) to `(-0.5, -1.75)`, or the space around `(-0.5, -1.75)` is blocked.
           Let's try a point *further* from `v9` and more aligned with `v15`. `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Let's try `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is still above the `v9` y-range and still far from `v20`. It should also be reachable from `v15` directly.
           
           **3. Configuration `#o5` (sampling):**
           Rocks are scattered across the x=0 line.
           `v1` (1.3, 0.8), `v3` (0.6, -1.2), `v4` (-0.6, 0.7), `v5` (1.9, -1.5), `v7` (-2.1, 0.5), `v8` (-0.6, -1.1).
           The configuration `(0.2, 0.0)` for `#o5` was in collision with `v20`. This means any point with `x` between -0.05 and 0.05, even if slightly outside, might be problematic for collision.
           Given the large spread of rocks, and the fact that `v14` needs to be `above` all of them from *one* `#o5` config, this suggests `#o5` might be a more general `operating area` rather than a precise point.
           Let's try a location far from `v20` and more central to the rocks. For example, `(-1.0, 0.0)` (on the left side of `v20`).
           From `(-1.0, 0.0)`:
           - `v1` (1.3, 0.8) - across `v20`
           - `v3` (0.6, -1.2) - across `v20`
           - `v4` (-0.6, 0.7) - clear
           - `v5` (1.9, -1.5) - across `v20`
           - `v7` (-2.1, 0.5) - clear
           - `v8` (-0.6, -1.1) - clear
           This confirms that if we pick a side for `#o5`, some rocks will be on the other side of `v20`. The initial `above(v14, #o5, ...)` for *all* rocks implies `v20` does not interfere with the `above` predicate, or `#o5` is on the wall itself. But being on the wall causes collision.
           
           This situation (a single configuration needed for operations spanning an obstacle `v20` for multiple targets) is tricky. The problem definition states: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." And the problem setter generated the valid action instances and initial state. So, if `above(v14, #o5, ...)` is true for all rocks, it must be possible. Similarly for `imagevisible`.
           
           Let's assume there is a configuration like `(0.0, 0.0)` which is collision-free due to the dimensions of `v20` (e.g. if rover is wide and `v20` is thin, it can be at `x=0.0` if `v20` is just a line). However, the previous tries show it collides.
           
           What if the `v20` AABB (lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) represents a segment that *does not block the rover at x=0.0* if the rover is at a non-zero height. This is unlikely as rover base is assumed to be at z=0.
           The most likely scenario is that a configuration on the x-axis, but not inside the -0.05 to 0.05 range is needed.
           
           Let's pick positions that are clearly separated from the wall `v20` (i.e. x-coordinate outside [-0.05, 0.05]).
           For `#o3` (imaging): `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           For `#o0` (comms): `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is distinct from `v9` and reachable from `v15`.
           For `#o5` (sampling): `(-0.5, 0.0)`.
           
           Let's use these.

           (#o5 v14 #o2 v4): (-0.5 0.0)

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The plan continues to fail due to occlusion and collision. It seems the assumption that a single configuration can achieve imaging/sampling for targets/rocks on both sides of the `v20` wall (x=0) is incorrect. The problem states `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` and `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)` in the initial state. This strongly implies such configurations *do exist*. The challenge is finding them without knowing the robot's dimensions or camera height.
           
           Given the wall `v20` is between `x=-0.05` and `x=0.05`:
           - Targets for `#o3`: `v17` (x=1.8), `v18` (x=0.6), `v19` (x=-1.9).
           - Rocks for `#o5`: `v1` (x=1.3), `v3` (x=0.6), `v4` (x=-0.6), `v5` (x=1.9), `v7` (x=-2.1), `v8` (x=-0.6).
           
           A rover positioned on the negative side of `v20` (e.g., `x < -0.05`) would likely have `v17`, `v18`, `v1`, `v3`, `v5` occluded by `v20`.
           A rover positioned on the positive side of `v20` (e.g., `x > 0.05`) would likely have `v19`, `v4`, `v7`, `v8` occluded by `v20`.
           
           This implies that to achieve the goals as stated by the initial `imagevisible` and `above` predicates (which use a *single* `#o3` and a *single* `#o5` for all targets/rocks spanning `v20`), the wall `v20` *must not* cause occlusion or collision when the rover is at an appropriate configuration. This contradicts the feedback received.
           
           Let's assume the continuous planner has a very strict interpretation of collision and occlusion.
           If `v20` is a wall, and targets are on both sides, and there is a single `#o3` and `#o5`, then the rover must either:
           1. Be *on* the wall itself (which causes collision based on previous feedback, e.g. `(0.0, 0.0)` colliding with `v20`).
           2. Be *far enough away* such that the line of sight clears the wall's height. The wall is `z=0` to `z=0.1`. If the camera is higher than `z=0.1`, then seeing over it is possible. This is a common interpretation.
           
           Let's try a configuration further away in the y-direction, and a distinct x value, for `#o3` and `#o5`. This might allow it to "see over" `v20` if the camera height is sufficient.
           Let's try placing the rover significantly far from the x-axis, say `y=-0.5` for sampling, and `y=0.5` for imaging (to keep it a bit more central to objectives).
           The initial `v15` for `v14` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **1. Configuration `#o3` (imaging):**
           Let's try a point in the middle of x, and at a y that is not near any target. For example, `(0.0, -0.5)`. This is right on the wall `v20` so it will collide.
           Let's try to clear the wall on the positive side, and relatively far in y so the angle is more favorable to see across `v20`. How about `(0.5, -1.0)`?
           `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0).
           From `(0.5, -1.0)`, `v19` is still across the `v20` wall. If the wall is indeed occluding, a single configuration on one side won't work.
           
           This is a deadlock based on the feedback and the problem statement's inherent contradictions if the wall is truly occluding. However, the problem states that `imagevisible` and `above` are true for the given `#` configurations. This means *the planner must find values for them*.
           
           Let's make a critical assumption based on the given `imagevisible` facts: the `v20` obstacle, despite its AABB, does NOT occlude the line of sight when the rover is placed at the origin `(0.0, 0.0)` for imaging, or `(0.0, -1.0)` or `(0.0, 1.0)`. The previous collisions at `(0.0, 0.0)` likely refer to the *robot base* colliding, not occlusion for the camera. The `cfreerayconf` predicate or `blocked` axiom uses `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative`, which is about the *ray* being clear, not the rover's base. The AABB `v20` collision could be with the rover itself.
           
           If the rover cannot be at `x=0` because of `v20`'s width, it has to be on either side.
           Let's re-examine `v20`'s AABB `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.
           This means `v20` is a rectangular prism from x=-0.05 to x=0.05, y=-2.5 to y=2.5, and z=0.0 to z=0.1.
           If the rover's base is wider than 0.1, it will collide if its center is at x=0.
           Thus, we must pick `x` values for `#o3` and `#o5` such that `abs(x) > 0.05`.
           
           Let's reconsider the reachability for `#o0`: `(-1.0, -1.5)` from `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)` was `not reachable`. This is surprising for a simple translation. This might indicate an unseen obstacle near `(-1.0, -1.5)`. Or perhaps, the initial configuration `v15` is not meant to be a starting point for pathfinding for `#o0`. However, the problem states `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`. So it must be reachable.
           
           Let's try to put `#o0` even further from `v9` and closer to `v15`. `v9` max y is -1.654. `v15` y is -1.75. So `v15` is below `v9`'s top.
           Let's try `(-1.0, -1.9)`. This is clearly outside `v9`'s y-range (lower than `v9`'s min y of -2.346). No, `(-1.0, -1.9)` is *above* `v9`'s AABB.
           `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           A point like `(-1.0, -2.5)` would be below `v9` and to the east of `v9` and likely reachable from `v15`.
           
           **Revised Plan Strategy:**
           Since a single point for imaging/sampling spanning the wall seems to be causing issues (collision or occlusion), let's consider if multiple `#` continuous parameters are implicitly allowed if they correspond to different targets, even if sharing a base `#o<id>` name. The current problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration...". It doesn't explicitly state that if `imagevisible` is true for multiple targets, they must share the same `#o<id>` for the configuration. However, the provided action instances `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`, `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`, `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)` *all use `#o3`*. This definitively means only one configuration `#o3` is allowed for all imaging. The same applies to `#o5` for `above`.
           
           Therefore, the interpretation that `v20` does not occlude these specific lines of sight (for `imagevisible` and `above`) must be true for the continuous planner. The previous errors indicate a collision of the *robot base* with `v20`, not occlusion.
           
           Let's try configurations that are *clearly* outside the `x` range of `v20`.
           For `#o3` and `#o5`, let's choose `x=0.6`. This value is beyond the `v20` AABB (x=0.05).
           For `#o0`, let's try `(-1.0, -2.5)`, which is below `v9` and should be reachable.
           
           **New Configurations:**
           - `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(0.6, 1.0)`. This point is on the positive side of `v20`. It is near `v18` and `v17`. `v19` is at `x=-1.9`. Assuming `v20` does not occlude, this should work for `imagevisible`.
           - `#o0` (communication to `v9`): `(-1.0, -2.5)`. This point is below `v9` and is on the same `x` as `v15`.
           - `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): `(0.6, 0.0)`. This point is on the positive side of `v20`. Assuming `v20` does not interfere for `above`, this should work.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I made a typo in the previous plan. The action `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)` was written as `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`. The closing parenthesis was missing from the action name. The action itself is listed as valid: `((move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5))`. I will correct this in the plan, but the logic remains the same as I am just fixing a formatting error in the plan, not changing the action sequence or the configurations. The previous response was still problematic due to the continuous values selected. The error for the previous turn was specifically about invalid action `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`. This is a formatting error, not a plan error.
           
           I will re-submit the plan with the corrected formatting, but given the continuous planner has rejected the previous configurations, I will need to select new configurations.
           
           Let's carefully review the constraints and feedback again.
           1. `v20` (wall at x=0): AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)). This implies any rover position with x between -0.05 and 0.05 will collide. Thus, configurations must have `|x| > 0.05`.
           2. `imagevisible` and `above` predicates in initial state are true. This means, despite the wall `v20` and scattered targets, there exist collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable configurations `#o3` and `#o5` for `v14` to perform these actions for *all specified targets*.
           3. `v9` (lander for comms): AABB(`((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`). Rover must not collide with it.
           4. `v14` starts at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Re-evaluating configurations based on all feedback:**
           
           **For `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`):**
           - Targets: `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0).
           - Previous failed attempts: `(0.0, 1.0)`, `(0.1, 1.0)`, `(0.2, 1.0)` (collision with `v20`), `(-0.5, 1.0)` (occlusion).
           - This indicates that being on either side of `v20` (positive or negative x) causes occlusion for targets on the other side.
           - The only way for a single `#o3` to satisfy `imagevisible` for targets on both sides of `v20` is if:
               - The camera height allows seeing *over* the wall. The wall is 0.1 high. If the camera is higher than 0.1, this is plausible.
               - The robot is far enough in `y` that the angle of view clears `v20` (i.e., it can see targets on the other side without the ray intersecting `v20`).
           - Let's try to put the rover further away from the wall's direct influence, e.g., in a corner or edge that allows it to look across.
           - `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try to stay on the left side of `v20` (negative x) and try a `y` that is not near `v20`'s ends. Let's try `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This point is outside `v20`'s x-range (x=-0.05 to 0.05). It is also away from the targets. This might allow for a wide enough view.
           
           **For `#o0` (communication to `v9`):**
           - `v9`: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           - Previous failed attempts: `(-1.5, -2.0)` (collision with `v9`), `(-1.0, -2.0)` (not reachable), `(-0.5, -1.75)` (not reachable), `(-1.0, -2.5)` (not reachable).
           - The repeated "not reachable" for points very close to the starting point `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14` is highly problematic. This could mean the motion primitive `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)` is invalid for any `o0` that is close to `v15`, or there's an invisible obstacle, or the "reachable" check is very stringent.
           - Given that `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and `v9` (the target lander) is in the southwest region, a point like `(-1.0, -1.5)` should be trivially reachable from `v15` for communication. It is also outside `v9`'s Y-range by a small margin (y=-1.654 max for v9). Let's retry `(-1.0, -1.5)`. The previous "not reachable" might have been due to an implicit collision or another constraint that's not immediately obvious from AABBs alone. It's the most sensible logical location near the starting point of the rover that is close to `v9` without colliding.
           
           **For `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks):**
           - Rocks span `x` from `v7` (-2.1) to `v5` (1.9).
           - Previous failed attempts: `(0.0, 0.0)`, `(0.1, 0.0)`, `(0.2, 0.0)` (collision with `v20`). `(-0.5, 0.0)` (no specific error for `#o5` in that attempt, but the plan failed overall).
           - Similar to imaging, `above` is likely to be occluded if the wall `v20` truly blocks. Again, the initial state is a strong guarantee.
           - Let's use `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `#o5` as well. This puts `v14` on the negative side of `v20`. This configuration is far enough from `v20` (x= -1.0 vs -0.05 to 0.05). If `above` is possible, it should be possible from here.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty in finding valid continuous configurations, and the persistent "not reachable" error for even small movements, it is possible that there's a fundamental issue with the environment or the continuous planner's constraints that are not fully exposed. However, I must keep trying. The "not reachable" for `(-1.0, -1.5)` for `#o0` while `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)` is the most perplexing error, as they are essentially on the same vertical line, close to each other.
           
           Let's try to assume a simple translation is fine if there are no obstacles.
           If `v14` at `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and `v9` is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           A point like `(-1.5, -1.5)` might be better for `comvisible` to `v9`. It's within `v9`'s x-range, but above its y-range, and also on the negative side of `v20`.
           
           Let's try to make the configurations as distinct from the collision zone (`v20` at x=0) as possible, and for reachability, try simple displacements from the initial state `v15`.
           
           **New, new, new Configurations:**
           - `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(-1.0, 1.0)`. This point is far from `v20` and still quite central in the y-axis. It is also reachable from `v15` via a simple path avoiding `v20`.
           - `#o0` (communication to `v9`): `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This puts `v14` to the west of `v15` and slightly north, to try to communicate with `v9` from a different angle, avoiding previous 'not reachable' issues. It is within `v9`'s x-range (-2.4 to -1.4) but slightly above its y-range (-2.3 to -1.6). This should be outside `v9`'s AABB.
           - `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This point is again far from `v20` on the negative side, and centrally located in y-axis.

           ```
           
           Configuration #o5 = (-1.0 0.0) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous configurations are proving exceptionally difficult to find, encountering repeated issues with collision, occlusion, and reachability, especially around the obstacle `v20` (the wall at x=0) and the lander `v9`.
           
           Let's re-examine `v9` AABB: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           My last attempt for `#o0` `(-1.5, -1.5)` was in collision with `v9`. This is because `x = -1.5` is within `v9`'s x-range `[-2.405, -1.395]` and `y = -1.5` is above `v9`'s y-range `[-2.346, -1.654]`. No, `y = -1.5` is *above* the upper bound of `v9`'s y-range (`-1.654`), so it should *not* be in collision. This suggests the AABB values might represent more than just the physical bounds, or there's an unseen collision hull around `v9`. Given this continuous planner's strictness, it implies `(-1.5, -1.5)` is too close to `v9`.
           
           For `#o0`, let's try a point that is clearly outside `v9`'s AABB for both X and Y.
           `v9` has `x` up to -1.395. `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's put `#o0` at `(-0.5, -1.75)`. This is clearly outside `v9`'s x-range (`-0.5 > -1.395`). This point was previously rejected as "not reachable", which is highly suspicious for a point very close to `v15` without any obvious large obstacles between them.
           Alternatively, put `#o0` even further away, e.g. `(0.0, -1.75)`. This would be on `v20`, leading to collision.
           So let's try `(0.1, -1.75)` to be on the right side of `v20`. This should also be reachable from `v15` without colliding with `v20`.
           
           For `#o5` `(-1.0, 0.0)` for rover `v14` at target `v4` was "not reachable". This is very strange for such a simple movement from `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, 0.0)`. It implies there is an obstacle between `y=-1.75` and `y=0.0` at `x=-1.0`. There are no obstacles defined at `x=-1.0`. This suggests the rover `v14` itself, or its bounding box is complex.
           
           Let's rethink `reachability`. The motion actions are of the form `(move rover q1 #o2 q2)`. The `#o2` is a trajectory. The problem implies that motion from `q1` to `q2` should be collision-free. The repeated "not reachable" errors are the biggest roadblock.
           
           Could it be that the range of valid `x` and `y` coordinates for the robot is limited? Or is `v20` a *very* long wall that makes paths between negative and positive x impossible without crossing `v20` itself?
           
           Given the difficulty, let's go back to the most basic assumptions:
           - The initial state `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)` are true. This means the continuous planner *must* be able to find valid values for these configurations for `v14`.
           - The `motion` predicates for all combinations are also true. So, `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`, `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`, etc., are *valid actions*.
           
           The problem is that I am asked to provide specific continuous values. This means I need to guess them correctly. If the continuous values are chosen such that the robot itself collides with `v20`, that is an issue. If `v20` occludes a target, that's an issue. If the path from `q1` to `q2` is blocked, that's an issue.
           
           Let's assume the previous `occlusion` error for `#o3 = (-0.5, 1.0)` was because `v17` and `v18` are at positive `x` coordinates.
           Let's assume the previous `collision` error for `#o0 = (-1.5, -1.5)` was because it was too close to `v9`.
           Let's assume the `not reachable` for `#o5 = (-1.0, 0.0)` for a simple vertical movement from `(-1.0, -1.75)` is due to an implicit constraint.
           
           If `-1.0, 0.0` for `#o5` is not reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)` (v15), it implies that `v14` cannot pass through the area `x=-1.0, y=(-1.75, 0.0)`. This could mean another object is there, or some internal restriction of the robot's movement.
           
           Let's use a strategy to select configuration points in "open" regions, far from any obstacles, and try to place them strategically.
           Open areas from the provided objects:
           - Many objects are around x=0, and y near 0 or 2 or -2.
           - `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - `v9` is around `(-1.8, -2.0)`.
           - `v20` is at `x=0`.
           
           Let's try to keep all `v14` operations on one side of `v20`, e.g., negative x.
           - **`#o3` (imaging):** Targets `v17`(x=1.8), `v18`(x=0.6), `v19`(x=-1.9).
             If `v14` is at `x=-1.0`, `v17` and `v18` are on the other side of `v20`. This will cause occlusion if `v20` is opaque.
             But the initial state *guarantees* that `imagevisible` is true from *a single* `#o3`. This implies that `v20` *does not* cause occlusion from some valid `#o3`. This means I must pick a point where the *robot itself* does not collide with `v20`.
             Let's try `(-0.6, 1.0)`. This is distinct from `v20` in `x` and far from `v15` in `y`, but at least it's on the negative side of `v20`.
           
           - **`#o0` (communication):** `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
             Rover `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
             Let's choose `(-0.5, -1.5)`. This is outside `v9` in `x` (`-0.5 > -1.395`) and `y` (`-1.5 > -1.654`). It's also reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`. The previous "not reachable" might have been context-dependent. Let's try it again.
           
           - **`#o5` (sampling):** Rocks are scattered.
             Let's try `(-0.6, 0.0)`. This is similar to `#o3` and also on the negative side of `v20`.
           
           This approach is highly iterative, as I cannot simulate the continuous planner's exact behavior. The repeated "not reachable" errors are the most puzzling for simple moves. This might be due to a bug in the problem generation or validation. I will try this set of coordinates, focusing on being clearly outside obstacles.

           (#o5 v14 #o2 v4): (-0.6 0.0)

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.6 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous configurations remain the most challenging aspect of this problem, with repeated failures due to collision, occlusion, or reachability. The core issue seems to be finding a single configuration for `#o3` (imaging) and `#o5` (sampling) that satisfies the initial state's `imagevisible` and `above` predicates across the `v20` wall (x=0) for targets/rocks on both sides.
           
           Let's summarize the targets and obstacles again:
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)). A wall at x=0.
           - `v14` initial: `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - `v9` (lander): AABB(`((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`).
           - Imaging targets: `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0).
           - Sampling rocks: `v1` (1.3, 0.8), `v3` (0.6, -1.2), `v4` (-0.6, 0.7), `v5` (1.9, -1.5), `v7` (-2.1, 0.5), `v8` (-0.6, -1.1).
           
           The consistent occlusion for `#o3` when trying to stay on one side of `v20` (`-0.6, 1.0` caused occlusion for `v17` at `x=1.8`) suggests that `v20` indeed acts as an occluder. This contradicts the implication of the initial `imagevisible` predicates that a single `#o3` should work for all targets on both sides of `v20`. This is a fundamental inconsistency in the problem setup if `v20` is a solid, tall wall.
           
           However, since the problem states the initial predicates are true, I must assume there is a configuration where the robot base does not collide with `v20`, and the camera can see over or around `v20`, making it `occlusion-free`.
           
           **The only way to achieve `imagevisible` for targets on both sides of `v20` without collision or occlusion for the robot base is if the rover is placed *very far* in the y-direction, such that the angle allows the line of sight to clear `v20` for all targets.** Or, the `z` height of the camera on the robot is sufficiently high to see over the 0.1 height wall. Since I don't know the robot's dimensions, I can only guess.
           
           Let's try to place `v14` for `#o3` at a much lower y-coordinate, for example, near `v14`'s starting `y` of `-1.75`, but still outside `v20`'s x-range. This might provide a better line of sight for targets far away.
           Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o3`. This is on the negative side of `v20`, and relatively far from `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. This also has `y` away from the targets, allowing for potentially less direct occlusion.
           
           **For `#o0` (communication to `v9`):**
           - `v9`: `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           - Previous failed `(-0.5, -1.5)` with `collision with v9`. My interpretation of AABB was incorrect if this collides. `x=-0.5` is outside `v9`'s x-range `[-2.405, -1.395]`. `y=-1.5` is outside `v9`'s y-range `[-2.346, -1.654]` (it's above the max y). So logically it should not collide. This suggests `v9` has a larger effective collision hull, or the configuration is still too close.
           - Let's try `(-0.1, -1.75)`. This is just outside `v20` to the left, and very close to `v14`'s start `y`. This is far from `v9`. It might be more reachable.
           
           **For `#o5` (sampling):**
           - Rocks span `x` from `v7` (-2.1) to `v5` (1.9).
           - Last attempt `(-0.6, 0.0)` was "not reachable". This is very problematic for a relatively short path.
           - Let's try `(0.1, 0.0)`. This point is on the positive side of `v20` (outside `x=-0.05` to `x=0.05`). It might allow sampling to work given the "above" predicate should hold. It might also address the "not reachable" from the `v15` start, as it's closer to the right side of `v20`.
           
           This trial-and-error method is highly inefficient without more information about the continuous space. I have to keep trying my best to guess valid coordinates.
           
           **New Configurations (Attempt 6):**
           - `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This point is on the negative side of `v20` and distinct from its `y` values.
           - `#o0` (communication to `v9`): `(-0.1, -1.75)`. This is just outside `v20` on the negative side and on the same `y` as `v15`. It's also far from `v9`.
           - `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): `(0.1, 0.0)`. This point is on the positive side of `v20`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The plan generation is still failing at the continuous parameter selection, facing collisions, out-of-range issues, and occlusion. This specific error about `imagevisible` range (`max 2`) and `comvisible` range (`max 4`) is new and important.
           - `imagevisible`: max distance 2.
           - `comvisible`: max distance 4.
           
           Let's re-evaluate all configurations considering these explicit range limits and the persistent collision with `v20`.
           
           **1. Configuration `#o3` (imaging):**
           - Targets: `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0).
           - Rover `v14` needs to be within 2 units of ALL these targets from a single `#o3`.
           - `v19` is at `x=-1.9, y=2.0`. `v17` is at `x=1.8, y=2.0`.
           - My previous attempt `(-1.0, -1.0)` was `4.34` away from `v17`. This is too far.
           - A point around `(0.0, 2.0)` would be close to `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` in `y`. The `x` coordinate needs to be chosen to avoid `v20` (x between -0.05 and 0.05).
           - Let's try `(0.1, 2.0)` or `(-0.1, 2.0)`.
               - `(0.1, 2.0)` to `v17` (1.8, 2.0): distance sqrt((1.8-0.1)^2 + (2.0-2.0)^2) = 1.7. In range.
               - `(0.1, 2.0)` to `v18` (0.6, 1.8): distance sqrt((0.6-0.1)^2 + (1.8-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.29) approx 0.54. In range.
               - `(0.1, 2.0)` to `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): distance sqrt((-1.9-0.1)^2 + (2.0-2.0)^2) = sqrt((-2.0)^2) = 2.0. In range.
           - `(0.1, 2.0)` is a good candidate for range. However, it's very close to `v20`. The previous attempts at `(0.1, 1.0)` and `(0.2, 1.0)` collided with `v20`. So `(0.1, 2.0)` will likely collide with `v20` as well.
           - This suggests that a single configuration that is both collision-free with `v20` AND within 2 units of all three imaging targets might not exist. This would imply the problem is unsolvable under these strict constraints, but the problem states the initial conditions are true.
           - If `v20` is a physical wall, then imaging `v19` (at `x=-1.9`) from `x=0.1` will involve occlusion. But the system *guarantees* `imagevisible` from `#o3`. This means the physical parameters of `v20` (height 0.1) allow viewing over/around it if the robot is far enough.
           - The `imagevisible` for `v19` at `(-1.9, 2.0)` and `v17` at `(1.8, 2.0)` from a single `#o3` is the trickiest. If `#o3` is at `(x_rover, y_rover)`, the horizontal span is almost 4 units. To be within 2 units, `x_rover` must be very close to the center of `v19` and `v17`. The y-coordinate must also be close to `2.0`. A location like `(0.0, 2.0)` is the center, but it collides.
           - Let's try `(0.5, 2.0)`.
               - To `v17` (1.8, 2.0): distance 1.3. In range.
               - To `v18` (0.6, 1.8): distance sqrt((0.1)^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.01+0.04) = sqrt(0.05) approx 0.22. In range.
               - To `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): distance sqrt((-1.9-0.5)^2 + 0^2) = 2.4. **OUT OF RANGE (max 2).**
           - This implies a configuration around `x=0` and `y=2` is necessary, but `x=0` collides.
           - What if rover `v12` is used for imaging? `v12` is at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`. Still, the issue of spanning targets across `v20` and being within range holds.
           - Let's assume the continuous planner's "collision with `v20`" means the *center* of the robot can't be between `x=-0.05` and `x=0.05`. We need `|x| > 0.05`.
           - The most central point (0, 2) is needed for range. Since it collides, maybe a value slightly outside, but within range of all. This is contradictory. The initial conditions are key. There must be a point that satisfies all constraints.
           - Let's re-try a point that is very slightly off the `x=0` line. If `(0.1, 2.0)` collided, `(0.06, 2.0)` might too. Let's try `(0.2, 2.0)`.
               - `(0.2, 2.0)` to `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): dist `2.1`. Still out of range.
           - This means a single `#o3` for all three targets, given range 2.0, is geometrically impossible if `v19` is at x=-1.9 and `v17` is at x=1.8 (total span 3.7). The center x is (-1.9+1.8)/2 = -0.05. A rover at `(-0.05, 2.0)` would be `1.75` from `v17` and `1.85` from `v19`. This is within range. BUT `(-0.05, 2.0)` is in collision with `v20`.
           - This is a critical logical inconsistency given `imagevisible` in the initial state for `#o3` for all three targets and the range limit. It strongly suggests that *either* the range constraint applies differently, or the `v20` AABB needs to be interpreted very leniently.
           - I must assume the initial predicate `imagevisible` implies the range is satisfied for some *valid* #o3. I will try `(0.0, 1.5)`. This is problematic for `v20` collision. Let's try to assume there's a specific `x` for `#o3` where the rover doesn't collide, e.g. `(0.06, 1.9)`.
               - `(0.06, 1.9)` to `v17` (1.8, 2.0): dist `sqrt(1.74^2 + 0.1^2)` approx `1.74`.
               - `(0.06, 1.9)` to `v18` (0.6, 1.8): dist `sqrt(0.54^2 + 0.1^2)` approx `0.55`.
               - `(0.06, 1.9)` to `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): dist `sqrt(1.96^2 + 0.1^2)` approx `1.96`. All within 2.0 range. This is the best logical guess for the center.
           
           **2. Configuration `#o0` (communication to `v9`):**
           - `v9` is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           - Max range 4.0.
           - `v14` initial: `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - Previous `(-0.1, -1.75)` collided with `v20`.
           - Let's try `(-0.6, -1.75)`. This is to the left of `v20`.
           - Distance from `(-0.6, -1.75)` to `v9` (let's use its center for approximation: `(-1.9, -2.0)`). Dist `sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.6))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2)` = `sqrt((-1.3)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(1.69 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(1.7525)` approx `1.32`. In range (max 4). This also needs to be reachable.
           
           **3. Configuration `#o5` (sampling):**
           - Rocks span from `x=-2.1` to `x=1.9`.
           - Previous `(0.1, 0.0)` collided with `v20`.
           - Similar to `#o3`, this suggests `x=0.0` is special and `|x| > 0.05` for no collision.
           - The `above` predicate, like `imagevisible`, might need to cover a wide area. If the wall `v20` occludes some rocks from `x=0.1`, then `above` can't be true for all.
           - Let's try a configuration that is well away from `v20` and central to the available rocks.
           - Let's use `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This was previously "not reachable". This is the most confusing error as it is a straight line from `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, 0.0)`. If this is not reachable, it makes any movement along `x=-1.0` impossible.
           - Given the "not reachable" error for `(-1.0, 0.0)`, let's try `(-0.6, 0.0)`. This was also previously tried with "not reachable" for a higher y. Let's try `(0.6, 0.0)`. This should be reachable from `(-0.6, -1.75)` (if `#o0` is there), crossing `v20`. If it's reachable, it might also satisfy `above` for all rocks.
           
           Let's use `v12` for analysis: `v12` at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`. `v20` is between `x=-0.05` and `x=0.05`.
           `v12` is at `x=1.0`, so it is on the right side of `v20`.
           Let's use `v12` to sample rocks on the right side of `v20`: `v1`, `v3`, `v5`.
           And `v14` for rocks on the left side: `v4`, `v7`, `v8`.
           This would be a multi-robot plan. The problem does not ask for it, and the action instances only show `sample_rock v14 #o5 ...`.
           
           This points back to the interpretation that `#o5` must be a single location for `v14`.
           Given the "not reachable" errors for `#o5` (`(-1.0, 0.0)`) and the "collision with `v20`" for `(0.1, 0.0)`, it seems the entire y-axis for `x` near `0` is problematic.
           
           Let's assume the problem statement implies there's a unique coordinate for each `#` configuration.
           The range 2.0 for `imagevisible` means `v14` needs to be very close to `(0.0, 2.0)`. `(0.06, 1.9)` seems like the most logical attempt for `#o3`.
           For `#o0`, `(-0.6, -1.75)` should be collision-free and within range.
           For `#o5`, if moving along `x=-1.0` is blocked, and `x=0.1` collides, what is left? Perhaps a point `(-0.6, -1.0)` is reachable and allows `above` for all.
           
           This is challenging. I will try the most central values that are slightly off the collision x-axis.
           
           **New Configurations (Attempt 7):**
           - `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(0.06, 1.9)` - This is the most central x for targets, just outside `v20`, and within range.
           - `#o0` (communication to `v9`): `(-0.6, -1.75)` - Collision-free with `v20`, outside `v9`, and within range.
           - `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): `(-0.6, -1.0)` - Collision-free with `v20`, potentially reachable, and central enough for `above` to work.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The plan generation continues to face persistent issues with finding valid continuous configurations. The constant rejections based on collision with `v20`, "not reachable" errors, and out-of-range for `imagevisible` point to a fundamental difficulty with the geometry or the interpretation of the continuous parameters.
           
           Let's break down the problems again with the latest feedback:
           
           1.  **`#o3` (imaging): `(0.06, 1.9)` for `v14` at target `v17` is in collision with `v20`.**
               *   The wall `v20` has an x-range of `(-0.05, 0.05)`. `0.06` is just outside this. This suggests the robot's own dimensions are larger than its point representation, causing a collision even if its center is just outside the wall.
               *   This makes any `x` value close to `0` problematic.
               *   Targets are `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0). Range is 2.0.
               *   As noted before, a single configuration within 2 units of both `v17` and `v19` geometrically requires an `x` coordinate very close to 0.05 or -0.05. If such points cause collision, then the only way this could be possible is if the robot's collision hull is extremely small, or the problem has an inherent contradiction.
               *   Since the initial state guarantees `imagevisible` for all three from `#o3`, there *must* be such a collision-free and range-valid point.
           
           2.  **`#o0` (communication): `(-0.6, -1.75)` for `v14` at target `v9` is not reachable.**
               *   `v14` starts at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`. This is a small movement.
               *   `v9` (lander) is `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. `(-0.6, -1.75)` is clearly outside `v9`'s bounding box in both x and y.
               *   This "not reachable" error for a short, seemingly unblocked path is very perplexing and has occurred consistently. This might hint at a general "unreachable zone" or an invisible obstacle that I'm unaware of.
           
           3.  **`#o5` (sampling): `(-0.6, -1.0)` for `v14` at target `v4` is not reachable.**
               *   Similarly, this is a path from `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)` or `#o0 (-0.6, -1.75)` or `#o3` to `(-0.6, -1.0)`. This is also a seemingly simple translation. This further suggests issues with reachability for even short distances in certain areas.
           
           Given these consistent failures and the inherent contradiction if the problem statement is taken literally with `v20` as a solid occluding/colliding wall, I must make a very specific assumption to try to find a solution. The only way this problem can be solved is if the *geometry* of the scene or the *definition of collision/occlusion* is more complex than a simple AABB check, or if there is a specific 'sweet spot' that avoids all issues.
           
           Let's assume there is *some* point `X_img` that is collision-free for `v14`, and for which `imagevisible` is true for all `v17, v18, v19`, and `comvisible` to `v9` is true from `X_comm`, and `above` is true from `X_sample`. And all `move` actions between them are valid.
           
           The most perplexing issue is "not reachable". This often implies a path planning problem where no collision-free path exists.
           Let's try to keep all continuous points very close to `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`. This should maximize reachability from the start.
           
           **If `#o3` (imaging) needs to be close to `y=2.0` (for all targets) but `x=0` is problematic due to collision/occlusion/range:**
           The only way around this would be if the targets are actually *not* across the wall from `v14`'s final `x` position, or if the `imagevisible` predicate is extremely generous. Given the span of targets, a point close to `x=0` is required. If `x=0.06` collides, how about `x=-0.06`? Or `x=0.1` and `y=1.5`?
           Let's try a point far from `y=2.0` that might allow for a wider viewing angle over `v20`. How about `(0.1, -1.0)`?
           - `(0.1, -1.0)` to `v17` (1.8, 2.0): dist `sqrt((1.7)^2 + (3.0)^2)` = `sqrt(2.89 + 9.0)` = `sqrt(11.89)` approx `3.45`. OUT OF RANGE.
           
           This strategy of a single point covering a wide range for image/sample is not working with range constraints.
           
           Let's consider that the continuous planner might be very sensitive to even tiny overlaps.
           The "not reachable" for a configuration suggests the *path* from the previous configuration to the new one is blocked.
           
           **A radical re-evaluation:** Since the system *guarantees* that `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)` are in the initial state, and the relevant `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, `above`, and `motion` predicates are true, the problem *is solvable*. My chosen numeric values are simply incorrect. I am going to make a wild guess based on the problem's own naming convention of `v12` and `v14` being at `v13` and `v15` for configs. Perhaps `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are actually referring to some known, pre-defined collision-free spots, and my numerical attempts are just bad guesses.
           The values must be found such that they adhere to all rules.
           
           Let's try configurations that are simple translations from `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - `#o3` imaging: Needs to be within 2 units. Given `v19` is at (-1.9, 2.0), `v17` is at (1.8, 2.0). A point like `(-1.0, 0.0)` is too far (dist to `v17` is `sqrt(2.8^2 + 2^2)` = `sqrt(7.84 + 4)` = `sqrt(11.84)` approx `3.4`).
           - So, `y` must be high. Let's try `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
               - `(-1.0, 1.0)` to `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): dist `sqrt(0.9^2 + 1.0^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 1)` = `sqrt(1.81)` approx `1.34`. In range.
               - `(-1.0, 1.0)` to `v17` (1.8, 2.0): dist `sqrt(2.8^2 + 1.0^2)` = `sqrt(7.84 + 1)` = `sqrt(8.84)` approx `2.97`. OUT OF RANGE.
           - This confirms that a single point on one side of `v20` cannot satisfy the range requirement for both `v17` and `v19`.
           
           This *must* mean that the `v20` obstacle is either not an occluder, or it is not as wide as its AABB suggests for certain robot interactions, OR the center of the robot can be `x=0.0`. But `(0.06, 1.9)` already failed due to collision with `v20`. This is where I am stuck.
           
           Given the problem constraints, the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. The problem provides `motion` predicates between `v15`, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. This indicates that these continuous configurations are indeed reachable from one another.
           
           Let's assume the continuous planner for `imagevisible` / `comvisible` is working as expected given the range. And `above` also works.
           The collisions with `v20` are the core problem. The rover must avoid `x` from `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
           
           I'm going to make one more attempt at configurations, trying to fulfill all the criteria for `v14`, assuming the most optimal locations for range and avoiding `v20` by a slightly larger margin.
           
           For `#o3` (imaging):
           - To satisfy range for `v17` (x=1.8), `v18` (x=0.6), `v19` (x=-1.9) from a single point (`max dist 2`). This implies being near `(0.0, 2.0)`.
           - If `x=0.06` collides, try `x=0.1`. If that collides, try `x=0.2`.
           - Let's try `(0.1, 1.8)`.
               - To `v17` (1.8, 2.0): dist `sqrt(1.7^2 + 0.2^2)` = `sqrt(2.89 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(2.93)` approx `1.71`.
               - To `v18` (0.6, 1.8): dist `sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.0^2)` = `0.5`.
               - To `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): dist `sqrt(2.0^2 + 0.2^2)` = `sqrt(4.0 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(4.04)` approx `2.01`. This is just barely out of range! `2.01 > 2.0`.
           - This confirms the geometric impossibility with `x` significantly away from `0`. The only points that satisfy the range are `(-0.05, 2.0)` to `(0.05, 2.0)`. All collide.
           
           This leads to the conclusion that if the conditions are truly strict (collision with `v20`, max range 2), then the problem's initial state is contradictory with what is geometrically possible. However, the problem statement mandates that such a plan exists.
           
           Given the dilemma, I must make a strong assertion about what the continuous planner might accept, even if it seems contradictory to the error messages. The only way to satisfy the `imagevisible` range and collision with `v20` is if `v20` is not actually a continuous obstacle in some sense, or there is some 'null' value that avoids all collisions.
           
           I will try to use the *exact geometric center of the region where all conditions might be met*, and slightly perturb it to avoid explicit collision with `v20` based on AABB. If `x=0` is the center for images and samples, and it collides, then perhaps `x=0.051` or `x=-0.051` is the intended value.
           
           Let's re-examine `v20`'s AABB. `x` from `-0.05` to `0.05`.
           So `x = 0.06` was indeed outside `v20`. The collision message is critical. This could mean the robot's physical width is `> 0.1` and centered at `0.06` still causes collision with `v20`.
           
           This implies a configuration at `x > 0.1` or `x < -0.1`.
           If `x = 0.1` is taken, then `v19` at `x = -1.9` is `2.0` units away.
           If `x = -0.1` is taken, then `v17` at `x = 1.8` is `1.9` units away.
           The center for `y` is `2.0`.
           
           **New Configurations (Attempt 8):**
           - `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`): `(-0.1, 1.9)`.
               - To `v17` (1.8, 2.0): dist `sqrt(1.9^2 + 0.1^2)` = `sqrt(3.61 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(3.62)` approx `1.90`. In range.
               - To `v18` (0.6, 1.8): dist `sqrt(0.7^2 + 0.1^2)` = `sqrt(0.49 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(0.5)` approx `0.70`. In range.
               - To `v19` (-1.9, 2.0): dist `sqrt(1.8^2 + 0.1^2)` = `sqrt(3.24 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(3.25)` approx `1.80`. In range.
               - This is theoretically valid for range. It's `x=-0.1`, which is outside `v20`'s AABB. It's still close to `v20`, so `v20` is the main uncertainty. This is the only way for the imaging range to work.
           
           - `#o0` (communication to `v9`): `(-0.5, -1.5)`. This was previously `collision with v9`. This suggests my calculation of `v9`'s bounding box vs the point is wrong, or the rover's extent is large. Let's try `(-0.5, -1.0)`. This is even further from `v9`. It is also outside `v20`. This should be reachable.
               - `v9` (center approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`). `(-0.5, -1.0)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)`: dist `sqrt((-1.4)^2 + (-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 1.0)` = `sqrt(2.96)` approx `1.72`. In range (max 4).
           
           - `#o5` (sampling, `above` all rocks): `(-0.5, -1.0)`. This should avoid `v20` and be reachable. If this also fails, there is a serious issue with the interpretation of reachability or the underlying environment model.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.1 1.9) for rover v14 at target v17 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v20: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           v21: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-0.5 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent failure in finding valid continuous configurations indicates an inherent difficulty or an inconsistency in the problem's geometric representation as perceived by the continuous planner, given the strict requirements. The `v20` collision (wall at x=0) combined with `v21` (new obstacle: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1))) for `#o3` imaging and the constant "not reachable" errors for `#o0` and `#o5` make this extremely challenging.
           
           Let's carefully analyze the new obstacle `v21`: a block from `x=-0.75` to `-0.25` and `y=1.75` to `2.25`.
           My last attempt for `#o3` was `(-0.1, 1.9)`. This collides with `v20` (as it's near x=0). And now it also collides with `v21` because `y=1.9` is within `v21`'s y-range `[1.75, 2.25]`, and `x=-0.1` is within `v21`'s x-range `[-0.75, -0.25]`. This is a critical new constraint.
           
           This means any point near `x=0` or in the region covered by `v21` is blocked for imaging.
           
           **Re-evaluating everything with `v20` and `v21`:**
           
           **1. `#o3` (imaging for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`):**
           - Targets: `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0). Max range 2.0.
           - `v20` blocks `x` from `[-0.05, 0.05]`.
           - `v21` blocks `x` from `[-0.75, -0.25]` and `y` from `[1.75, 2.25]`.
           - A valid `#o3` must avoid both `v20` and `v21`.
           - The ideal range for all targets is around `(0.0, 2.0)`.
           - If we go to `x > 0.05`, e.g., `(0.1, 1.9)` or `(0.2, 1.9)`:
               - Distance to `v19` (-1.9, 2.0) is `sqrt((-1.9-0.1)^2 + (2.0-1.9)^2)` = `sqrt(4.0 + 0.01)` approx `2.002`. This is still marginally out of range for the `x=0.1` example.
           - If we go to `x < -0.75`, e.g., `(-0.8, 1.9)`:
               - Distance to `v17` (1.8, 2.0) is `sqrt((1.8 - (-0.8))^2 + (2.0 - 1.9)^2)` = `sqrt(2.6^2 + 0.1^2)` = `sqrt(6.76 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(6.77)` approx `2.60`. This is OUT OF RANGE.
           
           This implies that, with `v20` and `v21` in place, it is **geometrically impossible** to find a single configuration `#o3` for `v14` to image all three targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) within the 2.0 range and without collision/occlusion, as the targets span too wide an area and the central "sweet spot" is blocked.
           
           This leads to a critical point: if the initial state `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` is true, then either:
           a) The max range for `imagevisible` is not 2.0 (but problem states it is).
           b) `v20` and `v21` do not obstruct line of sight in a way that is clear from their AABBs.
           c) The problem is unsolvable because of a contradiction between initial state and geometric constraints.
           
           Given the instructions, I must assume a solution exists. The only way it could exist if `x` values near `0` are blocked by `v20`, and `x` values in `[-0.75, -0.25]` are blocked by `v21` at relevant `y`s, is if the robot can **see over these obstacles from a sufficient distance**. But if it's too far, it's out of range. This is a severe dilemma.
           
           I'm going to try one last time with a configuration that is *very far away* from the obstacles in the y-direction, and at an `x` that is open, hoping this allows "seeing over" and satisfies range by some property I am missing.
           `v14` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's put `#o3` at `(1.0, -1.0)`. This is far from `v20` and `v21`.
           - `(1.0, -1.0)` to `v17` (1.8, 2.0): dist `sqrt(0.8^2 + 3.0^2)` = `sqrt(0.64 + 9)` = `sqrt(9.64)` approx `3.10`. OUT OF RANGE.
           
           This confirms the range constraint is the hardest. The range forces the rover near `(0.0, 2.0)`, which is the most obstructed area.
           If I cannot find a point for `#o3` that satisfies range and is collision/occlusion-free, the plan cannot be formed.
           
           **The only remaining possibility is to use `v12` for imaging, if `v12` can reach a suitable `#o3`.**
           `v12` is at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`.
           Let's analyze `v12` for `#o3`:
           - Try `(0.1, 1.9)` for `v12`. `x=0.1` is on the side of `v20` opposite `v12`'s `x=1.0`.
               - Distance to `v19` (-1.9, 2.0) is approx 2.002. Out of range.
               - Distance to `v17` (1.8, 2.0) is approx 1.71. In range.
               - Distance to `v18` (0.6, 1.8) is approx 0.54. In range.
           - `(0.1, 1.9)` for `v12` still fails `v19` range.
           - What about `v12` at `(-0.1, 1.9)`? This would be a large move for `v12` (from `x=1.0` to `x=-0.1`). It would also collide with `v20` and `v21` for `v12` just like `v14`.
           
           It's clear that the problem is unsolvable with the provided constraints and my understanding of the environment and rover kinematics. The simultaneous requirements of imaging/sampling targets across `v20` with a narrow range and having a small collision-free path for movement is geometrically contradictory for `v14` (and `v12`).
           
           Since I am instructed to return a plan or explain why it's not achievable:
           The goal is not achievable because no configuration for `#o3` can satisfy the following conditions simultaneously:
           1.  Be collision-free for rover `v14` (avoiding `v20` AABB: `x` in `[-0.05, 0.05]`, and `v21` AABB: `x` in `[-0.75, -0.25]` and `y` in `[1.75, 2.25]`).
           2.  Be within the `imagevisible` range of 2.0 units for all objectives `v17` (1.8, 2.0), `v18` (0.6, 1.8), `v19` (-1.9, 2.0). The objectives span an x-range of `1.8 - (-1.9) = 3.7` units. To be within 2.0 units of both `v17` and `v19`, the rover's x-coordinate must be very close to `(-1.9 + 1.8) / 2 = -0.05`. This point (`-0.05, 2.0`) is exactly on the edge of `v20`'s collision range, and thus causes a collision.
           3.  Be occlusion-free for all objectives, given `v20` and `v21` are fixed obstacles.
           
           The combination of `v20` and `v21` creates an impassable region in `x` from `[-0.75, 0.05]` at `y=1.75` to `2.25`. The imaging targets are centered around `y=2.0`. This makes it impossible to find a valid configuration for `#o3`.
           
           Furthermore, the persistent "not reachable" errors for `#o0` and `#o5` for seemingly simple translational movements indicate broader path planning issues, possibly due to unstated obstacles or highly restrictive movement models for the rover in the environment. Without specific information to overcome these "not reachable" errors, they are insurmountable.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable given the current information and the feedback from the continuous planner.
