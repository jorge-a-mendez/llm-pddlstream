           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My Thoughts on Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a small square object on a rectangular surface. The object is 0.07 x 0.07 meters, and the surface is defined by its AABB bounds.
           
           To ensure stability, the object must remain entirely within the surface's bounds and not collide with any other objects. Since I haven't been given any other constraints (like other objects), the primary concern is keeping the object within the surface.
           
           The object's rotation (theta) affects its effective AABB size.  I've considered several rotation angles, but because the object is square, rotations by multiples of pi/2 produce the same sized bounding box. I will need to diversify by using the full range to ensure diverse solutions.
           
           Since the surface and object dimensions allow many possibilities, I'll generate a regular grid of placements at specific rotational orientations, supplemented by a few randomly distributed placements. The rectangular surface has a width and height of 0.6.  The maximum effective object size, considering a diagonal rotation, is about 0.099.
           
           I need to calculate the bounding box based on the rotation angle and then place the object inside this valid space (the usable area).
