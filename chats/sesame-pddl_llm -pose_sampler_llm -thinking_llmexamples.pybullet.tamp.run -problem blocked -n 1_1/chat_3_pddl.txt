(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()`: A Plan in Motion**
           
           My objective is clear: to devise a plan that achieves the goal `new-axiom@0()` from the given initial state. This axiom mandates that both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` become true.
           
           By examining the initial conditions, it's evident that `?green` is `v12` and that the objects are stackable. Consequently, the goal simplifies to `on(v12, v18)`. The predicate `on(v12, v18)` is true if `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true for some pose `?p`. A thorough review of the current state reveals that `v12` is presently supported by `v14` at pose `v13`, but it can also be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           The arm has to pick up `v12`, and place it on `v18`.
           
           The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. However, analyzing the properties of the initial state, the base configuration `#o3` seems already to be appropriate and present. I deduce that the plan requires placing `v12` at pose `#o2` supported by `v18`. Therefore, the essential steps are `pick` and `place`.
           
           I evaluated the feasibility of the `pick` action. I confirmed that the preconditions are present and the postconditions are applicable to the current state.
           
           Next, I analyzed the `place` action, which also satisfies the requirements.
           
           Through the `pick` action, the current pose becomes false, with `v12` grasped, and the base remains unchanged.
           
           Subsequent to the `place` action, the object has been placed at the required pose, and now the hand is empty.
           
           Verifying that all preconditions and postconditions align, I confirm the plan, it will satisfy my initial objectives. The plan is valid. I've concluded that the required plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()` is the following two-step procedure:
           
           1.  Pick v12 from current pose
           2.  Place v12 at the supported pose, fulfilling the prerequisites of the goal.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Failure and Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed, and the culprit appears to be `atbconf(#o3)`. I need to revisit the problem's initial state and available actions.
           
           Initially, I know that `bconf(#o3)` is true, but critically, `atbconf(#o3)` is *not* explicitly satisfied. This is the lynchpin. The only actions that *directly* affect `atbconf` are `move_base`. `pick` and `place` require `atbconf(?q)` as a precondition, where ?q represents a base configuration. In the previous plan, ?q was `#o3`.
           
           Looking at the initial state again, I see `atbconf(v9)`. That means the robot is *not* starting at the required base, `#o3`. The `pick` and `place` action instances provided all rely on `#o3` for the base configuration:
           
           - `(pick ... #o3 ...)`
           - `(place ... #o3 ...)`
           - And so on.
           
           Therefore, to use any `pick` or `place` action, I need to get the robot to `#o3` first. The only way to do that is with `move_base`. But the only `move_base` action instance I have is `((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))`. It moves *from* `#o3` *to* `#o3`. This doesn't help me get from my initial state `v9` to `#o3`!
           
           This is a major problem. If I can't get to the required base configuration `#o3`, I can't perform the `pick` or `place` actions.
           
           Let me review the problem statement again: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           So, I have:
           - `atbconf(v9)` initially.
           - All `pick` and `place` actions need `atbconf(#o3)`.
           - The only `move_base` action doesn't let me move to `#o3`.
           
           Since I can't reach `#o3` with the given action instances, I'm unable to pick and place `v12` to `v18`. Therefore, I can't satisfy the goal condition `on(v12, v18)`. With the given constraints, this goal is simply unreachable. The provided action instances are insufficient.
