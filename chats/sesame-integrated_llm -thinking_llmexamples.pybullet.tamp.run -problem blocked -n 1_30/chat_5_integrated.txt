           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan to Achieve the Goal**
           
           The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having object `v12` *on* `v18`. After looking at the given axioms, the essence of this is that `v12` must be *at* a specific pose, which is supported by `v18`. Since `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is in the initial state,  we can place `v12` at pose `#p1`, which is supported by the surface `v18`. Given the problem, I must use `#p1` and not create dummy variables.
           
           Initially, `v12` is at `v13`. The robot, with arm `v4`, is `handempty` and its base is at `v3`.
           
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I must create a plan to execute:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, the robot's base must move from its current location, `v3`, to a pick configuration, `#q2`, that is near `v12`'s current location, `v13`. This will require a `move_base` action using trajectory `#t5`. This depends on the initial setup and geometry.
           2.  **Pick:** Using arm `v4`,  I need to pick `v12` from its current pose `v13` (using grasp `#g1`) while at base configuration `#q2`. We'll need another trajectory, `#t4`, and appropriate kinematic configuration.
           3.  **Move Base:** After picking `v12`, the robot needs to move the base from `#q2` to a place configuration, `#q3` (trajectory `#t7`).
           4.  **Place:** Finally, using arm `v4`, I place `v12` at the target pose, `#p1`, near `v18` at `q3` via trajectory `#t6`. The grasp will still be `#g1`.
           
           I must provide a continuous value for `#p1` as per problem instructions. Since the problem explicitly states `#p1` will be the location where the object is on `v18` which is known, and that the z coordinate will be the surface of `v18`. Given that the problem setup mentions an AABB bounding box for `v12`, its width is 0.097m. Its current pose has an z coordinate of 0.801 so `v12` is likely on another surface. `v18` has a known position. Given the z coordinate of the surface I can get the z coordinate of `v12` to be ~0.8 which aligns the center of the object to a height of the placement area. I have calculated the x, y values as (4.5, -0.3). Thus, a good value for `#p1` is (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0).
           
           This planned sequence will transition `v12` into a state that satisfies the goal. Each action has preconditions and effects that work towards the goal.
