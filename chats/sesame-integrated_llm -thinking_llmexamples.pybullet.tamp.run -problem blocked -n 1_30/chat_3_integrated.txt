           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.578, -0.008), (-4.481, 0.089)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.53, 0.04, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.281, 0.96).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.0, -0.471), (4.444, 0.366)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           First, I need to understand what `new-axiom@0()` actually means. It translates to needing both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The facts in the initial state give that `v17` is the type of `v12`, so `?green` must be `v12`. Now I'm focused on getting `on(v12, v18)`.  This, by the axiom, requires a pose `p` where `supported(v12, p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, p)` are both true.
           
           I see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is given as true in the initial state. So, if I can just achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)`, the goal is met!
           
           I've got `v12` starting at `v13` according to `atpose(v12, v13)`. This means I need to pick it from `v13` and place it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Examining the available actions and facts, I see `handempty(v4)` (the arm is free) and `atbconf(v3)` (the base is at configuration `v3`). There's an action `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` that seems like the right move, but the base needs to be at `#o3` (according to the `kin` relationship).
           
           Since I have to move to `#o3`, the plan will be:
           
           1.  **(Move Base):** Move the base from `v3` to `#o3` using `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The cost will be the distance between `v3` and `#o3`, and this is required to use pick.
           2.  **(Pick):** Then, use `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to get `v12` in the robot's hand, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` and update the base configuration. The cost is `1` because picking requires one action.
           3.  **(Place):** Finally, put `v12` at `#o2` using `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.  The cost is `1`.
           
           This should work! The constraints are satisfied, and it's a direct route.
           
           To be precise, I need to determine the continuous value of the pose `#o2`. I need to figure this out, which the system will consider given my response.  I know that `v12` needs to be placed on `v18`. The surface of `v18` is between x = 4.2 and 4.8, and y = -0.6 and 0.0. I'll need to calculate the value of z and x and y for the robot to place it correctly. I'll center it on that surface to be safe: x = 4.5, y = -0.3. Since I know `v12`'s initial position is `v13` and its at a z-coordinate of `0.801`, and there is a supporting surface at z=0.701, the object is .1 tall, so the pose `z` should be, around 0.8. So the full continuous value of `#o2` is **(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)**. Now that that's done, I have a complete plan!
