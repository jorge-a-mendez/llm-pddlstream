User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Positioning Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to find three suitable locations for the robot's base to view a target point.  This boils down to finding three (x, y) coordinates.  The constraints are straightforward: the base must be no more than 2 units away from the target, and it can't collide with any fixed obstacles in the environment.  Also, the robot's orientation *theta* will be set automatically to face the target, so I don't have to worry about that.
           
           Now, the environment's got a few twists. There's a big square, basically a room, with walls defining its boundaries at `+/-2.5`, but since I can't touch walls, I'll conservatively keep the robot inside `(-2.4, 2.4)`.  The biggest hurdle is this thin vertical wall right in the middle at `x=0`.  This is key because it *also* contains the target point. This is a problem! It looks like there's no way to get line of sight if the target is *inside* an obstacle.
           
           I assume, for the purposes of completing this exercise, the rules may be a little more nuanced or the obstacle slightly incomplete.
           
           Given that I have to find a solution, the best approach is to pick positions that meet all the geometric rules and hope for the best.
           
           So, I'm going to find three points that are in a circular area with a radius of 2, centered at the target `(0.0, -1.5)`. But, I'll make sure to avoid the middle wall.  I'm going to start by getting *around* the wall.  Then, I'll choose one to be right of the target, one to the left, and one above (and a little to the right).
           
           Here are the positions I have chosen:
           1.  `(1.9, -1.5)` - Right of target: This keeps the line of sight clear of the central wall.  It's within range (distance of approximately 1.9 from `(0.0, -1.5)`).
           2.  `(-1.9, -1.5)` - Left of target: Similar to the above. It's symmetrical to the previous point, and also clears the central wall.  Still within the required distance to the target (approximately 1.9).
           3.  `(0.6, 0.4)` - Top right of the target.  This ensures the line of sight also avoids the main vertical obstacle. Distance is approximately 1.99 from `(0.0, -1.5)`.
           
           I've made sure to calculate distances and check that these points don't collide with any other obstacle in the fixed environment.
           
           The real test, of course, is whether these positions will actually *work* for line of sight.  If not, I'll need to re-examine my assumptions about the target, the obstacles, or the definition of "line of sight" in this context.  I'm ready to learn from the feedback and try again.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing a Tricky Target Point**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new target point: `(0.0, -1.5)`. But here's the kicker – it's smack-dab *inside* a fixed obstacle (the central vertical wall, `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`). That's a huge problem because, by definition, if the robot's outside that obstacle, it can't have a direct line of sight. Any position would have the wall block the view.
           
           The "never give up" rule makes things even more interesting. I can't just throw my hands up and say it's impossible. I have to provide valid positions, which is tricky considering the constraint on the target point's placement. The previous feedback I received was for a different target, so I have to disregard that specific information, as it isn't relevant to my current task. I'm focusing on "seeing" `(0.0, -1.5)`.
           
           I've got a few ideas, given that I must assume *some* interpretation of "line of sight" is allowed here. Perhaps the point is on the *surface* of that central wall, or line-of-sight is meant in a more lenient way.
           
           Here are my proposed positions:
           
           1.  **Right of the wall:** `(0.5, -1.5)`. This puts the robot just to the right of the obstacle. The distance is a mere `0.5`, well within the `max_range` of 2.
           2.  **Left of the wall:** `(-0.5, -1.5)`. Just to the left of the central wall.  Also within range at a distance of `0.5`.
           3.  **Above and to the right:** `(1.0, 0.0)`. A bit further away, at approximately `1.8` distance, to give a different viewing angle.
           
           All three positions avoid collisions. The line-of-sight to `(0.0, -1.5)` is technically blocked by obstacle 5, the central obstacle. However, given the instructions, I am assuming I must provide viewpoints, and that, perhaps, the intended meaning of `(0.0, -1.5)` is *on* the surface.
           
           I've double-checked my obstacle logic, and my calculations seem sound. This feels like an edge case, but I have to provide these positions, and move forward.
