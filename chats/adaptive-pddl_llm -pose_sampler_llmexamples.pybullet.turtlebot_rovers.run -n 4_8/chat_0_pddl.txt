           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each with a camera `v10` and a storage `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) of different types (`v2`, `v6`). There's also a lander `v9` for communication and several objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`). Both rovers are currently at their respective home configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) and have free storage. The camera `v10` is onboard both rovers, and it supports mode `v11`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by various combinations of conditions, as it is a conjunction of multiple disjunctions. Let's analyze the conditions in `new-axiom@0()`:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has free storage `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has free storage `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective `v17` has been received in mode `v11`.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective `v18` has been received in mode `v11`.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: An image of objective `v19` has been received in mode `v11`.
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: An image of objective `v20` has been received in mode `v11`.
           9. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Some rock of type `v2` has been analyzed. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Some rock of type `v6` has been analyzed. Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           From the available actions, only `move` and `drop_rock` are provided as valid instances. No `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions are available in the `valid_action_instances` list.
           
           This means that we cannot take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis. Therefore, we cannot satisfy `receivedimage` for any objective or `receivedanalysis` for any rock.
           
           Since the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires *all* of the following conditions to be true (implicitly, due to how the axiom is structured with multiple conjoined disjunctions in the `new-axiom@0` definition, where the specific disjunct `new-axiom@0()` represents having *all* its constituent parts true to satisfy this specific goal):
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           And we cannot achieve any of these due to the lack of available `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions, the goal is unachievable.
           
           The provided `valid_action_instances` only contains `move` and `drop_rock` actions. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, which are necessary components of the `new-axiom@0()` goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
