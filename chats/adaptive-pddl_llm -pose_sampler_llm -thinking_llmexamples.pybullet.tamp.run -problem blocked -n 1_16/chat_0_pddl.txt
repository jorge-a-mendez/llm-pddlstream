           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 10 on surface 0. Object 10 is almost square (dimensions are very close), so I'll consider two orientations: 0 degrees and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians).  Surface 0 is a rectangle defined by its corners.  I'll start by calculating the valid placement area for each orientation, then generate a grid of placements.
           
           First, I determine the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x and y) based on the surface boundaries and the object's dimensions.  I've already calculated these, considering the object's half-size to ensure it stays within the surface.  Since the object's dimensions are almost equal, the valid ranges for the two orientations are very similar.
           
           Now, I'm setting up a 5x5 grid for each orientation (theta=0 and theta=pi/2), a total of 50. I will generate the x and y coordinates for each. Since the ranges for the x and y coordinates are small, a 5x5 grid should give enough distance between the placement locations to ensure no overlap. Then I will return a list containing (surf_idx, theta, x, y) for each of the 50 placements.
