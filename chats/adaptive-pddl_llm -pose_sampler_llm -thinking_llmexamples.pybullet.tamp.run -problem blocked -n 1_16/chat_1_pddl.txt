           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal in pr2-tamp**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I'm given the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain.  I started by breaking down what that goal means.  It boils down to having an object, which I'll call `?green`, be both "on" a specific object, `v18`, *and* have a particular "type", `v17`.  
           
           Looking at the initial state and axioms, I realized that the objects of type `v17` are `v8` and `v12`.  So, the simplest way to satisfy the goal is to get *either* `v8` or `v12` "on" `v18`. The definition of "on" is actually dependent on `supported` and `atpose` predicates.
           
           Now, checking the initial state, I see that both `v8` and `v12` are *not* currently on `v18`.  `v12` is on `v14` and `v8` is on `v11`. To change that, my only avenue is through `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           However, a closer examination reveals a critical problem.  The preconditions for picking an object involve a `kin` predicate which requires the base configuration to be `#o3`.  But, the *only* `move_base` action available in the environment is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This does *nothing* except incur a cost of zero and change `canmove()` to false, it does *not* provide any movement capabilities, nor allows the base to reach `#o3`. It just ensures canmove is false.
           
           The `kin` predicate dictates that I must be at the base configuration `#o3` to perform a pick. However, I am stuck at base configuration `v3`, which means I cannot perform any pick or place actions, because the required `kin` predicates will never be active. Since these are the only operators that can change the `on` predicate, and I can't reach the target location, this makes the goal *unachievable*.  I cannot manipulate the objects in the world given the constraints of the available actions, which boils down to not being able to move the robot base.
