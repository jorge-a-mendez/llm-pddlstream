User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.551), (0.155, -0.461)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.091, -0.29), (0.171, -0.21)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.202, -0.587), (-0.103, -0.488)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.11, -0.506, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.177, 0.984).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, 0.347), (-0.204, 0.431)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.131, -0.25, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.075, 0.997).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.152, -0.538, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.418, 0.908).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.245, 0.389, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.107, 0.994).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. My goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. I have to figure out how to do this, using the available facts and actions. I've got this robot arm (`v4`) with an empty hand, the ability to move its base (though it seems that might be a bit limited), and I need to use it to pick up these objects currently sitting on surface `v11` and place them onto `v18`. The key to success is this `kin` (kinematics) information, showing that the robot arm can reach and manipulate each object.
           
           Since I have these objects with `pose(obj, #o2)`, I need to specify for each object, their poses on `v18`, ensuring that I don't cause any collisions or unstable placements. I have an instance of base motion available which simply maintains the base state, and then the core actions are `pick` and `place`. It seems that my strategy is going to be a straightforward pick-and-place sequence: pick each object, move it, and put it on `v18`.
           
           **Action Details and Parameterization**
           
           I'm thinking I'll place these objects roughly in a grid pattern on `v18` with each object occupying its own, distinct pose. For this, I'm going to determine collision-free positions for placing each object on `v18`. I will pick positions such that each object has a clear location with no overlap. I'll make sure each position is collision-free. I also need to provide valid poses within the bounds of `v18`, such as with its center, to make sure I don't exceed the surface boundaries.
           
           I'll need to use arm `v4`. Each object's initial pose (i.e., v9 for v8, v13 for v12, v15 for v14, v17 for v16) is given. I'll use those for picking. For placing on surface `v18`, I need a placement `pose`, which will be a unique instance of `#o2` per object (`#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, etc.).
           
           **Plan Execution**
           
           With this plan, the steps are:
           1.  **Pick v8 from v9 and place at (#o2_v8)**. So `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)` and `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           2.  **Pick v12 from v13 and place at (#o2_v12)**. So `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)` and `place(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           3.  **Pick v14 from v15 and place at (#o2_v14)**. So `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)` and `place(v4, v14, #o2_v14, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           4.  **Pick v16 from v17 and place at (#o2_v16)**. So `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)` and `place(v4, v16, #o2_v16, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           **Key Assumptions and Considerations**
           
           *   I am assuming that the `move_base` action isn't strictly necessary for this problem to maintain a base configuration as `v3`. It only sets canmove() and atbconf(v3), which the pick/place actions also do.
           *   I will make the simplification that the grasp (#o1), the trajectory (#o4), and the base configuration (#o3) remain constant for all pick and place actions, simplifying the plan for clarity.
           
           This is my plan. I should be able to fulfill the goal if the object positions and placements are stable and collision-free.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v3 #o4)`.

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The user has given me a problem with a very specific constraint: I *must* use only the action instance `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` to reach the goal. The goal explicitly demands that objects be moved and placed, altering their `on` predicate status.  My expert knowledge tells me that this is a critical issue, considering the PDDL domain "pr2-tamp" that's in play.
           
           I immediately saw the problem. The *only* allowed action is `move_base`. It simply changes the robot's base configuration – that's all. It has absolutely no way to interact with objects in a manner that would affect their position or their `on` predicates. It's a dead end.
           
           I carefully re-evaluated all the information. I had facts about object poses and the robot's arm configuration. I saw the *kin* facts and that screams *pick* and *place* as viable actions. But, the user's instructions are crystal clear. I'm *only* allowed to use the given action.
           
           The goal? It's all about changing the `on` predicate. I need to move objects to satisfy it. That's simply impossible with only `move_base`.  I read the prompt a few times to make sure I wasn't missing anything. The "valid action instances" are the key constraint.
           
           The prompt states it explicitly: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of the provided action instance and the stated goal, a solution plan is simply *unreachable*. I need to explain the logical impasse to the user. There's no possible action sequence I can devise.
