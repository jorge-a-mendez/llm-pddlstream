User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, -0.551), (0.155, -0.461)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.091, -0.29), (0.171, -0.21)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.202, -0.587), (-0.103, -0.488)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.11, -0.506, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.177, 0.984).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, 0.347), (-0.204, 0.431)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.131, -0.25, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.075, 0.997).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.152, -0.538, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.418, 0.908).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.245, 0.389, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.107, 0.994).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to achieve the goal state: `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  This necessitates placing objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto object v18. The current state has these objects supported by v11.
           
           Based on the problem definition, the `on` predicate relies on `supported` and `atpose`.  Thus, to achieve the goal, I need to pick each object from v11, move it to a supported pose on v18, and place it there. From the facts, I see that these objects are currently at poses associated with v11.  Several supported predicates suggest potential poses on v18 (represented by `#o2`).
           
           Analyzing the available actions, the *only* action provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The prompt explicitly states that only actions in the given list are permissible.  This immediately raises a red flag: the actions needed to manipulate objects and achieve the goal (namely `pick` and `place`) are not present.
           
           The presence of the `graspable` predicate for the objects highlights that the required actions are `pick` and `place`. These actions involve changes to the `atpose` predicate of the objects. To achieve the goals, a `place` action is needed to place an object at a new pose and a `pick` action to move the object to the robot arm.
           
           The statement, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" makes it explicit that only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is available.  This means the goal is unreachable because no action can pick or place objects.  Since no other action instances are provided, I am unable to manipulate any object. Therefore, a plan to reach the goal state cannot be constructed with the given constraints.
