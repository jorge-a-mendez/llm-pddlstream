           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My initial thought is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking down the goal, I see it requires several conditions: `atconf` and `free` predicates are already satisfied in the initial state, while `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates need to be achieved.
           
           To satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates, I'd need to use a `send_image` action. Likewise, `receivedanalysis` requires a `send_analysis` action. However, the available actions are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`.  These actions can't generate the necessary `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, which is a major red flag.
           
           The system explicitly prohibits the use of any action not in the provided list. Since `send_image` and `send_analysis` are missing from the allowed actions, and these actions are crucial to achieving the goal, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* given the constraints.  The `move` actions are self-loops, and `drop_rock` can't be used since the rovers are initially empty. There is no way to perform image acquisition or analysis with the allowed actions. Therefore, I need to communicate that the goal cannot be accomplished within the provided framework and explain why.
