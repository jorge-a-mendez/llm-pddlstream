           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, which are currently on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects to `v16`. `v16` is a stackable surface for all three objects. However, there are no pick or place actions available in the provided action instances. Only `move_base` action is available, which means the robot can only move its base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action does not allow the robot to manipulate objects. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving the objects to `v16`. The goal requires the robot to pick and place objects, which are not allowed by the given action instances.
           
           The goal is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Currently, all three objects are on `v11`. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to perform pick and place operations for each object. However, the only available action instance is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action only moves the robot's base and does not allow for object manipulation. Therefore, the robot cannot pick up objects from `v11` and place them on `v16`. As a result, the goal is unreachable given the current set of available action instances.
