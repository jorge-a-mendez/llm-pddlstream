           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Achievement Plan: New Axiom Implementation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to several sub-goals: capturing and transmitting images from two rovers, obtaining two different rock analyses, and importantly, ensuring all necessary communication and analysis are received.
           
           The structure of the axiom is clear, and initial state checks confirm some conditions are already met (configuration and free status). The trick is generating and transmitting new data. The available facts guide the plan.  I'll need to calibrate the cameras, take pictures of objectives, send those images, analyze soil and a stone, and send those analyses. All of these require specific configuration conditions that initially appear continuous but are resolved to the rovers' current known locations.
           
           **Plan Construction**
           1.  **Image transmission:** I'll use `v12` to grab images of `v17`, `v19` and `v14` to get `v18`.  Each needs to be calibrated, the picture taken, and sent. The facts confirm that communication and image capture are possible with all rovers.
           2.  **Analysis and Transmission:** `v12` is tasked with analyzing and sending the rock `v1`. `v14` will analyze and transmit the soil `v5`. After each sampling, each rover needs to `drop_rock`. This crucial detail was missed initially.
           
           **Key Considerations**
           
           *   **Configuration Matching:** The continuous variables (#o3, #o0, #o5) must resolve to known configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14).  Otherwise, without a method to change position via `move` actions the problem is unsolvable.
           
           *   **Re-Calibration:** Each image capture requires calibration, and each sampling/analysis requires re-calibration with each rover
           
           *   **Free Status:** The `free` facts in the initial state are critical. I need to make them true. Hence the need for `drop_rock`.
           *   The `move` facts available are no-ops.
           
           Given all available facts and assumptions, this plan will successfully achieve `new-axiom@0()`

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 v15 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem's Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a problem where the provided valid actions are severely limited.  The actions I *can* use are either `move` to the same configuration, or `drop_rock`.  However, the `drop_rock` action is blocked because the rover's store isn't initially full, and the `move` action doesn't accomplish anything.
           
           Looking at the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, it's clear I need to acquire images (`receivedimage`), analyze samples (`receivedanalysis`), and eventually have the `drop_rock` action available.  But the actions I *need* – `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` – are *not* in the list of permitted actions.
           
           This is a serious roadblock. Without the ability to take, send, or analyze images, the image requirements are completely unattainable. The actions to make the store full, and then to analyze are unavailable too.  I can't even get to the preconditions for `drop_rock`!
           
           Therefore, based on this restricted action space and the goal state requirements, I must conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unreachable*. I need to explicitly state this. The current set of provided actions is insufficient.
