(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a given surface (Surface 0, defined by points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)). A "stable placement" means the object's bounding box fits entirely within the surface's bounding box. The object can also be rotated, which of course changes its bounding box dimensions.
           
           The first step is to figure out the maximum bounding box size the object can have when rotated.  Since it's a square, I know that when rotated, the bounding box will change its width and height based on the angle. The formula for the new width is: `w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))`, and for the new height is: `w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`. Given that both width and height are 0.07, these formulas simplify to 0.07 times the sum of the absolute values of cosine and sine of the rotation angle.  The maximum value of this sum is sqrt(2), which occurs at 45 degrees (pi/4). Therefore the maximum bounding box will be approximately 0.09899 x 0.09899.
           
           Now, let's analyze the surface. Surface 0 is a 0.6 x 0.6 square. Since the object's maximum dimensions (0.09899) are significantly smaller than the surface dimensions, I have plenty of space to place the object multiple times.
           
           I need to generate 50 unique placements (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).  I'll start by focusing on a rotation of 0 degrees and populate most of the placements in this way. I will use a simple grid-based approach.
           
           With a 0-degree rotation (theta=0), the new dimensions are 0.07 x 0.07. Then the acceptable ranges of x and y for stable placements can be calculated as [min_x + new_width/2, max_x - new_width/2] and [min_y + new_height/2, max_y - new_height/2]. In this specific case that will be [4.235, 4.765] and [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           Given these ranges, I can create a grid of 7x7 points within the valid ranges. Then I can generate the 49 points for `theta = 0`. With that, I would then have 1 placement. With 49 placements generated.
           
           For the final placement (the 50th), I will rotate the object at 45 degrees, and place the object at the calculated center of the surface, at x=4.5 and y=-0.3. This will increase diversity in the final set.

(Thoughts: **Object ID 10 Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for generating those 50 stable placements. I'm starting with a clean slate for object ID 10, ignoring any previous object placements unless specifically told otherwise. I've got the object's dimensions: essentially a square of ~0.0753 units per side. Surface 0 is a rectangle from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).
           
           First, I'll focus on the obvious: placing the object at 0 radians. I'll calculate the valid x and y ranges for the object's center, considering its size and the surface boundaries. Specifically, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the center of the square such that all sides are within the bounds of the rectangle, taking into consideration the rounded dimension. Then, I'll generate a 7x7 grid of placements within those ranges, giving me 49 placements at 0 radians.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll rotate the object by pi/4 radians (45 degrees). This will change the effective dimensions. I will recalculate the necessary adjustments and determine the valid x and y center ranges. I will position the object at the calculated center point for the rotation. I will use the *exact* dimensions and calculations with *no rounding*, because this will significantly impact the outcome, and I will be conservative with placement.
