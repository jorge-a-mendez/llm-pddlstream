           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` *on* `v18` and of a specific *type*. The "on" condition means the object must be supported *at a particular pose*, let's call it `?p`. I've identified potential candidates for `?green` as `v8` and `v12` because they are both of the correct type (`type(?green, v17)` is true).
           
           Examining the initial state, I see both `v8` and `v12` *are* supported by `v18` but crucially, neither is *at* the correct pose.  `v8` is at pose `v9`, and `v12` is at pose `v13`. To get either on `v18`, I need a `pick` and `place` sequence -  I would need to *move* one of them. The axioms I see that permit action in the given domain are of form: `[Predicate]` -> `[Preconditions]`, like `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` -> `Atom supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `Atom atpose(?o, ?p)`. But, here is where it gets tricky - this `pick` and `place` requires certain constraints.
           
           Now, here's the catch: the only action I'm *allowed* to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This seems like a red herring because this action only affects the `atbconf` predicate and doesn't directly manipulate the objects required to achieve the goal state!
           
           The key is that I *cannot* use the `pick` and `place` actions, which are necessary to reposition `v8` or `v12`. I am explicitly constrained to *only* the `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, given the initial configuration and the restricted action set, it's impossible to satisfy the goal. No object can be moved to the necessary pose on `v18`, so the goal is unachievable.
