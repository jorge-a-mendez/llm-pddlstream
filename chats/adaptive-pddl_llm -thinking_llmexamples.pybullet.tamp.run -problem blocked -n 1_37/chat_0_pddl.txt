User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)

           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Feasibility for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type, say `?green`, placed *on* another object, specifically `v18`. I immediately see two potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17` and stackable on `v18`. Either would work.
           
           Now, to get something *on* something else, the `on` axiom tells me I need to ensure it's both *supported* by and *atpose* the target object. Looking at the initial state, both `v8` and `v12` currently satisfy the type constraint.  I'm focusing on trying to achieve either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           For `v8`, it's currently at pose `v9` and supported by `v11`. To satisfy `on(v8, v18)`, I'd need it at pose `#o2` where it is also supported by `v18`.  Same logic applies for `v12`. I need to move them to `#o2`.
           
           However, here's where the snag hits. The only action instance available is `(move_base)`, which is entirely irrelevant. To manipulate the `atpose` predicate (which is essential for `on`), I need `pick` and `place` actions. Without these, I can't change the object's pose.
           
           The problem explicitly states that any action not in the provided list is forbidden. Given that constraint, I've got a problem. Since there are no `pick` and `place` instances, and `move_base` has no impact on `atpose`, I can't change the objects' positions.  Therefore, I'm forced to conclude that this goal, under these conditions, is simply *unachievable*.
