           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` condition, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the `new-axiom@0` axiom:
           
           `new-axiom@0()`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom atconf(v12, v13)`
               `Atom atconf(v14, v15)`
               `Atom free(v12, v16)`
               `Atom free(v14, v16)`
               `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)`
               `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)`
               `Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)`
               `Atom type(?stone, v2)`
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)`
               `Atom type(?soil, v6)`
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           
           So the first four conditions of the axiom are already met.
           
           The remaining conditions to achieve are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for all rocks of type `v2` (stone).
             - From the initial state, rocks of type `v2` are `v4`, `v3`, `v1`.
             - We need `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)`.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for all rocks of type `v6` (soil).
             - From the initial state, rocks of type `v6` are `v7`, `v8`, `v5`.
             - We need `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(objective, mode)`, the robot needs to `take_image` and then `send_image`. The `take_image` action requires the camera to be calibrated.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(rock)`, the robot needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           Let's analyze the available actions:
           `move` actions are available, but `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15` in the initial state. The only `move` actions available are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which means the rovers move from their current configuration to the same current configuration, essentially doing nothing. These actions don't change the robot's configuration and are not necessary unless they enable other actions. Given the initial state, the rovers are already in their desired positions for the `atconf` predicates.
           
           No `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions are provided in the list of available action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available.
           
           Since the goal requires sending images and analyzing rocks, and the initial state does not have any `haveimage` or `analyzed` facts, and the actions to achieve these (e.g., `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, `send_analysis`, `calibrate`) are not available in the given list of action instances, the goal is not achievable.
           
           The problem statement clearly indicates that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Therefore, without the ability to take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis, the goal cannot be reached.
