           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unattainable: A Critical Constraint**
           
           My analysis indicates that achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain is impossible given the current state and the provided action set. My thought process was systematic: I first dissected the goal, which hinges on several `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `type`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I observed that the initial state satisfies the `atconf` and `free` conditions but lacks the critical `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           To rectify this, I turned to the action schemas. My intent was to find a sequence of actions that would make these missing predicates true. Actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis` appeared promising, as they directly impact `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, respectively. I then assessed their preconditions, paying close attention to factors like `comvisible`, `objective`, and the rovers' current configurations.
           
           The crux of the problem emerged: the action instances I had available were limited and insufficient. The only permitted actions were trivial self-moves or the inapplicable `drop_rock` actions. Neither could modify the relevant predicates. I checked and double-checked the action instances and initial state, confirming my initial evaluation: There are no actions that can actually *achieve* the required state change. This is a severe constraint.
           
           Therefore, since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` which are not true and cannot be made true, and the goal also requires the achievement of the other preconditions, I'm forced to conclude that a feasible plan cannot be constructed.
