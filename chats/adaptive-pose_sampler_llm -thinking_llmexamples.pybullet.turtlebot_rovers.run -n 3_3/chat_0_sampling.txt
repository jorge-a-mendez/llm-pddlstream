(Thoughts: **Summary of my Approach to Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for finding three good base positions for the robot, keeping in mind the constraints:  The positions must be within 2 units of the target, and we need to avoid collisions with fixed obstacles while ensuring a clear line of sight to the target. I'll need to figure out where the target point is within the environment and use that to plan.
           
           First, I need to understand the environment and the obstacles within it. This includes the outer boundary (which is a square), a central vertical wall, and some smaller obstacles. Since I'm prioritizing the central vertical wall, I'll need to know which side of this wall the target lies.
           
           Next, I'll generate several candidate positions. I'll generate positions at different distances and angles from the target to get a variety of candidates and also prioritize that the base position is on the same side of the central wall as the target. I'll use a combination of points on circles around the target and random points for more coverage.
           
           Once I have candidates, I will filter them using several checks. I will need to make sure the positions are within the environment, are within range of the target, and do not collide with any obstacle (this will include the buffer of the robot's radius). I will also need to ensure that there is a clear line of sight to the target from each candidate. My current implementation of this should handle these factors robustly.
           
           Finally, I'll return the first three valid positions that meet all these criteria. The simulator will handle the final collision and line-of-sight check, but by using this method, I should be able to generate good candidate positions.
           
           Positions:
           (1.06, -0.06)
           (2.06, -1.56)
           (2.06, 1.44)

(Thoughts: **Refinement of Approach for Line-of-Sight and Obstacle Handling**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. Based on the previous feedback, I made a crucial error in assuming the target point. I was using `(2.06, -0.06)`, which led to my proposals being blocked by the central wall. The actual target point is now confirmed to be `(-1.87013, 1.88706)`.  The input I'm getting is a placeholder `{target_point}`, but I'm assuming that this is a repeat of the *previous* target point from the feedback.  This is a critical assumption I'm making.
           
           My main issue is that the target point now falls *inside* two obstacles, Obstacle 8 and Obstacle 21. This presents a problem. How can you have "line-of-sight" *to* a point that is *inside* an obstacle?  I'm interpreting "line of sight" to *mean* that the line segment from the robot base to the target point shouldn't intersect any obstacles *other* than the one containing the target itself. In this scenario, Obstacle 8 and 21 are *transparent* for the LOS calculation.
           
           To avoid collisions I'm expanding all obstacles by the robot's radius (0.1) and checking if the proposed base position falls *within* any of these expanded obstacles.
           
           Here's my updated strategy:
           
           1.  **Assume Target Point:**  I will use the confirmed target point `(-1.87013, 1.88706)`.
           2.  **Generate Candidate Positions:**  I'll generate a set of candidate base positions, primarily to the *left* of the central wall (x=0) and within a 2-unit range of the target point. This is based on where the target point is positioned.
           3.  **Collision Check:** I'll check each candidate base position for collisions with the *expanded* versions of the fixed obstacles.  Any collision gets immediately discarded.
           4.  **Line-of-Sight Check:** For all non-colliding positions, I will determine line-of-sight *to* the target. This entails checking if the line segment between the proposed base position and the target point intersects any of the obstacles *other* than Obstacles 8 or 21 (since those contain the target point).  The `line_intersects_aabb` function, which I improved, will be used.
           5.  **Target Selection:** I am aiming to find *three* valid positions that avoid collision and provide LOS.
           
           There's a serious caveat: the fact that the target point is *inside* the obstacles 8 and 21 makes finding solutions very challenging. I can only succeed if the problem interpretation, of a *target point inside obstacle*, is such that that obstacle is *transparent* (for LOS check only), and the robot cannot occupy that same space. If it's a strict interpretation, this problem could be considered *unsolvable*.
           
           I'll proceed under these assumptions, since the task asks me to provide answers and "you never give up!".

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, a new target point has been provided: `(0.62009495, 1.82262671)`. Let's dive in. The key issue here is that the target point is *inside* two obstacles, Obstacle 9 and Obstacle 20, which I've marked as critical in my previous interpretations. This means these obstacles are "transparent" for line-of-sight (LOS) checks for *this* target specifically. I'll need to remember that.
           
           My assumption of a robot radius, `R`, is essential to this analysis. Though not explicitly stated, I'll use `R = 0.1` as a default, common in these types of problems. However, my previous analysis of failures suggests I might need to consider a slightly larger `R` to ensure consistent collision detection and avoid edge cases.
           
           **Re-evaluating Fixed Obstacles and the Target's Location**
           
           I need to re-familiarize myself with the fixed obstacles, which I'll do by reviewing my notes.
           
           *   **Obstacle 9 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` and Obstacle 20 `((0.5717, 1.7742), (0.6685, 1.8710))`:** The target point, as mentioned, sits within these.
           *   The rest of the obstacles are the central wall, left wall, right wall, top and bottom, the bounding box of the environment and then the other smaller ones.
           *   **The Problem:** The robot has to stay outside of the bounding box and not collide.
           
           **Analyzing Previous Failures (Robot Radius and Collision Model)**
           
           I need to learn from the previous failures to be more accurate on the new assessment.
           
           *   My previous proposals, like `(-1.64, 1.88706362)`, collided with Obstacle 8 `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`. The provided feedback was just "collides with 0".
           *   `(-1.87013018, 1.64)` also collided with the same object. The analysis needs the standard AABB-distance from the center of the robot to an AABB collision test.
           *   I suspect the collision model uses a slightly larger radius, or considers robot base AABB collision.
           *   To be conservative, I will assume an `R_safe = 0.11` to prevent collisions on the boundaries of obstacles.
           
           **Developing a Strategy for the New Target**
           
           Here's the problem: The robot has to reach a point that is *inside* of obstacles, and stay within the environment bounds.
           This new target point, `(0.62009495, 1.82262671)`, is inside Obstacle 9 and Obstacle 20, which have been noted as "transparent". Also, it has to maintain LOS with the target.
           
           I need to propose positions for the robot that:
           
           1.  Stay within the environment bounds.
           2.  Maintain a distance of `<= 2` from the target.
           3.  Are to the right of the central wall `x>0.05 + 0.1` and not inside the target region.
           4.  Do not collide with obstacles or their expanded borders by `R_safe=0.11`.
           5.  Maintain LOS with the target (except for Obstacle 9 and Obstacle 20)
           
           I will consider 3 test candidates:
           1. `(0.62, 1.62)`
           2. `(0.9, 1.82)`
           3. `(0.62, 2.38)`
           
           **Candidate Positions and Rationale**
           
           I chose candidate positions around the target point, making sure to consider where obstacles are and ensuring LOS. I have calculated the following:
           *   **Candidate 1: (0.62, 1.62):** Has LOS to the target, is under the safe obstacle boundary, and has no collision problems. The y-value is slightly below the obstacles.
           *   **Candidate 2: (0.9, 1.82):** Has LOS to the target, has no collision issues as the x value is far enough past the obstacle boundaries.
