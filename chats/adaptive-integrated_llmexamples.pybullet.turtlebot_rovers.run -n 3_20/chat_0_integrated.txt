           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.001, -1.15), (-0.877, -1.026)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires us to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the `new-axiom@0()` definition:
           
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)

               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is a stone)
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is a stone)
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is a stone)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is soil)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is soil)
           
           The goal now is to achieve:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           4. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for at least one stone (e.g., v1, v3, or v4)
           5. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for at least one soil (e.g., v5, v7, or v8)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(objective, mode)`, we need to `send_image`. The `send_image` action requires `haveimage(rover, objective, mode)`, which is achieved by `take_image`, and `comvisible(rover, q, y, lander)`. The `take_image` action requires `calibrated(camera, rover)`. The `calibrate` action requires `imagevisible(rover, q, y, objective)`.
           
           Let's focus on one rover first, say `v14`.
           - **Calibrate camera for v14 and take image of v19 (objective):**
               - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` is true.
               - `onboard(v10, v14)` is true.
               - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
               - So, we can `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`. This sets `calibrated(v10, v14)` to true.
               - Then we can `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`. This sets `haveimage(v14, v19, v11)` to true and `calibrated(v10, v14)` to false.
           - **Calibrate camera for v14 and take image of v18 (objective):**
               - We need to calibrate again. `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true.
               - So, we can `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`. This sets `calibrated(v10, v14)` to true.
               - Then we can `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`. This sets `haveimage(v14, v18, v11)` to true and `calibrated(v10, v14)` to false.
           - **Calibrate camera for v14 and take image of v17 (objective):**
               - We need to calibrate again. `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` is true.
               - So, we can `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`. This sets `calibrated(v10, v14)` to true.
               - Then we can `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`. This sets `haveimage(v14, v17, v11)` to true and `calibrated(v10, v14)` to false.
           
           - **Send images from v14:**
               - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true.
               - We have `haveimage(v14, v19, v11)`, `haveimage(v14, v18, v11)`, `haveimage(v14, v17, v11)`.
               - So, we can `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`. This achieves `receivedimage(v19, v11)`.
               - Then `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`. This achieves `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
               - Then `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`. This achieves `receivedimage(v17, v11)`.
               All three `receivedimage` goals are satisfied.
           
           - **Sample and send analysis for a rock (stone) and soil:**
               - Let's use `v14` for sampling.
               - For a stone, we can pick `v4`. `above(v14, #o5, v4)` is true. `store(v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
               - So, `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`. This sets `full(v14, v16)` and `analyzed(v14, v4)`.
               - Then `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`. This achieves `receivedanalysis(v4)`. `v4` is `type(v4, v2)` (stone), so this satisfies `receivedanalysis(?stone)`.
               - To sample soil, `v14` needs to be `free(v14, v16)` again. So we need to `drop_rock(v14, v16)`.
               - For soil, we can pick `v7`. `above(v14, #o5, v7)` is true. `store(v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
               - So, `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)`. This sets `full(v14, v16)` and `analyzed(v14, v7)`.
               - Then `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`. This achieves `receivedanalysis(v7)`. `v7` is `type(v7, v6)` (soil), so this satisfies `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           This plan utilizes `v14` for all operations. The continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5` need to be specified. Note that `#o2` is for `move` action, which is not required since the initial `atconf` states for `v12` and `v14` are already desired states and the available move actions are self-moves.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible configuration for v14 to v9) and `#o1` (ray for comvisible), and `#o3` (imagevisible configuration for v14 to v19, v18, v17) and `#o4` (ray for imagevisible), and `#o5` (above configuration for v14 to v4, v7).
           
           Given the AABB of v14: ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)) and v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)), we need to find a collision-free configuration #o0 for v14 to see v9.
           Given the AABB of v14: ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)) and v19: ((1.87, 2.064), (1.967, 2.161)), v18: ((-0.674, 1.778), (-0.598, 1.854)), v17: ((0.518, 2.117), (0.615, 2.214)), we need to find a collision-free configuration #o3 for v14 to see v19, v18, v17. The objects v19, v18, v17 are quite far from v14.
           
           The problem statement implies that if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state and is used in `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, then we must provide a continuous value.
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, we need a value for `#o0`. Let's estimate one from the given AABBs. v14 is around x = -1.0, y = -1.75. v9 is around x = -1.9, y = -2.0. So, v14 is already quite close to v9. A configuration at or very close to its current configuration `v15` should work for communication. Let's use `v15` for `#o0` or a very slight variation. For the sake of providing a new value for `#o0`, let's choose a point close to `v15`.
           
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `v14` is around (-1.0, -1.75), and `v19` is around (1.9, 2.1). This is a significant distance (around 3-4 units). `imagerange` is max 2 units. This might be an issue. However, the problem statement provides `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` as true, so we have to assume a configuration `#o3` exists and satisfies the range and visibility.
           Similarly, for `v18` at (-0.6, 1.8) and `v17` at (0.5, 2.1), `v14` at (-1.0, -1.75). These are also large distances (around 3-4 units).
           
           Let's assume the continuous values exist for `#o3` such that `v14` can see `v17, v18, v19`, and for `#o0` such that `v14` can communicate with `v9`, and for `#o5` such that `v14` is above `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`.
           
           Given the objects and their AABBs:
           v14 (rover): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)), center approx (-1.0, -1.75)
           v9 (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)), center approx (-1.9, -2.0)
           v19 (objective): ((1.87, 2.064), (1.967, 2.161)), center approx (1.9, 2.1)
           v18 (objective): ((-0.674, 1.778), (-0.598, 1.854)), center approx (-0.6, 1.8)
           v17 (objective): ((0.518, 2.117), (0.615, 2.214)), center approx (0.55, 2.15)
           v4 (rock): ((-1.854, -1.3), (-1.748, -1.194)), center approx (-1.8, -1.25)
           v7 (rock): ((-1.473, 0.696), (-1.357, 0.811)), center approx (-1.4, 0.75)
           
           It's clear that the distances for `imagevisible` from `v14` to `v17`, `v18`, `v19` exceed the `imagerange` of 2. However, the initial state explicitly states `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, along with `imagerange(v14, #o3, v19)`, etc. This implies that such a configuration `#o3` must exist and allows the robot to see all three objectives. This seems to contradict the maximum distance of 2, but we must follow the initial state. The same reasoning applies to `comvisible`.
           
           We need a unique configuration for each (rover, target) pair if the plan needs it. However, the initial state uses `#o0` for all `comvisible` instances for `v14` and `v9`, and `#o3` for all `imagevisible` instances for `v14` and `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. Therefore, we only need to provide a single continuous value for each of these. Similarly, `#o5` is used for all `above` predicates.
           
           For `#o0` (v14 to v9), let's place v14 near v15, looking at v9.
           v14 is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). v9 is at approx (-1.9, -2.0).
           Let's choose a configuration for `#o0` as (-1.0, -1.75). Ray `v14` to `v9`: from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.9, -2.0).
           For `#o3` (v14 to v19, v18, v17). These targets are quite spread out. It is unlikely one configuration can provide line of sight to all of them. However, the problem statement says `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This implies such an #o3 exists and covers all three. This is a strong constraint, and we need to assume such a configuration is possible. Given that the problem does not provide full 3D information or obstacles other than what can be derived from the `blocked` axiom, we have to assume a configuration that is at the center of the rover's current bounding box for the target.
           Let's calculate average point for (v19, v18, v17):
           v19: (1.9, 2.1)
           v18: (-0.6, 1.8)
           v17: (0.55, 2.15)
           Average approx: ( (1.9 - 0.6 + 0.55)/3, (2.1 + 1.8 + 2.15)/3 ) = (1.85/3, 6.05/3) = (0.61, 2.01)
           This point is far from v14's current position (-1.0, -1.75). The current configuration `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Since the range is an issue, and no other configurations are given for `imagevisible`, we have to pick `#o3` at a location within `imagerange` from all objects. This is impossible given the current `v14` location and `imagerange(v14, #o3, v19)`. However, since the problem states the `imagevisible` predicates are true, we must assume that such an `#o3` exists and use it. I will pick a point that attempts to be central to all three, and close to v14, but this is a contradiction. The only way this makes sense is if `#o3` is a specific configuration that already exists and satisfies these, and we are not finding it ourselves. For now, I will assume it's valid and provide a value.
           
           For `#o5` (above, v14 to v4, v7), v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           v4 is at (-1.8, -1.25).
           v7 is at (-1.4, 0.75).
           Let's choose a configuration for `#o5` as (-1.0, -1.75) for simplicity and assuming the robot can manipulate its arm to be above the rock.
           
           The plan will use `v14` for all operations.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v4) , (sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16) , (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem statement explicitly lists the "valid action instances" that are allowed to be used. My previous plan used actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These actions are defined in the domain, but they are not present in the *list of valid action instances* provided for this specific problem.
           
           The provided list of valid action instances is:
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           This means that only `move` actions for rovers to their current positions (which are effectively no-ops unless they clear some internal state not visible in PDDL), and `drop_rock` actions are permitted.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the initial state with these severe constraints.
           
           Goal:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` (Already true in initial state)
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)` (Already true in initial state)
           3. `free(v12, v16)` (Already true in initial state)
           4. `free(v14, v16)` (Already true in initial state)
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v4)`)
           9. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v7)`)
           
           With only `move` (self-move) and `drop_rock` actions available:
           - We cannot take images (`take_image` is not available).
           - We cannot calibrate cameras (`calibrate` is not available).
           - We cannot send images (`send_image` is not available).
           - We cannot sample rocks (`sample_rock` is not available).
           - We cannot send analysis (`send_analysis` is not available).
           
           This means we cannot achieve `receivedimage(...)` or `receivedanalysis(...)` with the given valid actions, as these predicates can only be achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` respectively, which are not allowed.
           
           Since the initial state does not contain any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, and we have no actions to achieve them, the goal is unreachable.
