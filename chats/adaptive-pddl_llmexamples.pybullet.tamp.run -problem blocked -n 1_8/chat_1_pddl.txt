           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes a robot with two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and several graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v12` is currently at pose `v13` and is supported by `v14`. `v8` is at pose `v9` and is supported by `v11`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and is supported by `v11`. All three graspable objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`) can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`. The robot arm `v4` has kinematic information (`kin`) for picking and placing `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` at various poses and with various grasps. The robot is currently at base configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` simplifies to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. `v8` is currently supported on `v11`, and `v12` is currently supported on `v14`. To achieve the goal, either `v8` or `v12` needs to be placed on `v18`.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only changes the base configuration from `v3` to `v3` and makes the robot unable to move, then able to move again. It does not allow for picking or placing any objects. Since the goal requires moving an object to a new location, and the `move_base` action does not facilitate this, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires an object of `type v17` to be `on v18`. From the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of `type v17`. Currently, `v8` is `on v11` (supported by `v11` at `atpose v9`) and `v12` is `on v14` (supported by `v14` at `atpose v13`). To achieve the goal, we would need to pick up either `v8` or `v12` and then place it on `v18`. This would require `pick` and `place` actions. However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not allow for any manipulation of objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
