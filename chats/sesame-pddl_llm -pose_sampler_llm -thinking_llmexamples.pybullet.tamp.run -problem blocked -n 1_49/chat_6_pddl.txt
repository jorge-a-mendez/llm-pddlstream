(Thoughts: **The Planning Process: A Detailed Walkthrough**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with this goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`.  Let's break it down. It requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  Looking at the initial state, it's clear that `?green` must be `v12` since I have `type(v12, v17)`. That simplifies things. Now, my goal is `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The definition of `on` tells me I need `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  Again, from the initial state, I can see that the pose `?p` must be `#p2` because `supported(v12, #p2, v18)` is present. So, the real challenge is achieving `atpose(v12, #p2)`.  
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13`, according to the initial state.  Therefore, I need to *move* `v12` from `v13` to `#p2`.  The tools I have at my disposal are the `pick` and `place` actions.  The obvious strategy is to `pick` `v12` from `v13` and then `place` it at `#p2`.  Simple.
           
           Let's look at the `pick` actions available. There's one that seems perfect: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t9)`. It picks `v12` from its current pose `v13`. Great.  But, I need to make sure the preconditions are met.  These are crucial.
           
           I need: `kin`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(#q4)`, and some negated safety conditions `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v12, v13, #g2)` and `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#t9)`. The `kin`, `atpose`, and `handempty` conditions are all satisfied from the initial state.  But the base configuration (`atbconf`) is at `v3`, while the pick needs it at `#q4`.  I need a `move_base` action!
           
           Looking at my available `move_base` actions, `(move_base v3 #q4 #t10)` does exactly that.  It moves the base from `v3` to `#q4` using trajectory `#t10`.  That covers my first step.
           
           The move base action, `(move_base v3 #q4 #t10)`, has the preconditions: `basemotion(v3, #t10, #q4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and `canmove()`. All of these are satisfied, based on the initial state or the implicit knowledge. The effects will be `atbconf(#q4)`, `NegatedAtom atbconf(v3)`, and some `NegatedAtom canmove()`. Okay, step 1 is a go!
           
           Now, the `pick` action: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t9)` - time for that.  All its preconditions are now met because the move base action established the required base configuration. The effects will include that `v12` is at `grasp(v4, v12, #g2)` and `NegatedAtom atpose(v12, v13)` now is false.  I'm making progress.
           
           Now I need to `place` `v12` at `#p2`.  The perfect `place` action is `(place v4 v12 #p2 #g2 #q5 #t11)`. The preconditions here are `kin(v4, v12, #p2, #g2, #q5, #t11)`, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #g2)`, `atbconf(#q5)`, and some safety conditions. The `kin` and `atgrasp` (because of `pick` already happened) conditions are ok. The base configuration, `atbconf`, is currently at `#q4`, but this `place` needs `#q5`.  Another `move_base`!
           
           I scan the options and find `(move_base #q4 #q5 #t12)`, which is exactly what I need. This action has its own preconditions, but they're all met, because the base is at `#q
