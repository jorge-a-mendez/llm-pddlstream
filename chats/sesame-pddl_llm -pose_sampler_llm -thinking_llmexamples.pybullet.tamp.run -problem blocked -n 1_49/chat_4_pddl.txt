           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Block-Stacking Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having a specific object (`v12`) "on" another (`v18`) and be of a certain type (`v17`). Fortunately, the type is already established in the initial state. The core challenge is making `v12` be "on" `v18`. This means positioning `v12` in a way where it is supported by `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state reveals a crucial piece of information: there's already a pose for `v12` (pose `#o2`) where it is *supported* by `v18`. Bingo! That significantly simplifies things. The problem now boils down to moving `v12` to that particular pose `#o2`.
           
           Looking at available actions, it's clear I need a "pick" and "place" operation. However, there's a small catch. The initial state doesn't have the base in the correct configuration (`atbconf(#o3)`) needed for picking and placing. So, I need to add a `move_base` action.
           
           The plan emerges:
           
           1.  **Move the base**: I need to move the base from its current configuration (`v3`) to `#o3` using the `move_base` action. The preconditions for this are all satisfied in the initial state.
           2.  **Pick `v12`**: Using the "pick" action, I need to pick `v12` from its initial position (`v13`).
           3.  **Place `v12`**: Finally, using the "place" action, I place `v12` at the desired pose `#o2`.
           
           Once I've executed these steps, I will have achieved `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Since the initial state provides `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, I have met the criteria to satisfy my target `Atom on(v12, v18)`. With the given `type(v12, v17)`, the target `new-axiom@0()` is complete. I've walked through the preconditions, effects, and confirmed that they are met or achieved at each step. This plan seems solid.
