(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0.  First, "stable" means the object must be fully within the surface's bounds, which is an AABB defined by the points `(4.2, -0.6)` and `(4.8, 0.0)`. Object 5 has dimensions,  `size_x = 0.07000000000000028` and `size_y = 0.06999999999999995`.
           
           I need to calculate how far inside the surface boundary the center of the object can be, depending on its rotation, `theta`. The rotated effective bounding box halves, `hw_rot` (half-width) and `hh_rot` (half-height), are based on the original object's dimensions and `theta`:
           
           `hw_rot = hx * abs(cos(theta)) + hy * abs(sin(theta))`
           `hh_rot = hx * abs(sin(theta)) + hy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           where `hx` and `hy` are half the initial extents.
           
           Since `size_x` and `size_y` are slightly different, the object isn't *exactly* a square, even though it's close. I cannot directly use `0.07` to calculate the `effective_half_size`.  So, I had to compute `hx` and `hy` precisely.
           
           Surface 0 AABB: `min_x = 4.2`, `max_x = 4.8`, `min_y = -0.6`, `max_y = 0.0`.
           
           To create 50 diverse placements, I'll use two sets of 25 placements each, varying the `theta`:
           
           1.  **`theta = 0.0` radians (25 placements):**  This means the object is aligned with the axes. Here, `hw_rot` is just `hx` which is equal to `size_x / 2`. The same applies to `hh_rot = hy`. Thus,
               `x_range = [4.2 + hw_rot, 4.8 - hw_rot]`, and  `y_range = [-0.6 + hh_rot, 0.0 - hh_rot]`.
               I'll generate a 5x5 grid of object centers within these ranges, placing the centers at `(4.235000000000014 + i * 0.132499999999993, -0.56500000000000003 + j * 0.13250000000000001)` for `i,j=0...4`.
           
           2.  **`theta = pi/4` radians (25 placements):** This means the object is rotated 45 degrees. The values of `hw_rot` and `hh_rot` are equal and depend on both `size_x` and `size_y`, due to the rotation. The maximum effective object size, the value that minimizes the placement area, occurs in this configuration. Using trigonometry, I compute `hw_rot_pi4` and `hh_rot_pi4`. The valid center range then adjusts accordingly.
               `hw_rot_pi4 = hh_rot_pi4 = 0.070000000000000115 * math.sqrt(2) / 2`
               The valid `x` range is then `[4.2 + hw_rot_pi4, 4.8 - hw_rot_pi4]`, and the `y` range is `[-0.6 + hh_rot_pi4, 0.0 - hh_rot_pi4]`.
               I'll generate another 5x5 grid of object centers, this time, at `(4.249497474683058 + i * 0.125251265, -0.5505025253169417 + j * 0.125251265)` for `i,j=0...4`.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 10, Avoiding Collisions with Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object 10 on surface 0. Object 10's dimensions are pretty small, but the tricky part is avoiding collisions with object 5, which was successfully placed in the previous turn. Thankfully, the instructions only require me to avoid collisions *between* these two objects; I don't have to worry about other objects. Since this is a new placement for object 10, the successful placements from the previous turn are used as constraints.
           
           First, I need to figure out the exact safe areas for object 10. Object 5 has created 'occupied' areas on the surface. Object 10 has an equal horizontal and vertical dimension of 0.092, so any placement with 0 or 45 degrees of rotation must not overlap object 5. Calculating this is a bit involved, but I've got a strategy.
           
           I have already determined which placements were successful from the previous turn (with object 5) and have their exact positions and sizes.
           
           I'm going to follow the established strategy: generate placements at 0 and pi/4 radians (45 degrees) rotation angles. It's a proven method and should lead to the desired amount of stable placements. So, I need to calculate the safe ranges for object 10's center position on the surface, making sure it doesn't collide with the AABB of object 5.
           
           I've got the half-extents for object 10 (size divided by two) and the surface dimensions. Next, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center (x, y) based on its size and the surface. I also need to calculate the rotated dimensions at 45 degrees. The math is straightforward, but it's important to get it right.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting. I've got to check for collision with Object 5. I will create a grid of potential placements within the calculated ranges, both with 0 and 45 degrees rotation. For each of these grid points, I need to compute the object 10 AABB and check for any overlap with the object 5 AABBs. It is critical to calculate the x and y AABB correctly and that it is collision free. If there's an overlap, I discard that placement.
           
           The key to success here is to do this process efficiently. My analysis suggests that object 10 cannot fit between the individual objects, or columns of object 5. Object 10 cannot fit into object 5, nor within the gaps, but it *can* fit in an x-range which avoids both columns of object 5. The generated points must not overlap, otherwise the placement is invalid.
           
           I will iterate through all possible (x, y) pairs for object 10 to check them. I'll need to generate a dense grid in the x-range, to guarantee 50 non-colliding placements.
           
           The code generates the grid points, the collision, and will finally return valid placements.
           
           In short: Get the size of both objects and the surface. Calculate the AABB. Construct the AABB. Generate valid points. Check for any collisions. I am confident that following this process will provide the 50 placements.
