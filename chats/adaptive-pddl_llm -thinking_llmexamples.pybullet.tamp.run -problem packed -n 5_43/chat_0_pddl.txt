           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a new support surface (v20), all starting from their current position on surface v11.  The core of this task involves manipulating objects; specifically, picking them up from v11 and placing them onto v20.  The domain provides me with the standard `pick` and `place` actions that I would use in a classical planning scenario. These actions change `atpose` of objects, which is required to achieve the goal `on(v8,v20)`, `on(v12,v20)`, `on(v14,v20)`, `on(v16,v20)`, `on(v18,v20)`.
           
           My initial thought process involves a straightforward strategy for each object:
           1.  **Pick Up:** Identify the current pose on v11,  use a `pick` action to grasp each object.
           2.  **Move & Place:** Determine the target pose on v20 and employ a `place` action to release each object.
           
           To execute this plan, I'd need to consider the preconditions and effects of my actions: the `pick` action requires the robot to be in a valid configuration, the object to be at the correct pose on its support surface, and of course, a clear hand.  The `place` action, similarly, has preconditions on the robot's grasp and a valid target pose.
           
           However, the crucial piece of information is the *very* limited set of *permitted* actions. The task constraints are explicit: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  The only allowed action instance I was given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.   
           
           This single action is basically a no-op that just re-establishes the base at its current pose.  It has nothing to do with manipulating objects. It doesn't allow me to *pick* anything up from v11, or to *place* the object down on v20.   It just moves the base from v3 to v3 (effectively does nothing).
           
           Because the problem *requires* `pick` and `place` actions to achieve the desired goal *and* those action instances are explicitly *not* on the "allowed" list, it's clear the goal state is simply *unattainable*. I cannot build a valid plan using only the `move_base` action. There's no way to arrange the objects as requested with the provided set of valid actions.
