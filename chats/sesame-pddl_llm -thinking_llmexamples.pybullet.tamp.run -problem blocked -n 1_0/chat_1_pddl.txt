           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get an object, which we'll call `?green`, to be "on" something and have a specific "type."  The axiom `new-axiom@0()` essentially boils down to making `?green` *both* on `v18` and of type `v17`.  We know from the initial state that either `v8` or `v12` could be `?green` because they are both type `v17`.  Since it's simpler, and initial state gives us the option to manipulate `v8`, I'll start by making `v8` be `?green`.
           
           To make `v8` "on" `v18`, the initial state knowledge and the axiom for "on" indicate that it needs to be *supported* by and *at* a certain pose. The initial state already tells me that there are supported options available for all objects that fulfill our goal of getting something *on* v18. Since we have the support information `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`, we are almost there with the right support.
           
           The supported facts in the initial state also suggest that `v8` is initially supported but at the incorrect pose. The robot has to place the object `v8` to be on `v18` at the right pose, which is at `#p0`. Currently, `v8` is *at* another pose, which will have to be changed.
           
           Since the initial state already tells us where `v8` is, the robot can just change to its target pose `#p0`. Now, I need a sequence of actions that will first move the robot base, then pick `v8`, and then move the robot base again to place `v8` where it needs to be.
           
           The `place` action has these preconditions: `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)` (robotics knowledge to be present to manipulate an object to target); `atgrasp(?a, ?o, ?g)` (the object grasped); `atbconf(?q)` (robotics information); `NegatedAtom unsafepose(?o, ?p)` (no unsafe pose present); `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(?o, ?p, ?g)` (no unsafe approach present); and `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(?t)` (no unsafe trajectory present). To move and place objects, I need to check the following actions will satisfy my goal. `atbconf(?q)` (the base should be at `#q` for all robot motions).
           
           Here's the plan I formulated to achieve the goal:
           
           1.  **Move Base to `#q0`**:  The robot's base configuration is initially `v3`, but we need it at `#q0` to pick up `v8`. The initial state gives us `basemotion(v3, #t2, #q0)`, so we can use `move_base v3 #q0 #t2`. This relies on the action's effect to set baseconf and canmove() to the right state to enable `pick` and `place` later.
           2.  **Pick `v8` from pose `v9`**:  We have the necessary kinematics, `kin(v4, v8, v9, #g0, #q0, #t0)`.  The hand is empty (`handempty(v4)`) initially. We just assume no unsafe approaches (`~unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #g0)`) or unsafe trajectories (`~unsafeatraj(#t0)`. Using `pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0` and the previous move sets the right base config and canmove() states.
           3.  **Move Base to `#q1`**:  We'll use `move_base #q0 #q1 #o0` because our known basemotion gives us the ability.
           4.  **Place `v8` at `#p0`**:  Since we have `kin(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t1)` and have picked and moved the object and the robot, `place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t1` does this.
           This plan achieves the `on(v8, v18)` part of the goal. Since `type(v8, v17)` is already true in the initial state, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is met.
           
           I could have tried to achieve `on(v12, v18)`, but the plan for `v8` seems
