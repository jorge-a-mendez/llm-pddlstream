(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()` which, after examining the axiom definitions, boils down to achieving both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've delved into the initial state and object definitions, recognizing that `v17` is a type and `v18` is a receptacle.  There are two objects of type `v17` - `v8` and `v12`.  I see that both of them are stackable and supported by other objects.  My aim is to place one of them on `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the `on` predicate, I understand I need to find an object (`?green`, either `v8` or `v12`) and a pose (`?p`) where it is both supported by `v18` and currently located at a particular pose.
           
           Both `v8` and `v12` satisfy the `type` condition. I am going to choose `v8` as ?green. Initial State analysis tells me `v8` is currently supported by `v11` at `v9`. I see there is an available `pose(#o2)` and `supported` predicate between `v8` and `v18`.
           
           The task is to move `v8` from its current pose `v9` on `v11` to the desired pose `#o2` on `v18`.  I need to use my arm `v4` to do this.
           
           Based on the available actions, it looks like a three-step process:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I need to move the robot base from its initial configuration `v3` to a suitable configuration `#o3` (which I assume is near `v8` and `v18`), to execute the pick/place actions.  This is a `move_base` action, setting `canmove()` flag to `false`.
           2.  **Pick:** Using arm `v4`, I'll pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`. The pick action will set `canmove()` to `true` and remove `atpose(v8,v9)`.  Critically, this relies on the robot being at the correct base configuration and the arm being in a suitable initial state, which I will have established in the first step.
           3.  **Place:** Then, I'll place `v8` onto `v18` at the target pose `#o2`. The place action, like `pick`, sets the `canmove()` flag back to `true`, and sets `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           I must ensure the actions have their preconditions satisfied.
           
           I've carefully considered the `canmove()` predicate.  It is consumed by `move_base` and generated by `pick` and `place` actions, and the base movement is essential before pick/place.
           
           In general, the plan seems complete and sound, moving the base, picking the target object with the arm, and placing it at the correct final pose to achieve `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Given that only a single pick/place action is required, the plan seems to be the minimal cost, since it only involves one object.
           
           In the future I can consider the cost metrics, assuming cost functions are available.
