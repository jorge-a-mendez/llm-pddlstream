           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.299, -0.331), (-4.2, -0.232)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, -0.282, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, -0.373).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           The goal is to ensure an object of type `v17` is on `v18`. After reviewing the axioms, the simplest path involves placing either object `v8` or `v12` (both of type `v17`) onto surface `v18`. Since `v8` is currently supported on surface `v11` and within reach, I will attempt this option.
           
           I will formulate the plan as follows:
           1.  **Move the robot base:** Execute `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to position the robot (base `v3` at (2.5, 0, 0)) to a reachable base configuration `#o3` (I will define this to be (4.0, 0, 0)).  This ensures the robot arm can reach both `v9` where `v8` is located (at (4.5, 0.3, 0.8)) and the target surface `v18` with bounding box ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           2.  **Pick object:**  Use the command `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` to pick `v8` from its current position `v9` (on `v11`).  Here, `#o1` represents the grasp, `#o3` the suitable base config, and `#o4` the trajectory; these values are derived from the initial state's `kin` predicates, which I assume are valid based on the action parameters.
           3.  **Place object:** Employ the `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` command. This places `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v18`.  `#o2` is defined as (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 1) and ensures `v8` is placed appropriately on `v18`.  The `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4` parameters continue to represent the grasping, base, and trajectory components that are valid for this action from the `kin` statements.
           
           This plan uses the action instances and object descriptions provided to achieve the goal and respects the problem's constraints. The total cost is the distance for `move_base` plus `pickcost()` plus `placecost()`. It seems a minimal and logical solution.

User:      Pose (#o3): (4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0) is not in the correct format. Please provide each pose in the format `(<pose_name> <object_name> <surface_name>): (<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Pose #o2 = (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0) for object v8 on surface v18 is not in the correct format. Please provided poses in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **My Revised Understanding of the Plan and Pose Formatting**
           
           Okay, so I've re-evaluated the instructions and the user's feedback. I now understand that the plan is correct, but the pose formatting needs to be adjusted, and the role of the base configuration `#o3` needs clarification. Let me break it down:
           
           *   **Base Configurations:**  The user is correct in pointing out that `#o3` is a *base configuration* (bconf), not an object pose. Base configurations only have x, y, and yaw (theta). They *don't* have a `z` value because they don't represent the position of an object on a surface. Because of this, `#o3` should *not* be listed in the `--Poses--:` section. The plan is the same, just clarifying that `#o3` does *not* require a pose in the format, as it is a base configuration.
           
           *   **Object Pose Format:** The user wants poses in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`. The previous output included a full quaternion, but the user is only requesting the yaw angle.  The goal is to keep things simple for the problem. So, when providing poses, I'll provide an *x, y, z, theta* format with the theta in radians. The user wants the theta in radians, specifically.
           
           *   **Example Correction for Object #o2:**  Object `v8` should be placed with y = -0.3. This means that a good place to put this object is at `(#o2 v8 v18): (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`.
           
           *   **Summary of Plan:** The overall plan is sound.
               1.  Move the base from `v3` to base configuration `#o3` (no poses needed as discussed above).
               2.  Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
               3.  Place `v8` at a *new* pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           So, the key change is in the representation of *poses*, and making it clear that `#o3` is a base configuration and *not* a pose.
