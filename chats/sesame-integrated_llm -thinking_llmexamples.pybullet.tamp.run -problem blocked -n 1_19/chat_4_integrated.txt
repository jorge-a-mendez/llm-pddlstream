           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.299, -0.331), (-4.2, -0.232)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, -0.282, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, -0.373).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.  We already know `type(v12, v17)` is true from the initial state, so our primary focus is getting `v12` onto `v18`.  This leads to the sub-goal of achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The `on` axiom tells me that to get `on(v12, v18)`, I need to find a pose `?p` where both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true.  Fortunately, the initial state gives me `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`. This means that to satisfy `on(v12, v18)`, the main task is now to achieve `atpose(v12, #p1)`. Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           My plan is, therefore, to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` to pose `#p1` on `v18`.  To do this, I need to get the robot arm to pick up `v12`, move it, and then place it at the desired location. This involves a sequence of actions:
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I need to move the robot base from its initial configuration `v3` to a suitable pick configuration `#q2`.
           2.  **Pick `v12`:** Using the arm `v4`, I need to execute `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t4)`, which picks `v12` from its current pose `v13` at the correct base configuration `#q2`.
           3.  **Move the robot base (again):** After picking, I need to move the robot base from `#q2` to a place configuration `#q3` to align with the target pose.
           4.  **Place `v12`:** Finally, I'll use the arm `v4` to execute `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t6)`, placing `v12` at the target pose `#p1`.
           
           I've carefully checked all the preconditions for each action, particularly the `kin` and `atpose` states. I'm assuming that no collisions will occur since it's not described that they can and none that are specifically described have the same poses.
           
           I've also verified that the necessary trajectories exist and the robot can actually perform each of these movements (using `basemotion` and `kin`). Safety is assured by assuming the trajectories are safe and that no objects that would cause collisions are present (or their presence is unknown).
           
           The specific pose `#p1` will be calculated to lie above the surface of `v18`, with coordinates (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) which is well clear of other objects.
           
           Therefore, the plan should succeed.
