           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.299, -0.331), (-4.2, -0.232)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, -0.282, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, -0.373).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Core Strategy: A Detailed Plan to Achieve a New Axiom**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the goal: `(new-axiom@0)`. This boils down to ensuring that both `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)` are true. The second part is simple: the initial state gives us `(type v12 v17)`, meaning `v12` is the right type. Therefore, my focus is now to make sure that `(on v12 v18)` holds true.
           
           The crucial predicate for this is `on(?o, ?r)`, which translates to: `(supported(?o, ?p, ?r) AND atpose(?o, ?p))`. I already know `(supported v12 #o2 v18)`. This reduces my objective to achieving `(atpose v12 #o2)`, in other words, to put `v12` at pose `#o2`. To do this, I must first see which pose is `v12` at currently, which is `v13`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`. I observe the available actions in the domain model and discover that to achieve this, I will need to pick it up and place it on surface `v18`.
           
           Here's the planned procedure:
           
           1.  **Move Base** - First, I need to move the robot's base to a strategic base configuration, labeled `#o3`, which will allow the robot's arm to reach both `v13` (current pose) and `#o2` (target pose). This action is represented as `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. My goal is that a single configuration will suffice.
           
           2.  **Pick Up** - Once at `#o3`, I'll use the `pick` action `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to grasp `v12` from its initial pose, using arm `v4`. The pick action has specific requirements to run, I need to check the preconditions, which can be summarized:
               *   **Reachability** - It has to be that `#o3` is a base configuration that the arm is able to reach all the way there.
               *   **Pose Check** - The robot base has to be in the base configuration `#o3` and that the robot hand should be empty.
           
           3.  **Place** - Finally, the `place` action `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` will be performed. Again, all of its preconditions must be true, which are the same, except for:
               *   The arm now has to grasp `v12`
               *   The robot must be at configuration `#o3`
           
           Once I have ensured that these preconditions are met, I can successfully execute the plan!
           
           I'll finalize the plan by specifying the necessary continuous values. I must determine the position of `#o2`, which will be a pose for `v12` on surface `v18`. I will choose the following values for `#o2` = `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           A key challenge I anticipated was defining the value of `#o3`. To reach both pick and place locations, I will use my base configuration to reach both positions. The given `kin` facts suggest that it is a valid state of reachability.
