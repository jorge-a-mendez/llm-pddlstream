           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.299, -0.331), (-4.2, -0.232)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, -0.282, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, -0.373).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Generation and Pose Determination**
           
           My goal is to achieve the new axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which requires placing an object of type `v17` (let's call it `v8` for now) onto a specific surface, `v18`. From the initial state, I know `v8` is of type `v17` and that I have the flexibility to select one of several objects.  I've chosen `v8` as my focus.
           
           To achieve this, I need to find a way to make `on(v8, v18)` true.  This hinges on making both `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` (that `v8` is supported by `v18`) and `atpose(v8, ?p)` (that `v8` is at a valid pose, `?p`) true.  I can see that `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` is true in the initial state, where `#p0` is a specific pose. Therefore, the essential step is to make `v8` be at that pose, `#p0`.
           
           To achieve `atpose(v8, #p0)`, I formulate a plan that involves picking the object and placing it. This is composed of 4 main actions: 1. Move base, 2. Pick, 3. Move base, and 4. Place.
           
           1.  **Move Base to Pick:** Move my base to position `#q0` where I can pick up `v8`.
           2.  **Pick `v8`:** The action `pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0` to pick up `v8` using gripper `v4` from its current pose `v9` and base pose `#q0`. The actions are successful and `handempty(v4)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` are false.
           3.  **Move Base to Place:** Move the base from `#q0` to `#q1`.
           4.  **Place `v8`:** The action `place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2`, place the object at pose `#p0` and at grasp `#g0`, at base conf. `#q1`.
           
           With the action `place`, the object will be at pose `#p0`. And because `supported` is true, the goal is achieved.
           
           **Continuous Value for Pose #p0:**
           
           Now, I need to specify a continuous value for `#p0`.  Given that the problem has an object (`v8`) defined with an AABB `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))` in the world frame and I'm asked to satisfy the initial state with a valid, stable, and collision-free pose.
           
           I know that `v18` is a sink and will be the surface. I will choose a pose for `#p0` that is stable and collision-free. I can also observe `v11` has the same X and Y region as the sink, but a larger Y region. I assume the height is 0.8 in the initial pose of the object. Also, I assume the sink region is at z coordinate of 0.7, so the `z` location of the object after the pick is  0.8, meaning the surface the object lies on must be smaller, that it is the smaller Y region within v11 which is v18.
           
           Here is the AABB of v18: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Therefore, I define the pose `#p0` as the center of the sink,  with a pose of `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           This pose will result in a collision-free placement. This, if followed through, results in a plan to put the object on the sink and the achievement of the overall new axiom requirement.
