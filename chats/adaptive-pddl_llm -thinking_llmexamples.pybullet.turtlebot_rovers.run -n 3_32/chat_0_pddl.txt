           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the situation. I'm aiming to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, but this boils down to: getting images from objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` (using mode `v11`), and receiving analyses of stone and soil.  Crucially, the initial state doesn't have these images or analyses.
           
           My initial thought was to break it down. To receive an image (`receivedimage`), I'd need to send one (`send_image`).  `send_image` relies on having taken an image (`take_image`). `take_image` in turn needs the camera calibrated (`calibrated`) and to *actually* have taken an image (`haveimage`). These actions require a specific configuration, which requires `imagevisible` and `atconf` to match. The same logic follows for obtaining `receivedanalysis` via `send_analysis`, which requires taking a sample, etc.
           
           Now, my initial check revealed a *potential* problem: both rovers (`v12`, `v14`) *could* see the objectives to image, but they'd need to be at configuration `#o3` to do so. However, *neither* rover can move to `#o3` with the only given move actions staying put.
           
           But then I took a *very* close look at the allowed action instances, and this is the crux of the issue. The *only* allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, no `send_analysis`.  That means, I'm completely *stymied* right at the outset. I need those missing actions to get the images and analyses I require. Even if the preconditions *could* be met, I *can't* actually perform the actions!
           
           Since I *cannot* use actions outside of the allowed list, achieving the desired goal is *impossible*.  There are no other initial conditions that change things.
