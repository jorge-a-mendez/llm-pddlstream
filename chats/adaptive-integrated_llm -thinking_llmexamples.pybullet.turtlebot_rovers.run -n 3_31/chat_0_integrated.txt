           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unattainable: Restricted Mobility Prevents Image and Analysis Processing**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unattainable.  The crux of the problem lies in the limited mobility of the rovers, `v12` and `v14`.  They are initially at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the *only* permissible movement actions are identity moves: `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. This effectively locks them in their starting positions.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To fulfill these, the rovers need to take images, analyze samples, and then transmit the results. However, taking images and sampling rocks require the rovers to be at specific configurations: `#o3` for imaging, and `#o5` for sampling, as indicated by the initial state facts for `imagevisible` and `above` predicates. Likewise `comvisible` indicates a configuration `#o0` for communication.  Since no actions exist to move the rovers *to* these necessary configurations, the preconditions for actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` can never be satisfied.  The provided actions simply lack the capability to transition the rovers from their initial states to the required configurations.
           
           In conclusion, the restricted movement capability severely restricts the rovers' ability to interact with the environment for observation and sampling, rendering the target axiom unreachable under the given action constraints.
