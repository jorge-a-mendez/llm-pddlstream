           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom with multiple conditions. Let's break down the conditions from the axiom definition:
           
           `Atom atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           `Atom atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           `Atom free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           `Atom free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This needs to be achieved. Rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 and send it.
           `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This needs to be achieved. Rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 and send it.
           `Atom type(?stone, v2)`: This indicates that an object of type `v2` should be analyzed and received. Objects v1, v3, and v4 are of type v2 (stone).
           `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means one of the objects of type v2 (v1, v3, or v4) needs to be analyzed and its analysis sent.
           `Atom type(?soil, v6)`: This indicates that an object of type `v6` should be analyzed and received. Objects v7, v8, and v5 are of type v6 (soil).
           `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means one of the objects of type v6 (v7, v8, or v5) needs to be analyzed and its analysis sent.
           
           Let's plan to achieve the `receivedimage` goals first using rover v14, then the `receivedanalysis` goals.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           1. Rover v14 needs to be at a configuration where it can image v17 and v18. `conf(v14, #o3)` is a suitable configuration given the `imagevisible` and `imagerange` predicates.
           2. It needs to calibrate its camera `v10`.
           3. It can then `take_image` of `v17` and `v18`.
           4. After taking the images, it needs to be at a configuration where it can communicate with the lander `v9`. `conf(v14, #o0)` is a suitable configuration given the `comvisible` and `comrange` predicates.
           5. Finally, it can `send_image` for both `v17` and `v18`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           We need to analyze one rock of type `v2` and one rock of type `v6`. Let's pick `v1` (type v2) and `v7` (type v6) for analysis using rover v12.
           1. Rover v12 needs to be at a configuration where it can sample rocks. `conf(v12, #o5)` is a suitable configuration given the `above` predicate.
           2. `sample_rock` for `v1` using `v16` store.
           3. `sample_rock` for `v7` using `v16` store.
           4. Then, rover v12 needs to be at a configuration where it can communicate with the lander `v9`. `conf(v12, #o0)` is a suitable configuration.
           5. Finally, it can `send_analysis` for both `v1` and `v7`.
           
           Combining these steps:
           
           Rover v14 will handle imaging and sending images.
           Rover v12 will handle sampling and sending analysis.
           
           Since both rovers are initially at their base configurations (v14 at v15, v12 at v13), they can start by moving to their respective task configurations.
           
           Rover v14 will move to #o3 to take images, then to #o0 to send images.
           Rover v12 will move to #o5 to sample rocks, then to #o0 to send analysis.
           
           The AABBs for the rovers and objects allow for the specified configurations to be collision-free and for rays to be clear.
           For example, rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) (v13). Object v5 is at ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06)). A configuration #o5 that places rover v12 above v5 would be around (0.45, -1.1).
           Object v7 is at ((-0.802, -0.611), (-0.662, -0.471)).
           Object v1 is at ((0.856, 1.351), (0.937, 1.433)).
           Rover v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0) (v15).
           Object v17 is at ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969)).
           Object v18 is at ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083)).
           Lander v9 is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           
           The plan should be:
           1. Rover v14 moves to #o3.
           2. Rover v14 calibrates.
           3. Rover v14 takes image of v17.
           4. Rover v14 takes image of v18.
           5. Rover v14 moves to #o0.
           6. Rover v14 sends image of v17.
           7. Rover v14 sends image of v18.
           8. Rover v12 moves to #o5.
           9. Rover v12 samples v1.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires fulfilling several conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This involves a rover taking an image of objective `v17` and sending it to the lander.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This involves a rover taking an image of objective `v18` and sending it to the lander.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means sampling a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`) and sending its analysis.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means sampling a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`) and sending its analysis.
           
           Let's assign tasks to the rovers:
           - **Rover v14** will handle `receivedimage` tasks.
           - **Rover v12** will handle `receivedanalysis` tasks.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial position v15 = (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           1. **Move to a configuration (`#o3`) to image `v17` and `v18`**:
              - `v17` AABB: ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969)). A good viewing pose for v14 (from its side of the scene) might be around (1.8, 1.7).
              - `v18` AABB: ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083)). A good viewing pose for v14 might be around (-2.0, 1.7).
              - Since a single #o3 configuration is provided for both v17 and v18, we need to pick a position that allows viewing of both. This implies either a position that allows viewing of both, or the use of two distinct #o3 configurations, one for each. The problem setup provides `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, implying that #o3 is one configuration that allows seeing both. Given the wide range, a central location might be effective, but let's assume separate configurations are implied by the instruction "provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". I will use the #o3 that allows v14 to see v17, and then the #o3 that allows v14 to see v18 as different #o3 values.
              - For `v17` (at (1.8, 1.9)), v14 can be at (1.8, 1.7) (within 2 units and with a clear ray).
              - For `v18` (at (-2.0, 2.0)), v14 can be at (-2.0, 1.8) (within 2 units and with a clear ray).
              - The initial configuration is `conf(v14, #o3)` where #o3 is able to see both. If only one #o3 is available, it might be difficult. Let's assume #o3 is specific to each imaging task.
           2. **Calibrate `v10`**.
           3. **Take images of `v17` and `v18`**.
           4. **Move to a configuration (`#o0`) to communicate with `v9`**:
              - `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Lander is around (-1.9, -2.0).
              - v14 (at (-1.0, -1.75)). A good communication pose for v14 might be around (-1.9, -1.9) (within 4 units and with a clear ray).
           5. **Send images of `v17` and `v18`**.
           
           **Rover v12 (initial position v13 = (1.0, -1.75))**:
           1. **Move to a configuration (`#o5`) to sample rocks**:
              - Let's choose `v1` (rock of type `v2`) and `v7` (rock of type `v6`).
              - `v1` AABB: ((0.856, 1.351), (0.937, 1.433)). Rover v12 can be at (0.9, 1.4).
              - `v7` AABB: ((-0.802, -0.611), (-0.662, -0.471)). Rover v12 can be at (-0.7, -0.5).
              - Similar to imaging, a single #o5 is given. This suggests that the #o5 configuration should be chosen to be above both. This is difficult given their disparate locations. I will use the interpretation that #o5 is specific to each sampling task, as per the "each (rover, target object) pair" instruction.
              - For `v1` (at (0.9, 1.4)), v12 can be at (0.9, 1.4).
              - For `v7` (at (-0.7, -0.5)), v12 can be at (-0.7, -0.5).
           2. **Sample `v1` and `v7`**.
           3. **Move to a configuration (`#o0`) to communicate with `v9`**:
              - `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Lander is around (-1.9, -2.0).
              - v12 (at (1.0, -1.75)). A good communication pose for v12 might be around (-1.9, -1.9) (within 4 units and with a clear ray).
           4. **Send analysis of `v1` and `v7`**.
           
           Let's ensure we use distinct #o<number> for each unique (rover, target) pair. Since there are multiple instances of #o3, #o0, and #o5 in the initial state, I'll refer to them specifically for each task if possible, or create new ones if necessary based on the problem statement "If your plan uses some object #<name>... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". Given that the initial state already lists `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o3)` etc., it implies these configurations exist and can be used. I will assume the provided #o<number> values are unique instances for the specific purposes listed in the initial state predicates.
           
           Let's refine the plan based on the available actions. There are specific `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for #o3 and #o0 and `above` predicates for #o5. The problem states that `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` etc. means that #o3 is a valid configuration for rover v14 to image v17 and v18. Similarly for #o0 for communication and #o5 for sampling.
           
           Thus, we don't need distinct #o3 for v17 and v18, just one #o3 that can see both. Same for #o5 and #o0.
           
           Revised plan:
           1. Rover v14 moves to `#o3` to image `v17` and `v18`.
           2. Rover v14 calibrates.
           3. Rover v14 takes images of `v17` and `v18`.
           4. Rover v14 moves to `#o0` to send images.
           5. Rover v14 sends images of `v17` and `v18`.
           6. Rover v12 moves to `#o5` to sample `v1` and `v7`.
           7. Rover v12 samples `v1` and `v7`.
           8. Rover v12 moves to `#o0` to send analysis.
           9. Rover v12 sends analysis of `v1` and `v7`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` which comprises several conditions, including reaching specific configurations, sending images, and sending analysis of different rock types.
           
           Let's break down the required conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Rover needs to take an image of `v17` and send it.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Rover needs to take an image of `v18` and send it.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone, e.g., `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) needs to be analyzed and its analysis sent.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil, e.g., `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) needs to be analyzed and its analysis sent.
           
           I will use Rover `v14` for image-related tasks and Rover `v12` for analysis-related tasks.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           1.  **Move to `#o3`** to image objectives `v17` and `v18`.
               *   `v17` (objective): AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969)). A suitable configuration for v14 to image v17 could be (1.80, 1.70).
               *   `v18` (objective): AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083)). A suitable configuration for v14 to image v18 could be (-2.00, 1.80).
               *   The problem statement implies that `#o3` is a single configuration for the `imagevisible` predicates. Given the geometry of `v17` and `v18`, they are on opposite sides and far from `v14`'s starting position. It's unlikely that a single `#o3` allows viewing both. However, the available action instances like `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)` and `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)` suggest that `#o3` is a valid configuration for imaging both (possibly by re-orienting the camera, which is not explicitly modeled beyond `calibrated`). Given the instruction to provide a *different continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair*, I will interpret `#o3` in these image-related actions as distinct positions even if they share the same name in the PDDL initial state.
           2.  **Calibrate** camera `v10` for `v17`.
           3.  **Take image** of `v17`.
           4.  **Calibrate** camera `v10` for `v18` (since taking an image uncalibrates the camera).
           5.  **Take image** of `v18`.
           6.  **Move to `#o0`** to communicate with lander `v9`.
               *   `v9` (lander): AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A suitable configuration for v14 to communicate with v9 could be (-1.90, -1.90).
           7.  **Send image** of `v17`.
           8.  **Send image** of `v18`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           1.  **Move to `#o5`** to sample rocks.
               *   Let's pick `v1` (rock, type `v2`) and `v7` (rock, type `v6`).
               *   `v1` (rock): AABB ((0.856, 1.351), (0.937, 1.433)). A suitable configuration for v12 to be above v1 could be (0.90, 1.40).
               *   `v7` (rock): AABB ((-0.802, -0.611), (-0.662, -0.471)). A suitable configuration for v12 to be above v7 could be (-0.70, -0.50).
               *   Similar to `#o3`, I will interpret `#o5` as distinct positions for each sampling task.
           2.  **Sample rock `v1`**.
           3.  **Sample rock `v7`**.
           4.  **Move to `#o0`** to communicate with lander `v9`.
               *   `v9` (lander): AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A suitable configuration for v12 to communicate with v9 could be (-1.90, -1.90).
           5.  **Send analysis** of `v1`.
           6.  **Send analysis** of `v7`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, which requires taking and sending images of `v17` and `v18`, and sampling and sending analysis of a 'stone' rock (`v1`, `v3`, or `v4`) and a 'soil' rock (`v5`, `v7`, or `v8`).
           
           I will re-evaluate the configurations based on the collision and reachability feedback.
           
           **Collision Avoidance and Reachability:**
           
           *   **Rover v14 (starts at v15 = (-1.0, -1.75))**
               *   **Imaging `v17` (AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969))):** The previous config (1.80, 1.70) collided with `v19` (AABB((1.75, 1.75, 0.0), (2.25, 2.25, 0.1))). `v19` is directly in front of `v17`. A new configuration for `v14` needs to be found that allows a view of `v17` but avoids `v19`. Let's try to view `v17` from further back or a slightly different angle. A position like (1.60, 1.70) could be suitable, allowing the rover to be close enough (within 2 units) while avoiding the collision and having a clear ray.
               *   **Imaging `v18` (AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083))):** The previous config (-2.00, 1.80) collided with `v20` (AABB((-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), (-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))). Similar to `v17`, `v20` is in the way. Let's try to view `v18` from (-1.80, 1.80). This should be within range and clear.
               *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.90) collided with `v9` itself. This means the rover was trying to occupy the same space as the lander. The rover needs to be *near* the lander, but not *inside* it. A position like (-1.90, -1.50) would be closer to the rover's initial position and still within range of the lander for communication, while avoiding collision.
           
           *   **Rover v12 (starts at v13 = (1.0, -1.75))**
               *   **Sampling `v1` (AABB ((0.856, 1.351), (0.937, 1.433))):** Previous config (0.90, 1.40) was fine. Let's keep it.
               *   **Sampling `v7` (AABB ((-0.802, -0.611), (-0.662, -0.471))):** Previous config (-0.70, -0.50) was unreachable. Rover `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). Moving to (-0.70, -0.50) is a significant move. Let's find an alternative rock of type `v6` that is easier to reach for `v12`. `v5` (AABB ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06))) is much closer to `v12`'s starting position. Let's choose `v5` instead of `v7`. A suitable configuration to be above `v5` would be (0.45, -1.10).
               *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** Similar to `v14`, the config (-1.90, -1.90) collided with `v9`. A position like (-1.90, -1.50) for `v12` would work to communicate with `v9` while avoiding collision.
           
           **Revised Plan:**
           
           1.  Rover `v14` moves from `v15` to `#o3_v17` (new specific config for `v17` imaging).
           2.  Rover `v14` calibrates for `v17`.
           3.  Rover `v14` takes an image of `v17`.
           4.  Rover `v14` moves from `#o3_v17` to `#o3_v18` (new specific config for `v18` imaging).
           5.  Rover `v14` calibrates for `v18`.
           6.  Rover `v14` takes an image of `v18`.
           7.  Rover `v14` moves from `#o3_v18` to `#o0_v14_v9` (new specific config for communication with `v9`).
           8.  Rover `v14` sends images of `v17` and `v18`.
           9.  Rover `v12` moves from `v13` to `#o5_v12_v1` (specific config for `v1` sampling).
           10. Rover `v12` samples rock `v1`.
           11. Rover `v12` moves from `#o5_v12_v1` to `#o5_v12_v5` (specific config for `v5` sampling).
           12. Rover `v12` samples rock `v5`.
           13. Rover `v12` moves from `#o5_v12_v5` to `#o0_v12_v9` (specific config for communication with `v9`).
           14. Rover `v12` sends analysis of `v1`.
           15. Rover `v12` sends analysis of `v5`.
           
           Since the action instances are provided with the original `#o` names, I must use those. This implies that the `#o` configurations are flexible enough to accommodate different positions for imaging/sampling/communicating, or that the system will find a single position for each `#o` that satisfies all listed predicates that use it. Given the feedback, I need to provide distinct *values* for `#o3`, `#o5`, and `#o0` for *each* (rover, target) pair. This means the specific #o<number> objects are distinct and can be specified multiple times with different values.
           
           Therefore, for imaging `v17` and `v18` using `v14`, I will use `v14` at `#o3` twice, once for `v17` and once for `v18`. Similarly for sampling and communication.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires taking and sending images of `v17` and `v18`, and sampling and sending analysis of a 'stone' rock (`v1`, `v3`, or `v4`) and a 'soil' rock (`v5`, `v7`, or `v8`).
           
           I will use Rover `v14` for image-related tasks and Rover `v12` for analysis-related tasks. I need to find collision-free and reachable configurations.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           *   **Imaging `v17` (AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969))):** The previous config (1.60, 1.70) collided with `v19` (AABB((1.75, 1.75, 0.0), (2.25, 2.25, 0.1))). `v19` is located at `x > 1.75` and `y > 1.75`. To avoid `v19` and see `v17` (which is around (1.8, 1.9)), `v14` needs to be in a position that gives it line-of-sight without collision. Let's try to position `v14` further back in x and slightly different y. Perhaps `(1.50, 1.90)`. This position is within range (distance from (1.8, 1.9) is sqrt((1.8-1.5)^2 + (1.9-1.9)^2) = 0.3, well within 2 units) and should avoid `v19`.
           *   **Imaging `v18` (AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083))):** The previous config (-1.80, 1.80) collided with `v20` (AABB((-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), (-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))). `v20` is located at `x < -1.75` and `y > 1.75`. `v18` is around (-2.0, 2.0). To avoid `v20`, `v14` could try to image `v18` from `(-1.70, 2.00)`. Distance from (-2.0, 2.0) is 0.3, within 2 units.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.50) collided with `v9`. The lander `v9` is quite large. A communication position needs to be within 4 units, outside its bounding box. `v9`'s max_y is -1.654. So `y` values greater than this should avoid collision. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(-1.90, -1.60)`. This is still very close. Let's try `(-1.90, -1.20)`. This should provide enough clearance and still be within communication range of `v9`. Its x-range is approx -2.4 to -1.4.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           *   **Sampling `v1` (AABB ((0.856, 1.351), (0.937, 1.433))):** The previous config (0.90, 1.40) was not reachable. Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). Moving to (0.90, 1.40) is a long, possibly blocked, path. `v1` is at `(0.9, 1.4)`. The rover is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The objects `v3`, `v5` are closer. Let's try sampling `v3` instead of `v1` for the stone (`v2`) type. `v3` (AABB ((0.414, -1.634), (0.51, -1.538))). A good position for `v12` above `v3` could be `(0.45, -1.60)`. This is much closer to `v12`'s starting position.
           *   **Sampling `v5` (AABB ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06))):** The previous config (0.45, -1.10) was not reachable. `v5` is around `(0.45, -1.1)`. Let's try to get `v12` to `(0.45, -1.10)` again, but note that this needs to be a valid path, which the motion controller will find. Assuming such a path exists (not explicitly provided in AABBs for intermediate points).
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.50) collided with `v9`. As for `v14`, try `(-1.90, -1.20)`.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given for motion (#o2) can find a path to these locations.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which involves specific image and analysis reporting tasks. The repeated failure in finding reachable and collision-free configurations suggests that the scene geometry and the rovers' initial positions are challenging. Let's analyze the rover positions and target locations more carefully and consider alternative strategies if direct paths are consistently blocked.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           *   **Imaging `v17` (AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969))):** `v17` is in the positive x, positive y quadrant. `v14` starts in negative x, negative y. The obstacle `v19` (AABB((1.75, 1.75, 0.0), (2.25, 2.25, 0.1))) blocks direct approach from south-west. Reaching (1.50, 1.90) from (-1.0, -1.75) requires crossing a large part of the map. It seems like the map might be divided, or there are many small obstacles not explicitly listed, making long-distance travel difficult. Let's try to find a configuration for `v14` to image `v17` that is close to the y-axis, perhaps `(0.0, 1.70)` if that's traversable. The max distance is 2. `v17` is around (1.8, 1.9). This new point `(0.0, 1.70)` is ~1.8 units away from `v17`. This location is less likely to be blocked by `v19`.
           *   **Imaging `v18` (AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083))):** `v18` is in negative x, positive y. Obstacle `v20` (AABB((-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), (-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))) blocks direct approach from south-east. `v14` needs to image `v18` from a position not colliding with `v20`. Let's try `(-1.60, 1.70)`. This point is on the edge of `v20`'s x-range and y-range, so it might still collide or be very close. Perhaps `(-1.50, 2.00)` to be slightly away and still view `v18` (distance from `(-2.0, 2.0)` is 0.5).
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** `v9` is in the negative x, negative y quadrant. `v14` starts near `v9`. The previous configurations were too close or inside `v9`. `v9`'s `max_y` is -1.654. We need a point that is `y > -1.654` and within 4 units. Let's try `(-1.90, -1.60)`. This is just outside the `y` boundary of `v9` and centrally aligned in `x`. This should allow communication without collision and be reachable from `v14`'s start.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           *   **Sampling `v3` (AABB ((0.414, -1.634), (0.51, -1.538))):** `v3` is in positive x, negative y, very close to `v12`'s starting position. The previous config (0.45, -1.60) was not reachable. This is puzzling as it's very close to `v12`'s current region. This might indicate an unseen obstacle or a very restricted movement space. Let's try a different rock for type `v2`. `v4` is another rock of type `v2` (AABB ((-2.143, -1.106), (-2.049, -1.012))). This is far from `v12` and closer to `v14`. Let's stick with `v3` but try `(0.50, -1.50)` which is within `v3`'s AABB. This configuration would be "above" `v3`.
           *   **Sampling `v5` (AABB ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06))):** `v5` is also in positive x, negative y. The previous config (0.45, -1.10) was not reachable. `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). `v5` is around (0.45, -1.1). This is also a relatively short move. Let's try `(0.45, -1.0)` to be slightly above `v5`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** Similar to `v14`, try `(-1.90, -1.60)`. This should be reachable from `v12` as it's a relatively large distance but on the 'other side' from where `v12` starts, similar to how `v14` needs to go.
           
           The repeated failure for reachability suggests either very complex terrain with unlisted obstacles, or very limited motion capabilities. Given that `v12` cannot reach points close to its starting position, this is highly restrictive. I will try to find configurations that are very close to the objects themselves, on their edges or slightly above, to minimize travel, hoping this increases reachability.
           
           If this attempt fails, the problem may be fundamentally unachievable given the provided scene details and constraints, as the robot base cannot even move to nearby points.
           
           Let's carefully pick specific points inside or directly above the target objects, assuming 'above' means directly over, and that motion to these very close points is feasible if not colliding.
           
           For `imagevisible` and `comvisible`, the `conf` must be collision-free and have an occlusion-free ray. For `above`, the `conf` should be above the rock.
           
           **Rover `v14` (at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           *   `v17` (1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969) -> center (1.801, 1.925). To avoid `v19` (lower=(1.75, 1.75)), let's try (1.70, 1.90) for `v14` (still within 2 units).
           *   `v18` (-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083) -> center (-1.998, 2.035). To avoid `v20` (lower=(-2.25, 1.75)), let's try (-1.90, 1.90) for `v14` (still within 2 units).
           *   `v9` (-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654). To avoid `v9`, and be within 4 units, a good point would be `(-1.90, -1.60)`. This point is outside `v9`'s max Y (-1.654).
           
           **Rover `v12` (at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           *   `v3` (0.414, -1.634), (0.51, -1.538) -> center (0.462, -1.586). For `above`, let's try `(0.46, -1.58)`.
           *   `v5` (0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06) -> center (0.46, -1.11). For `above`, let's try `(0.46, -1.11)`.
           *   `v9` (-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654). Similarly, for communication, let's try `(-1.90, -1.60)`.
           
           This is the best I can do given the constraint and feedback. The repeated 'not reachable' for configurations that seem geometrically plausible suggests either very strict movement constraints not fully described by AABBs (e.g., narrow corridors, unlisted small obstacles) or that the rover models themselves have limited reach. I will proceed with the plan and these revised configurations.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, which include sending images of `v17` and `v18`, and sending analysis of rocks `v3` and `v5`. The main challenge lies in finding collision-free and reachable configurations for the rovers. The current attempts have consistently failed due to collisions with obstacles or the target objects themselves, or due to configurations being unreachable.
           
           Let's carefully re-evaluate the geometry and proximity to obstacles for each target.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Imaging `v17` (AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969))):** The previous config (1.70, 1.90) collided with `v19` (AABB((1.75, 1.75, 0.0), (2.25, 2.25, 0.1))) and `v17` itself. This means the rover's chosen location overlapped with the obstacle and the objective. `v17` is the target, so the rover should not be inside its bounding box. `v19` is an obstacle. `v17` is centered around (1.8, 1.9). `v19` is in the region `x > 1.75` and `y > 1.75`. To view `v17` (within 2 units) and avoid `v19` and `v17`, `v14` should be in the region `x < 1.75` or `y < 1.75` for `v19`, and *outside* `v17`'s AABB. Let's try to view `v17` from `(1.60, 1.80)`. This should be outside `v19` and `v17` and within the 2-unit range of `v17`.
           *   **Imaging `v18` (AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083))):** The previous config (-1.90, 1.90) collided with `v20` (AABB((-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), (-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))) and `v18` itself. `v18` is centered around (-2.0, 2.0). `v20` is in the region `x < -1.75` and `y > 1.75`. To view `v18` (within 2 units) and avoid `v20` and `v18`, `v14` should be in the region `x > -1.75` or `y < 1.75` for `v20`, and *outside* `v18`'s AABB. Let's try `(-1.60, 2.00)`. This should be outside `v20` and `v18` and within range.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.60) collided with `v9`. This indicates that `y=-1.60` is still within `v9`'s bounding box (`max_y` is -1.654). We need to be above `v9`'s `max_y`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(-1.90, -1.50)`. This is outside the `y` range of `v9` and within 4 units.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Sampling `v3` (AABB ((0.414, -1.634), (0.51, -1.538))):** The previous config (0.46, -1.58) was not reachable. This is a very short distance from `v12`'s start (1.0, -1.75). The repeated 'not reachable' for very close points indicates a significant challenge. Perhaps a slightly different x or y to bypass an unseen obstacle, or the robot's footprint is larger than expected. Let's try `(0.40, -1.60)` for `v3`. This is still within the `x` range of `v3` and very close to `v12`'s `y` position.
           *   **Sampling `v5` (AABB ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06))):** The previous config (0.46, -1.11) was not reachable. Similar issue. Let's try `(0.40, -1.10)` for `v5`. This is also very close to `v12`'s `x` position and closer to its `y` position than `v3`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.60) collided with `v9`. Similar to `v14`, let's try `(-1.90, -1.50)`.
           
           Given the consistent "not reachable" errors for nearby targets, there might be a fundamental issue with pathfinding or unstated obstacles in the environment that make these seemingly simple moves impossible. I will choose targets that are closer to the rover's initial positions to minimize path length, hoping that might help with reachability. I have already selected `v3` and `v5` which are closer to `v12`.
           
           If this attempt still fails on reachability for configurations that are very close to the rover's starting position, it suggests that the problem might be unachievable or requires more complex pathfinding beyond simple AABB checks, which is outside the scope of my current capabilities.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, requiring image transmission for `v17` and `v18`, and analysis transmission for rock types `v2` (e.g., `v3`) and `v6` (e.g., `v5`). The persistent issues with collision and reachability for even seemingly straightforward movements indicate the environment is very constrained. Let's try to adjust the configurations again, pushing for extreme positions (but still within range) to avoid obstacles.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Imaging `v17` (AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969))):** `v19` (AABB((1.75, 1.75, 0.0), (2.25, 2.25, 0.1))) is the obstacle. Our previous attempt `(1.60, 1.80)` was outside `v19`'s `x` range but inside its `y` range, meaning `1.80 > 1.75`. To avoid `v19` and `v17` itself, `v14` needs to be in a position `x < 1.75` and `y < 1.75` (for `v19`), and also outside `v17`'s bounding box. Given `v17`'s coordinates, `y` must be less than `1.881`. Let's try to image `v17` from `(1.60, 1.70)`. This should be outside `v19`'s upper Y, and also outside `v17`'s lower Y. The distance from `v17` (center ~ (1.8, 1.9)) to `(1.60, 1.70)` is `sqrt((1.8-1.6)^2 + (1.9-1.7)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.08) ~ 0.28`, well within 2 units.
           *   **Imaging `v18` (AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083))):** `v20` (AABB((-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), (-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))) is the obstacle. Our previous attempt `(-1.60, 2.00)` was outside `v20`'s `x` range but inside its `y` range. To avoid `v20` and `v18` itself, `v14` needs to be in a position `x > -1.75` and `y < 1.75` (for `v20`), and also outside `v18`'s AABB. `v18` is centered around (-2.0, 2.0). This means `y` must be less than `1.988`. Let's try `(-1.70, 1.70)`. This should be outside `v20` and `v18`. Distance from `v18` (center ~ (-2.0, 2.0)) to `(-1.70, 1.70)` is `sqrt((-2.0 - (-1.7))^2 + (2.0 - 1.7)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.18) ~ 0.42`, well within 2 units.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.50) collided with `v9`. This is extremely difficult if points outside `v9`'s bounding box are still colliding. This implies `v9`'s actual collision geometry might be larger than its listed AABB, or the rover is very wide. Given `v9`'s `max_y` is -1.654, a y-coordinate of -1.50 should be clear. If even `(-1.90, -1.50)` collides, then maybe it needs to be much further away, or another axis. Let's try to align with the x-center of `v9` but even further away in y. `(-1.90, -1.00)` is 0.65 units away from `v9`'s highest point, and within 4 units from `v9`'s center.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Sampling `v3` (AABB ((0.414, -1.634), (0.51, -1.538))):** The previous config (0.40, -1.60) was not reachable. `v3` is at `(0.4-0.5, -1.6-1.5)`. `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The previous point `(0.40, -1.60)` is very close. If this is unreachable, it strongly suggests a hidden obstacle field. Let's try `(0.50, -1.60)`. This is still within the `x` range of `v3` and close.
           *   **Sampling `v5` (AABB ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06))):** The previous config (0.40, -1.10) was not reachable. `v5` is at `(0.4-0.5, -1.1-1.0)`. `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(0.50, -1.10)`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous config (-1.90, -1.50) collided with `v9`. Similar to `v14`, let's try `(-1.90, -1.00)`.
           
           This is becoming very challenging. If these configurations, which are geometrically sound based on the provided AABBs, are still problematic, it implies the problem cannot be solved with only the information provided about obstacles and reachability. However, I must continue to try.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, which require sending images of `v17` and `v18`, and sending analysis of rocks `v3` and `v5`. The constant collision and unreachability issues for configurations, even when attempting to adjust based on AABBs, strongly suggest a severely restricted environment or underlying model issues not explicitly stated.
           
           Given the persistent "not reachable" errors even for very short moves from initial positions, and collisions even with generous clearances, it is increasingly likely that a solution cannot be found using the current approach. However, I must continue to attempt to find a plan.
           
           Let's rethink the strategy, particularly for reachability. If moving across the map is hard, perhaps we should attempt to complete tasks closer to the starting points using the *same* rover if possible, or swap roles if one rover can reach something the other cannot.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Imaging `v17` (AABB ((1.757, 1.881), (1.845, 1.969))):** `v19` (AABB((1.75, 1.75, 0.0), (2.25, 2.25, 0.1))) is the obstacle. The previous position `(1.60, 1.70)` had `y < 1.75` for `v19`. The problem states the collision, which means either `v14`'s footprint is larger than `(1.60, 1.70)`, or there are other unseen obstacles. Let's try to image `v17` from a slightly different angle, keeping distance from `v19`. `v17` is around (1.8, 1.9). Maybe `(1.50, 1.80)`? This would be more to the left of `v19`'s x-range, and within range of `v17`. Distance to `v17`'s center: `sqrt((1.8-1.5)^2 + (1.9-1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.1) ~ 0.31`.
           *   **Imaging `v18` (AABB ((-2.045, 1.988), (-1.951, 2.083))):** `v20` (AABB((-2.25, 1.75, 0.0), (-1.75, 2.25, 0.1))) is the obstacle. `v18` is around (-2.0, 2.0). The previous `(-1.70, 1.70)` also caused collision. Let's try `(-1.50, 1.90)`. This would be more to the right of `v20`'s x-range. Distance to `v18`'s center: `sqrt((-2.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (2.0-1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.25+0.01) = sqrt(0.26) ~ 0.51`.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous `(-1.90, -1.00)` was not reachable. This is particularly concerning as `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Moving to `(-1.90, -1.00)` is not extremely far. The constant "not reachable" implies the space is very cluttered around `v14`'s start or along paths to nearby points. Let's try `(-1.00, -1.50)`. This is right next to `v14`'s starting `x` and only slightly `y` adjusted. It's still outside `v9`'s `max_y` and should be within communication range.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`):**
           
           *   **Sampling `v3` (AABB ((0.414, -1.634), (0.51, -1.538))):** The previous `(0.50, -1.60)` was not reachable. This is very close to `v12`'s start `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's assume some minor adjustment will make it reachable. Try `(0.60, -1.60)`. This is slightly more towards `v12`'s starting `x`.
           *   **Sampling `v5` (AABB ((0.409, -1.162), (0.511, -1.06))):** The previous `(0.50, -1.10)` was not reachable. Let's try `(0.60, -1.10)`. Similar reasoning, a minor adjustment hoping to find a reachable point.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):** The previous `(-1.90, -1.00)` was not reachable. This is a very long path for `v12` (starts at `1.0, -1.75`). Given the consistent "not reachable" for `v12` even for shorter paths, it's highly improbable `v12` can reach `v9`'s vicinity.
           
           **Re-evaluating the strategy:** If `v12` cannot reliably reach its sampling targets (`v3`, `v5`) or `v9`, then `v14` might need to pick up some of `v12`'s tasks, or the goal is unachievable with `v12`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, which is closer to `v9` than `v12`. It is also closer to rocks like `v4` for a stone, and `v7` for soil (though `v7` is quite far). However, `v14` already struggles to reach imaging targets far away.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty in finding reachable points, especially for `v12` and for communication with `v9` for both, I'll attempt this plan, but if it fails on reachability again, it points to the problem being unachievable.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to achieve the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, which require sending images of `v17` and `v18`, and sending analysis of rocks `v3` and `v5`. The consistent "not reachable" feedback for all proposed configurations, even those very close to the rovers' starting positions, strongly indicates that the problem is unachievable with the current environment definition. This is not a matter of finding a better coordinate, but rather a fundamental inability for the robots to move.
           
           For example:
           - Rover `v14` starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. It cannot reach `(-1.00, -1.50)`, which is only a movement of 0.25 units in the y-direction.
           - Rover `v12` starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. It cannot reach `(0.60, -1.60)`, which is a relatively small movement.
           
           This suggests that the environment either has completely blocked off movement for the rovers from their starting positions, or the robot's movement model itself has an issue that prevents any movement at all. Since I am constrained to the given actions and cannot modify the environment or robot model, and every proposed path leads to "not reachable", I must conclude that the goal is currently unachievable from the initial state based on the provided constraints and feedback.
           
           No plan will be provided as the goal is determined to be unachievable.
