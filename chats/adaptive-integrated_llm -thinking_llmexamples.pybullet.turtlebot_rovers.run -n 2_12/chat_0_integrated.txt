           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.379, 2.006), (-0.295, 2.09)).

           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.983, -0.909), (-0.853, -0.779)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).

           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.771, -1.029), (0.87, -0.931)).

           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan and Rationale**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core challenge is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to:
           
           1.  Getting images of objects `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` using the camera `v10`.
           2.  Analyzing and sending the analysis of rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, and `v8`.
           
           The initial state provides some key facts: the rovers are `atconf` (at specific configurations), some objects are `objective`, `mode`, and `store` objects are present. It has to make assumptions on the `motion` (self-loop only). It is safe to assume that `blocked(#<objects>) = false`.
           
           I'll use `v12` to handle the imaging tasks and `v14` for the rock analysis tasks. Since there are no moves, the rover has to take images with a fixed coordinate. The main plan will be the following.
           
           **Imaging Plan (Rover v12)**
           
           *   **Action 1**: `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` - Calibrate the camera to observe `v17`. The preconditions `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is given, and the assumption is that the rover is in its current position `v13` (so `#o3 = v13`).
           *   **Action 2**: `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)` - Take the image of `v17`. `calibrated(v10, v12)` from the previous step is a precondition.
           *   **Action 3**: `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` - Recalibrate for `v18` (since the camera gets uncalibrated).
           *   **Action 4**: `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)` - Take the image of `v18`.
           *   **Action 5**: `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` - Send the image of `v17`. `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is given and will be used assuming `#o0 = v13`.
           *   **Action 6**: `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)` - Send the image of `v18`.
           
           **Analysis Plan (Rover v14)**
           
           *   **Action 7**: `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)` - Take a sample from the first rock. Preconditions: `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, which must assume `#o5 = v15`. The store is initially free so we assume that `free(v14,v16)`.
           *   **Action 8**: `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)` - Send the sample analysis. We have assumed `#o0 = v15`.
           *   **Action 9**: `drop_rock(v14, v16)` - Drop the rock to free up the storage.
           *   Repeat Actions 7-9 for rocks `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, and `v8`.
           
           The core assumption driving this is the interpretation of configurations represented by `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`.  Given the absence of general `move` actions, I'm forced to assume these `#o` configurations *are* the rovers' starting configurations: `#o3` is `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`, and `#o0` is `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`. `#o5` must also be at the rover's initial positions.
           
           **Configurations**
           
           Given that I have to interpret those as rover coordinates the following is the final format:
           
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (1.0 -1.75)`
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18):
)

(Thoughts: **My Revised Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           Okay, the user's feedback hit me hard – I completely missed a critical constraint. My initial plan was using actions *not* in the permitted list. My bad. The only allowed actions are frustratingly limited: `move` operations, which basically do nothing of substance to change the configuration and `drop_rock` actions which, based on the initial state, aren't even *initially* executable.
           
           The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which means I need a whole slew of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. My first thought was to get those through `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, as they seem logical, but those aren't even permitted here. Also, the `sample_rock`, `take_image`, and `calibrate` actions, which I was also considering, are now out of the question.
           
           The only tools I have are these meaningless `move` actions and potentially useful (but initially inapplicable) `drop_rock` actions. The `move` actions are self-loops; they don't do anything regarding `atconf` changes. Then the `drop_rock` actions require a `full` predicate to be true, but in the initial state, all those are `free`. Even if I could *somehow* trigger a `drop_rock` action, it would only modify the `free` predicates, not the things I actually *need*.
           
           Given these extremely severe constraints and the initial state, there is simply no path to achieving the goal. The required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are fundamentally unachievable within the allowable action space. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
