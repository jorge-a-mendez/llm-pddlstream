User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Robot Base Position Selection**
           
           As a seasoned expert in this domain, I approach the problem with a clear understanding of the environment and a strategic approach to finding optimal robot base positions. My primary goal is to identify three positions that satisfy the following constraints: be within a 2-unit radius of the `target_point`, have an unobstructed line of sight to the `target_point`, avoid collisions with fixed obstacles, and remain within the operating boundaries of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           The environment presents some key challenges. First, there's a central divider (obstacle 5) that can easily obstruct the line of sight. Secondly, the presence of various rectangular obstacles (6-21) scattered throughout the room further complicates finding clear paths.
           
           My approach can be summarized as follows:
           
           1.  **Candidate Generation**: I initiate the process by strategically generating a set of candidate robot base positions around the `target_point`. This involves sampling points at varying distances, within the 2-unit radius limit, and at multiple angles around the `target_point`. I also create points along cardinal and diagonal directions.
           
           2.  **Constraint-Based Filtering:** The next critical step is to filter these candidates based on a series of rigorous checks:
               *   **Boundary Validation:** I ensure that all candidate positions fall within the allowed operating boundaries, i.e., x and y coordinates are in the range of -2.5 to 2.5.
               *   **Collision Avoidance:** Each candidate base position is checked to ensure that the robot's base will not physically overlap with any of the fixed obstacles.
               *   **Line-of-Sight Determination:** This is crucial. For each candidate, I verify a direct, unobstructed line of sight to the target point. A specific heuristic is used to avoid points on the opposite side of the central divider relative to the target, as such points will typically be occluded. A finer, more detailed check then samples multiple points along the line of sight from the candidate position to the `target_point`. Each sample point is tested against the fixed obstacles.
               *   **Minimum Target Distance:** Positions that are extremely close to the target (within a defined buffer of 0.1 units) are considered inappropriate and are discarded.
           
           3.  **Optimal Position Selection:** Once the valid, unobstructed candidates are identified, my final step is to select three of these base positions. To ensure a robust set of options, I prefer positions that are angularly diverse (well-spread around the target).
           
           Given these conditions, I would recommend the following three base positions relative to `target_point = (0.5, 0.5)` :
           
           *   (1.5, 0.5)
           *   (0.5, -1.0)
           *   (1.0, 1.5)
           
           These positions will facilitate effective task performance, clear lines of sight, and collision-free navigation, thus allowing the robot to perform its objective successfully.
