(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's the plan for generating 50 stable placements for object ID 6, which is a square (0.08023 x 0.08023), on surface 0, a square centered at (0,0) with bounds ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           First, I've determined that due to the object's square shape, the rotation angle `theta` won't significantly affect its bounding box.  Therefore, for simplicity and efficiency, I'll set `theta = 0` for all placements. Since the problem statement cares about AABB, the fact that object is square implies no rotation changes the AABB.
           
           To ensure stability (full containment within the surface), the object's center (x, y) must lie within a smaller square centered at (0,0).  The valid range for both x and y is [-0.094885, 0.094885].  This range is derived by taking the surface's dimensions, subtracting the object's half-width from each side.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll create a grid within this valid range. An 8x8 grid will give 64 points, more than the 50 I need. I'll use `np.linspace` or an equivalent to evenly space the x and y coordinates.
           
           The x and y coordinates that define the center of the object will vary between -0.094885 and 0.094885. This means I'll have the following values for x_values and y_values.
           
           x_values = [-0.094885, -0.067775, -0.040665, -0.013555, 0.013555, 0.040665, 0.067775, 0.094885]
           y_values = [-0.094885, -0.067775, -0.040665, -0.013555, 0.013555, 0.040665, 0.067775, 0.094885]
           
           To select 50 points from an 8x8 grid,  I will iterate through all 8 x values, starting with the first value (-0.094885) and pairing them with all 8 values for the y coordinates, generating 8 different (x,y) coordinates for this row.
           When I reach the x = -0.040665 in row 3, I am at index 2, so I know I still have 5 points.
           After this point, I will have 6 rows (until index = 5). I have to fill the last row to index 1. Index 0 and Index 1 are required, which will create 50 points in total.
           
           Here is the exact structure I will generate: (surf_idx, theta, x, y):
           - (0, 0, x_values[0], y_values[0]) to (0, 0, x_values[0], y_values[7]) -- 8 points
           - (0, 0, x_values[1], y_values[0]) to (0, 0, x_values[1], y_values[7]) -- 8 points
           ...
           - (0, 0, x_values[5], y_values[0]) to (0, 0, x_values[5], y_values[7]) -- 8 points
           - (0, 0, x_values[6], y_values[0]) and (0, 0, x_values[6], y_values[1]) -- 2 points
           
           This will be a set of 50 different placements. All stable, all contained within surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           I've been tasked with placing object 5 (a square with side 0.073196) on surface 0, ensuring 50 stable placements while avoiding collision with a previously placed object, object 6 (also a square with side 0.080231).  First, I calculated the valid placement area on surface 0, which is a square: `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`. Considering object 5's size, its center can move within a slightly smaller square.
           
           The previously placed object (object 6) has its center at (-0.094885, -0.094885) and it is also at 0 degrees, so it occupies roughly the bottom-left corner of the surface.  From its dimensions, the occupied space of object 6 (its AABB) is `[-0.135, -0.0547695] x [-0.135, -0.0547695]`.
           
           To prevent collisions, I needed to ensure that object 5's bounding box did *not* overlap with object 6's. If we use the object centers x_c5, y_c5 as our variables, then we want to ensure the condition `(x_c5 + obj5_half_x <= -0.135 OR x_c5 - obj5_half_x >= -0.0547695 OR y_c5 + obj5_half_y <= -0.135 OR y_c5 - obj5_half_y >= -0.0547695)` holds true.
           
           This simplifies to `(x_c5 >= -0.0181715 OR y_c5 >= -0.0181715)`. Therefore object 5 should have its center (x_c5, y_c5) NOT inside the rectangle `[-0.098402, -0.0181715] x [-0.098402, -0.0181715]`.
           I created a grid of potential x and y coordinates, ranging from -0.098402 to 0.098402. By iterating through each combination of x and y values within this grid, and applying the exclusion criteria for the colliding region, I obtained 55 potential placements.
           
           Finally, I rounded some values for the final output, and selected the first 50 valid placements. The output consists of 50 different locations for the center of object 5, which are collision free, all at 0 degrees.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan:** I need to find 50 stable locations for an object (ID 4) on a surface (Surface 0). I have to avoid collisions with two other objects already placed there (IDs 6 and 5).
           
           First, I need to define the valid placement area on Surface 0, taking into account the object's size (0.0907930998267843 x 0.0907930998267843) and the surface's boundaries (-0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y). This gives me the initial range for the object's center coordinates (x_c and y_c) to ensure it's fully within the surface.
           
           Then, I must avoid collisions with the existing objects. I need to calculate the bounding boxes for both Object 6 and Object 5, using their center coordinates and dimensions.  For Object 6, with its center at (-0.094885, -0.094885) and size 0.08023099927654764 x 0.08023099927654764, the collision area is calculated.  Similarly, I'll calculate the bounding box and collision area for Object 5, which is centered at (-0.09840204115709567, -0.01405734682991372) and has a size of 0.07319591768580866 x 0.07319591768580858.
           
           The collision avoidance conditions are defined. I will only accept placements (x_c, y_c) if they are within surface bounds AND do not collide with either of the other two objects. If the object's center falls outside the collision box of Object 6 OR outside the collision box of Object 5, I can be sure that a collision does not happen.
           
           I'll then combine these conditions to define my safe placement area.  I'll generate a grid of potential locations, calculating if Object 4 would collide at that point by comparing the object's position to Object 6 and 5's. I will mark those positions as *invalid*. All other points will be *valid*.
           
           To refine the valid placements, the rotation is defined at 0 degrees, the square object's bounds will be the same. The grid will be re-evaluated to find all safe placements. Since 50 are required, the bounds need to be refined.
           
           I realize I will need to consider the object at 45 degrees rotation, or pi/4. This will require new bounds, now accounting for the rotation. I will redefine the object bounds to create the grid.
           
           Given the bounds, the 47 valid placements are defined for 0 rotation. Then three are taken for 45 degree rotation, to equal the required 50 placements. I will then output all of these locations.
