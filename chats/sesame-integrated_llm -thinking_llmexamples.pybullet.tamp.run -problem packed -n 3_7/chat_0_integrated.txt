           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.163, 0.279), (-0.065, 0.377)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.173, -0.453), (0.263, -0.363)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.011, -0.581), (0.096, -0.496)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.114, 0.328, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.314, 0.949).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.218, -0.408, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.187, 0.982).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.054, -0.539, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.617, 0.787).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Due to Geometric Constraints**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) onto a surface (`v16`).  Simple enough, right?  The problem is, they're currently on another surface (`v11`), and `v16` is a smaller object with the constraints of "axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs)" and "fully contained within the bounds of the surface". Based on the facts I have, the dimensions don't work out.
           
           First, I need to understand what the initial poses, the objects' bounding boxes, and the target surface's bounding box mean. The initial poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`) give me a starting point, including a rotation component, but the goal is clearly to place *new* poses.
           
           I have to carefully calculate where I can place the objects to avoid any collisions. I assume a `theta=0` placing (because the problem specifies "axis-aligned bounding boxes", I understand this to mean aligned to the world frame).
           
           I quickly realize the target is way too small to fit the three objects side-by-side. The math is simple: their total width is greater than the available surface width. Trying to rearrange them doesn't fix it. I've considered several arrangements, but none work due to the AABB-based containment requirement.
           
           Then I get some clarification. The prompt mentions a concept of 'dummy surfaces' but it is not applicable here. Even if I assume a more generous interpretation of what it means to be "fully contained", it still doesn't work.
           
           Given all the facts, I can only conclude that achieving the goal is geometrically impossible, and based on the provided data, I must state the goal as *unreachable*.
