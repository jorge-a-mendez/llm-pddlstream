User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There are some obstacles in the room, mainly:
           - A central vertical obstacle at x=0, stretching from y=-2.5 to y=2.5. This effectively divides the room into two halves.
           - Several smaller obstacles, some of which are along the walls, acting as "shelves" or protrusions. Other obstacles are scattered in the open spaces.
           - There are clusters of obstacles in the upper-right, upper-left, and lower-middle sections of the room.
           - Specifically, the regions around (0, 2), (2, 2), (-2, 2) seem to have more clutter. The region around (0, -2) also has some obstacles.
           
           Given the target point {target_point}, I will try to find positions for the robot base. The robot needs to be within 4 units of the target. I will try to prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight, avoiding being directly behind any of the known obstacles. I will also try to keep the robot within the valid x and y bounds of [-2.5, 2.5]. I will generate a diverse set of points around the target, considering different directions (North, South, East, West, and diagonals) and varying distances up to the maximum of 4. I will try to avoid placing the robot too close to the obstacles, especially the central one at x=0 if the target is on the other side of it, or the wall obstacles.
