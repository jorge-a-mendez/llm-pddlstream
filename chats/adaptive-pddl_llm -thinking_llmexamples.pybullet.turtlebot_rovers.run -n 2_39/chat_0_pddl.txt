           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to satisfy a few conditions: specific configuration and "free" states for some objects (which are already true in the initial state), and then "receivedimage" and "receivedanalysis" predicates for a stone and soil sample. The initial conditions are met, so the path looks like this. I need to get the images and analyses of some stone and soil samples.
           
           To get "receivedimage", I know I need to *take_image* and then *send_image*. To get "receivedanalysis", I need to *sample_rock* and then *send_analysis*. Standard stuff. Now, I see I can use rock `v1`, `v3`, or `v4` as my stone; I'll choose `v3`. For the soil, I have `v5`, `v7`, or `v8` to choose from and I'll use `v7`.
           
           But here's the kicker. The instruction manual clearly states I can only use action instances provided in a specific list, and any other instance is not allowed. I check the list of available actions and notice the *only* available actions are moves and dropping rocks. There are *no* instances of *take_image*, *send_image*, *sample_rock*, or *send_analysis*. This creates a problem.
           
           Considering what I understand about the goal, I would need to perform all the steps mentioned for the imaging and sampling steps, including the relevant actions to make those happen. Because these are absent from the list of available actions, those necessary action instances are unavailable. There's no way to *take_image*, *send_image*, *sample_rock*, and *send_analysis*. This means there's no way to reach the desired state, since I can't generate the necessary "receivedimage" and "receivedanalysis" facts. So, despite having a path in mind, I cannot achieve the goal based on these limited instructions. The conclusion is, therefore, that this plan is *not* achievable.
