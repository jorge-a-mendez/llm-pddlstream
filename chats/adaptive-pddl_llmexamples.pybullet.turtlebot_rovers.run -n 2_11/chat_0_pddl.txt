           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. Examining the definition of `new-axiom@0()` shows that it requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are already at their respective initial configurations in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers currently have a free store, as indicated in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means images of objectives v17 and v18 using mode v11 must be taken and sent to the lander.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a rock of type `v2` must be received by the lander.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of a rock of type `v6` must be received by the lander.
           
           Let's break down the plan to achieve these conditions:
           
           **Achieving `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           - To get `receivedimage`, we first need `haveimage`.
           - To get `haveimage`, we need to `take_image`.
           - To `take_image`, we need to `calibrate` the camera.
           - Rover `v14` has camera `v10` onboard and supports mode `v11`. It is at `v15`. `imagevisible` predicates are given for `v14` at `#o3` (which is a different conf than v15) for both `v17` and `v18`.
           - Similarly, `v12` has camera `v10` onboard and supports mode `v11`. It is at `v13`. `imagevisible` predicates are given for `v12` at `#o3` for both `v17` and `v18`.
           - However, the allowed actions are only `move` and `drop_rock`. There are no `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `send_image` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances. This makes it impossible to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           
           **Achieving `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           - To get `receivedanalysis`, we need to `send_analysis`.
           - To `send_analysis`, we need `analyzed`.
           - To get `analyzed`, we need to `sample_rock`.
           - The initial state shows rocks of type `v2` (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and `v6` (`v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           - Rover `v14` is above rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at `#o5`. It has a free store `v16`.
           - Rover `v12` is above rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at `#o5`. It has a free store `v16`.
           - There are no `sample_rock` or `send_analysis` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances. This makes it impossible to achieve `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Since none of the actions required to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are available in the provided list of valid action instances, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           The available actions are only `move` and `drop_rock`, which are not sufficient to satisfy the complex goal, which requires imaging and analysis actions.
           
           No plan can be generated as the necessary actions (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are not in the list of allowed action instances.
