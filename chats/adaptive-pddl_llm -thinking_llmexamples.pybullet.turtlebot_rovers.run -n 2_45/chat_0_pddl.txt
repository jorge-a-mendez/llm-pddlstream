           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but to get there, I need a plan. My analysis tells me this axiom boils down to four sub-goals: two images, and two analyses, all delivered to the lander. The initial state provides the necessary configuration and relationships between the Rovers, the rocks, and the lander. The challenges lie in the preconditions for my actions, and the need to manage camera calibration and the rover's storage capacity.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           I'll split the tasks between the two rovers. Rover v12 will take care of getting images and the analysis of a specific stone. Rover v14 will be in charge of the soil analysis.
           
           **Rover v12's actions**
           1.  **Image v17:**
               *   Calibrate the camera for imaging v17.
               *   Take the image.
               *   Send the image to the lander.
           2.  **Image v18:**
               *   Calibrate the camera for imaging v18 (after taking the previous one).
               *   Take the image.
               *   Send the image to the lander.
           3.  **Stone Analysis:**
               *   Sample the specific stone and store it in the rover's store.
               *   Send the analysis to the lander.
               *   Release the rock after sending the analysis (to satisfy the axiom's preconditions)
           4.  **Repeat these operations for another image**
           
           **Rover v14's actions**
           1. **Soil Analysis:**
               *   Sample the specific soil and store it in the rover's store.
               *   Send the analysis to the lander.
               *   Release the rock after sending the analysis (to satisfy the axiom's preconditions)
           2.  **Repeat these operations**
           
           The trickiest part is managing the resources. I have to make sure the rover's store is available before each sampling, and released immediately after each analysis. Camera calibration also has to be re-done before taking each photo.
           
           Let's summarize the plan:
           *   Use two rovers
           *   One for images and stone analysis
           *   Other for soil analysis
           *   Manage camera calibration
           *   Take, Send, then Release the sample after analysis.
           
           That should achieve `new-axiom@0()`!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a challenge. The user has correctly pointed out that I used invalid actions previously, so I need to stick to the given action set: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13)) ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15)) ((drop_rock v12 v16)) ((drop_rock v14 v16))`.  I've re-evaluated the `new-axiom@0()` goal with these constraints.
           
           The goal demands: keeping the robots in their initial positions (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`), ensuring that the store is open ( `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`), receiving two images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) of something, and receiving analyses of stone and soil (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`).
           
           The permitted actions are severely limited.  `move` is useless, essentially a no-op, maintaining the initial `atconf` state. `drop_rock` only works if the store is full, but the initial state shows the store being free, so these actions are not feasible. I can't even get started!
           
           The critical missing pieces are actions to take and send images, and to sample and send analysis reports. Actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are absent. It's a fundamental flaw! With just the `move` and `drop_rock` functions, I can't possibly satisfy those `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, which are the crux of the goal. The goal requires an image and an analysis, and I cannot fulfill those tasks.
           
           Considering these circumstances, the conclusion is clear: with the given action set, it's *impossible* to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The provided toolset is woefully insufficient. I need to communicate this explicitly.
