User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.039, 0.477), (0.051, 0.567)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.236, 0.391), (-0.147, 0.48)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.221, 0.124), (0.292, 0.195)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.169, -0.498), (-0.071, -0.4)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, 0.31), (0.013, 0.409)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.006, 0.522, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.824, 0.566).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.191, 0.436, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.582, 0.813).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.257, 0.159, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.703, 0.711).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.12, -0.449, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.89, 0.456).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.037, 0.36, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.934, 0.357).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Plan: Placing Multiple Objects on Surface v20**
           
           As an expert in the field, I've analyzed the problem and devised a plan to move the objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto the surface v20.  I've considered the initial state, the available actions, and the goal of achieving `on(object, v20)` which necessitates `supported(object, #p, v20)` and `atpose(object, #p)` for each object.
           
           The core of the plan lies in a series of `pick` and `place` actions executed by the robot arm, `v4`.  The robot base configuration `v3` remains constant. Due to the problem constraints, it's clear the base doesn't need to move since there's just a single, non-changing `move_base` fact.
           
           Each object will follow this sequence:
           1.  **Pick:** `(pick v4 <object> <initial_pose> #o1 v3 #o4)`
           2.  **Place:** `(place v4 <object> #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           
           I have carefully considered the initial poses of the objects (v9, v13, v15, v17, v19) on their support (v11).  I've looked at the constraints to place the objects in collision-free and stable poses on the surface `v20`.  For each object, I will use `#o2` as target pose.
           
           **Collision Avoidance and Target Pose Selection**
           
           I've determined a suitable arrangement for placing the objects on `v20`, considering their sizes and the surface dimensions. All objects fit on `v20`.
           
           Since the problem requires that all the placement poses are different for each of the objects, even though they share the same symbol `#o2`. I need to generate distinct continuous poses for each object on the target surface, taking into consideration the AABBs of the objects and the target.
           
           I've identified these continuous values for `#o2` (x, y, z, theta), ensuring the objects don't collide.
           
           -   **v8:** `(-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           -   **v12:** `(0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           -   **v14:** `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           -   **v16:** `(0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           -   **v18:** `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           The z-coordinate for all objects is 0.781.
           
           **Action Sequence**
           
           The actions will be performed sequentially for each object. This sequence achieves the goal state by sequentially removing each object from support `v11` by the robot and then re-placing the object onto `v20`.
           
           1.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4`
           2.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`
           3.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4`
           4.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`
           5.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4`
           6.  `place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`
           7.  `pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4`
           8.  `place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`
           9.  `pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4`
           10. `place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`
           
           This sequential plan ensures that the hand remains empty for each pick, and the base remains at `v3`.
           
           The cost of this plan will be 10 (pickcost + placecost for each of the objects).

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the plan I proposed was flagged, and I see why. The system is only permitting the `move_base` action, specifically, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This, essentially, moves the robot's base configuration from location `v3` to the same location, also using trajectory `#o0`.  While that's a valid action in the allowed set, it's completely useless for what we're trying to accomplish.
           
           The ultimate objective is to achieve the following: `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`. That translates to getting five objects onto the surface at location `v20`.  The issue is clear: `move_base` only allows us to alter the robot's physical position; it doesn't offer any mechanism for *interaction* with the objects themselves. I'm not seeing any `pick` or `place` instances defined within the permitted action list.
           
           Without the ability to manipulate the objects (i.e., using `pick` and `place`), the robot is fundamentally incapable of satisfying the `on` predicates. It's a classic planning impasse: the available actions are insufficient to achieve the goal state.  My initial plan, then, however well-intentioned, was doomed to failure because it relied on interactions that aren't possible with the current action limitations.  We'll need to revise the allowed actions or the goal entirely.
