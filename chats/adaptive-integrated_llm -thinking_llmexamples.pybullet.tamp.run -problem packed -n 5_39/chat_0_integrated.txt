User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.039, 0.477), (0.051, 0.567)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.236, 0.391), (-0.147, 0.48)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.221, 0.124), (0.292, 0.195)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.169, -0.498), (-0.071, -0.4)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.086, 0.31), (0.013, 0.409)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.006, 0.522, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.824, 0.566).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.191, 0.436, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.582, 0.813).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.257, 0.159, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.703, 0.711).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.12, -0.449, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.89, 0.456).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.037, 0.36, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.934, 0.357).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a problem where I need to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` – all *on* object `v20`.  My understanding of *on* translates to `supported` and `atpose` predicates, meaning the objects must be both supported by and at a specific pose on `v20`.  Currently, these objects are all supported by `v11` at various poses. The target surface `v20` *is* stackable, which is good.
           
           The issue, and it's a critical one, is the available actions.  The only action I *can* use is `move_base`. That action *only* changes the robot's base configuration. It doesn't allow me to manipulate the objects at all. I need to move these objects from their current poses on `v11` to poses on `v20`.  That would require actions like `pick` and `place` – actions to actually move the objects.
           
           Let me break down the goal further: I need each object to be *at* a specific pose and *supported* by `v20`.  So, for `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`, I need to satisfy both `atpose(?p)` and `supported(?p, v20)` where ?p represents a pose. However, the current state and the available action don't provide the ability to change the `atpose` and `supported` predicates from its current state of being `on v11` to `on v20`.
           
           The initial state shows all the target objects supported by `v11`, which is not what I want.
           
           With only `move_base`, I can't even touch the objects!  The problem statement specifically says I can *only* use the listed actions.  `move_base` isn't going to help me manipulate objects. I need to *pick* them up from `v11` and *place* them on `v20`. But *those* actions are explicitly *not* allowed. I'm essentially handcuffed.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of the problem – the limited actions – I'm forced to conclude this goal is simply *unachievable* in the current setup. I don't have the necessary tools. This is a clear case of an unsolvable problem with the provided action set.
