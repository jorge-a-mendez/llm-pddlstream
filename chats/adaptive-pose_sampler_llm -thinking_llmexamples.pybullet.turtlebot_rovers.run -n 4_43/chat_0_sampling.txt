User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 25 optimal positions for a robot's base, given a specific target point. Here's my thought process. The robot base has to be within a 4-meter radius of the target and confined to the room's dimensions, which are -2.5 to 2.5 meters in both x and y. Critically, these base placements must avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles and offer a clear line of sight to the target. It's important to remember that I won't know if a position fails the first time, but a second request for the same target will indicate a previous failure, and I'll adapt accordingly. However, since this is the *first* request, I don't have that information yet.
           
           **Understanding the Scene:**
           
           Firstly, I need to understand the room's layout, which is provided as a set of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). From the AABBs, I can see this describes a room with walls that have a thickness. However, for simplicity I will treat the bounds of the actual `(-2.5, -2.5)` to `(2.5, 2.5)` area as the walls. The AABBs reveal walls and a key central pillar at x=0. The smaller boxes are positioned throughout the space. The central pillar is a major consideration for line-of-sight analysis.
           
           **Line-of-Sight & Collision Checks:**
           
           The primary challenge is to identify positions that provide a clear view to the target. The central pillar at x=0 is the most likely to cause blockages. I'll need to use ray-casting or a similar method. I'll need to check if the line segment between the proposed base position and the target intersects any of the obstacles. To enhance robustness, I am using a safety margin around obstacles. I'll employ this same method to determine if a point is colliding.
           
           **Candidate Position Generation:**
           
           I will create a list of candidate positions, primarily sampling them in concentric circles around the target point. This provides a structured sampling of positions near the target point. This sampling will be more dense the further the radius from the target point.
           
           **Validation and Refinement:**
           
           Each candidate position will be assessed. The code needs to:
           
           1.  Verify the position is within the room boundaries.
           2.  Ensure it's within 4 meters of the target.
           3.  Check if it collides with any fixed obstacle.
           4.  Determine if there's line of sight to the target point.
           
           The collision check requires considering point-in-AABB logic. Line-of-sight, meanwhile, necessitates more sophisticated line-segment-AABB intersection calculations, using the slab-method with a safety buffer. I've designed these to accurately identify valid placements.
           
           **Fallback Strategy:**
           
           If the first method does not provide 25 valid points, I can use a strategy for increased point sampling or random sampling, to locate 25 valid points. If no solutions are found, the algorithm may have to return to a default.
