User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Selecting Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so the task is to pick three (x, y) coordinates for the robot base, given a target at (0, 0), while sticking to these rules: maximum distance of 2 from the target, avoid collisions with obstacles, and make sure we have a clear line of sight to the target. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           First thing, I broke down the environment, mapping out the obstacles. The primary challenge is this central wall obstacle, defined as x between -0.05 and 0.05. The target point (0, 0) is actually *within* the x-extent of this central wall.  This immediately raised a red flag because it would seem to block the line of sight.
           
           This creates an important interpretation issue: if the target is within an obstacle, it can't "be seen."  However, based on the problem statement and the fact that solutions are expected, I had to assume the target is *intended* to be viewable from around the central wall.  The task usually implies line-of-sight is *possible*. I therefore need to position the robot on either side of this wall.
           
           Also, the robot must stay within [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.  The distance constraint (max range of 2) effectively keeps the robot within those limits.  Any point within a radius 2 circle around (0,0) will have coordinates within those limits.
           
           So, I determined the ideal positions:
           
           1.  (-1.0, 1.0) - Left side, top-left angle.
           2.  (1.0, 1.0) - Right side, top-right angle.
           3.  (1.0, -1.0) - Right side, bottom-right angle.
           
           These all work because:
           
           *   They are at a distance of `sqrt(2) = 1.414` from (0,0), so they are within range.
           *   They are all at `x` = 1.0 or -1.0, and `y` = 1.0 or -1.0. This keeps them out of the `x` = [-0.05, 0.05] range, so they will not collide with the central wall.
           *   The lines of sight to the target don't cross the other obstacles in the scene.
           *   Finally, they are all within the bounds, as x and y are within the range of [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           I believe that these positions provide the required diversity and maximize the ability to view the target despite the obstacle.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Feedback and Re-evaluating for Target (0.0, 0.0)**
           
           Okay, so I've got some feedback, but it's a bit tricky. The user gave me some "negative examples," but they're for a *different* target point, not the one I'm currently working on, which is (0.0, 0.0) – the exact same target as my *first* request. Initially, I provided three positions: `(-1.0, 1.0)`, `(1.0, 1.0)`, and `(1.0, -1.0)`. Now, I'm second-guessing myself based on that *other* feedback, which included some "not reachable" errors, but those were specific to a different target.
           
           My main concern is the central wall obstacle – it's a vertical wall that seems to encompass the target if you only read literally. This means I've already had to make the assumption that the target `(0.0, 0.0)` is viewable from either side of this wall – otherwise, it's an impossible problem.
           
           Since the instructions explicitly state "You may reuse previous positions if they appear valid," and since the negative examples were *for a different target*, I believe it is most appropriate to reuse my previous solution, as there is no reason to think my interpretation of the central wall as viewable is incorrect for the same target and the obstacles haven't changed.
           
           Based on that interpretation, all three of my initial positions – `(-1.0, 1.0)`, `(1.0, 1.0)`, and `(1.0, -1.0)` – still seem valid. They are all within the maximum range of 2 from (0.0, 0.0), are positioned outside the wall's x-range, and have an unobstructed line of sight to the target assuming that the *other* target's line of sight failures are irrelevant.
           
           Therefore, despite the "negative examples," I am going to re-submit `(-1.0, 1.0)`, `(1.0, 1.0)`, and `(1.0, -1.0)` as my proposed positions for target (0.0, 0.0).

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Request and Formulating a Solution**
           
           Okay, so we're back to the same target point: (0.0, 0.0). This is the *third* time, which definitely raises a flag. The instructions say if it happens again, it's probably an obstacle, so let's dig deeper. The feedback from the previous attempts was for a *different* target point, which is a bit confusing – does it apply here or not? The problem description uses the phrase "may be," leaving wiggle room. But the core prompt says "If you receive a second request for the same target point," which is what happened. So, let's play it safe.
           
           I've got three previous positions for this target in my memory: (-1.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0), and (1.0, -1.0). Are they still good? Since the feedback was technically for a different target, these *might* still work. But the problem *also* states "you will always try to find a new position," so it's best to come up with fresh spots. I need to be more proactive here. It's time to try something different, just in case. Also, a prompt's instruction to "never give up," means I should show I'm trying something different.
           
           Now, let's review the scene. There's Obstacle 5, a vertical wall at x=0. That was my initial assumption, meaning I have to stay on either side of the wall, but I still have to check everything again. Are my previous positions good with respect to this wall? They are: the positions `(-1.0, 1.0)`, `(1.0, 1.0)`, `(1.0, -1.0)` are valid with respect to this wall, being `|x| = 1.0 > 0.05`, and I know they are all within max_range of 2.
           
           But hold on... the *target* point itself, (0.0, 0.0), is *inside* Obstacle 5! That's a huge problem. That means the instructions are possibly inaccurate, or something else is happening. So, I will assume the target is viewable from either side, if I stay to the sides of the wall. Let's make sure our positions avoid that wall, AND any other obstacles. I need new ones, with varied x and y values, and making sure to avoid the central wall at x=0. I will consider `(-0.5, 1.9)`, `(0.5, 1.9)`, and their negations. They don't work, though; the obstacle 9 would get in the way.
           
           Okay, let's try something that will avoid the target's "internal" location in the wall. So, let's re-think. How can I get around that pesky wall? I want diverse positions. Okay, let's try `y=0`. So, `(-1.0, 0.0)`, and `(1.0, 0.0)`. Those should be within range, and on either side of the wall. That sounds good. Now, let's look at a diagonal solution. How about `x= -1.5`, so `y=1.3`? Well, the y must be `1.3`, so I can see it. But that's close to other obstacles. Let's check:
           1. `(-1.0, 0.0)` is good.
           2. `(1.0, 0.0)` is good.
           3. `(-1.5, 1.3)` is good.
           
           So, here are my new positions:
           1. `(-1.0, 0.0)`
           2. `(1.0, 0.0)`
           3. `(-1.5, 1.3)`
           
           These all sound great for now! Let's see how these ones go.

(Thoughts: **Fourth Attempt at (0.0, 0.0): New Positions Needed**
           
           Okay, here we go again. This is the fourth time I'm being asked for positions for target (0.0, 0.0).  The system hasn't given me a direct "failure" for any of my previous attempts for *this* target, only for a different one.  Still, the fact that I'm being asked *again* suggests that the previously proposed positions aren't working in practice.  Perhaps there are unseen dynamic obstacles or subtle rules at play that aren't captured in the static obstacle list.  I need to keep providing new and diverse positions.
           
           Let's quickly review. The target is (0.0, 0.0), and the max range is 2.0. We have a central wall, Obstacle 5, running from (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5).  That means I need to place the robot *outside* of that x-range,  effectively separating my options into x < -0.05 and x > 0.05.
           
           Since the system seems to be wanting a different approach, I'm going to focus on more distant, yet still valid, locations. I'm going to choose three diverse positions adhering to the range limitations and avoiding the central wall.
           
           1.  **Directly Left:** (-1.9, 0.0) is 1.9 units away from the target, well within the limit and in the right "x" zone, with a clear line of sight, if needed.
           2.  **Directly Right:** (1.9, 0.0) is 1.9 units away, the same distance as my first choice, but on the other side. This ensures adequate coverage.
           3.  **Third Quadrant:** To mix it up and get some angle on it, I'll go with (1.3, -1.3).  This is roughly 1.84 units from the target. The line of sight looks clear. The only concern is Obstacle 15, which is quite close, but even a quick spot-check indicates the path is likely clear.
           
           These three should offer a fresh perspective. Let's see how these fare.

           Since the system seems to be wanting a different approach, I'm going to focus on more distant, yet still valid, locations. I'm going to choose three diverse positions adhering to the range limitations and avoiding the central wall.
           
           1.  **Directly Left:** (-1.9, 0.0) is 1.9 units away from the target, well within the limit and in the right "x" zone, with a clear line of sight, if needed.
           2.  **Directly Right:** (1.9, 0.0) is 1.9 units away, the same distance as my first choice, but on the other side. This ensures adequate coverage.
           3.  **Third Quadrant:** To mix it up and get some angle on it, I'll go with (1.3, -1.3).  This is roughly 1.84 units from the target. The line of sight looks clear. The only concern is Obstacle 15, which is quite close, but even a quick spot-check indicates the path is likely clear.
           
           These three should offer a fresh perspective. Let's see how these fare.
