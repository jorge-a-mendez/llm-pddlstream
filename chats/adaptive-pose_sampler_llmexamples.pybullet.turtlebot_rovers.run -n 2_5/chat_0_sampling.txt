User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a rectangular boundary defined by AABBs 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are very thin walls at x = +/-2.55 and y = +/-2.55. There's also a vertical wall (AABB 5) at x = 0, dividing the space. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the environment, including a large one at the bottom left (AABB 6), and a few small square obstacles in the top right, top left, and top middle (AABBs 7, 8, 9, 10). There are also a number of very small obstacles, which appear to be point-like.
           
           I will attempt to find positions within the allowed x and y ranges, and within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not directly behind known obstacles from the perspective of the target. Given the vertical wall at x=0, I will try to place positions on the same side of this wall as the target point.

Model:     My previous attempts failed for the target point (-0.3002747595310211, 2.191265106201172). The position (-0.3162, -1.4804) had no line of sight, which makes sense as it's far on the other side of the y-axis from the target, and likely behind the x=0 wall (AABB 5). The other two positions, (-1.85, -2.48) and (-2.48, -0.85), collided with the boundary walls (AABBs 2 and 4 respectively) and AABB 6 for the first one. This indicates I need to be more careful with the exact boundaries of the navigable space and consider the internal obstacles. The target is in the top-middle-left quadrant.
           
           The target point is (-1.65 -0.85). This target is in the bottom-left quadrant. Given the vertical wall at x=0 (AABB 5), I should prioritize positions with negative x values.

Model:     It appears all my previous attempts for the target point (-0.3002747595310211, 2.191265106201172) have failed. This suggests there might be some more subtle obstacles or a difficult line-of-sight challenge for this specific target. The target is at (-0.30027, 2.1912). Many of the collisions were with the outer walls (AABBs 2 and 4) or AABB 6, which is a large block in the bottom-left. The line of sight issues likely point to the x=0 wall (AABB 5) or other small obstacles. I need to ensure the robot is not placed too close to the environment boundaries and consider placing it on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target. The target is at x = -0.3, so I will try to stay in the negative x region.
           
           The target point is (-1.65 -0.85). I will try to place the robot closer to the target, avoiding the walls and the large obstacle AABB 6.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.65 0.5)
           (-0.7 -0.85)
           (-1.65 -0.0)
