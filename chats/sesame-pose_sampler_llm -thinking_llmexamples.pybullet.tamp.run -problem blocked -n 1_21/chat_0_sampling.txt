(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts on Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5 and dimensions 0.07x0.07 on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A placement is a tuple of (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).  Since the problem statement indicates the object dimensions are for the *axis-aligned bounding box*, I'm going to assume the object *is* an AABB and can be treated as a simple rectangle.  Therefore, I'll only need to consider rotations of 0 and pi/2 radians.  However, because the object is a square, the effective bounding box will be the same regardless. Using 0 degrees should suffice to find stable placements.
           
           The object needs to be entirely within the surface. Surface 0's dimensions are 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high (calculated from the provided coordinates).  The object is 0.07x0.07.
           
           To ensure containment, I need to calculate the valid x and y ranges for the object's center.  I do this by offsetting the surface boundaries by half the object's width/height.  For `theta=0`, the effective width and height are 0.07.  This gives me the following:
           
           *   **x range:** 4.235 <= x <= 4.765
           *   **y range:** -0.565 <= y <= -0.035
           
           I will generate 50 placements within this valid region, starting with a grid-like placement strategy with a step size equal to the object's width (0.07). The goal is to generate a diverse set of placements. There are 8 x positions and 8 y positions that do not cause overlap when placed in a grid. This is more than enough for the 50 I require. I then have 64 available placement options. After a complete consideration of the problem I've generated the placements and will render them to the format requested.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable and Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square-like object (ID 10) on a given surface (surface 0: [(4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)]). I know this object is approximately 0.0711 units on each side.  I also have to avoid any collisions with objects that are *already* in the scene - specifically, those with ID 5.
           
           First, I identified the valid placement region for object 10 on surface 0, *ignoring* object 5 for now.  This meant calculating how far the object's center could be from the edges of the surface. Based on the dimensions and with no rotation, the object's center has the ranges: x from 4.23555 to 4.76445, and y from -0.56445 to -0.03555.
           
           Then, I meticulously analyzed the *existing* placements of object 5, which are at 0 degrees rotation. Those objects are arranged vertically and each takes 0.07 in X and Y. Each one takes up 0.07 horizontally from x = 4.2 to 4.27, and another two from x = 4.27 to x = 4.34. The vertical placements of the first set are -0.6 to -0.04 and for the second set, -0.6 to -0.46, with some overlap from the first set.
           
           The new object 10 will *definitely* collide if placed *exactly* where a previous object 5 is. I had to create a strategy. I decided to build a "column" on the right side of the placements for object 5. So, object 10 will start with an x of 4.37555, after the end of any of those objects.  I used the object 5's existing x range, which is at 4.34, to determine the position of object 10's AABB to be non-overlapping. The other objects are squares, so placing object 10 at 0 rotation, will be easy.
           
           I created 8 valid Y and 6 X coordinates to generate 48 placements. Finally, I *shifted* the last x coordinate to produce two new placements and get the 50 placements desired.  I had to be certain that these additional two would fit without collisions.  I ran an AABB collision test to verify all the points, making sure there was no overlap in the X and Y bounds of Object 10 and each of object 5 placements, while ensuring object 10's location was within the given surface limits.
