           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Line of Reasoning for Achieving the Goal Atom `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means finding an object that's both *on* something and of a certain *type*.  I've got the initial state and a set of available actions to work with.
           
           My initial thought is to break down the problem.  The `new-axiom@0()` boils down to two key conditions: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state gives me a head start by listing available objects and their types. I'm focusing on those objects that are potentially stackable on v18.
           
           Next, I look at the initial state and see that there are objects such as v8 and v12 which can be `type(v17)`. I think the best path forward would be to manipulate these objects using the available actions to satisfy the goal.  I analyze all given facts that would help achieve `on(v8/v12, v18)` and analyze their relationship to the goal.
           
           Based on facts about `on` derived from `supported` and `atpose`, I see that the robot needs to move one of those objects to the top of `v18`. From the `supported` facts in my initial state, I see that v8 and v12 can be potentially stacked on v18. 
           
           Then I analyze the `stackable` predicates, and I conclude that it would be best if I can manipulate `v8`. Then, I decide to create the plan:
           
           1.  *First*, I need to bring the robot's base into a configuration where the robot can pick up `v8`. Then I need the actions to bring the base from v3 to pose `#o3` (using `move_base`).
           2.  *Second*, I need to have the robot pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`. 
           3.  *Third*, with `v8` in the robot's hand, I need to place `v8` on the appropriate pose `#o2` on top of `v18`. 
           
           I checked the preconditions for each action, particularly looking at  `atbconf()`, the state of the base. I made sure to check the relevant given facts and negated atoms. 
           
           Finally, I walk through each action and verify that it leads to achieving the goal, given the initial state, the available actions, and the deduced states after each action. Everything lines up. I can verify that my plan does lead to my goal state.
