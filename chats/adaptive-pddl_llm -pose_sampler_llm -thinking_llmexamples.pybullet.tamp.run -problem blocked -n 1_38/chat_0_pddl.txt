           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placing an Object: A Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at placing object ID 5 on surface 0, and the goal is 50 stable placements. I know the object's dimensions (0.07 x 0.07), and I need to figure out how to rotate and position it on the surface which is defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The placement format is straightforward: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.
           
           First thing I realize is that since the object is square, the effective size when rotated changes. I calculate the effective size based on the rotation angle `theta` and note that the maximum effective size is when `theta` is pi/4 or multiples of it and is approximately `0.09898`. Minimum when theta is 0, pi/2, etc. and equals 0.07.
           
           To ensure the object is fully within the surface, I need to constrain the center coordinates `(x, y)` based on the effective size and the surface boundaries.  I take note of the surface's dimensions (0.6 x 0.6) and use these to compute the valid range of `x` and `y` center coordinates.
           
           The object is pretty small compared to the surface, giving me plenty of room. I decide to generate placements by varying the rotation angle and position.
           
           I'll start with 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2 radians, these angles make the effective size as small as possible. I then make sure the object's position is within the bounding box of the square surface.
           
           Then I move onto pi/4 and 3pi/4. The effective size will be greater, so the valid range for `x` and `y` coordinates will be a bit smaller.
           
           I'm aiming for 50 placements so I construct a plan. For the theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 placements I'll pick points along x = 4.235, 4.335, 4.435, 4.535, 4.635, 4.735 and for the y = -0.565, -0.465, -0.365, -0.265, -0.165, -0.065. I make the list and check the ranges.
           
           For the pi/4, 3pi/4 I pick x = 4.3, 4.5, 4.7 and y = -0.5, -0.3, -0.1.
           
           This will get me my 50 placements. I make sure my coordinates for each placement are within the valid ranges I calculated for that angle.
           
           Now it's time to generate the list of 50 placements, each in the correct format.
