           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I quickly decode as needing an object, let's call it `?green`, that's both of type `v17` and on `v18`. Looking at the starting situation, I see that both `v8` and `v12` fit the type requirement.  Now, the real challenge is getting one of these objects to be "on v18."
           
           My initial thought is to work backward from the "on" predicate.  This condition actually relies on `supported` and `atpose` facts.  For an object to be on something, it must be supported by that thing at a particular pose.
           
           I started checking whether `v8` or `v12` are already in the right spot.  Unfortunately, it looks like `v8` is `on v11` and `v12` is `on v14` according to the initial facts. To get either of them onto `v18`, I'd need to manipulate their `atpose` facts.
           
           Next, I look at the actions I can take. There is one move_base action available, which moves the robot base from a start configuration to another. From the available action, I note that the robot is currently in `v3` and the only action available is moving it to the same base configuration `v3`. This will change `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()` to `NegatedAtom canmove()`. So, I've got to find a way to manipulate the objects. But I see *no* available `pick` or `place` actions that I need for my strategy.
           
           I've got a problem.  I need to change the position of either `v8` or `v12`, but the only available move doesn't allow me to. The only action available is `move_base`. Given these constraints, I've got to conclude this goal is, for the time being, out of reach. There is no way I can satisfy `on(?green, v18)` with what I've got, and therefore, I must fail to reach my goal.
