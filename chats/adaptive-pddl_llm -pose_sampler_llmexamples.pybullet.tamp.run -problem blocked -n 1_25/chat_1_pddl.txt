           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at `v9` supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` supported by `v11`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective configurations. The base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`, which means `?green` could be `v12` or `v8`.
           
           To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, we need `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.
           Looking at the initial state, we have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This implies that `v12` or `v8` could potentially be placed on `v18`.
           
           Let's pick `v12` as `?green`. We need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`, which means `atpose(v12, #o2)` where `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           Currently, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)`. We need to pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           The available action instances are very limited. Only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is provided, which is essentially a no-op movement of the base. No pick or place actions are available, despite the kinematic information being present in the initial state. Since there are no `pick` or `place` action instances provided, the robot cannot manipulate any objects. Therefore, the goal `on(?green, v18)` cannot be achieved, and the overall goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at `v9` supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` supported by `v11`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective configurations. The base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`, which means `?green` could be `v12` or `v8`.
           
           To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, we need `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.
           Looking at the initial state, we have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This implies that `v12` or `v8` could potentially be placed on `v18`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)` and `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)`. Neither `v13` nor `v9` are poses on `v18`. Therefore, to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, either `v12` or `v8` needs to be moved to a pose on `v18`. This would require a `pick` action to grasp the object and a `place` action to set it down on `v18`.
           
           However, the provided list of valid action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available. Without the ability to pick up and place objects, the robot cannot change the `atpose` of any object. Consequently, it is impossible to achieve the `on(?green, v18)` precondition for the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Since the necessary actions (`pick` and `place`) are not available in the given action instances, the goal is not achievable from the initial state.
