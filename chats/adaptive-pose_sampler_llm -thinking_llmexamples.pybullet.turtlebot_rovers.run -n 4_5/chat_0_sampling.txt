           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to find three valid (x, y) positions for a robot's base, near a given target point.  These positions must be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target and fall within the bounds of a square environment centered at (0,0) with limits x & y [-2.5, 2.5]. Crucially, I have to ensure the robot doesn't collide with any fixed obstacles.  The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           I'm given the fixed obstacles as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). The most critical obstacle to consider is the central vertical wall at x=0.  The prompt emphasizes the need to avoid obstacles and the importance of remembering potential previous collisions for the same target if they reoccur.  I will prioritize placing the robots away from the most likely problem spots, like being within 0.1 of x=0.
           
           **Target Point Specific Analysis and Strategy**
           
           The given target point is (-0.95, -0.95). So, I'll need to work with x and y coordinates that fall between [-2.95, 1.05] for possible initial calculations. However the actual bounds are the environment at [-2.5, 2.5]. I will focus on the AABBs in the immediate vicinity of the target.
           Here's my thought process. Since I don't have a direct collision or line-of-sight check function, I'll have to rely on geometric reasoning and trial-and-error to get this right.  I need to pick three distinct robot placements that are likely to be good, then double-check to make sure.
           
           **Candidate Position Selection and Obstacle Avoidance**
           
           Based on the target point's position and the configuration of the AABBs, I decide to create three placements.
           1.  **P1:** This first spot will be placed to the left of the target, but closer to the environment border, (-2.4, -0.95). The distance to the target is under two units, which keeps things legal.
           2.  **P2:** This spot will be right below the target point, (-0.95, -2.4).
           3.  **P3:** This spot will be created and placed top-left diagonally from the target, and outside of a few likely-colliding rectangles: (-2.01, 0.11).
           
           **Line-of-Sight & Final Validation**
           
           I manually inspect the locations and confirm that all three positions should, geometrically, have a clear line of sight to the target and should not collide with fixed obstacles.  The y-axis range from -2.4 to -0.95 will be ok, as the x range of obstacles are off, and will work.
           
           **Final Positions**
           
           My final answer is as follows:
           *   Robot 1: (-2.40, -0.95)
           *   Robot 2: (-0.95, -2.40)
           *   Robot 3: (-2.01, 0.11)

(Thoughts: **Refined Approach to Target Point Placement**
           
           Okay, after analyzing the previous failures, I've got a clearer picture of what I need to do. It seems my main issues were:
           
           1.  **Bumping into walls:** I need to make sure my proposed positions are *inside* the bounding box, leaving a small buffer from each wall to avoid collisions. X-coordinates should be roughly between -2.45 and 2.45, and y-coordinates as well.
           
           2.  **Obstruction from the central wall:** I need to ensure the robot and target are on the *same side* of the central vertical wall (between x = -0.05 and x = 0.05). If the target's x-coordinate is positive, the robot's x-coordinate needs to be as well, and vice versa. The target (0.1, 0.1) suggests a location on the right side of the wall.
           
           So, for this new target (0.1, 0.1) within a maximum range of 2:
           
           **Plan of Attack:**
           
           I'll start by making sure any robot positions are to the right of the central wall. I will calculate three likely target positions using a distance and angle based approach and then perform the necessary checks.
           
           *   **P1: Directly to the right of the target:**  I'll place the robot a distance of 1.0 away from the target to the right (1.1, 0.1). I'll check its location and line of sight.
           *   **P2: Below and to the right of the target:**  I'll place the robot at -45 degrees and a distance of 1.5 away to test obstacle avoidance (1.16, -0.96).
           *   **P3: Above the target:** I'll place the robot at a distance of 1.5 up (0.1, 1.6). This should avoid the previous obstacle occlusions.
           
           **Initial Position Set:**
           
           *   **P1: (1.1, 0.1)** This position is to the right and is on a clear path to the target. It's safe!
           *   **P2: (1.16, -0.96)** Positioned on the right and below and should also be safe.
           *   **P3: (0.1, 1.6)** Positioned above. This seems safest.
           
           **Final Sanity Check:**
           
           All these points are inside my constraints: right side of central wall, y-axis near 0, inside the main boundary limits, and within max range. Looks good.

(Thoughts: **My Revised Approach for Navigating the Space:**
           
           After carefully analyzing the previous feedback and common failure modes, I've refined my strategy. The key takeaway is the importance of considering the robot's physical dimensions and safety margins. I've observed that the robot's footprint, or perhaps a safety buffer, can lead to collisions even when the robot's center appears to be clear of obstacles.
           
           Specifically, I'm now assuming a minimum clearance of around 0.15 units. This means, I'm enforcing two rules:
           
           1.  **Safety Margin:** My calculations must ensure that any potential robot positions have at least a 0.15-unit buffer from all AABB boundaries. In practice, this means checking if the proposed x, y coordinates are valid, using the constraints that **`x` should be `> 0.2`** when the target is to the right of the central wall (and `x` should be `< -0.2` if the target is to the left), and that both **`x` and `y` must be within `[-2.35, 2.35]`**. This should ensure the robot stays within the designated space.
           2.  **Line of Sight:** I'm prioritizing shorter paths and more direct lines of sight to minimize the risk of occlusion. I will try to avoid the long diagonal paths that go from corner to corner if there are clearer alternatives.
           
           **Applying the New Strategy to the New Target:**
           
           The new target is at `(0.1, 0.1)`. Knowing that `x > 0.2` is a must, I'll calculate three new positions with three points that satisfy this condition, and a clear line of sight.
           
           **Position 1 (P1):** Directly to the right of the target, at `(0.6, 0.1)`. This provides a horizontal line of sight which is very short and simple. The distance between robot and target is 0.5, below the required limit.
           
           **Position 2 (P2):** To the top-right, at `(0.81, 0.81)`. Diagonal at 45 degrees, which has a 0.7071 unit distance, so, distance is 1. The path is `y=x` which is less likely to intersect any obstacles as it is a short, direct path.
           
           **Position 3 (P3):** To the bottom-right, at `(0.81, -0.61)`. Diagonal at -45 degrees. Distance 1. Again, there are no AABBs within this path as this path is clear, so it does not intersect other obstacles.
           
           I believe these three proposed positions are a much safer approach.
