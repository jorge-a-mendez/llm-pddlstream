           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get these objects where they need to be. The ultimate goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all *on* `v20`.  Since *on* translates to *supported* and *atpose*, I need to ensure each object is *atpose* and *supported* by `v20`.  
           
           I see that these objects are currently supported by `v11` at various poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, and `v19` respectively). The axioms and initial states are clear: everything starts on `v11`. The key is to use the `pick` and `place` actions of arm `v4`.  The other arm, `v6`, isn't relevant for this.
           
           I've determined that I need to pick each object, one at a time, and then place it on `v20`. The robot's initial state gives me everything I need: base config `v3`, arm `v4` with `handempty`. The kinematics are available: arm `v4` can pick/place any object at the required poses. `kin` predicates confirm that the movements I intend are valid.
           
           Therefore, the plan is straightforward:
           1.  **Pick** `v8` from pose `v9`, place it onto `v20` at pose `#o2`.
           2.  **Pick** `v12` from pose `v13`, place it onto `v20` at pose `#o2`.
           3.  **Pick** `v14` from pose `v15`, place it onto `v20` at pose `#o2`.
           4.  **Pick** `v16` from pose `v17`, place it onto `v20` at pose `#o2`.
           5.  **Pick** `v18` from pose `v19`, place it onto `v20` at pose `#o2`.
           
           The continuous parameters like `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, and `#o4` will be used to ensure the right configurations.  I just have to make sure the grasping (#o1) is available and the kinematic trajectories (#o4) are free. The base configuration remains constant. The arm moves will change both the supporting base and supporting surface of each object. There is no `unsafe` situation present in this current plan.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new constraint: the previous plan used invalid actions. The only permitted action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's a severe restriction. Let's re-examine the goal and initial state with this in mind.
           
           The goal is to have five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) all stacked on `v20`.  The `on` axiom tells me I need to satisfy `supported(?o, ?p, v20)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` for each object.  From the initial state, I know the support relations: these objects are supported by `v11`. Their poses, initially, are on `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, and `v19` respectively.
           
           To achieve the goal, I need to change these poses to `#o2`.
           
           However, the action `move_base v3 v3 #o0` only affects the robot's configuration (`atbconf`) and the `canmove` predicate. It has absolutely no effect on the `atpose` facts of objects!  The actions that *do* affect `atpose` are the pick and place actions, and of course, they are not available. The clean and cook actions are irrelevant as well.
           
           Given that I can only use `move_base` and the goal requires manipulating object poses, it's clear: **this goal is unreachable.**  There's no way to modify the object's `atpose` facts with the restricted action set. The plan is dead in the water.
