           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.037, -0.424, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.096, 0.995).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.078, -0.465), (0.004, -0.383)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.185, -0.437, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.578, 0.816).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.088, 0.265, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.03, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.14, -0.481), (0.229, -0.392)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.051, 0.228), (0.125, 0.302)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)

           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)

           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v12)

           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on v16. However, the only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which only moves the robot's base. There are no pick or place actions available in the provided action instances. Without pick and place actions, the robot cannot manipulate any objects and thus cannot achieve the goal of placing objects on v16. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
