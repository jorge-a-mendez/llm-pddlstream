(Thoughts: **Geometric Placement Strategy for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to define 50 stable placements for object 4, a square with side length 0.09063341717155693, on surface 0, a square region with bounds ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  I'm focusing on ensuring the object remains entirely within the surface boundaries. Since the object's stability isn't explicitly defined, I'll prioritize generating a diverse set of placements across the available space.
           
           The first step involves understanding the object's geometry and how it relates to the surface. Object 4's shape remains the same regardless of its orientation, but the area it occupies changes.  At the key angles of rotation, it can still fit within a certain area of the surface.  This needs to be considered when calculating ranges for containment.
           
           To calculate the appropriate placement ranges, I start by identifying the valid x and y coordinates of the object's center.  The object must be fully contained within the surface; the center's valid range for `theta = 0` is `[-0.08968329141422153, 0.08968329141422153]`. For  `theta = pi/4`, it has a range of `[-0.070913547455, 0.070913547455]`.
           
           I'll generate a grid-like placement strategy to cover the space effectively. To vary the orientations for diverse placements, I'll generate sets of placements for two distinct rotations, 0 and pi/4 radians.  For `theta = 0`, I'll use 25 unique placements. These 25 placements will be generated by 5 equal x values, and 5 equal y values:
           x values: -0.08968329141422153, -0.04484164570711077, 0.0, 0.04484164570711076, 0.08968329141422152
           y values: -0.08968329141422153, -0.04484164570711077, 0.0, 0.04484164570711076, 0.08968329141422152
           The x-values, y-values will define (x,y) coordinates for `theta = 0` placements.
           
           Then, I'll generate 25 unique placements for `theta = pi/4`.  These 25 placements will be generated by 5 equal x values, and 5 equal y values:
           x values: -0.070913547455, -0.0354567737275, 0.0, 0.0354567737275, 0.070913547455
           y values: -0.070913547455, -0.0354567737275, 0.0, 0.0354567737275, 0.070913547455
           The x-values, y-values will define (x,y) coordinates for `theta = pi/4` placements.
           
           Surface Index will be 0 for all the 50 placements.

           My objective is to define 50 stable placements for object 4, a square with side length 0.09063341717155693, on surface 0, a square region with bounds ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new square object, ID 5, that I need to place on surface 0 without colliding with the existing object, ID 4, which is already placed there. I'm aiming for 50 stable placements. I know the sizes and positions, so here's how I'm thinking about it.
           
           First, I need to understand where object 4 is occupying space. I have its center and the size of its bounding box. From that, I can determine the exact region on the surface that object 4 covers. It's essentially occupying a corner of the surface.
           
           Next, I look at the properties of Object 5, which is also a square, but potentially rotated, so I need to account for how it might be oriented. I figure that rotations are 0 and pi/4. I'll need to calculate the bounding box sizes for different rotations. 
           
           Now, I'll calculate the valid placement area for object 5 on surface 0. Using the surface boundaries and the size of Object 5's bounding box, I'll determine the range of possible center positions along X and Y axes, ensuring it stays on the surface.
           
           To avoid collisions with object 4, I'm going to determine a strategy for generating placements. I'll mainly focus on the area *not* covered by object 4, which is the top-right and the bottom-right, and a tiny bit of the top-left area. 
           
           I'll generate a grid of potential center positions for Object 5. Then, for each potential placement, I'll calculate its bounding box and check for overlap with Object 4's bounding box. I'll use a collision detection function to make this calculation more concise and reduce duplication of code.
           
           I need to generate a 5x5 grid for each rotation and check all the combinations. 
           *   **0 Degrees/pi:** I can find 10 valid placements and
           *   **pi/4 rotation:** I can also find 10+6=16 valid placements
           Since I'll be generating so many placements, I'll store the x and y coordinates that would result in collision and add all of the other coordinates. The total number of solutions is: `10 + 10 + 16 + 16 = 52`.
           I will collect the placements while checking and I can be sure that the result contains exactly 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 8) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 4 and 5).
           
           First, I need to define the occupied space of the existing objects. I calculated the half-extents (half the side length) and center coordinates of both object 4 and object 5, and determined their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). This gives me a precise understanding of the areas already taken.
           
           Next, I look at the properties of the new object (ID 8), which is also a square. I calculated the half-extent for the new object. I also determine the ranges where object 8 can be placed at angles of 0, pi/2, pi/4 and 3*pi/4, within the bounds of surface 0, but I realize the object needs to fit within the surface boundaries.
           
           The core of the solution is a collision detection function. I've defined conditions for when two AABBs overlap. The basic approach is: Check if object 8's AABB is contained within surface 0. Then, for a given center coordinate and rotation (theta), I calculate the AABB of object 8. I check this AABB for overlap with the AABBs of both object 4 and object 5. If there's no overlap, then the placement is valid.
           
           I am using a systematic approach where I generate candidate placements (x, y coordinates and rotations) at steps, and check for collisions. By iterating through possible center coordinates within the surface and considering rotations, I ensure I explore a range of valid positions. I'll prefer rotations of 0 and pi/2 because these occupy smaller surface areas. This should easily help me find the required 50 placements. I'll make sure there are no duplicates. I'll be able to quickly locate potential locations. After generating the candidate placements, I check each one against the collision rules. Then, I keep only those that don't collide with existing objects and are within the surface bounds.

           Object 7 is a square with side length 0.09451069005005147. To be safe, I'm defining a simple collision check: `does_collide(aabb1, aabb2)`. This uses AABB's in the form `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`
           
           The half-extent for `theta=0` is `0.047255345025025735` and for `theta=pi/4`, it's `0.066896237192`.
           
           I've set up a grid for each possible rotation of Object 7: 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 and pi/4 and 3pi/4. The `x` and `y` center coordinates must be valid within the surface area, and then I'm calculating the coordinates, using step sizes based on object size and boundary.
           
           Finally, I'm looping through all of the calculated candidate positions and verifying collisions. Then I'm generating a list of valid placement coordinates, which will contain the necessary information.
