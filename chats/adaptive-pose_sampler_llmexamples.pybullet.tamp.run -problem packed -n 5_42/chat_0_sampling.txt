           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.09158626258820451, 0.09158626258820454)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface, `0`, centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object, with ID 4, is also square with side length approximately 0.0916. Since the object is smaller than the surface, there are many possible stable placements. I will generate a diverse set of placements covering various positions and orientations within the bounds of surface 0.
           
           The object's dimensions are (0.09158626258820451, 0.09158626258820454), which are very close to each other, indicating it's nearly square.
           The surface is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           The maximum x and y coordinates for the center of the object, when axis-aligned (theta=0 or pi/2), would be `0.135 - (0.09158626258820451 / 2) = 0.135 - 0.045793131294102255 = 0.089206868705897745`. The minimum would be `-0.089206868705897745`.
           
           I will generate placements that vary in x, y, and theta. I will ensure that the object's AABB remains within the surface AABB for all rotations. For a square object with side `s` rotated by `theta`, the effective half-width and half-height for its AABB are `0.5 * s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. In this case, `s = 0.09158626258820451`.
           The maximum half-dimension occurs at pi/4, where `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)) = sqrt(2)`. So, `0.5 * 0.09158626258820451 * sqrt(2) = 0.06476140590812971`.
           The allowed range for the center of the object is then `(-0.135 + 0.06476140590812971, 0.135 - 0.06476140590812971)`, which is `(-0.07023859409187029, 0.07023859409187029)`.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, with a single square surface `0` from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. A new object, ID 7, is presented, which is also nearly square with side length approximately 0.0705. The object with ID 4 was successfully placed at the origin with no rotation. I need to place object 7 such that it does not collide with object 4, and is stable on surface 0.
           
           Object 4 has dimensions (0.09158626258820451, 0.09158626258820454) and was placed at (0, 0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 occupies the space from approximately (-0.0458, -0.0458) to (0.0458, 0.0458).
           
           Object 7 has dimensions (0.07052405218326091, 0.07052405218326085).
           When object 7 is axis-aligned, its half-dimensions are approximately 0.03526. The maximum x and y coordinates for its center would be `0.135 - 0.03526 = 0.09974`. The minimum would be `-0.09974`.
           When rotated by pi/4, its effective half-dimension is `0.5 * 0.07052405218326091 * sqrt(2) = 0.049866`. The allowed range for the center is `(-0.135 + 0.049866, 0.135 - 0.049866)`, which is `(-0.085134, 0.085134)`.
           
           To avoid collision with object 4, which is centered at (0,0) and extends from roughly (-0.0458, -0.0458) to (0.0458, 0.0458) (when axis aligned), I need to ensure that object 7's AABB does not overlap with this region.
           If object 7 is axis-aligned (half-size ~ 0.03526), its center must be at least `0.0458 + 0.03526 = 0.08106` away from the origin in x or y.
           
           I will generate placements for object 7 that are outside of the AABB of object 4, and within the bounds of surface 0.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface `0` from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. I have two previously placed objects that did not collide with fixed obstacles:
           - Object 4: (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.09158626258820451, 0.09158626258820454). This object occupies roughly (-0.0458, -0.0458) to (0.0458, 0.0458).
           - Object 7: (ID: 7) -- 0, 0.0, 0.082, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.07052405218326091, 0.07052405218326085). This object occupies roughly (0.082 - 0.0353, 0.0 - 0.0353) to (0.082 + 0.0353, 0.0 + 0.0353), which is (0.0467, -0.0353) to (0.1173, 0.0353).
           
           A new object, ID 5, is presented. It is also square with side length approximately 0.0972. I need to place object 5 such that it does not collide with objects 4 and 7, and is stable on surface 0.
           
           Object 5 has dimensions (0.09724125532110728, 0.09724125532110728).
           When axis-aligned, its half-dimensions are approximately 0.04862. The maximum x and y for its center would be `0.135 - 0.04862 = 0.08638`.
           When rotated by pi/4, its effective half-dimension is `0.5 * 0.09724125532110728 * sqrt(2) = 0.06875`. The allowed range for the center is `(-0.135 + 0.06875, 0.135 - 0.06875)`, which is `(-0.06625, 0.06625)`.
           
           Let's summarize occupied regions (approximate AABBs for axis-aligned objects):
           - Object 4: x in [-0.0458, 0.0458], y in [-0.0458, 0.0458]
           - Object 7: x in [0.0467, 0.1173], y in [-0.0353, 0.0353]
           
           I need to find a space for object 5 (half-size ~ 0.04862) that is not overlapping with these two.
           
           Candidate regions for object 5:
           1. Negative X-axis: The space to the left of object 4. This would be roughly `x < -0.0458`. Center for object 5 would need to be `x < -0.0458 - 0.04862 = -0.09442`. Given the surface limit of -0.135, and object 5 half-size, minimum x for center is -0.08638. So a placement like `(-0.08, 0)` could work.
           2. Positive Y-axis: The space above object 4. This would be `y > 0.0458`. Center for object 5 would need to be `y > 0.0458 + 0.04862 = 0.09442`. Given the surface limit of 0.135, and object 5 half-size, maximum y for center is 0.08638. So, this region is a bit tight. `(0, 0.08)` could be a candidate.
           3. Negative Y-axis: The space below object 4. This would be `y < -0.0458`. Center for object 5 would need to be `y < -0.0458 - 0.04862 = -0.09442`. `(0, -0.08)` could work.
           
           Given object 7 is at (0.082, 0.0), it partially blocks the positive X-axis region near object 4. So I will focus on the negative X and Y regions, and the positive Y regions, making sure to avoid the extent of object 7.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same square surface `0` from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. I have three previously placed objects that did not collide with fixed obstacles:
           - Object 4: (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.09158626258820451, 0.09158626258820454). This object (half-size ~ 0.0458) occupies roughly (-0.0458, -0.0458) to (0.0458, 0.0458).
           - Object 7: (ID: 7) -- 0, 0.0, 0.082, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.07052405218326091, 0.07052405218326085). This object (half-size ~ 0.0353) occupies roughly (0.0467, -0.0353) to (0.1173, 0.0353).
           - Object 5: (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.09724125532110728, 0.09724125532110728). This object (half-size ~ 0.0486) occupies roughly (-0.08 - 0.0486, 0.0 - 0.0486) to (-0.08 + 0.0486, 0.0 + 0.0486), which is (-0.1286, -0.0486) to (-0.0314, 0.0486).
           
           A new object, ID 8, is presented. It is square with side length approximately 0.0926. I need to place object 8 such that it does not collide with objects 4, 7, and 5, and is stable on surface 0.
           
           Object 8 has dimensions (0.09264221171421272, 0.09264221171421272).
           When axis-aligned, its half-dimensions are approximately 0.04632. The maximum x and y for its center would be `0.135 - 0.04632 = 0.08868`.
           When rotated by pi/4, its effective half-dimension is `0.5 * 0.09264221171421272 * sqrt(2) = 0.06551`. The allowed range for the center is `(-0.135 + 0.06551, 0.135 - 0.06551)`, which is `(-0.06949, 0.06949)`.
           
           Let's summarize occupied regions (approximate AABBs for axis-aligned objects):
           - Object 4: x in [-0.0458, 0.0458], y in [-0.0458, 0.0458]
           - Object 7: x in [0.0467, 0.1173], y in [-0.0353, 0.0353]
           - Object 5: x in [-0.1286, -0.0314], y in [-0.0486, 0.0486]
           
           I need to find a space for object 8 (half-size ~ 0.04632) that is not overlapping with these three.
           The central x-axis region is heavily occupied by objects 4, 7, and 5.
           - Object 4 is centered at (0,0).
           - Object 5 is centered at (-0.08, 0).
           - Object 7 is centered at (0.082, 0).
           
           The remaining open areas are primarily in the positive and negative y-directions.
           For example, in the positive y-direction, above object 4. The y-range of object 4 is `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`. So, for object 8, a center y-coordinate `y_center` needs to be `y_center > 0.0458 + 0.04632 = 0.09212`. The maximum y-center for object 8 is `0.08868`. This indicates that placing an object (especially axis-aligned) directly "above" object 4 is not possible if it needs to clear its AABB. This is where rotations become important. However, the largest dimension for the AABB of object 8 is `0.06551` (at pi/4 rotation).
           `0.0458 + 0.06551 = 0.11131`. Max y-center for pi/4 is `0.06949`. So, this region is also tight for rotated objects.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the free space.
           The surface is `[-0.135, 0.135]` x `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           Occupied by 4: `[-0.0458, 0.0458]` x `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`
           Occupied by 7: `[0.0467, 0.1173]` x `[-0.0353, 0.0353]`
           Occupied by 5: `[-0.1286, -0.0314]` x `[-0.0486, 0.0486]`
           
           It seems the "corridor" in the middle of the surface for y is blocked by objects 4, 5, and 7.
           We need to find space for a new object with half-size of around 0.046.
           
           Consider placing object 8 in one of the corners of the surface.
           For example, the top-left corner:
           The x-range of object 5 is `[-0.1286, -0.0314]`. So, to be to the left of object 5 would require `x < -0.1286 - 0.046 = -0.1746`, which is outside the surface.
           To be to the right of object 5, x-center needs to be `x > -0.0314 + 0.046 = 0.0146`. But this would collide with object 4.
           
           Consider the space in the top-left quadrant of the surface.
           If we place it in the top-left corner, it would need its center at roughly `(-0.135 + 0.046, 0.135 - 0.046) = (-0.089, 0.089)`.
           Let's check for collision with other objects:
           Object 5 extends up to `y = 0.0486`. So `0.089` is above it.
           Object 4 extends up to `y = 0.0458`. So `0.089` is above it.
           Object 5 extends up to `x = -0.0314`. So `-0.089` is to the left of it.
           Object 4 extends up to `x = 0.0458`. So `-0.089` is to the left of it.
           This seems like a promising region. Let's try `(-0.08, 0.08)` for example.

Model:     The scene is still the square surface `0` from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. I have four previously placed objects that did not collide with fixed obstacles:
           - Object 4: (ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.09158626258820451, 0.09158626258820454). This object (half-size ~ 0.0458) occupies roughly `x in [-0.0458, 0.0458], y in [-0.0458, 0.0458]`.
           - Object 7: (ID: 7) -- 0, 0.0, 0.082, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.07052405218326091, 0.07052405218326085). This object (half-size ~ 0.0353) occupies roughly `x in [0.0467, 0.1173], y in [-0.0353, 0.0353]`.
           - Object 5: (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0. Dimensions: (0.09724125532110728, 0.09724125532110728). This object (half-size ~ 0.0486) occupies roughly `x in [-0.1286, -0.0314], y in [-0.0486, 0.0486]`.
           - Object 8: (ID: 8) -- 0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08. Dimensions: (0.09264221171421272, 0.09264221171421272). This object (half-size ~ 0.0463) occupies roughly `x in [-0.1263, -0.0337], y in [0.0337, 0.1263]`.
           
           A new object, ID 6, is presented. It is square with side length approximately 0.0982. I need to place object 6 such that it does not collide with objects 4, 7, 5, and 8, and is stable on surface 0.
           
           Object 6 has dimensions (0.09820500590012926, 0.09820500590012926).
           When axis-aligned, its half-dimensions are approximately 0.0491. The maximum x and y for its center would be `0.135 - 0.0491 = 0.0859`.
           When rotated by pi/4, its effective half-dimension is `0.5 * 0.09820500590012926 * sqrt(2) = 0.06944`. The allowed range for the center is `(-0.135 + 0.06944, 0.135 - 0.06944)`, which is `(-0.06556, 0.06556)`.
           
           Let's summarize occupied regions (approximate AABBs for axis-aligned objects):
           - Object 4: `x in [-0.0458, 0.0458]`, `y in [-0.0458, 0.0458]` (Center: (0,0))
           - Object 7: `x in [0.0467, 0.1173]`, `y in [-0.0353, 0.0353]` (Center: (0.082, 0.0))
           - Object 5: `x in [-0.1286, -0.0314]`, `y in [-0.0486, 0.0486]` (Center: (-0.08, 0.0))
           - Object 8: `x in [-0.1263, -0.0337]`, `y in [0.0337, 0.1263]` (Center: (-0.08, 0.08))
           
           The surface corners are being filled.
           Top-left corner occupied by object 8.
           Bottom-left seems open. Let's try `(-0.08, -0.08)` for object 6 (half-size ~ 0.0491).
           - It needs `x > -0.135 + 0.0491 = -0.0859` and `y > -0.135 + 0.0491 = -0.0859`. So `(-0.08, -0.08)` is within the surface.
           - Check collision with object 4 (`y` range `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`): Object 6's y-range would be `[-0.08 - 0.0491, -0.08 + 0.0491] = [-0.1291, -0.0309]`. This is below object 4.
           - Check collision with object 4 (`x` range `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`): Object 6's x-range would be `[-0.08 - 0.0491, -0.08 + 0.0491] = [-0.1291, -0.0309]`. This is to the left of object 4.
           - Check collision with object 5 (`x` range `[-0.1286, -0.0314]`, `y` range `[-0.0486, 0.0486]`): Object 6's x-range `[-0.1291, -0.0309]` overlaps with object 5's x-range `[-0.1286, -0.0314]`. Specifically, they almost perfectly align on the right edge. Object 6's left edge is slightly outside of object 5's left edge. But they are also aligned in x, and object 5 has a y-range that overlaps with object 6 if object 6 is at (-0.08, -0.08). The y range of object 6 would be `[-0.1291, -0.0309]`, and object 5 is `[-0.0486, 0.0486]`. These y-ranges overlap. Specifically, `[-0.0486, -0.0309]` is an overlap. So `(-0.08, -0.08)` will collide with object 5.
           
           I need to place object 6 carefully. Let's look for corners not occupied, or edges.
           Current occupancy pattern roughly:
           `X X . . .`
           `X 4 7 . .`
           `X 4 7 . .`
           `X . . . .`
           `X . . . .`
           where X is some part of 4, 5, 7, 8.
           
           Object 4 is at (0,0). Object 5 is at (-0.08,0). Object 7 is at (0.082,0). Object 8 is at (-0.08,0.08).
           This means the entire 'middle' row `y in [-0.0486, 0.0486]` (from object 5's Y-extent) is heavily occupied from x `[-0.1286, 0.1173]`.
           
           Let's consider the region `y < -0.0486` (below object 5) or `y > 0.0486` (above object 5).
           And also `y < -0.0458` (below object 4).
           And `y < -0.0353` (below object 7).
           
           Basically, we are looking for a clear 'strip' along y.
           A clear area is roughly for `y` between `[-0.135, -0.0491 - 0.0486] = [-0.135, -0.0977]` (to clear object 5) or `y` between `[0.0491 + 0.0486, 0.135] = [0.0977, 0.135]` (to clear object 5).
           Given object 6 half-size (0.0491), its center needs to be in:
           `y_center < -0.0977 + 0.0491 = -0.0486` (this is wrong, should be `y_center < -0.0486 - 0.0491 = -0.0977`) no, no.
           
           The available y-range for the center of an axis-aligned object 6 (half-size 0.0491) is `[-0.135+0.0491, 0.135-0.0491] = [-0.0859, 0.0859]`.
           Looking at the lowest y-value that any existing object occupies: object 5 at `y = -0.0486`. So, the bottom edge of object 6 must be less than -0.0486. This means its center y must be less than `-0.0486 - 0.0491 = -0.0977`.
           This is outside the available range for object 6's center `[-0.0859, 0.0859]`.
           This means an axis-aligned object 6 cannot be placed completely below any of objects 4, 5, or 7.
           
           What about a region with only one object below it?
           Object 7 (y-range `[-0.0353, 0.0353]`) is the narrowest.
           If we want to place object 6 directly below object 7 (or not overlapping its y range), the center for object 6 needs to be `y_center < -0.0353 - 0.0491 = -0.0844`. This is within `[-0.0859, 0.0859]`.
           So, we can try `(0.082, -0.084)` as a center for object 6.
           Let's check `x = 0.082` for object 6 (half-size 0.0491): x-range `[0.082 - 0.0491, 0.082 + 0.0491] = [0.0329, 0.1311]`.
           Check overlaps:
           - Object 4 (`x` range `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`, `y` range `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`): Object 6 x-range `[0.0329, 0.1311]` overlaps with 4's x-range `[-0.0458, 0.0458]` (intersection `[0.0329, 0.0458]`). Also, object 6 y-range `[-0.1331, -0.0349]` overlaps with 4's y-range `[-0.0458, 0.0458]` (intersection `[-0.0458, -0.0349]`). So, `(0.082, -0.084)` collides with object 4.
           
           The space is getting very constrained. Let's try placing object 6 in the bottom-right corner.
           Center: `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           Object 6 (half-size 0.0491).
           x-range: `[0.08 - 0.0491, 0.08 + 0.0491] = [0.0309, 0.1291]`.
           y-range: `[-0.08 - 0.0491, -0.08 + 0.0491] = [-0.1291, -0.0309]`.
           - With Object 4 (x in `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`, y in `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`): Overlap in x `[0.0309, 0.0458]`. Overlap in y `[-0.0458, -0.0309]`. Collision.
           - With Object 7 (x in `[0.0467, 0.1173]`, y in `[-0.0353, 0.0353]`): Overlap in y `[-0.0353, -0.0309]`. Overlap in x `[0.0467, 0.1173]` and `[0.0309, 0.1291]` (intersection `[0.0467, 0.1173]`). Collision.
           
           It seems I cannot place axis-aligned objects in the corners with an 0.08 offset without collision. The objects are quite large relative to the gaps.
           I will try to offset the centers slightly further, ensuring they are still within the surface boundaries.
           
           Let's try to place it at the edges.
           Consider the top-right corner. Max center for an axis-aligned object 6: `(0.0859, 0.0859)`.
           Object 6 at `(0.085, 0.085)` (half-size 0.0491):
           x-range: `[0.085 - 0.0491, 0.085 + 0.0491] = [0.0359, 0.1341]`.
           y-range: `[0.085 - 0.0491, 0.085 + 0.0491] = [0.0359, 0.1341]`.
           - Object 4 (x `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`, y `[-0.0458, 0.0458]`): No x-overlap. No y-overlap. OK.
           - Object 7 (x `[0.0467, 0.1173]`, y `[-0.0353, 0.0353]`): No y-overlap. No collision.
           - Object 5 (x `[-0.1286, -0.0314]`, y `[-0.0486, 0.0486]`): No x-overlap. No y-overlap. OK.
           - Object 8 (x `[-0.1263, -0.0337]`, y `[0.0337, 0.1263]`): No x-overlap. No collision.
           
           This seems like a promising placement! `(0.085, 0.085)` for object 6.
