           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is a square with dimensions 0.081x0.081. Since the object is a square, its orientation does not affect its bounding box, so I will only consider theta = 0. The object is significantly smaller than the surface, so there is plenty of space for placement. I will try to place the object in various positions across the surface, covering the center and corners.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID 5) is also a square, with dimensions 0.084x0.084. Its orientation does not affect its bounding box, so I will only consider theta = 0. The object is still significantly smaller than the surface.
           
           I now also have information about the placement of object ID 4, which is at (0, 0, 0, 0). I need to ensure that the new placement for object ID 5 does not collide with object ID 4. Object ID 4 has dimensions 0.081x0.081. This means its bounding box extends from -0.0405 to 0.0405 in both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, the new object (ID 5, size 0.084x0.084) must be placed such that its bounding box does not overlap with ID 4's bounding box. The half-size of object 5 is 0.04204.
           So, the center of object 5 must be at least 0.0405 + 0.04204 = 0.08254 units away from the origin in either x or y, if it were to be placed directly adjacent. I will try to place it further away to ensure no overlap.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, a single square surface centered at the origin, 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID 6) is also a square, with dimensions 0.095x0.095. Its orientation does not affect its bounding box, so I will only consider theta = 0.
           
           I now have information about the placement of object ID 4 at (0, 0, 0, 0) and object ID 5 at (0, 0, 0.09, 0.0). I need to ensure the new placement for object ID 6 does not collide with either of these.
           
           Object ID 4: center (0,0), half-size 0.0405. Bounding box: x in [-0.0405, 0.0405], y in [-0.0405, 0.0405].
           Object ID 5: center (0.09,0), half-size 0.04204. Bounding box: x in [0.09 - 0.04204, 0.09 + 0.04204] = [0.04796, 0.13204], y in [-0.04204, 0.04204].
           
           The new object ID 6 has half-size 0.04768.
           
           To avoid collision with ID 4, the center of ID 6 must be at least 0.0405 + 0.04768 = 0.08818 units away from the origin in x or y.
           To avoid collision with ID 5, the center of ID 6 must be at least 0.04204 + 0.04768 = 0.08972 units away from (0.09, 0) in x or y.
           
           Looking at the currently placed objects:
           ID 4 is from x=-0.0405 to x=0.0405.
           ID 5 is from x=0.04796 to x=0.13204.
           The gap between ID 4 and ID 5 in the x-direction is 0.04796 - 0.0405 = 0.00746. This is too small for object 6 (half-width 0.04768).
           So I cannot place object 6 between 4 and 5 along the x-axis.
           
           I will try placing object 6 on the negative x-side or on the y-axis, far enough from both.
           The total surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Max x for object 6's center: 0.135 - 0.04768 = 0.08732.
           Min x for object 6's center: -0.135 + 0.04768 = -0.08732.
           Max y for object 6's center: 0.08732.
           Min y for object 6's center: -0.08732.
           
           Given ID 4 is centered at (0,0) and ID 5 at (0.09,0).
           Let's try placing ID 6 on the negative x side, e.g., at (-0.09, 0).
           Its bounding box would be x in [-0.09 - 0.04768, -0.09 + 0.04768] = [-0.13768, -0.04232]. This would go out of bounds on the left, which is not allowed. The max negative x-center is -0.08732.
           So placing at (-0.085, 0) or similar.
           Let's check (-0.085, 0):
           x range: [-0.085-0.04768, -0.085+0.04768] = [-0.13268, -0.03732].
           This range does not overlap with ID 4's x-range [-0.0405, 0.0405]. It also does not overlap with ID 5's x-range [0.04796, 0.13204].
           This looks like a good candidate.
           
           Let's try placing it on the y-axis, e.g. (0, 0.09).
           Bounding box for ID 6 at (0, 0.09): x in [-0.04768, 0.04768], y in [0.09-0.04768, 0.09+0.04768] = [0.04232, 0.13768].
           Does this collide with ID 4? ID 4 y-range is [-0.0405, 0.0405]. No collision in y. X-ranges also overlap, but since y-ranges don't, it's fine.
           Does this collide with ID 5? ID 5 y-range is [-0.04204, 0.04204]. No collision in y.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface centered at the origin, 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID 7) is also a square, with dimensions 0.091x0.091. Its orientation does not affect its bounding box, so I will only consider theta = 0.
           
           I now have information about the placement of objects ID 4, 5, and 6. I need to ensure the new placement for object ID 7 does not collide with any of these.
           
           Object ID 4: center (0,0), half-size 0.0405. Bounding box: x in [-0.0405, 0.0405], y in [-0.0405, 0.0405].
           Object ID 5: center (0.09,0), half-size 0.04204. Bounding box: x in [0.09 - 0.04204, 0.09 + 0.04204] = [0.04796, 0.13204], y in [-0.04204, 0.04204].
           Object ID 6: center (-0.085,0), half-size 0.04768. Bounding box: x in [-0.085 - 0.04768, -0.085 + 0.04768] = [-0.13268, -0.03732], y in [-0.04768, 0.04768].
           
           The new object ID 7 has half-size 0.0455.
           
           Current arrangement along the x-axis:
           ID 6: [-0.13268, -0.03732]
           ID 4: [-0.0405, 0.0405]
           ID 5: [0.04796, 0.13204]
           
           Notice that the objects are all centered on y=0 and they are quite spread out along the x-axis. This suggests placing the new object centered on the y-axis (i.e. x=0) but with a positive or negative y-coordinate.
           
           Let's try placing ID 7 at (0, 0.09).
           Its bounding box would be x in [-0.0455, 0.0455], y in [0.09-0.0455, 0.09+0.0455] = [0.0445, 0.1355].
           Check for collision with existing objects:
           ID 4 (x in [-0.0405, 0.0405], y in [-0.0405, 0.0405]):
             x-overlap: [-0.0405, 0.0405] overlaps with [-0.0455, 0.0455]
             y-overlap: [-0.0405, 0.0405] does NOT overlap with [0.0445, 0.1355] (0.0405 < 0.0445). No collision.
           ID 5 (x in [0.04796, 0.13204], y in [-0.04204, 0.04204]):
             x-overlap: [-0.0455, 0.0455] does NOT overlap with [0.04796, 0.13204] (0.0455 < 0.04796). No collision.
           ID 6 (x in [-0.13268, -0.03732], y in [-0.04768, 0.04768]):
             x-overlap: [-0.0455, 0.0455] does NOT overlap with [-0.13268, -0.03732] (-0.03732 < -0.0455). No collision.
           
           This placement (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09) seems valid and stable.
           Also, the maximum y coordinate for object 7's center is 0.135 - 0.0455 = 0.0895. So 0.09 is slightly out of bounds. Let's try 0.085.
           New proposed placement for ID 7: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.085).
           Its bounding box would be x in [-0.0455, 0.0455], y in [0.085-0.0455, 0.085+0.0455] = [0.0395, 0.1305].
           Check again:
           ID 4 (x in [-0.0405, 0.0405], y in [-0.0405, 0.0405]):
             y-overlap: [-0.0405, 0.0405] overlaps with [0.0395, 0.1305] in y coordinate (specifically at y=0.0395). Collision!
           My previous check was flawed. 0.0405 > 0.0395, so there is indeed an overlap in y.
           
           Let's recalculate the minimum separation needed.
           Center of ID 7: (x7, y7). Half-size of ID 7: h7 = 0.0455.
           Center of ID 4: (0,0). Half-size of ID 4: h4 = 0.0405.
           For no collision between ID 7 and ID 4: |x7 - 0| >= h7 + h4 OR |y7 - 0| >= h7 + h4.
           h7 + h4 = 0.0455 + 0.0405 = 0.086.
           So, if x7 = 0, then |y7| must be >= 0.086.
           If y7 = 0, then |x7| must be >= 0.086.
           
           Center of ID 5: (0.09,0). Half-size of ID 5: h5 = 0.04204.
           h7 + h5 = 0.0455 + 0.04204 = 0.08754.
           If y7 = 0, then |x7 - 0.09| must be >= 0.08754.
           This means x7 must be >= 0.09 + 0.08754 = 0.17754 (too far right for the surface)
           or x7 must be <= 0.09 - 0.08754 = 0.00246.
           If x7 is near 0, then we need to ensure |y7| is greater than h7+h5 = 0.08754.
           
           Center of ID 6: (-0.085,0). Half-size of ID 6: h6 = 0.04768.
           h7 + h6 = 0.0455 + 0.04768 = 0.09318.
           If y7 = 0, then |x7 - (-0.085)| must be >= 0.09318.
           x7 + 0.085 >= 0.09318 => x7 >= 0.00818
           or x7 + 0.085 <= -0.09318 => x7 <= -0.17818 (too far left for the surface)
           If x7 is near 0, then we need to ensure |y7| is greater than h7+h6 = 0.09318.
           
           So, if placing along x=0 (y-axis): |y7| must be >= 0.086 (from ID 4) and also >= 0.08754 (from ID 5) and >= 0.09318 (from ID 6). So |y7| must be at least 0.09318.
           Max y for ID 7 center: 0.135 - 0.0455 = 0.0895.
           This means I cannot place ID 7 centered on x=0. The required separation (0.09318) exceeds the maximum allowed center y (0.0895).
           
           This means the object must be placed such that its x-coordinate is not 0, or its y-coordinate is not 0.
           Let's re-evaluate placement on the y-axis, but with an x-offset. For example, x = 0.05.
           If center is (0.05, Y):
           Check against ID 4: (0,0). For no overlap: |0.05 - 0| >= 0.086 (false, 0.05 < 0.086) OR |Y - 0| >= 0.086. So we need |Y| >= 0.086.
           Check against ID 5: (0.09,0). For no overlap: |0.05 - 0.09| = |-0.04| = 0.04. This is NOT >= 0.08754. So, we need |Y - 0| >= 0.08754. So we need |Y| >= 0.08754.
           Check against ID 6: (-0.085,0). For no overlap: |0.05 - (-0.085)| = |0.135|. This IS >= 0.09318. No y separation needed for ID 6.
           
           So if x7 = 0.05, we need |y7| >= 0.08754.
           Max y for ID 7 center: 0.0895.
           So a placement like (0, 0.0, 0.05, 0.088) would be valid.
           Let's verify this again.
           Center (0.05, 0.088). Half-size 0.0455.
           Bounding box: x in [0.05-0.0455, 0.05+0.0455] = [0.0045, 0.0955].
                         y in [0.088-0.0455, 0.088+0.0455] = [0.0425, 0.1335].
           Surface bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135]. This is within bounds.
           
           Collision checks:
           ID 4 (center (0,0), half-size 0.0405):
             x-range: [-0.0405, 0.0405]. Object 7 x-range: [0.0045, 0.0955]. Overlap in x is [0.0045, 0.0405].
             y-range: [-0.0405, 0.0405]. Object 7 y-range: [0.0425, 0.1335]. No overlap in y (0.0405 < 0.0425). No collision with ID 4.
           ID 5 (center (0.09,0), half-size 0.04204):
             x-range: [0.04796, 0.13204]. Object 7 x-range: [0.0045, 0.0955]. Overlap in x is [0.04796, 0.0955].
             y-range: [-0.04204, 0.04204]. Object 7 y-range: [0.0425, 0.1335]. No overlap in y (0.04204 < 0.0425). No collision with ID 5.
           ID 6 (center (-0.085,0), half-size 0.04768):
             x-range: [-0.13268, -0.03732]. Object 7 x-range: [0.0045, 0.0955]. No overlap in x. No collision with ID 6.
           
           This strategy works! I can try various (x,y) pairs for the center of ID 7, making sure the object is far enough from other objects and within surface bounds.
           
           Another option: (-0.05, 0.088).
           Center (-0.05, 0.088). Half-size 0.0455.
           Bounding box: x in [-0.05-0.0455, -0.05+0.0455] = [-0.0955, -0.0045].
                         y in [0.088-0.0455, 0.088+0.0455] = [0.0425, 0.1335].
           Collision checks:
           ID 4 (center (0,0), half-size 0.0405):
             x-range: [-0.0405, 0.0405]. Object 7 x-range: [-0.0955, -0.0045]. Overlap in x is [-0.0405, -0.0045].
             y-range: [-0.0405, 0.0405]. Object 7 y-range: [0.0425, 0.1335]. No overlap in y. No collision with ID 4.
           ID 5 (center (0.09,0), half-size 0.04204):
             x-range: [0.04796, 0.13204]. Object 7 x-range: [-0.0955, -0.0045]. No overlap in x. No collision.
           ID 6 (center (-0.085,0), half-size 0.04768):
             x-range: [-0.13268, -0.03732]. Object 7 x-range: [-0.0955, -0.0045]. Overlap in x is [-0.0955, -0.03732].
             y-range: [-0.04768, 0.04768]. Object 7 y-range: [0.0425, 0.1335]. No overlap in y (0.04768 < 0.0425 is false, but 0.04768 is less than 0.0425 is also false. 0.0425 is greater than 0.04768 (false), let me recheck. Y_obj6_upper = 0.04768. Y_obj7_lower = 0.0425. No overlap.) No collision with ID 6.
           
           This also seems valid. I'll use this method to generate diverse placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains a single square surface centered at the origin, 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID 8) is a square, with dimensions 0.09897x0.09897. Its orientation does not affect its bounding box, so I will only consider theta = 0.

           Max center coordinates for ID 8 on the surface: 0.135 - h8 = 0.135 - 0.049487 = 0.085513.
           Min center coordinates for ID 8 on the surface: -0.085513.
           
           Let's find a clear area for ID 8.
           Current object arrangement:
           Mostly centered along y=0:
           ID 6: x in [-0.13268, -0.03732] (y in [-0.04768, 0.04768])
           ID 4: x in [-0.0405, 0.0405] (y in [-0.0405, 0.0405])
           ID 5: x in [0.04796, 0.13204] (y in [-0.04204, 0.04204])
           
           One object is placed with a positive y:
           ID 7: x in [0.0045, 0.0955], y in [0.0425, 0.1335].
           
           Consider placing ID 8 in the bottom half of the surface, i.e., y < 0.
           
           Let's try to place ID 8 at (x8, y8) where y8 is negative.
           For example, try y8 = -0.08.
           Need to check x-overlap for all existing objects if y8 is -0.08.
           y-range for ID 8: [-0.08 - h8, -0.08 + h8] = [-0.08 - 0.049487, -0.08 + 0.049487] = [-0.129487, -0.030513].
           
           Check y-overlap with existing objects:
           ID 4: y in [-0.0405, 0.0405]. Overlaps with ID 8 y-range? Yes, [-0.0405, -0.030513].
           ID 5: y in [-0.04204, 0.04204]. Overlaps with ID 8 y-range? Yes, [-0.04204, -0.030513].
           ID 6: y in [-0.04768, 0.04768]. Overlaps with ID 8 y-range? Yes, [-0.04768, -0.030513].
           ID 7: y in [0.0425, 0.1335]. No y-overlap.
           
           Since there is y-overlap with ID 4, 5, and 6, we need to ensure x-separation from them.
           Required x-separation for ID 8 (h8=0.049487):
           From ID 4 (h4=0.0405): min_x_sep = h8 + h4 = 0.049487 + 0.0405 = 0.089987.
           From ID 5 (h5=0.04204): min_x_sep = h8 + h5 = 0.049487 + 0.04204 = 0.091527.
           From ID 6 (h6=0.04768): min_x_sep = h8 + h6 = 0.049487 + 0.04768 = 0.097167.
           
           Let's try placing ID 8 at (x8, -0.08).
           To avoid collision with ID 4 (centered at (0,0)): |x8 - 0| must be >= 0.089987. So |x8| >= 0.089987.
           To avoid collision with ID 5 (centered at (0.09,0)): |x8 - 0.09| must be >= 0.091527.
             x8 >= 0.09 + 0.091527 = 0.181527 (out of bounds)
             x8 <= 0.09 - 0.091527 = -0.001527.
           To avoid collision with ID 6 (centered at (-0.085,0)): |x8 - (-0.085)| must be >= 0.097167.
             x8 + 0.085 >= 0.097167 => x8 >= 0.012167.
             x8 + 0.085 <= -0.097167 => x8 <= -0.182167 (out of bounds)
           
           So we need:
           |x8| >= 0.089987 (from ID 4)
           x8 <= -0.001527 (from ID 5)
           x8 >= 0.012167 (from ID 6)
           
           These conditions (x8 <= -0.001527 AND x8 >= 0.012167) are contradictory. This means that at y=-0.08, there is no x position that avoids collision with both ID 5 and ID 6 simultaneously due to their x-positions. This means placing ID 8 with y = -0.08 is not feasible.
           
           Let's try a y-position that completely avoids existing objects along the y-axis.
           The y-ranges of existing objects are roughly:
           ID 4: [-0.0405, 0.0405]
           ID 5: [-0.04204, 0.04204]
           ID 6: [-0.04768, 0.04768]
           ID 7: [0.0425, 0.1335]
           
           The common y-range for objects 4, 5, 6 is roughly [-0.04768, 0.04768].
           So, if ID 8 is placed with a y-coordinate such that its y-range does not overlap with this, and also does not overlap with ID 7, it will be good.
           
           Let's try placing ID 8 with y-center at -0.1.
           Its y-range would be [-0.1 - 0.049487, -0.1 + 0.049487] = [-0.149487, -0.050513].
           This range does not overlap with ID 4, 5, 6, or 7. So no x-separation is needed!
           The lower bound -0.149487 is outside the surface lower_y (-0.135). So -0.1 is too low for the center.
           
           Let's try y-center at -0.085.
           ID 8 y-range: [-0.085 - 0.049487, -0.085 + 0.049487] = [-0.134487, -0.035513].
           This is within surface bounds: [-0.135, 0.135].
           This y-range [-0.134487, -0.035513] does NOT overlap with:
           ID 4: [-0.0405, 0.0405] (since -0.035513 > -0.0405 is true, no overlap)
           ID 5: [-0.04204, 0.04204] (since -0.035513 > -0.04204 is true, no overlap)
           ID 6: [-0.04768, 0.04768] (since -0.035513 > -0.04768 is true, no overlap)
           ID 7: [0.0425, 0.1335] (no overlap)
           
           So, a placement at (x, -0.085) for object ID 8 will not collide with any of the existing objects, as long as it's within the surface bounds.
           Let's choose x=0 for simplicity.
           Proposed placement: (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.085).
           Its x-range: [-0.049487, 0.049487]. This is within [-0.135, 0.135].
           Its y-range: [-0.134487, -0.035513]. This is within [-0.135, 0.135].
           This seems like a perfectly valid placement.
