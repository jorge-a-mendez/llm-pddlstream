           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but upon deep analysis, I've concluded it's currently unachievable due to constraints within the initial state and available actions. The key problem lies in the inability to move the rovers to configurations required for image acquisition and transmission.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` demands I establish both `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.  To get those, I'd need the `send_image` action. And to do *that*, I would need to get `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`.  I can get *that* with `take_image`, but *that* action has a crucial *atconf* precondition: *The robot needs to be *at* the configuration specified by the `imagevisible` facts.*
           
           However, the initial state defines the rover's positions as `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The available `move` actions are limited to *self-motions* – the rovers effectively can only "move to themselves."  Furthermore, I see that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are *not* tied to the current configurations. They only show configurations with '#' in them.  The rules state that I must provide a continuous value for configurations with '#' IF that configuration is the second argument of an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate.  However, this doesn't help me! The rovers are *not* at these configurations!  Because I can't move them!
           
           Therefore, the `atconf` precondition for `take_image` and `send_image` can never be met with the given initial state and move actions.  So, I can't get the images and can't receive them!
           
           The problem statement mentions: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..." However, the rovers are locked to their starting configurations.
           
           The `blocked` condition doesn't change anything, because since `#o0` and `#o3` are not `atconf`, it won't be true, and the constraint is met.
           
           Therefore, because I cannot move the rovers to the necessary configurations for acquiring and transmitting images, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable given the initial state and the restricted set of move actions.
