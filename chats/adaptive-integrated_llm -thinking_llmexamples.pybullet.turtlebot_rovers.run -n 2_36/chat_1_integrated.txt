           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.**  I'll be using rover `v14` for all tasks, since it seems the most suitable. First, I need to take and send images of objectives `v17` and `v18` with camera `v10`. To do this, I will:
           
           1.  **Move `v14` to a specific image-taking configuration (`#o3`)**:  I have to give specific coordinates for this configuration. Let's say this position is `(0.7005, 1.943)`, chosen because it's approximately mid-way between the locations of the two objectives.
           
           2.  **Calibrate the camera**: I will have `v14`'s camera `v10` calibrate on the images of `v17` and `v18`.
           
           3.  **Take the images**: I'll take images of `v17` and `v18`, with the camera.
           
           4.  **Communicate**: Next, I'll move `v14` to `(-1.0, -1.75)` which is a suitable communications spot, and I'll send the images I took to the lander.
           
           Then, I need to get analysis of two rock types:  stone (type `v2`) and soil (type `v6`).  I will choose the stone rock `v4` and the soil rock `v5`.
           For these two rocks, I will:
           
           1.  **Move to a sampling configuration (#o5)**: For that, I need to be *above* them, and from the information available, a common position should be possible. The coordinate I chose is the center of the stone rock `(-0.9285, -0.1815)`.
           
           2.  **Sample and send rock analysis**: I'll sample rock `v4`, then move to the communication position and send its analysis. Then drop the rock. After this, I'll sample rock `v5`, move to the communication configuration to send its analysis, and then drop that rock too.
           
           Finally, I'll return `v14` to its initial configuration.
           That should meet the goal requirements for `new-axiom@0()`, assuming I understood all the constraints correctly. Let's hope it works!

           **The Goal:** The mission is clear. Rovers `v12` and `v14` start at their initial configurations, their stores are free, and we need to receive images of objectives `v17` and `v18`, plus analyses of rocks `v4` and `v5`. `v14` is the key player here.
           
           **Key Challenges & Reasoning:**
           
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** The previous plan failed due to a collision issue with obstacle `v19` at the proposed `#o3` configuration. My primary focus was to find new `#o3` configurations (positions for rover `v14` to take pictures) that are both collision-free and allow `v14` to "see" objectives `v17` and `v18`.
           *   **Reachable Configurations:** The initial plan's use of `#o0` (presumably for communication) was flagged as "not reachable." This means I had to make sure the proposed communication position was accessible, and not in collision with `v19`.
           
           **The New Plan:**
           
           1.  **Imaging:** I'm using *two* separate configurations for `#o3`:
               *   `#o3_v17 = (1.5, 2.0)` to image `v17`. This should be collision-free.
               *   `#o3_v18 = (-0.1, 1.85)` to image `v18`. This should also be collision-free.
           
               Since the problem states that the plan can use different values for `#o3` for the different images, this is acceptable.
           
           2.  **Communication:** I have re-evaluated the initial communication position (#o0), and re-calculated the position as `-1.1 -1.7` (still within the com range) to communicate with the lander.
           
           3.  **Sampling:** I determined the best position for a "sampling" action to sample all rocks, and proposed the point `#o5 = (-1.53, -0.65)` for rover `v14`. This should avoid collisions and be close enough to the rocks to allow `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` to be true.
           
           4.  **Action Sequence (Overview):**
               *   Move `v14` from initial config to `#o3_v17`. Take a picture.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v17` to `#o3_v18`. Take a picture.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v18` to `#o0` to communicate the images.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5`. Sample rock `v4`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0` to communicate. Drop rock.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5`. Sample rock `v5`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0` to communicate. Drop rock.
               *   Move `v14` to `v15`, the initial position.
           
           **The most crucial points from the rules:**
           
           *   The given actions are the only ones allowed.
           *   The "continuous values" must be supplied for the image and communication locations (the configurations used in `imagevisible` and `comvisible`).
           *   Configurations will be provided.
           
           **The Configurations Section should look like this (according to the rules)**
           `--Configurations--:`
           `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (1.5 2.0)`
           `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (-0.1 1.85)`
           `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.1 -1.7)`
           
           **Rationale for Omission of #o5 in Configurations:**
           The initial interpretation based on how `above` is used made me want to include a configuration for `#o5`. But the rules are explicit. Only `#` objects *used in* imagevisible or comvisible require configurations. I *can't* provide an explicit configuration for a predicate like `above`. The separate algorithm will find the continuous value for this.

(Thoughts: **My Re-Evaluation of the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous plan had some issues with reachability and collisions. Time to dig in and make sure this new plan is rock solid. The main task is still to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but this requires specific actions: getting images, analyzing samples, and communicating the results. I need to get the rover, `v14`, to the right spots to do all of these things.
           
           The key challenge is the rover's movements, which need to be collision-free. I've got to deal with three obstacles that weren't a problem before: `v19`, `v20`, and `v21`. These are all boxes in the world, and I need to plot routes around them. I'll need a good mix of positions that are both reachable *and* provide clear lines of sight to the targets.
           
           The starting points are fixed, though. The other rover, `v12`, will be stationary at `v13`. It's `v14` I need to move. It begins at `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` and, as far as I can tell, I should be able to get it where it needs to go.
           
           *   **Imaging:** For the image targets (`v17` and `v18`), I'll need to calculate reachable poses for `v14`. I'll first check the coordinates and distance to the obstacles, and then run a line-of-sight check.
           *   **Communication:** I have to get `v14` near the lander `v9`. I'll use a similar methodology to my imaging, but here I can be a little bit more relaxed on the visibility, as long as it's within range.
           *   **Sampling:** Since I'm not providing a position for the sampling configuration, `o5`, the system will generate it, but I'll make sure it's possible in the layout, based on its relation to the rocks.
           
           I've learned from the feedback that "not reachable" probably means I chose configurations too far away, or that there were obstructions. I will try to be more strategic this time. The strategy is straightforward: first find feasible points that are near the ideal points. Then, I need to choose configurations that are clear of obstacles.
           
           I am *not* going to specify a value for `#o5` as it is not needed according to the criteria. Let's see what happens.

(Thoughts: **A Strategic Plan for PDDL Goal Achievement in the Rovers Domain**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to reach the `Atom new-axiom@0()` goal, which expands into specific `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the `rovers` domain. The task involves two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each equipped with a camera, tasked with imaging specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`) and analyzing rocks (`v4`, `v5`), then sending the data to the lander (`v9`).
           
           The core of the challenge lies in the rovers' need to navigate a constrained environment, avoiding collisions with obstacles like `v19`, `v20`, `v21`, and `v22`. Previous attempts highlighted significant problems, namely, `v20`, a vertical wall at x=0, creates a significant separation obstacle to reach objectives on opposite sides of the wall. This made achieving `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` difficult because the objectives and lander are all located on the opposite side of `v20`. Moreover, configuration planning needs to avoid collision.
           
           My analysis reveals a key insight: `v12` (initially on the right side) must image `v17`, while `v14` (initially on the left side) must image `v18`, analyze rocks, and transmit the data to the lander. This division of labor is essential to navigate the spatial constraints imposed by `v20`. The previous plan that failed, attempted to have `v14` get images of both `v17` and `v18`, this would have required the rover to cross `v20`, which is where most previous failures occurred.
           
           The current plan uses continuous motion configurations, defined by continuous values for `#o0` (communication), `#o3` (imaging), and `#o5` (sampling). Therefore, I've had to carefully select new, reachable, and collision-free configurations for the two rovers.
           
           For `v12`, I've assigned:
           *   `#o3_1`:  `(1.8, 1.9)` for imaging objective `v17`. This position is collision-free and within the 2-unit range.
           *   `#o0_1`: `(1.0, -1.0)` for communication, on the right side of `v20` and reachable given `comvisible` precondition.
           
           For `v14`, I've assigned:
           *   `#o3_2`:  `(-1.0, 1.9)` for imaging objective `v18`. This is reachable and collision-free
           *   `#o5`: `-1.5, -0.5)` for sampling. This location provides access to both `v4` and `v5`.
           *   `#o0_2`: `(-1.5, -2.0)` for communicating with the lander.
           
           The final, refined plan is as follows:
           
           **Rover v12 Plan:**
           1.  Move to imaging config (`#o3_1`).
           2.  Calibrate and image `v17`.
           3.  Move to communication config (`#o0_1`).
           4.  Send the image of `v17`.
           5.  Return to starting position.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan:**
           1.  Move to imaging config (`#o3_2`).
           2.  Calibrate and image `v18`.
           3.  Move to sampling position (`#o5`).
           4.  Sample `v4`.
           5.  Move to comm position (`#o0_2`).
           6.  Send image and analysis of `v4`.
           7.  Drop `v4`.
           8.  Move back to sampling pos (`#o5`)
           9.  Sample `v5`.
           10. Send analysis and image of `v5` to `v9`.
           11. Drop `v5`.
           12. Return to starting position.
           
           This revised plan is designed to be executable within the given action instances, specifically the existing `motion` predicates.

           9.  Sample `v5`.
           10. Send analysis and image of `v5` to `v9`.
           11. Drop `v5`.
           12. Return to starting position.
           
           This revised plan is designed to be executable within the given action instances, specifically the existing `motion` predicates.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.8 1.9) for rover v12 at target v17 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v23: AABB(lower=(1.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(2.25, 2.25, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o0 = (1.0 -1.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 1.9) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.5 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v9: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Revised Plan**
           
           Okay, here's my updated thinking, incorporating the feedback and my own deeper dive into the problem:
           
           I need to reconfigure the rovers. I see the main constraint is the wall at x=0 (`v20`). That divides the problem in two halves: left and right. Rover *v12* is right, and *v14* is left.
           
           **Initial Considerations:**
           
           *   I must respect the "not explicitly stated is false" rule. *v12* *must* communicate to *v9* because the problem explicitly states `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. But *v20* is in the way.
           *   I can assume that if a state is given, communication has a valid configuration (LOS). The implication is that a direct geometric line of sight could either be indirect or doesn't actually get blocked by the AABB in collision checking (`blocked(#o1)`).
           
           **Configuration Selection:**
           
           *   **For Rover v12 (Right Side):**
               *   I need a reachable configuration `#o3` (to image `v17`) and reachable `#o0` (to communicate to `v9`).
               *   For *#o3*, *v12* starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, `v17` is at `(2.0, 2.0)`. Obstacle *v23* is at `(1.75, 1.75)`. Therefore, I must use `(1.5, 1.0)` to avoid collisions.
               *   For *#o0*, it must still communicate with *v9*. Previous `(1.0, -1.0)` was "not reachable." However, the problem explicitly states `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So I'm choosing `(1.1, -1.0)` to allow for that.
           
           *   **For Rover v14 (Left Side):**
               *   I need reachable configurations `#o3` and `#o5`.
               *   For *#o3*, to image *v18*, I'll use `(-1.2, 1.5)`.
               *   For sampling, `(-1.5, -0.5)` is an appropriate position `(#o5)`.
               *   For *#o0*, `(-1.0, -1.8)` will allow for the sending of the data without intersecting with *v9*.
           
           *   The goal now is to reach the target images, and have all samples sent to *v9*.
           
           **Action Plan:**
           
           *   Rover *v12*: Move to `(1.5, 1.0)`, image `v17`, move to `(1.1, -1.0)`, and send the image.
           *   Rover *v14*: Move to `(-1.2, 1.5)`, image `v18`. Then, move to `(-1.5, -0.5)` to sample `v4` and `v5`. Move to `(-1.0, -1.8)` and send the image along with analysis of *v4* and *v5*.
           
           *   All rovers end at their starting positions.
           
           **Final Thoughts and Revisions:**
           
           The key is to assume (given the `comvisible` predicates) a valid and reachable configuration exists even in the face of the obstacle *v20*.
           I hope it is sufficient, and it follows the rules given.
