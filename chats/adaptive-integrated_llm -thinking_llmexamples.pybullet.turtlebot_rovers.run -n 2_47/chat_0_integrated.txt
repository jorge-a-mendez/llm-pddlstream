           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a pretty specific goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to ensuring several conditions are met, including having images received and analyses completed for both stone and soil samples. The initial state gives me a head start on some of these, but the core of the problem lies in the image and analysis parts.  I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a known configuration.  The initial state also shows the visibility of objects that would need to be captured by the rovers.
           
           I first dove into breaking down how I could achieve the `receivedimage` goals. I mapped the steps required: take the image, which requires calibration, and then send it.  I quickly realized the rovers are stuck in their initial configurations, v13 for v12 and v15 for v14. The problem statement gives me `#o0` and `#o3` continuous configurations for my rovers, but my available moves do not allow me to move to these, and `imagevisible` and `comvisible` do not work with their `atconf`. This is the first roadblock. The rovers can't take images because they're stuck in the wrong place.
           
           Then, I looked at the only actions I'm *allowed* to use. Here's where it got really challenging. I'm limited to *extremely* basic actions: moving to their current location (effectively no move) and dropping rocks.  There's no `take_image`, no `send_image`, and no `send_analysis`.  This list is severely restrictive. This is a critical constraint. If I'm only allowed to move to the same configuration, the initial configuration is the only one I can use. And it doesn't give me any path towards those goals.
           
           With these restrictions, achieving the goals related to receiving images and analyses becomes utterly impossible. I re-read the conditions of the axiom, and it's clear: with these allowed actions, I can't generate the necessary `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. The rovers are effectively immobile, and unable to perform any actions that are actually meaningful to the goal. The actions just aren't there.
           
           Therefore, because the `move` actions prevent changing the rover's location, it is impossible to achieve `receivedimage`. Therefore it's impossible to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` given the initial state and *particularly* given the allowed actions. My final conclusion is that the goal is simply unreachable with this set of constraints.
