(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, dimensions 0.0973 x 0.0973) on a square surface (ID 0) with dimensions -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. A stable placement requires the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to be completely within the surface.
           
           My initial thought was to consider the object's dimensions as its AABB, which is the standard interpretation. However, the object can rotate, potentially increasing its AABB.  I need to consider that, for a square with side *s* rotated by *theta*, the maximum AABB side is *s* * sqrt(2) (at theta = pi/4). Because  0.0973 * sqrt(2) is less than the surface's side, which is 0.27, I'm confident the square will fit at any orientation. I'll need a way to calculate the effective AABB at each angle. 
           
           Knowing the max expanded AABB is smaller than the surface, I can start by defining how I calculate the effective AABB dimension. For a given angle *theta*, the effective side dimension is `obj_w * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'm using `obj_w` which is the original object's dimension, 0.0973.
           
           To find valid placements, I need to ensure the object's center is within the surface boundaries, adjusted by half the effective AABB side. So, I will calculate the range in x and y dimensions. The  valid range for the x-coordinate will be  `[-0.135 + half_effective_side(theta), 0.135 - half_effective_side(theta)]`, and the y-coordinate range will be similar.
           
           Now I'll calculate `x` and `y` center coordinates. I'll choose 5 different rotation angles (`0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, `pi/2`) to fully explore the space. Then for each angle, I will calculate the allowed range. Lastly, using `linspace`, I will divide the allowed ranges into enough x and y coordinates to create ten different coordinate pairs. This gives me my 50 unique placements: 5 rotations * 10 coordinates = 50.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object ID 5 onto surface 0.  This is similar to what I did with the previous object, ID 4.  The main challenge is avoiding collisions with object 4, which is currently placed at the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           Object 5 is a square, just like object 4.  It's got a side length of `0.0934797270169698`.  I need to find 50 stable placements for it.  Stability means it has to fit within the surface boundaries which are basically a square defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Object 4's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is currently occupying the region `[-0.135, -0.0376996]` in both the x and y dimensions.  This means object 5 has to avoid that area.
           
           To find suitable positions, I'm taking the following approach:
           
           1.  **Generate Candidate Positions:** I'm going to create a grid of potential center points for object 5.  I'll consider the surface limits, and also the dimensions of object 5, to ensure that the entire object will fit within the boundaries.  I'm exploring several rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2 radians) to maximize the placements available.
           2.  **Calculate AABB:** I'll calculate the AABB for each candidate placement of object 5 (cx, cy) and for each `theta`, accounting for the effective side of the rotated object.
           3.  **Collision Check:** I'll check for non-collision between object 5's AABB and object 4's AABB.  To make sure I'm not in conflict, I use the criteria: (`x5_max <= x4_min) OR (x5_min >= x4_max) OR (y5_max <= y4_min) OR (y5_min >= y4_max`).
           4. **Iterate:** For each (x, y) location on the surface I will check for collision.  After I have found sufficient placement locations that are non-conflicting, I am finished with the algorithm.
           
           I am using this approach to efficiently generate a diverse set of valid placements that satisfy all the specified criteria.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to put a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into two other objects (IDs 4 and 5). I've got the size and position of all three, including object rotations. My goal is to find 50 valid, collision-free spots.
           
           First, I've defined the playing field (surface 0) as a square with sides that are 0.27 units long and are centered on (0, 0). Object 4 is in the bottom-left, while Object 5 is in the top-left quadrant of the area. Each has a specific size. I calculated the extents of their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). I'll need these AABBs for collision checks.
           
           Next, I determined the boundaries for object 6. Since it's a square, its bounding box expands based on its rotation, represented by 'theta.' The largest dimension comes at a 45-degree angle.
           
           Now, the core of the problem: collision detection. I need to make sure the object 6 doesn't touch the others and stays within the surface. I've broken this down into steps:
           
           1.  **Surface Bounds:** Check if the object stays within the surface's edges.
           2.  **Object 4 Collision:** Make sure the object 6 AABB doesn't intersect Object 4's AABB.
           3.  **Object 5 Collision:** Make sure object 6's AABB doesn't intersect Object 5's AABB.
           
           To find valid placements, I'll test several possible rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). For each angle, I will generate a grid of potential locations (x, y) across the surface. This grid needs to avoid the areas occupied by Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           I will calculate the bounding box for each candidate placement and check for collisions against the existing object AABBs. If a candidate placement passes the bounds and collision checks, it's added to my list. I repeat this process until I've found 50 valid, collision-free placements. The code takes the first 50 placements it generates.
