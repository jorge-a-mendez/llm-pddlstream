(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with figuring out 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface.  The object's dimensions are `(0.09541893822627012, 0.09541893822627012)` – making it a perfect square, and the surface is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, another square centered at (0,0).  For stability, the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must remain completely within the surface's AABB.  Since they are squares, the rotation of object is key here.
           
           I've determined that the maximum AABB dimension occurs when the object is rotated by 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians). The key is to calculate the effective dimensions of the object as it rotates. For a square, this is just `side * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll need to figure out how far the object can move along x and y-axis within this surface.
           
           I'll iterate through several rotation angles (`theta`) from 0 to pi/2 (as any rotation can be expressed within this range). For each `theta`, I'll calculate the allowed center positions based on the effective AABB dimensions. After that I have to convert to `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` format.
           
           Since the maximum rotation angle for squares only depends on the edges or the mid-points (for any dimension), I decided to generate placements from seven `theta` values: `0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5*pi/12, pi/2`.  For each angle, I will position the center at (0,0) and the midpoints of the possible `x` and `y` values.
           
           This gives me a little more than the needed 50 placements. I'll just take the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Summary: A Strategic Approach**
           
           Okay, so I've got the lay of the land. We have object ID 4 locked in at (0,0), and I need to strategically place object ID 5, a square with side *s_5*, 50 times on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions. The surface boundaries are +/- 0.135, and I need to stay clear of object 4's existing footprint, a square AABB defined by (-0.0477, -0.0477) to (0.0477, 0.0477).
           
           First, I figured out that any rotation (*theta*) will influence the object's effective footprint - it's no longer just *s_5*. The effective side length becomes  `s_5 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, which simplifies things. For the square object, this expands or contracts with rotation.
           
           I identified the key obstacle: object 4's AABB. I must avoid this area! I then calculated that, to avoid collision, object 5's center must be positioned outside a square defined by `+/- (half_s_4 + half_W_5)`.  This calculation depends on the angle *theta* of the new object.
           
           Next, I needed to check where the object is allowed on the surface. For a given *theta*, my strategy is to first calculate the inner (forbidden) square and outer (available) square:
           
           *   The outer square (S) defines the overall boundary on which the object is allowed to be placed. The object's center coordinates *must* lie inside this box.
           *   The inner square (C) defines the area that is off-limits due to the previously placed object, and has a value of `half_s_4 + half_W_5`.
           
           *   I found that for larger angles (e.g., pi/4), the effective size of the object is so large that there is insufficient space for placement.
           I can only place the object at smaller angles.
           
           So, I precalculated values and coordinates for two values of theta where the sum of cos(theta) + sin(theta) is less than 1.147. This gives us ranges of valid values for placement.
           
           I focused on picking locations where at least one coordinate is at the extremes of the possible range (edge of the box) or one is zero (edge center). Then calculated the 20 valid pairs for the two angles: *0* and *0.1* radians, which are 20 points each. Then for an angle close to 90 degrees I will get the remaining 10 points. I verified that using these coordinates for the object's *center*, ensures that the object avoids overlap while staying within bounds.
           
           I generate the needed 50 valid placements. I'm ready to ship these over.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID 6)**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on a square surface (surface 0), while ensuring it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5).  The surface's edges are at +/- 0.135, and ID 4 is centered at (0,0) and ID 5 sits near the top edge.
           
           My core approach involves careful geometric calculations.  I've determined the "forbidden zones" around ID 4 and ID 5, essentially their AABBs expanded by half the object's width (which is determined by its side length).  This expansion accounts for different rotation angles (`theta`) of ID 6.
           
           I'll start with `theta = 0` (no rotation). I'm focusing on "strips" outside the existing objects. This reduces to a collision-free space calculation, outside the expanded objects.
           
           Surface boundary limit: `S_0` = 0.092.
           ID4 prevents placement within radius = 0.090.
           ID5 has one x region at x=0, and y between 0.05 and 0.13, which is a problematic area.
           Safe regions are around the edge.
           I will pick points:
           Set A Right Side: Coordinates 0.0905, 0.0915, 0.092.
           Set B Left Side: -0.0905, -0.0915, -0.092.
           Set C Y bottom side -0.0905, -0.0915, -0.092.
           
           Top right and left corners in between the ID 4 and ID 5.
           Corners should be calculated.
           
           Then, there must be a valid angle rotation by `0.02`. I have calculated the maximum value of the angle to rotate.
           
           I plan to generate a set of coordinates that ensures non-collisions.
           For theta=0, valid places are near the boundary on the right, left, and bottom.
           Additional, I will place points in top-right and top-left regions.
           For example, x=0.091, y=0, then place the other points.
           Coordinates such as `(0, 0.0, -0.091, 0.09)` are valid.
           
           Therefore,  I can generate 50 stable configurations for placement to solve the problem.
