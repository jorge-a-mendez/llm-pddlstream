           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Core Strategy: A Detailed Plan for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to place three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16, specifically satisfying the conditions `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The initial state reveals these objects are currently located on surface v11 at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively.  The underlying principle is to ensure each object is supported by v16, and this is achieved through the desired `atpose` predicate.
           
           The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), but only v4 is relevant for this task. The robot's base is currently at v3 and its initial arm configuration for v4 is v5, with handempty. To execute the plan, I'll employ a classic "pick and place" sequence. The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`, each incurring a cost associated with distance or action.
           
           Since the robot's base and arm configurations play a role (`kin` predicate), I've determined I need to first move the robot's base to a specific pose configuration `#o3` if it's not already there. The information provided confirms the robot is initially at `v3`, but the `kin` predicates indicate the `pick` and `place` actions require the base to be at `#o3`. Therefore, an initial `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` action is required.  Assuming the move has a positive cost and the robot can move.
           
           The core of the plan will be as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` - aligning the base to the pick/place configuration.
           2.  **Pick v8:** `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Picking the first object.
           3.  **Place v8:** `place v4 v8 (#o2 v8 v16) #o1 #o3 #o4` - Placing v8 onto v16 at a chosen pose.  Note the disambiguation of `#o2` into `(#o2 v8 v16)`.
           4.  **Pick v12:** `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Picking the second object.
           5.  **Place v12:** `place v4 v12 (#o2 v12 v16) #o1 #o3 #o4` - Placing v12 onto v16 at a chosen pose, `(#o2 v12 v16)`.
           6.  **Pick v14:** `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4` - Picking the third object.
           7.  **Place v14:** `place v4 v14 (#o2 v14 v16) #o1 #o3 #o4` - Placing v14 onto v16 at a chosen pose, `(#o2 v14 v16)`.
           
           The crucial aspect of the "place" operations is assigning distinct positions for each object on the target surface v16. Given the surface and object dimensions and considering collision avoidance, I've chosen poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on v16:
           - `#o2 v8 v16`: `(-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`
           - `#o2 v12 v16`: `(0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`
           - `#o2 v14 v16`: `(0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           These specific coordinates will need to be provided in a distinct `--Poses--:` section in the solution format. The poses are all within the bounds of the v16 surface and will prevent collisions.
           
           The plan assumes that all the pick/place kinematics are already established. The goal is to move three objects and the plan is to: first move base, then perform a sequence of pick and place actions.
           The robot starts with its base at `v3` and canmove(). The first action will make it `atbconf(#o3)` and also sets `canmove()` to false.
           The `pick` actions will make `handempty(v4)` false and  `canmove()` true.
           The `place` action will make `handempty
