(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a small square object (ID 5, size approximately 0.0894 x 0.0894) on a larger square surface (corners: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  A "stable" placement means the object is entirely within the surface.
           
           I'll start by calculating the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for different rotations.  Since the object is square, this AABB calculation is straightforward.  I'll need the object's dimensions and rotation angle to find the effective width and height of its AABB.  I have precise formulas to calculate the bounding box based on rotation. Because the object dimensions are similar, the calculations are simplified.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB must fit entirely within the surface.  So, for each rotation, I'll calculate the valid range for the object's center position. This valid range is determined by the surface's boundaries and the AABB dimensions. The key here is calculating the maximum half-width and half-height for rotated objects to ensure they are contained within the surface.
           
           I plan to generate 50 placements by systematically varying the rotation angle (evenly spaced from 0 to 2*pi).  For each angle, I'll place the object at the center of the calculated valid region. If a valid placement cannot be found for an angle, that's because there is no room available or the math is incorrect.  The code will calculate all of the rotation and ensure the surface fits the rotation object.
           
           Finally, I'll use a loop to make sure I have 50 unique placements to return.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, I've got a new object, ID 4, that needs to be placed on surface 0, right next to the already positioned object, ID 5.  Object 5 is sitting pretty at the center of the surface.  My mission? Find 50 stable and collision-free locations for Object 4.
           
           I'm well-versed in these spatial arrangements, and my focus is on ensuring Object 4 doesn't bump into Object 5.  I have the dimensions of both objects, the surface boundaries, and I know object 5's position.
           
           Object 4 has a size very similar to Object 5. I will make a calculation of collision using the AABB. Object 5 is right in the center, so I will try to place the new object as far as possible from the center.
           
           I'll start by making 50 different angles for Object 4, it is almost square, so the angle won't affect it as much. Then, I will compute ranges for x and y of object 4. Then collision check. Based on the position of object 5, I'm going to find the valid zones for object 4. I'll make sure it's within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's dive into the details. I have a strategy in mind. For each rotation, I'll calculate the *half-width* and *half-height* of Object 4's AABB.  I'll then determine the valid center coordinates (x, y) that keep Object 4 within the surface boundaries.
           
           Now, to avoid collisions with Object 5, I'll identify the areas where Object 4 *cannot* be. These collision zones are the core of my analysis. The strategy will be to ensure the x and y of object 4 AABB is far enough from that of object 5.
           I'll try these steps: Calculate, Validate, place.
           
           1. **Calculate**: For each rotation (theta), I'll calculate the effective half-width and half-height of Object 4's AABB.
           2. **Validate**: I need to check the space between the positions and object 5 to have at least a little bit of the space.
           3. **Place**: The final step. The program will try to place the object in those validated locations.
           
           I'm confident I can find 50 diverse, stable locations that satisfy the placement constraints.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 6: A Strategy for Stability**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6, a small square (approximately 0.0816 x 0.0816), on surface 0, which is defined by a rectangular region of `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.  I need to consider two previously placed objects: object 5 (centered at 0,0) and object 4 (centered slightly to the left).
           
           My strategy centers around a robust approach for placing the object on the surface without overlapping the other objects:
           
           1.  **Angle Iteration:** I'll begin by generating 50 evenly spaced angles (`theta`) from 0 to 2*pi.  For each angle, object 6 is rotated.
           2.  **AABB Consideration:** For each rotation, I'll calculate the rotated AABB for object 6 which is dependent on the angle and the object's original dimensions.
           3.  **Collision Checking:** Collision checking will be performed based on the rotation angle by performing an intersection test to ensure that the new object is not overlapping with objects 4 and 5 by checking for containment within each other's boundaries.
           4.  **Region Generation:** During the process of generating each angle and rotation, there will be the consideration of a candidate list of points to check for collision.
           
               *   **Right Side:** Generate candidate points on the right of object 5, and in the middle of y-axis.
               *   **Top Side:** Generate candidate points on top of the objects and center it in the horizontal direction.
               *   **Bottom Side:** Generate candidate points to be placed on the bottom of the objects and center it horizontally.
               *   **Left Side:** Generate candidate points to the left side and verify for placement.
           
           5.  **Placement Validation:** The proposed placement will be validated to ensure it does not overlap with previously placed objects. In this step, for the object 6 to be valid, all previously placed objects must be considered and it must not intersect with the boundaries of the surface.
           
           This multi-step approach ensures a careful and efficient search for stable placements while adhering to the constraints.
