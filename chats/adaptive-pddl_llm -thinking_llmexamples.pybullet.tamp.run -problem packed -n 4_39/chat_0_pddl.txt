           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Feasibility Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The task is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto region `v18`. I've carefully analyzed the initial state, the goal, and the available actions.  From what I see,  `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are currently sitting on `v11`, and I need them on `v18`. This requires actions to *pick* them up and *place* them on the target.
           
           I've checked the axioms. Specifically `on(?o, ?r)` is defined by `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` AND `atpose(?o, ?p)`, so I need to make those predicates true for each object and region `v18`. From the initial state and the provided facts, the potential poses on `v18` are there for the objects.
           
           The crux of the issue is the available actions.  The *only* action instance I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This moves the base configuration, but it doesn't affect the poses of the objects or the state of the arms. It doesn't allow me to change an object's location.
           
           Even though the `move_base` action removes and then adds back `atbconf(?q)`, I can't pick or place anything because the action doesn't allow such actions. Since the plan requires picking and placing the objects, and the available actions don't enable these, the plan is simply not achievable with this limited action set. The problem specifies that only instances in the list can be used, so no other solution can be formulated.  The goal is unreachable.
