(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for a small, almost-square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which has boundaries from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement requires that the object, regardless of its rotation, remains entirely within the defined surface area.
           
           I've determined the essential principles:  Since the object's dimensions are almost square, the effective dimensions of its bounding box (AABB) when rotated by an angle *theta* are relatively easy to calculate. For this I will approximate the object as a square of side `s = 0.07`.  The bounding box has effective dimensions `effective_size_x = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` and `effective_size_y = s * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))`, so for *theta* equals 0 or 90 degrees and multiples thereof these dimensions will also be approximately `0.07` and for *theta* equals 45 degrees, the dimensions are approximately `0.099`.
           
           To ensure stability, I'll calculate the allowed translation range for the object's center within the surface for any angle.  The object's center needs to be within `x_min = surf_lower_x + effective_size_x/2` and `x_max = surf_upper_x - effective_size_x/2` and `y_min = surf_lower_y + effective_size_y/2` and `y_max = surf_upper_y - effective_size_y/2`.
           
           My strategy involves generating diverse placements across the surface, at five key angles: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, and π radians.  For each angle, I will select 10 unique positions within the valid region.
           
           Here's the detailed plan.
           
           **Angle 0:**
           Effective dimensions are approx. (0.07, 0.07). The valid region for placement is approximately  [4.235, 4.765] and [-0.565, -0.035]. The placements consist of the four corners plus a mix of points.
           
           **Angle pi/4:**
           Effective dimensions are approx. (0.099, 0.099).  The valid range is approximately [4.250, 4.750] and [-0.550, -0.050]. I will use the corners and points in the interior.
           
           **Angle pi/2:**
           The object is rotated, but the bounds remain [4.235, 4.765] and [-0.565, -0.035]. I'll use different positions.
           
           **Angle 3pi/4:**
           The bounds for this rotation are [4.2495, 4.7505] and [-0.5505, -0.0495]. I'll choose different points inside the valid region.
           
           **Angle pi:**
           This will have the same dimensions as the cases for rotations 0 and pi/2, in the region.  Placements will follow the same pattern for the angles.
           
           By strategically varying the angle and x,y placements, I can achieve a diverse set of 50 stable object placements.
