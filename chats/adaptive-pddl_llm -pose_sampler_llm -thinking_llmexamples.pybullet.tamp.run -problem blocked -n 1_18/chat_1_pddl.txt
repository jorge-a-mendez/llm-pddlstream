           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` be both "on" a specific object (`v18`) and of a particular "type" (`v17`).**
           
           First, I realized that I needed to determine what object could fulfill the `?green` variable. Looking at the initial state, I saw that both `v8` and `v12` were of the correct type (`v17`). Since the initial states provide the ability to achieve `v8` to be at pose #o2, I decided to focus on moving `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           To do this, I recognized that "being on" something requires both being supported by it and being at a specific pose. `v8` is initially supported but at pose `v9`. Therefore, I needed to get `v8` to the pose `#o2`.
           
           The actions I have at my disposal are limited. `move_base` doesn't seem relevant since the only instance moves the robot from `v3` to itself. The only way to reposition `v8` is to pick it up and place it down, or to pick it up and place it somewhere else. I formulated the plan of picking `v8` from its current pose `v9` and placing it on `v18`, at pose `#o2`.
           
           This requires preconditions to be true before performing `pick` and `place`.
           The available `kin` instances are crucial for the arm trajectory. `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` are given. I need to take the base configuration to `v3` to execute the actions, since `atbconf(v3)` is the only base config given to be active in the state. Assuming that `#o3` can be set to `v3` for pick and place operations, it could work. Also, I have to ensure that all trajectories `#o4` and so on are safe.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Pick `v8` with arm `v4`, pick from pose `v9`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and trajectory `#o4` (all of which satisfy the `kin` fact, by the earlier assumption regarding `#o3`).
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Place `v8` with arm `v4` onto pose `#o2`, using grasp `#o1`, base config `v3`, and trajectory `#o4` (which satisfies the `kin` fact because again, I'm assuming `#o3` is `v3`).
           
           This plan guarantees that `v8` is `atpose(#o2)`. Since the initial conditions show `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, I have now achieved the goal of  `on(v8, v18)`. And from the initial conditions, `type(v8, v17)`. Consequently, the new axiom is now fulfilled. 
           
           **Assuming the crucial condition where `#o3` can be `v3`, I believe this plan is sound and complete.**

           This plan guarantees that `v8` is `atpose(#o2)`. Since the initial conditions show `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, I have now achieved the goal of  `on(v8, v18)`. And from the initial conditions, `type(v8, v17)`. Consequently, the new axiom is now fulfilled.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan Evaluation: An Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out a critical flaw in my previous plan: I used actions (`pick` and `place`) that weren't explicitly allowed. I was given a *very* strict set of valid action instances, and I missed that key constraint. My only option now is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing `on(?green, v18)`. Since `type(?green, v17)` is true initially, I'm really looking to get `on(v8, v18)`. That in turn means I need `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.  I already have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` in the initial state, so I'm aiming for `atpose(v8, #o2)`. The catch is, I *start* with `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           
           To change that pose, I'd typically use `pick` and `place`, but those are off the table. My only tool is `move_base`. Let's break down this specific instance: `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)`.  It essentially moves the robot from `v3` to `v3`. It does nothing to `v8`. The preconditions are all satisfied initially: `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and `canmove()`. Executing this action *consumes* `canmove()` and increments the cost, but it leaves `atbconf(v3)` intact. Importantly, it doesn't change anything about `v8`'s pose.
           
           This `move_base` instance, effectively a no-op, prevents me from achieving the goal. The core issue is that I can't manipulate objects with the provided actions.  There's simply no way to move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           Because the problem clearly states I shouldn't return a plan if the goal is unreachable, I'll stop here.  My previous attempt failed because I incorrectly assumed I could derive actions from the *kin* facts. In this scenario, *only* the explicitly listed action instances are valid. With the given constraints, this goal is unequivocally *unreachable*.
