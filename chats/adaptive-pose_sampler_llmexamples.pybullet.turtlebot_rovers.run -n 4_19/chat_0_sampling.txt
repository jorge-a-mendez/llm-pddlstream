           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is essentially a room with outer walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central wall at x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I need to find 3 robot base positions that are within 2 units of the target point and avoid these obstacles, also ensuring line of sight.
           
           Given the target point (1.2982424 0.6124446), I will try positions around it, keeping in mind the max range of 2. I'll prioritize positions that are likely to be in open areas and have clear line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (0.2982424 0.6124446)
           (1.2982424 -0.3875554)
           (1.2982424 1.6124446)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous positions failed because of no line of sight to the target (2.1188154220581055, 1.823552131652832). This suggests that the central wall at x=0, or some other obstacle, was blocking the view from those positions. The first proposed point (0.2982424, 0.6124446) is on the left side of the x=0 wall while the target is on the right, so it's expected that there's no line of sight. The second point (1.2982424, -0.3875554) is also problematic because the target is at y=1.823, and there might be obstacles between y=-0.387 and y=1.823.
           
           Given the new target point (0.20100000500679016, 0.20100000500679016), I will try to place the robot closer to the target and ensure it's on the correct side of the x=0 wall. I will also be mindful of the other smaller obstacles that might obstruct the view. The target is near the center of the scene.

Model:     The previous attempts were for two different target points. Let's analyze the failures for the most recent target point (0.48770850896835327, 2.19759202003479).
           
           The proposed position (0.20100000500679016, -0.7989999949932098) collided with obstacle 0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)), which is the central wall along the y-axis. My proposed x-coordinate for this point (0.201) is greater than 0.05, so it's not directly inside the obstacle. However, the x-range for this obstacle is between -0.05 and 0.05. I need to be more careful with the exact boundaries of these obstacles.
           
           The other two positions (1.2010000050067902, 0.20100000500679016) and (-0.7989999949932098, 0.20100000500679016) failed due to no line of sight to the target (0.48770850896835327, 2.19759202003479). The target is in the upper part of the room (high y-value). The positions at y=0.201 are quite far in the y-direction, and given the small obstacles in the upper part of the room (e.g., 9, 10, 20, 21, 22), it's likely they were blocked. The x=0 wall (obstacle 0) would also block line of sight for the position with negative x-coordinate (-0.798...).
           
           For the current target point (1.7516244649887085, -2.11545467376709, 0.20100000500679016), it's located in the bottom right quadrant. I need to place the robot within 2 units of this target. I should avoid the central wall at x=0. Also, the region around y=-2.5 is the bottom outer wall, so I should ensure the robot is not placed there. There is obstacle 2 ((-2.55, -2.55), (2.55, -2.45)) which represents the bottom outer wall. So, I will try to keep a bit of distance from y=-2.5.
           
           Positions:
           (1.7516244649887085 -0.11545467376709002)
           (0.7516244649887085 -2.11545467376709)

Model:     It seems I made a mistake in the target point for the previous request. The previous target point was actually (2.1188154220581055, 1.823552131652832), not (1.7516244649887085, -2.11545467376709) as I assumed in my reasoning. This explains the failures.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the correct target point (2.1188154220581055, 1.823552131652832). This point is in the upper right quadrant of the room.
           
           The previous proposed positions for this target were:
           1. (0.2982424, 0.6124446) - no line of sight. This is on the wrong side of the x=0 wall, as noted before.
           2. (1.2982424, -0.3875554) - no line of sight. The target is at y=1.823, and this position is at y=-0.387. Obstacles (like 7, 9, 10, etc.) are in the upper region, and possibly the target itself is somewhat obstructed from this low y-position.
           3. (1.7516244649887085, -0.11545467376709002) - no line of sight. Similar issue to the previous one, too low in y.
           4. (0.7516244649887085, -2.11545467376709) - no line of sight. Also too low and possibly blocked by the x=0 wall or other obstacles.
           5. (2.45, -1.11545467376709) - collides with obstacle 0: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)). This is the right outer wall. My x-coordinate (2.45) is right on the boundary of this obstacle. I need to be more careful with boundaries and potentially propose slightly inside the room from such boundaries.
           
           Given the target (2.1188154220581055, 1.823552131652832), I need positions in the upper right quadrant, close to the target, and avoiding the various small obstacles in that region (like 7, 19, 9, 12, 14).
           
           Positions:
           (1.1188154220581055 1.823552131652832)
           (2.1188154220581055 0.823552131652832)
           (1.6188154220581055 2.123552131652832)
