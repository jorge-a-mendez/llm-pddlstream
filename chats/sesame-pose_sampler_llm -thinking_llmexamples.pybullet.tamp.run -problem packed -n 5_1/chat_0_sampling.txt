(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7, with dimensions `(0.09194263414526439, 0.09194263414526443)`, on surface 0, which is an AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Stability means the object's rotated bounding box is entirely within the surface's AABB.  I'll define a placement as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The surface index is always 0.
           
           Because the object's dimensions are almost identical (nearly a square), the effective bounding box dimensions after rotation are practically the same for any angle, varying from the original object side length to the original object side length multiplied by `sqrt(2)`. The surface is a square of side 0.27 centered at (0,0).
           
           My strategy is to generate diverse placements. I’ll vary the rotation angle (`theta`) and then, for each angle, generate a grid of `(x, y)` positions within the surface area. I've chosen two angles: 0 radians (no rotation) and pi/4 radians (45 degrees rotation).  For each angle, I will generate a grid of x,y coordinates to get a diverse set of placements.
           
           For theta = 0, the grid coordinates will be:
           (0, 0, -0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 0, -0.08, -0.04)

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a new object (ID 5) with dimensions very close to a square (0.0889 x 0.0889), and I need to find 50 stable placements on a surface that's 0.27 x 0.27 meters centered at (0,0). I have to avoid colliding with another object (ID 7) already placed at (-0.08, -0.08) with a slightly larger size (0.0919 x 0.0919).  Since it's at an angle of 0, its collision area is simply the AABB.
           
           **Collision Avoidance is Key:**
           
           I'll be using a simple AABB check to avoid collisions.  Given the size, the problem will be complicated to use more exact methods. I’ll make sure the separation distance is greater than the combined bounding boxes.
           
           **Placement Plan:**
           
           Here's how I'll get to 50 valid placements:
           
           1.  **Theta = 0 (0 rad) & Theta = pi/2 (1.57 rad):** For object 5 at these angles, the geometry is almost the same. I'll use a grid of points { -0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08 } for both x and y. Then I added two further points, one at (0.07, 0.07) and one at (0.07, -0.07). The only constraint is to ensure that I am not placing the centroid of object 5 inside the AABB of object 7. I calculated the safe zone for placement to be  x >= 0.010429 or y >= 0.010429, which corresponds to the placement strategy and that is equivalent to no collision.
           2.  **Theta = pi/4 (0.78 rad) & 3pi/4 (2.35 rad):** I used the surface bounds and did calculations for the bounding box after rotation, which changed based on angle. For a rotation of pi/4, I will use a different grid based on my calculation, the valid range of the centroid is smaller than before, using { -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06 } for both x and y. I did all these things to guarantee no collision. The placement strategy and calculation for the collision avoidance are the same.
           
           3.  I have 18 non-colliding placements for Theta = 0, 16 for pi/2, and 16 for pi/4.
           
           This gives me 18 + 16 + 16 = 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a new request to place object ID 4 on surface 0. My primary goal is to avoid any collisions with the already-placed objects, IDs 7 and 5. This is a standard problem, but the devil's in the details, so let's break it down.
           
           First, the scene geometry is clear: a surface defined by the range  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I understand this means x goes from -0.135 to 0.135, and y goes from -0.135 to 0.135 on the surface.
           
           Now, the obstacles. Object 7 is positioned at `(0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08)` and is nearly square, with x and y dimensions of roughly 0.09. Its AABB x range is `[-0.12597, -0.03403]` and its AABB y range is `[-0.12597, -0.03403]`. Object 5 is positioned at `(0, 0.0, 0.04, 0.04)` and has similar dimensions. Its AABB x range is `[-0.00446, 0.08446]`, and its AABB y range is `[-0.00446, 0.08446]`.  I'm using the AABBs to simplify the collision detection process, as I have the precise shape data.
           
           Object ID 4 is also nearly square, with x and y dimensions of roughly 0.096.
           
           My strategy? Generate possible placement locations for object 4 while meticulously checking for collisions with objects 7 and 5. I'm going to consider three rotation angles for object 4: 0 radians, pi/4 radians, and pi/2 radians. With this nearly square shape, the 0 and pi/2 placements are very similar because rotations by pi/2 are just the same dimensions, rotated.
           
           Let's begin.
           
           **1.  Theta = 0:** I need to find the valid x, y coordinates where I can place the object.  The max and min surface coordinates I can use for this placement are:
           
           *   x_max: 0.086678
           *   x_min: -0.086678
           *   y_max: 0.086678
           *   y_min: -0.086678
           
           Using the precise sizes, I calculate the collision check conditions with each object.
           
           *For object 7:*
           I calculate the AABB x-separation and y-separation values:
           `X_SEP_7 = 0.094292` and `Y_SEP_7 = 0.094292`.
           
           *For object 5:*
           I do the same calculations:
           `X_SEP_5 = 0.092782` and `Y_SEP_5 = 0.092782`.
           
           My python code is a tool to test candidate placements and make the decision about placement. I chose a reasonable set of candidate center points on a grid with coordinates  `x, y`: `{-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08}`.  I can quickly scan the surface and quickly check, as well.
           
           I realize that to avoid collision, *both* of the following conditions must not be true for *any* placement of the center point for ID 4 (`cx4`, `cy4`):
           1. `abs(cx4 - ckx) < (hw4 + hwk)` for some obstacle K
           2. `abs(cy4 - cky) < (hh4 + hhk)` for some obstacle K
           
           Using this, I can rapidly assess.
           
           The key points are:  I am carefully checking the edges, knowing that the constraints get tighter with more objects on the surface.
           
           After careful testing, I find these valid points for this rotation: `(0.08, -0.08)`, `(0.08, -0.04)`, `(0.04, -0.08)`.
           
           **2.  Theta = pi/2:** Because the object is nearly square, the process and valid points are the same for this rotation.

           Using the precise sizes, I calculate the collision check conditions with each object.
           
           *For object 7:*
           I calculate the AABB x-separation and y-separation values:
           `X_SEP_7 = 0.094292` and `Y_SEP_7 = 0.094292`.
           
           *For object 5:*
           I do the same calculations:
           `X_SEP_5 = 0.092782` and `Y_SEP_5 = 0.092782`.
           
           My python code is a tool to test candidate placements and make the decision about placement. I chose a reasonable set of candidate center points on a grid with coordinates  `x, y`: `{-0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08}`.  I can quickly scan the surface and quickly check, as well.
           
           I realize that to avoid collision, *both* of the following conditions must not be true for *any* placement of the center point for ID 4 (`cx4`, `cy4`):
           1. `abs(cx4 - ckx) < (hw4 + hwk)` for some obstacle K
           2. `abs(cy4 - cky) < (hh4 + hhk)` for some obstacle K
           
           Using this, I can rapidly assess.
           
           The key points are:  I am carefully checking the edges, knowing that the constraints get tighter with more objects on the surface.
           
           After careful testing, I find these valid points for this rotation: `(0.08, -0.08)`, `(0.08, -0.04)`, `(0.04, -0.08)`.
           
           **2.  Theta = pi/2:** Because the object is nearly square, the process and valid points are the same for this rotation.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 8 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 8) on Surface 0, while avoiding collisions with three existing objects (IDs: 7, 5, and 4). Surface 0's dimensions are fixed, providing a constrained workspace.
           
           The approach involves a meticulous analysis of object dimensions, rotations, and collision scenarios. First, I determine the effective bounding box (AABB) of object 8 for different rotations (0, pi/2, pi/4, 3pi/4). For each rotation, I calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that keep the object entirely within Surface 0.
           
           Next, I perform collision checks between object 8 and each existing object for each considered rotation. This involves calculating the sum of the half-widths and half-heights of the objects to determine the minimum separation required to avoid collision. The code then systematically generates a list of placements, applying both surface containment and collision criteria.
           
           The process starts with a grid-based approach. The x and y values are based on a step. I will filter the collision and containment conditions for each potential location.
           This method helps me to select diverse placements that are not clustered.
           A final validation will ensure that the selected 50 placements are stable and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with four existing obstacles (IDs 4, 5, 7, and 8). I'm utilizing my knowledge of geometry and AABB collision detection to tackle this problem.
           
           First, I define the key parameters: the surface dimensions, the obstacles' positions, sizes, and rotations, and the size of the new square object. Then, I calculate the half-extents of the new object for different rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4).
           
           Next, I generate a dense grid of x, y coordinates within the surface bounds, considering the maximum extents for rotation (pi/4), to ensure the entire surface is covered.
           
           For each rotation, I check all grid points. For each (x, y) grid point, I check for collision with the four existing objects. I have precalculated the influence zones for obstacles with the sums of the half-extents. If the new square isn't within any overlapping zones, it's considered valid. Finally, if the object's (x, y) coordinates for a certain angle of rotation satisfy the surface bounds criteria and is outside all of the influence zones of the objects, then I add that placement to the list of valid placements. The finer grid allows more precise determination of non-overlapping points, and a wider coverage for more options. 
           
           The strategy ensures the final placements are within the surface bounds and collision-free. After rigorous testing, I generated 50 placements successfully.
