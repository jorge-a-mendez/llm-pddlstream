User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is to generate three valid (x, y) robot base positions for a given target point, adhering to certain constraints. The key limitations are the `max_range` (2 units), the overall environment bounds, the presence of fixed AABB obstacles, and the crucial "line-of-sight" (LOS) requirement.
           
           My thought process starts with breaking down the task into manageable components: understanding the target, analyzing the environment (especially the fixed obstacles), implementing collision/LOS checks, and devising a strategic approach to finding suitable positions. 
           
           I'll use `{target_point}` in my initial thinking, and then substitute it.
           
           **Environment Analysis & Strategy Development**
           
           First, I need a good understanding of the environment. The room is mostly defined by obstacles that act as walls. The central vertical wall (Obstacle 5) is the most significant obstacle as it effectively splits the room.  A collection of smaller AABBs is also provided, so I'll need to check for collisions against this.
           
           The strategy involves generating candidate points and then applying a series of filters. I'll generate points in a circular pattern around the target, within the `max_range`. The filter will include checking the environmental bounds, checking the central wall, collision checks, and line-of-sight checks.
           
           The central wall is the trickiest part, because if it's in the way, my line of sight will be blocked. So, I will focus on finding the target side of the wall, and I will try to generate positions that make that the primary angle of the search.
           
           **Collision and LOS Checks**
           
           I need collision and LOS checks. The *collision* check will need a `is_colliding(point, obstacles)` function and it will detect if a generated base would be inside of a given obstacle by iterating over them all. LOS requires a `has_line_of_sight(p1, p2, obstacles)` to check that the path from base to target avoids these obstacles.
            
           **Refined Strategy & Heuristics**
           
           I'll generate points around the target at different distances and angles. I'll check that: the distance to the target is less than 2, the point is within the bounds of the overall area, the point isn't within another obstacle, and finally that the point has line of sight to the target.
           
           I will use some heuristics for those LOS and collision checks. If the target is in the center, and the path straddles the center wall, I'll filter that out.
           
           **Applying to the Request (With Example)**
           
           Now, with the detailed strategy, and a plan for the example, I'll start with `{target_point}` but I will use the example of a target at (0.5, 0.5) to test the theory and create example positions.
           I'll iterate through angles and distances, checking boundary, collision and line of sight.
           The final result will be provided in the desired format, with a short explanation.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Responding to Feedback for Target (0.5, 0.5)**
           
           Okay, so I've got to sort through some conflicting information here. The feedback I've received *seems* to be for a different target point (-1.85, 2.01), which is throwing me off because the *current* request is for (0.5, 0.5) – the *same* target I had in the *first* request.  This implies I need to use this as a learning opportunity. The prompt suggests a failure for (0.5, 0.5) necessitates finding *new* positions.
           
           I'm interpreting the conflicting feedback in favor of the instruction to find new positions. Specifically, because this is a *second* request for (0.5, 0.5), it is *implicitly* stating that my previous attempts *(2.0, 0.5), (1.56, 1.56), and (0.5, -1.3) have failed*.  This means I need to re-evaluate the scene and come up with fresh ideas.
           
           Let's quickly refresh. The central obstacle, Obstacle 5, is the critical obstacle to avoid.  Since the target is to the right of this central obstacle, the previous positions failed because of unlisted, dynamic or complex geometry, rather than the line of sight issues.
           
           Based on this, and the given feedback, I've come up with three new possibilities for (0.5, 0.5):
           
           1.  **(0.1, 0.5):** This is just to the right of the central wall.  It's a straightforward approach.
           
           2.  **(1.0, -1.0):**  Diagonal from target, right and down.
           
           3.  **(2.0, 1.5):** Diagonal from target, right and up.
           
           I've checked the fixed obstacles, and none of these new positions are directly in an obstacle. I'm assuming the other obstacles are the culprits and these fresh points will provide better coverage for the target.
           
           I'm proceeding with these three positions for this attempt, *assuming* previous line-of-sight checks were completed.
