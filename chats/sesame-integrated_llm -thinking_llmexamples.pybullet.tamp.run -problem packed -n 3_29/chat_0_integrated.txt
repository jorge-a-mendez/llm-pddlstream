           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, 0.229), (-0.207, 0.301)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.126, 0.203), (-0.052, 0.277)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.119, -0.516), (0.195, -0.441)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.243, 0.265, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.014, 1.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.089, 0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.687, 0.727).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.157, -0.478, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.041, 0.999).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem. My objective is to get these three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto v16. Currently, they're sitting on v11. The core challenge is that they all need to go to the same "pose" which is defined as #o2. The trick is I have to give different coordinate values for #o2 for *each* object since it needs to be a continuous value (x, y, z, rotation) that doesn't cause them to overlap or collide.
           
           My thought process then zeroes in on a few crucial steps:
           
           1.  **Define #o2 for Each Object:** First, I have to figure out the right coordinates for placing each of these objects. I have the spatial constraints: the objects must fit on v16, and I also have to assume that this plate v16 has the same height as v11 to make these computations easier. Based on the constraints, I will assume the v16 surface sits at the z = 0.781. I'll need to calculate the bounding boxes for the objects and then the placement coordinates to make sure the objects have ample space to fit onto v16.
           2.  **Move Robot Base:** I need to make sure the robot's base is in the right spot, which I am assuming to be at #o3. So, my initial state has it at v3 and then I will move the base to the right location (#o3) via base motion trajectories.
           3.  **Picking and Placing:**  Then, I'll need to pick each object, one by one. I'll pick it and put it down onto v16. Each "pick" and "place" will also need the right values for #o1, #o3, and #o4, and I will have to find where those are, such as #o0, which are likely base trajectory names in the scene. I will define a sequence of these pick-place actions and make sure the robot doesn't collide with the objects.
           
           In the end, I need a safe and feasible sequence to get v8, v12, and v14 onto v16 with a unique set of coordinates on top of the plate for each object that meets these requirements.
