           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.145, 0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.227, 0.974).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Placement of Objects on a Surface**
           
           The objective is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current positions on surface v11 to surface v20. The current locations and poses of each object are given, along with the fact that v11 supports them. The goal is to ensure each object is "on" v20, which, based on the axioms, means they must be supported by v20 and at a specific pose.
           
           Since the robot's base can't move (it is fixed at v3), the primary actions are *pick* and *place*.  The available actions are move_base, pick, place, clean, and cook, but cleaning and cooking are irrelevant.  The initial state includes facts about handempty arms (v4 and v6), their configurations, and base configuration. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6. Only v4 has the relevant kin facts for picking and placing each object.
           
           The solution requires picking each object from its initial pose and placing it on a new, suitable pose supported by v20. All required pose configurations, which are represented by `#o2`, must be calculated. The problem also specifies that the initial `atbconf(v3)` is a base configuration. The `kin` facts are also available, and these represent valid pick and place kinematics for arm v4. Each instance must utilize the same grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           I must consider collision and blockages. Each object's position is given, and their bounding boxes. v20 is smaller, and I must select positions for each object. All objects are currently supported by v11, so the new placements must take into consideration the object size and the space available on v20. Each object requires a separate pose, which are defined by continuous values for `#o2`. The poses chosen are on v20, ensuring enough distance between them to avoid overlap.
           
           Each object's pose consists of x, y, and z coordinates, plus a rotation theta. The coordinates must be computed. The objects have been assigned these coordinates and angle of rotation to ensure a successful placement:
           
           -   v8 at (0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 1.056)
           -   v12 at (-0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.46)
           -   v14 at (0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 2.93)
           -   v16 at (-0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 2.426)
           -   v18 at (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 3.026)
           
           Based on these configurations, the plan will be executed, so there are no base movements:
           
           1.  Pick v8 from its location using arm v4.
           2.  Place v8 to the calculated coordinates on v20 using arm v4.
           3.  Pick v12 from its location using arm v4.
           4.  Place v12 to the calculated coordinates on v20 using arm v4.
           5.  Pick v14 from its location using arm v4.
           6.  Place v14 to the calculated coordinates on v20 using arm v4.
           7.  Pick v16 from its location using arm v4.
           8.  Place v16 to the calculated coordinates on v20 using arm v4.
           9.  Pick v18 from its location using arm v4.
           10. Place v18 to the calculated coordinates on v20 using arm v4.
           
           The cost will be a summation of the pick and place cost (5 picks and 5 places), which is 10 if there is a 1 cost for each of them.

(Thoughts: **Critical Oversight: Action Instance Constraint**
           
           Okay, I've got a major problem here. The user pointed out a crucial detail I missed: the list of *explicitly allowed action instances*. I was operating under the incorrect assumption that `pick` and `place` actions were available, even if specific instantiations weren't provided. The problem statement, however, is crystal clear: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Given that the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot's base but doesn't interact with objects, I'm at an impasse. Let's revisit the goal and initial state with this severe constraint in mind:
           
           **Goal:**  All objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) need to be `on v20`.
           
           **Initial State:**  All objects are currently at poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, `v19`), and they are all `on v11`.
           
           To achieve the goal, I need to move these objects from `v11` to `v20`. The problem is, without `pick` and `place` (or a similar action that modifies the `atpose` predicate), I have no way to alter the positions of the objects. The `move_base` action instance doesn't affect `atpose` facts.
           
           Consider the effects of the `pick` and `place` actions; those actions are the only ones that change object poses. Without them, I'm stuck. I have facts like `supported(v8, #o2, v20)` that would let me make `on(v8, v20)` *true*, but there is no mechanism to have `atpose(v8, #o2)` become true.
           
           The goal explicitly requires manipulating the objects, which cannot be done with only the robot's movement.
           
           The prompt explicitly tells me to *not* return a plan if the goal is unreachable.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the strict action instance limitations. The robot cannot possibly achieve the desired final state.
