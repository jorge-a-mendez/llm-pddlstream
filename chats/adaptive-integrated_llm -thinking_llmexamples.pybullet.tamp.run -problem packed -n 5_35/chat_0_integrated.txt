           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.072, -0.263, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.499, 0.867).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.098, 0.422), (0.192, 0.515)).

           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.145, 0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.227, 0.974).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           The central challenge involves planning the movement of five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial location (v11) to a designated surface (v20) using a robot with two arms. The available actions are severely restricted: only the `move_base` action (from base config v3 to itself) is explicitly allowed. This creates a significant constraint.
           
           **Detailed Analysis of the Task**
           
           The goal is to achieve an `on(object, v20)` predicate for each object. The state of each object is defined by `supported` and `atpose` predicates. This means the goal state requires both the objects to be supported by v20, and that the objects' `atpose` must change. Given that I have to work with what's given, the critical question is whether I can achieve the state change within the provided set of actions.
           
           Each object is initially positioned on v11 at the pose `vX` (where `X` is a unique number for each object). The desired goal placement surface is v20, and all the goal positions are defined as the symbolic pose `#o2`.
           
           Because the robot base cannot move, I have to assume the robot can reach v11 to grab the objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) and v20 to place them, without any changes in the base.
           
           The plan must use `pick` and `place` actions, because those are the only actions capable of changing an object from `atpose(o, p)` to `atpose(o, q)` - the only way to achieve the goal `on(o, v20)`. These actions require continuous trajectory objects to be generated, which is not pre-computed. However, in the provided prompt, there is a clear instruction to generate these trajectories for each pick and place using continuous values. 
           
           The prompt also specifies *exactly* the valid set of actions that can be used: the grounded instantiation of a `move_base` action. Because the *only* action provided is `move_base v3 v3`, the robot base does not move and pick/place actions are forbidden. 
           
           The goal's achievement is then impossible.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           With the strict interpretation of the allowed action list, the problem is unsolvable. It is impossible to achieve the target state because the only provided action (`move_base v3 v3`) cannot change the object poses, which are critical to achieve the goal `on`.
