           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem describes a rovers domain where two rovers, v12 and v14, can move, take images, send images, sample rocks, and send analysis of rocks. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires several conditions to be met simultaneously:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Storage v16 on rover v12 is free.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Storage v16 on rover v14 is free.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective v19 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Image of objective v20 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists a stone of type v2.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of that stone has been received.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists soil of type v6.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of that soil has been received.
           
           Let's check the initial state against the goal conditions and available actions.
           
           **Initial State Analysis:**
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           
           So, the first four conditions of the `new-axiom@0()` are already met.
           
           **Image Reception:**
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)` are all `false` initially. These need to be achieved. To do this, a rover needs to:
               1. Calibrate its camera.
               2. Take an image of the objective.
               3. Send the image to the lander.
           
           Let's check the objects:
           - `objective(v17)`, `objective(v18)`, `objective(v19)`, `objective(v20)` are present.
           - `mode(v11)` is present.
           - `camera(v10)` is onboard both v12 and v14, and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           - `lander(v9)` is present.
           - `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates are present for both rovers at appropriate configurations.
           
           **Rock Analysis:**
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: We have rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` of type `v2` (stone type). We need to sample and analyze one and send the analysis.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: We have rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` of type `v6` (soil type). We need to sample and analyze one and send the analysis.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           1. Rover must be `above` the rock.
           2. `free` storage must be available.
           3. `sample_rock` to get `analyzed`.
           4. `send_analysis` to get `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Let's identify the specific rocks for analysis:
           - For `?stone` (type `v2`): We can use `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`. Let's pick `v3`.
           - For `?soil` (type `v6`): We can use `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`. Let's pick `v7`.
           
           **Available Actions:**
           The provided allowed actions are extremely limited: `move` for both rovers to their current configurations (which doesn't change anything), and `drop_rock` for both rovers. This list suggests that the goal is either already met or achievable without any complex rover actions like imaging or sampling.
           
           However, the goal predicates `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are not true in the initial state, and the only available actions `move` and `drop_rock` do not change these predicates.
           The `new-axiom@0()` relies on `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates which are false in the initial state and cannot be achieved with the given allowed actions.
           The problem states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*."
           
           Since none of the allowed actions can produce `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, and these facts are required by the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is not achievable with the provided allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           None of the provided actions (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, `drop_rock v14 v16`) have these predicates in their effects. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given allowed actions.
