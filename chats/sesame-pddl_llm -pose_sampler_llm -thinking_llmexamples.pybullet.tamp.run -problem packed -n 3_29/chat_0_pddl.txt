(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for object ID 5, a nearly-square object with dimensions 0.0847666 x 0.0847666, on a square surface from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Since this is the first object I'm placing, I don't need to worry about avoiding collisions with *other* objects.  My primary concern is ensuring each placement is *fully contained* within the surface and, ideally, well-distributed across it.  
           
           The object's rotation (theta) will affect its effective bounding box.  I need to calculate the effective width and height of the *rotated* bounding box.  For a given rotation angle, the effective width and height are determined by the sum of the rotated object's dimensions based on trigonometric functions (sine and cosine of the angle). I have already derived the equations that define how I can calculate these effective bounding box values. I need to calculate it for any given angle. Then I can use those values for deriving the bounding box centers.
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I'll strategically vary the rotation angle (theta) and center coordinates (x, y) of the object.  The goal is to select theta values that provide a representative range of orientations. I will use the function defined earlier to select the ranges of `x` and `y` for a given `theta`.
           
           Here's my plan:
           1.  **Rotation Angles:** I'll use a set of five rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2 radians. These angles cover the range from 0 to 90 degrees, and with the symmetry of the object and surface, these are sufficient to represent a full rotation's worth of possibilities.
           2.  **Coordinates:** For each rotation angle, I'll calculate the bounds for `x` and `y` center coordinates. I am going to select 5 positions for each rotation with equal horizontal intervals to generate the coordinates for `x`. I'll select only 2 positions for each vertical positions.
           
           With this approach, I will generate exactly 50 placements.  I have already confirmed that there will be 50 unique placements: 5 angles x 5 `x` positions x 2 `y` positions.  I need to compute the placement for each combination.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a placement for object 5 on surface 0, and now I need to figure out where to put object 6, making sure it doesn't bump into object 5. My approach is to systematically define potential placements and then rigorously check for collisions.
           
           First, I calculate the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for object 5, which is already placed. This gives me the "no-go zone" on surface 0.
           
           Next, I'll consider object 6's size and shape. Since it's a square, its effective width and height change depending on the rotation angle (theta). I'll evaluate several angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2.  I've chosen these specific angles because they provide a good sampling of possible orientations. For each angle, I will determine the available valid region on surface 0. Then, I must subtract the area occupied by object 5 from this valid region to avoid collision.
           
           My main strategy is to generate a grid of candidate center points on the surface for each angle. The size of the grid is 5x5. I can define the valid region on surface 0, and then I must identify the section of the valid region *not* occupied by object 5. To ensure non-collision, I will verify the new object 6 does not overlap with the AABB of object 5 using a collision check, which just verifies that the object 6's coordinates don't collide with object 5's.
           
           I will iterate through all possible values of theta (angles) and all coordinate combinations (center points) in my grid, testing each potential placement for collision with object 5. I am sure to ensure the AABB of object 6 *does not* intersect with the AABB of object 5. I will continue until I have a diverse set of 50 valid placements for object 6. With 5 possible angles, it should be easy to find 50, even with object 5 in the way.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 4) on a surface, avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 6). The surface is a square of size 0.270 x 0.270, centered at the origin.
           
           I'll start by defining the bounding boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects. This involves calculating each object's width, height, position, and rotation (currently all are at 0). I will then calculate a set of diverse candidate placements for ID 4, defined by `x` and `y` coordinates as well as angle `theta`. I will start by iterating through 5 angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2).
           
           For each candidate, I will calculate the effective width and height of object 4 at that angle (to determine how large an AABB is required). I can then determine a safe range for the center coordinates `(x, y)` to keep the bounding box on the surface. For example, if the object's width is at its max (say, theta = 0), the x_center must be at least half the object width from the surface's edge.
           
           I will then generate a grid of `(x, y)` points within these safe ranges, calculate the AABB for a rotated ID 4 at those points, and test for any intersection between this AABB and the AABBs of objects 5 and 6 using a collision check function. If there is no overlap, I'll add that placement to the list. I repeat this process for each of my pre-selected 5 angles, stopping once I've found 50 valid placements. The goal is to generate these points densely enough to make sure this is successful.
           
           To improve the accuracy of my collision checks, I have calculated precise AABBs for object 5 and object 6. They are flush against the left surface, with no y-overlap.
           
           I will modify the starting grid for x-coordinates so that no x-coordinates lead to any collisions. The existing strategy already uses a set of bounding box calculations to ensure only placements on the surface are considered.
