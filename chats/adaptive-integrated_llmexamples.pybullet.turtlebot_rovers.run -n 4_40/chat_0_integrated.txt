           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two landers, v9, and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20). Rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. Both rovers have a camera v10 that supports mode v11 and both have free storage v16. There are various `imagevisible` and `above` predicates for the rovers and objects, meaning they can potentially observe or sample these objects from certain configurations. There are also `comvisible` predicates, indicating the rovers can communicate with the lander v9 from specified configurations.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state, which breaks down into several subgoals:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12 has free storage v16. This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14 has free storage v16. This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 has been received in mode v11.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 has been received in mode v11.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: An image of objective v19 has been received in mode v11.
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: An image of objective v20 has been received in mode v11.
           9. `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object is of type v2 (stone). In the initial state, `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` are true.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a stone (type v2 rock) has been received. This implies sampling and sending analysis of a rock of type v2.
           11. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object is of type v6 (soil). In the initial state, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` are true.
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of soil (type v6 rock) has been received. This implies sampling and sending analysis of a rock of type v6.
           
           Since `atconf` and `free` predicates are already true in the initial state, we only need to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` goals.
           
           We need to:
           1. Take images of objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 with either rover v12 or v14 using camera v10 and mode v11.
           2. Calibrate the camera before taking each image.
           3. Send these images to the lander v9.
           4. Sample two different rocks, one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           5. Send the analysis of these two sampled rocks to the lander v9.
           
           Both rovers (v12 and v14) can see all the objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) from configuration `#o3` and can communicate with the lander v9 from configuration `#o0`. Both rovers can also sample all the rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) from configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use rover v12 for all the tasks as it is sufficient.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`:
           - Move v12 to `#o3`.
           - Calibrate v10 for v12 with v17 using ray `#o4`.
           - Take image of v17 with v12, v10, v11.
           - Send image of v17 to v9.
           - Recalibrate v10 for v12 with v18 using ray `#o4`.
           - Take image of v18 with v12, v10, v11.
           - Send image of v18 to v9.
           - Recalibrate v10 for v12 with v19 using ray `#o4`.
           - Take image of v19 with v12, v10, v11.
           - Send image of v19 to v9.
           - Recalibrate v10 for v12 with v20 using ray `#o4`.
           - Take image of v20 with v12, v10, v11.
           - Send image of v20 to v9.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           - Move v12 to `#o5`.
           - Sample rock v1 (type v2 - stone) into store v16.
           - Move v12 to `#o0`.
           - Send analysis of v1 to v9.
           - Move v12 to `#o5`.
           - Sample rock v7 (type v6 - soil) into store v16 (must drop v1 first).
           - Move v12 to `#o0`.
           - Send analysis of v7 to v9.
           
           However, the rover can only hold one sample at a time (`full(v, s)`). We will need to sample one rock, send its analysis, drop it, then sample the second rock and send its analysis.
           
           Let's verify the available actions. Only `move`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, `drop_rock` are available.
           
           The provided `motion` actions only allow the rovers to "move" to their current configuration, which is essentially a no-op if the configuration name is the same. To move to a new configuration like `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, there needs to be a `motion` predicate defined with the target configuration. The problem states: `Atom motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `Atom motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`. This implies the only allowed "move" actions are staying put. This makes achieving the goal problematic, as all `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates rely on configurations that are not the current ones for the rovers (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14). Specifically, `imagevisible` uses `#o3`, `comvisible` uses `#o0`, and `above` uses `#o5`. Since no `motion` actions are provided to move the rovers to these new configurations, the goal is unreachable.
           
           If we assume there are implied motions to these configurations or if the `conf(rover, #name)` predicates mean the rover *can* be at these configurations, then the plan can be constructed. However, based strictly on the provided `motion` predicates, the rovers cannot move to the necessary configurations for the `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           Given the constraints that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" and the only provided `move` actions are no-ops to the current configurations, the rovers cannot reach the necessary configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) to perform any of the required actions (taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, sending analysis). Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
