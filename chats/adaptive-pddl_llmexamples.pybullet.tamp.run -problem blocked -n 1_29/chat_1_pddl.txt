           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes a robot with two arms, `v4` and `v6`, at specific arm configurations `v5` and `v7`, respectively. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`. There are three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` and supported by `v11`. All objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`. Object `v12` is of type `v17`, as is `v8`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which by the axioms means that object `?green` must be `on` `v18` and `type` `?green` must be `v17`. In our scene, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. Therefore, the goal simplifies to placing either `v8` or `v12` `on` `v18`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is `on` `v11` and `v12` is `on` `v14`. To achieve the goal, we need to pick up either `v8` or `v12` and place it on a pose `supported` by `v18`.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any objects or arm configurations, as it's moving from `v3` to `v3`. It only consumes `canmove()` and then makes it true again, and incurs a cost. The initial state already provides several `kin` facts for arm `v4` to interact with objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`, but no `pick` or `place` actions are available in the provided action instances. Without `pick` and `place` actions, or any other actions that can change the `on` predicate, the goal of placing an object `on` `v18` cannot be achieved. The `move_base` action alone is not sufficient.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous analysis still holds: the goal is to have either `v8` or `v12` `on` `v18`. This requires a `pick` and `place` operation. However, no `pick` or `place` actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow for manipulating objects to achieve the `on` predicate. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
