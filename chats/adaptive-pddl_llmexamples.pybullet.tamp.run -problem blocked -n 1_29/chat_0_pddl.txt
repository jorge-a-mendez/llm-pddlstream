           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (`#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `v10` through `v18`, `v3` through `v9`) with properties like `stackable`, `graspable`, `pose`, `type`, `arm`, `handempty`, `atpose`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, `ataconf`, `canmove`, `supported`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have objects with `type v17` (`v8` and `v12`). We also have `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`, which means `v8` or `v12` could be the `?green` object.
           
           The goal basically means we need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Let's pick `v12` as the `?green` object to satisfy the axiom. `v12` has type `v17`. We need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`. The axiom for `on(?o, ?r)` is `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           In the initial state, we have `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. This means `v12` is currently on `v14`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which means `v12` can be placed on `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           The available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action only moves the robot base from `v3` to `v3` (staying in the same configuration) and consumes the `canmove()` predicate. This doesn't help us with object manipulation.
           
           No actions related to picking or placing are available. Without `pick` and `place` actions, it's impossible to move `v12` from `v14` to `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The only available action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` changes the `canmove()` state to false, but it doesn't achieve the goal of placing an object on `v18`. Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the `valid_action_instances` list, the robot cannot manipulate any objects to achieve the `on` predicate required for the goal. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
