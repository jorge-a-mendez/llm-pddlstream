           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.096 x 0.096. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, offering ample space for placement. I will prioritize placing the object near the center of the surface to maximize clearance from the edges, and explore various orientations. Since the object is square, rotation by multiples of 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) will result in the same bounding box, but I will still explore different angles for diversity. The available x and y range for the object's center on surface 0 is from -0.135 + 0.09604661799651137/2 to 0.135 - 0.09604661799651137/2 for a 0 rotation, which is approximately -0.086976691 to 0.086976691.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           I have successfully placed object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means a square object of size 0.096x0.096 is now at the center of the surface.
           
           The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.083 x 0.083. This object is slightly smaller than object 5.
           I need to find placements for object 7 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with object 5, which is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). The bounding box of object 5 extends from approximately -0.048 to 0.048 in both x and y. Therefore, object 7's center needs to be outside this range, considering its own half-dimensions (0.083/2 = 0.0415).
           
           To avoid collision, the absolute value of the x or y coordinate of object 7's center must be greater than approximately 0.048 + 0.0415 = 0.0895 when placed with 0 rotation.
           The available x and y range for object 7's center on surface 0, without considering object 5, is from -0.135 + 0.08281828473065997/2 to 0.135 - 0.08281828473065997/2, which is approximately -0.09359 to 0.09359.
           This is a very tight fit if trying to place them side-by-side along an axis. I will need to be careful with the placement. For instance, placing object 7 at (0.09, 0.0) might collide as it's too close. The extreme points are 0.09359. So, if object 5 occupies (-0.048, 0.048) to (0.048, 0.048), object 7 could be placed in a corner. For example, if object 7 is at (0.09359 - 0.0415, 0.09359 - 0.0415) its corner would be at (0.09359, 0.09359).
           
           Let's try placing object 7 in the corners of the surface, as far as possible from the center where object 5 is. The maximum x/y coordinate for the center of object 7 (rotated by 0 or pi/2) is 0.135 - 0.08281828473065997/2 = 0.09359.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           I have successfully placed object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0).
           
           *   **Object 5 (ID: 5):** Square, 0.09604661799651137 x 0.09604661799651137. Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
               Its bounding box (at 0 rotation) is approximately from (-0.048, -0.048) to (0.048, 0.048).
           *   **Object 7 (ID: 7):** Square, 0.08281828473065997 x 0.08281828473066. Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0).
               Its bounding box (at 0 rotation) is approximately from (0.09 - 0.0414, -0.0414) to (0.09 + 0.0414, 0.0414), which is (0.0486, -0.0414) to (0.1314, 0.0414).
           
           The new object (ID: 4) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0976 x 0.0976. This object is very similar in size to object 5.
           I need to find placements for object 4 on surface 0, ensuring it does not collide with object 5 and object 7.
           
           Object 5 covers the central area. Object 7 is to the right of object 5.
           The combined occupied x-range along y=0 (with 0 rotation) is approximately:
           Object 5: [-0.048, 0.048]
           Object 7: [0.0486, 0.1314]
           So, the approximate occupied region along the x-axis, centered at y=0, is [-0.048, 0.1314].
           
           The half-dimension of object 4 is approximately 0.0976 / 2 = 0.0488.
           The maximum x/y coordinate for the center of object 4 (rotated by 0 or pi/2) is 0.135 - 0.0488 = 0.0862.
           
           Possible areas for object 4:
           1.  To the left of object 5: Needs center_x < -0.048 - 0.0488 = -0.0968. Max center_x is 0.0862. This seems possible.
           2.  Above object 5 and 7: Needs center_y > 0.048 + 0.0488 = 0.0968. Max center_y is 0.0862. This might be too tight or impossible.
           3.  Below object 5 and 7: Needs center_y < -0.048 - 0.0488 = -0.0968. Max center_y is -0.0862. This might be too tight or impossible.
           
           Let's target placing object 4 to the left of object 5. A center x of -0.09 will work.
           Also, try placing it in the top or bottom corners, away from the x-axis where objects 5 and 7 are concentrated.
           Given the object size, the maximum coordinate for the center will be 0.135 - 0.09760471867384733/2 = 0.0861976.
           A placement at `(0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0)` for object 4 would have its right edge at -0.09 + 0.0488 = -0.0412. This would collide with object 5's left edge at -0.048. My calculation above was incorrect. For non-collision, the edge of object 4 must be outside the edge of object 5.
           If object 5 is [-0.048, 0.048] and object 4 is at center `cx` with half-width `hw_4`, then `cx + hw_4 < -0.048` or `cx - hw_4 > 0.048`.
           For placing to the left: `cx < -0.048 - hw_4 = -0.048 - 0.0488 = -0.0968`.
           The minimum center x is -0.0862. This means that a side-by-side placement along the x-axis to the left of object 5, or to the right of object 7, is not possible for object 4, because the surface is not wide enough.
           
           I must place object 4 above or below the existing objects.
           If center_y > 0:
           Needs `center_y - hw_4 > 0.048` (to clear object 5) and `center_y - hw_4 > 0.0414` (to clear object 7). So `center_y - hw_4 > 0.048`.
           `center_y > 0.048 + 0.0488 = 0.0968`.
           The maximum `center_y` is `0.0862`.
           This means object 4 cannot be placed directly above or below object 5 (and thus 7) with 0 rotation without overlapping them.
           
           This implies I must place object 4 in a corner region such that its bounding box *at its given rotation* does not overlap the bounding boxes of 5 and 7. Since all objects are squares, rotating them by 0 or pi/2 does not change the AABB. Rotating by pi/4 *does* change the AABB. However, this is likely to *increase* the effective dimensions, making it even harder to fit.
           Let's re-evaluate the available space more carefully.
           Surface: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`
           Object 5: `(cx=0, cy=0)`, `hw=0.048023`. Occupies `[-0.048023, 0.048023]` in both x and y.
           Object 7: `(cx=0.09, cy=0)`, `hw=0.041409`. Occupies `[0.048591, 0.131409]` in x, and `[-0.041409, 0.041409]` in y.
           
           New object 4: `hw=0.048802`.
           Let's try placing object 4 in the top-left corner.
           Its center `(cx_4, cy_4)` must satisfy:
           `cx_4 + hw_4 < -0.048023` (to clear object 5 on left) -> `cx_4 < -0.048023 - 0.048802 = -0.096825`.
           Minimum `cx_4` allowed by surface is `-0.135 + hw_4 = -0.135 + 0.048802 = -0.086198`.
           This shows that `cx_4` cannot satisfy the left-clearance condition *and* surface bounds if centered on y=0.
           
           The only way is if it can fit entirely above or below.
           `cy_4 - hw_4 > 0.048023` (to clear object 5 from below). `cy_4 > 0.048023 + 0.048802 = 0.096825`.
           Maximum `cy_4` allowed by surface is `0.135 - hw_4 = 0.086198`.
           This also shows it cannot fit entirely above or below object 5.
           
           This means object 4's bounding box *must* overlap with the x-range of object 5 and/or 7, or the y-range of object 5 and/or 7.
           So, it must be placed in a way that allows for partial overlap along one axis, but not the other, to avoid collision. For instance, centered at (0, y_new) for object 4.
           If `cx_4` is 0, its x-range is `[-0.048802, 0.048802]`. This overlaps with object 5.
           So, if `cx_4` is 0, then its y-range must be completely outside object 5's y-range.
           `cy_4 - hw_4 > 0.048023` or `cy_4 + hw_4 < -0.048023`.
           `cy_4 > 0.096825` or `cy_4 < -0.096825`.
           But we know max `|cy_4|` is `0.086198`. So it's impossible for object 4 with center x=0.
           
           This means the objects are too large to fit three in a row or two by two such that their AABBs don't overlap. This suggests that the placement of object 5 and 7 already creates a very constrained space.
           The key here is that the problem states "stable placement" and "fully contained within the bounds of the surface" and "not collide with any of the fixed obstacles". The previous object placements *are* fixed obstacles. My calculations suggest it is impossible to place object 4 without collision. However, the instructions state "You never give up."
           
           Let's re-examine the collision logic. If I place object 4 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09)` for instance, where its center is at `y=0.09`. Its y-range would be `[0.09-0.0488, 0.09+0.0488] = [0.0412, 0.1388]`.
           Object 5's y-range is `[-0.048023, 0.048023]`. These y-ranges overlap.
           This is difficult. The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". In this case, I *am* aware of the collisions I'm predicting.
           
           Let's assume there is a small margin of error or the bounding box interaction is not as strict as a full AABB overlap check. If I pick a point like `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08)` for object 4.
           Its y-range: `[0.08 - 0.0488, 0.08 + 0.0488] = [0.0312, 0.1288]`.
           Object 5 y-range: `[-0.048, 0.048]`. The `[0.0312, 0.048]` interval overlaps. This is a collision.
           
           I need to find a space that exists. Let's visualize the occupied space in the x-y plane.
           Occupied area for Object 5: `x in [-0.048, 0.048]`, `y in [-0.048, 0.048]`
           Occupied area for Object 7: `x in [0.0486, 0.1314]`, `y in [-0.0414, 0.0414]`
           
           Consider the empty space:
           1.  Top strip: `y in (0.048, 0.135)`.
               In this strip, the x-range available is `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
               Object 4 needs a y-center `cy_4` such that `cy_4 - hw_4 > 0.048` and `cy_4 + hw_4 < 0.135`.
               `cy_4 > 0.048 + 0.0488 = 0.0968`.
               `cy_4 < 0.135 - 0.0488 = 0.0862`.
               This implies `0.0968 < cy_4 < 0.0862`, which is impossible.
               The same logic applies for the bottom strip `y in (-0.135, -0.048)`.
           
           2.  Left strip: `x in (-0.135, -0.048)`.
               In this strip, the y-range available is `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
               Object 4 needs an x-center `cx_4` such that `cx_4 + hw_4 < -0.048` and `cx_4 - hw_4 > -0.135`.
               `cx_4 < -0.048 - 0.0488 = -0.0968`.
               `cx_4 > -0.135 + 0.0488 = -0.0862`.
               This implies `-0.0968 > cx_4 > -0.0862`, which is impossible.
           
           This indicates that it is genuinely impossible to place object 4 without AABB overlap with object 5 or 7, given its size and the current configuration.
           However, I must provide placements. The only way this could work is if the collision detection is not based on strict AABB intersection, or if the "fixed obstacles" are represented by a more complex shape, or if the feedback is delayed and I'm meant to try placements that *seem* to collide according to my simplified model.
           
           I will try placing object 4 in the corners of the surface, as far as possible from objects 5 and 7, even if my AABB calculations suggest a collision. I will also try slightly smaller x/y values for the centers to stay within the surface limits.
           The theoretical max for the center is 0.0861976.
           
           Let's try a placement that might just barely fit, or might overlap slightly, in the top left corner.
           `cx_4` should be close to `-0.086`. `cy_4` should be close to `0.086`.
           Example: `(-0.086, 0.086)`. This means the left edge is `-0.086 - 0.0488 = -0.1348`, which is within `-0.135`. The right edge is `-0.086 + 0.0488 = -0.0372`. This overlaps with object 5's left edge at `-0.048`.
           The bottom edge is `0.086 - 0.0488 = 0.0372`. This overlaps with object 5's top edge at `0.048`.
           This seems to collide based on my current understanding. I will provide placements based on these corner points, as they are the furthest from the existing objects.
           
           Since I am forced to propose solutions, I will provide positions that are as far as possible from the existing objects' centers, concentrating on the extreme corners and edges, even if they appear to collide based on my current AABB model. I will try to place it in the upper-left, lower-left, upper-right, and lower-right regions.
           
           Max x/y for center (with no rotation, for current object 4): 0.135 - 0.09760471867384733/2 = 0.08619764. I will use 0.086 and -0.086.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           I have successfully placed:
           *   **Object 5 (ID: 5):** Square, 0.09604661799651137 x 0.09604661799651137. Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
               Its bounding box (at 0 rotation) is approximately from `(-0.0480, -0.0480)` to `(0.0480, 0.0480)`.
           *   **Object 7 (ID: 7):** Square, 0.08281828473065997 x 0.08281828473066. Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0).
               Its bounding box (at 0 rotation) is approximately from `(0.09 - 0.0414, -0.0414)` to `(0.09 + 0.0414, 0.0414)`, which is `(0.0486, -0.0414)` to `(0.1314, 0.0414)`.
           *   **Object 4 (ID: 4):** Square, 0.09760471867384733 x 0.09760471867384735. Placed at (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086).
               Its half-dimension is `0.0488`. Its bounding box is approximately from `(-0.086 - 0.0488, 0.086 - 0.0488)` to `(-0.086 + 0.0488, 0.086 + 0.0488)`, which is `(-0.1348, 0.0372)` to `(-0.0372, 0.1348)`.
           
           The new object (ID: 8) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0761 x 0.0761. Its half-dimension is `0.03805`. This is the smallest object so far.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the combined occupied space and find potential gaps.
           Surface bounds: `x,y in [-0.135, 0.135]`
           
           **Occupied regions:**
           *   **Obj 5:** `x in [-0.0480, 0.0480]`, `y in [-0.0480, 0.0480]`
           *   **Obj 7:** `x in [0.0486, 0.1314]`, `y in [-0.0414, 0.0414]`
           *   **Obj 4:** `x in [-0.1348, -0.0372]`, `y in [0.0372, 0.1348]`
           
           From the successful placement of object 4, my previous strict AABB collision assessment was inaccurate. Object 4 (x: -0.0372 to -0.1348, y: 0.0372 to 0.1348) successfully placed, despite having an x-range (`[-0.1348, -0.0372]`) that overlaps with object 5's x-range (`[-0.0480, 0.0480]`) and a y-range (`[0.0372, 0.1348]`) that overlaps object 5's y-range (`[-0.0480, 0.0480]`).
           This suggests that the collision detection is not based on simple AABB intersection, or that it is checking for *full overlap* rather than *any overlap*. More likely, the objects are represented by their true polygonal shapes, and their rotated AABBs are much smaller than what I'm calculating for the full extent of the object in its unrotated form. The success of (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086) for object 4 confirms this.
           
           Let's adjust my strategy. I will assume that the objects are indeed axis-aligned despite the `theta` parameter, but that the exact dimensions for collision are slightly more lenient, or that my half-extents are conservative. Given the success of object 4, it means there is actually space in the top-left area.
           
           The new object 8 has `hw_8 = 0.03805`.
           Maximum `|center_x|` or `|center_y|` for object 8 (with 0 rotation) is `0.135 - 0.03805 = 0.09695`.
           
           Let's aim for the remaining corner regions, or in the gaps between the existing objects.
           Since object 4 is at `(-0.086, 0.086)` (top-left), object 7 is at `(0.09, 0.0)` (right-middle), and object 5 is at `(0,0)` (center).
           
           Possible areas for object 8:
           1.  **Bottom-left corner:** `(x < 0, y < 0)`.
               Furthest from object 5 and 7. Object 4 is in the top-left.
               Try `(-0.09, -0.09)` for object 8. This is within the surface.
               Object 8's x-range: `[-0.09-0.038, -0.09+0.038] = [-0.128, -0.052]`. This avoids object 5's x-range.
               Object 8's y-range: `[-0.09-0.038, -0.09+0.038] = [-0.128, -0.052]`. This avoids object 5's y-range.
               This seems like a very promising non-colliding spot.
           
           2.  **Top-right corner:** `(x > 0, y > 0)`.
               Object 7 is to the right. Object 4 is top-left.
               Try `(0.09, 0.09)` for object 8.
               Object 8's x-range: `[0.09-0.038, 0.09+0.038] = [0.052, 0.128]`. This overlaps with Object 7's x-range `[0.0486, 0.1314]`.
               Object 8's y-range: `[0.09-0.038, 0.09+0.038] = [0.052, 0.128]`. This avoids Object 5's and 7's y-ranges.
               Given the success of object 4, this might still pass if the intersection is not critical.
           
           3.  **Between Object 5 and 7 but shifted on Y (if possible):**
               Object 5 is `[-0.048, 0.048]` in x. Object 7 is `[0.0486, 0.1314]` in x. There is a very small gap between them on x from `0.048` to `0.0486`. This is `0.0006`. Too small for object 8's `0.076` width.
               However, if I rotate object 8, its effective AABB size could change. The problem statement says "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" which suggests that the *given* sizes are for the AABB and not necessarily the square's side length. If the object is a square of side `s`, its AABB at 0 rotation is `s x s`. At 45 deg rotation, its AABB is `sqrt(2)s x sqrt(2)s`. Here, the given extents are for the AABB at *some* orientation, and it's simplest to assume they are for 0/90 degree rotations. Since they are equal, it's a square.
           
           Let's try the bottom-left corner with various rotations.
           Also try to use maximum valid coordinates. `0.09695` is the maximum valid for center.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           I have successfully placed:
           *   **Object 5 (ID: 5):** Square, 0.09604661799651137 x 0.09604661799651137. Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Half-dim: `0.0480`. BBox: `x in [-0.0480, 0.0480]`, `y in [-0.0480, 0.0480]`.
           *   **Object 7 (ID: 7):** Square, 0.08281828473065997 x 0.08281828473066. Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)`. Half-dim: `0.0414`. BBox: `x in [0.0486, 0.1314]`, `y in [-0.0414, 0.0414]`.
           *   **Object 4 (ID: 4):** Square, 0.09760471867384733 x 0.09760471867384735. Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086)`. Half-dim: `0.0488`. BBox: `x in [-0.1348, -0.0372]`, `y in [0.0372, 0.1348]`.
           *   **Object 8 (ID: 8):** Square, 0.0760844972812861 x 0.07608449728128608. Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)`. Half-dim: `0.0380`. BBox: `x in [-0.1280, -0.0520]`, `y in [-0.1280, -0.0520]`.
           
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0834 x 0.0834. Its half-dimension is `0.0417`. This is similar in size to object 7.
           Maximum `|center_x|` or `|center_y|` for object 6 (with 0 rotation) is `0.135 - 0.0417 = 0.0933`.
           
           Let's consolidate the occupied space and identify the remaining gaps.
           Surface bounds: `x,y in [-0.135, 0.135]`
           
           **Current Occupied Regions (approximate AABBs with 0 rotation):**
           *   **Obj 5 (center):** `x: [-0.048, 0.048]`, `y: [-0.048, 0.048]`
           *   **Obj 7 (right-middle):** `x: [0.0486, 0.1314]`, `y: [-0.0414, 0.0414]`
           *   **Obj 4 (top-left):** `x: [-0.1348, -0.0372]`, `y: [0.0372, 0.1348]`
           *   **Obj 8 (bottom-left):** `x: [-0.1280, -0.0520]`, `y: [-0.1280, -0.0520]`
           
           From the successful placements, especially Object 4, it's clear that the collision checker is more permissive than strict AABB overlap. Object 4's bbox has significant overlap with Object 5's bbox on both x and y axes. Object 8 also overlaps Object 5's x-range, and Object 4's x-range is almost identical to Object 8's.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 in the remaining "open" corners or edges.
           The most significant remaining "empty" regions are:
           1.  **Bottom-right corner:** `x > 0, y < 0`. This is away from all existing objects.
               Try `(0.09, -0.09)` for object 6.
               Object 6's half-dim is `0.0417`.
               Object 6's x-range: `[0.09 - 0.0417, 0.09 + 0.0417] = [0.0483, 0.1317]`. This overlaps with Object 7's x-range (`[0.0486, 0.1314]`).
               Object 6's y-range: `[-0.09 - 0.0417, -0.09 + 0.0417] = [-0.1317, -0.0483]`. This avoids Object 5 and 7's y-ranges.
               Given the previous successes, this corner is a very strong candidate despite the x-overlap.
           
           2.  **Top-right area:** `x > 0, y > 0`.
               Try `(0.09, 0.09)` for object 6.
               Object 6's x-range: `[0.0483, 0.1317]`. Overlaps Obj 7.
               Object 6's y-range: `[0.0483, 0.1317]`. This seems clear of Obj 5, 7, 8, but not Obj 4.
               Obj 4's y-range: `[0.0372, 0.1348]`. Obj 6's y-range: `[0.0483, 0.1317]`. These y-ranges overlap significantly.
           
           Let's prioritize the bottom-right corner and then consider other spots. I will use the maximum possible coordinates for the corners to ensure full containment.
           Max `|center_x|` or `|center_y|` for object 6 (with 0 rotation) is `0.135 - 0.041724 = 0.093276`. I'll use 0.093 and -0.093.
