           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the target state defined by the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to ten core conditions that need to be true in the final state: four involving rovers being at specific configurations and their stores being free, four requiring that images of different objectives are received, and two requiring the receipt of analysis from rocks of specific types.
           
           I began by evaluating the initial state. The initial state already satisfies the rover configuration and store conditions. Therefore, my focus narrows to achieving the image and analysis reception requirements.
           
           **Image Acquisition and Transmission Plan**
           
           To satisfy the image reception conditions, I need to perform a series of image-related actions. To achieve `receivedimage`, I need to take an image with `take_image` and then send it with `send_image`. Preconditions for taking an image include ensuring the camera is calibrated, there's a visible image, and the rover is at the correct configuration. I will therefore also need to calibrate the camera with the `calibrate` action. Sending an image has prerequisites such as the image itself being available (produced by the `take_image` action), and the lander being visible. After analyzing the initial state, I discovered that I can use rover `v14` for the image-taking and transmission.
           
           I devised a plan where `v14` will first calibrate the camera and take an image, then send each of the four required images. Since the calibration process negates the calibrated state, calibration would be required before each image is taken or only once per image. The plan would then consist of a series of calibrate-take-send actions for each required objective.
           
           **Rock Sampling and Analysis Transmission Plan**
           
           The analysis reception conditions require me to sample rocks and send the analysis. This involves using the `sample_rock` action to analyze rocks of specific types and then sending the results with the `send_analysis` action. The initial state shows I can use rover `v12` to sample and send analysis for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`
           
           The `sample_rock` action results in the store `full`. However, the store must be empty initially. This means after sampling a rock, I need to free the store using `drop_rock`. To avoid any problems, I will sample a rock, send its analysis, and then drop it to clear the store, before I repeat the sequence.
           
           **Overall Plan and Constraint Analysis**
           
           A plan was devised by combining both sequences for each rover. However, the problem statement mentions that only some pre-defined actions are applicable. These are `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`. The required `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions are *not* permitted.
           
           **Conclusion: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Given the restrictions, the plan is not achievable because the `take_image` and `send_analysis` operations are critical to achieve the main conditions.  Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions can be used, and they don't produce the necessary facts. There are also no available actions that could produce any of the conditions related to `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
