(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Base Configuration Conflict**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those objects where they need to be, broken down into what I'm thinking: My goal is clear: get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* `v18`. I know that means I need to arrange each object so that it's *atpose* `p` where it is *supported* by `v18`. 
           
           So, I looked at what I had:
           *   **Object v8:**  Needs to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`. I see I already have the supported facts to accomplish this.
           *   **Object v12:** Same, needs to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`. The correct supporting fact is there.
           *   **Object v14:** Same, needs to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`. Supporting fact checks out.
           *   **Object v16:** Same, needs to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`. Yep, support confirmed.
           
           To get each object there, I need to *pick* them up and *place* them. The plan looks like this: `pick -> place` for each object. The parameters seem straightforward because the target pose, `#o2`, is the same for all objects!
           
           I pulled up the *pick* and *place* action preconditions.  I saw that the preconditions for *pick* and *place* depend on *kin*, the robot's kinematics, and, importantly, the robot *atbconf*. The robot's base configuration *must be* a *bconf* that is compatible with the kinematics.
           
           Looking at the *kin* facts I have, I see that the base configuration (`q`) is `#o3` for *every* *pick* and *place* action. Fine, I'll check that: I check my initial conditions and I see that the initial *atbconf* I am `v3`. This is a problem! The only action available is a *move\_base* that only moves my current base `v3` to my current base `v3`.
           
           I looked at the move base carefully. Given the initial state, I cannot change my base configuration *to* `#o3`. The only available move base consumes and reasserts my current base.
           
           **Conclusion:** I can't.  I looked at *every* fact and action. There's *no* way to reconfigure the robot's base from `v3` to the needed `#o3`. I'm stuck. It's a fundamental conflict. The goal is, unfortunately, unreachable given the available actions and starting state. I'll need to explain this very carefully.
