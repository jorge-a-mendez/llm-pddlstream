           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem: I need to get four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto object v18.  My understanding of how "on" works tells me I need to ensure each object is both *supported* by v18 and *at* a valid pose on v18.
           
           Looking at the initial state, all four objects are currently perched on v11.  I have the "supported" relations that imply they *could* be on v18. That's a good start.  However, to make them "on" v18, I need to get them *to* v18.
           
           Here's the problem: The only action I'm *allowed* to use is `move_base`. This action isn't going to help me manipulate these objects.  I need actions like `pick` and `place` to actually change the positions and support relationships. The fact that the list of valid actions *doesn't* include the necessary `pick` and `place` actions is a massive constraint!
           
           As it stands, given the available action, this goal is *unreachable*. I can't directly alter the `atpose` of the objects because I can't use actions that would allow me to do so. It seems I'm stuck with a limitation on the available actions.
