(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a small square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a larger rectangular surface. A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface. I've broken this down into a systematic approach, considering rotations and valid (x, y) coordinates for the object's center.
           
           Since the object is a square, its effective bounding box changes with rotation. To handle this, I first calculate the effective half-width and half-height of the rotated object, considering its side lengths and the rotation angle (theta). For each `theta`, I compute the allowed range for the object's center `(x, y)` to ensure containment within the surface boundaries.
           
           To get a diverse set of placements, I've chosen five key angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. For each angle, I generate 10 unique placements within the valid x-range by keeping a constant y value within its allowed range. The y values are equally distributed to capture this dimension.
           
           The final output is a list of tuples containing the surface index (0 in this case), rotation angle (radians), and x and y coordinates of the object's center for each stable placement. The object's actual dimensions are slightly off from 0.07, and I have taken them into account in the calculations, ensuring high precision.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 10) on a surface, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects.  The key here is understanding the existing constraints.  I've been given some successful placements for a previous object (ID 5) – all on the same surface, at a fixed y-value, and varying x-positions.  These placements were valid and presumably didn't collide with the *initial* scene's obstacles.
           
           Now, a new object (ID 10), slightly larger and almost perfectly square, needs to be placed *without* colliding with these previously placed object 5 instances.  Crucially, the rule states that I must avoid collisions between objects with different IDs (i and j).  This means the previous object 5 instances are *now fixed* obstacles that ID 10 *must* avoid.
           
           Here's the tricky part:  The existing object 5 placements *overlap*. This initially confused me. If this overlap was not present in the original input, it is a key piece of information. However, my understanding is this only means that objects with the *same* ID can overlap. Thus, object 10 must avoid all 10 previously placed object 5 instances.
           
           Given that the placements are close together and at a fixed y, I'm going to determine a composite occupied region by object 5 by constructing the union of their bounding boxes. This effectively creates a rectangle at the bottom of the surface.  Since object 5 is placed along the surface bottom (y = -0.565 approximately), the object 5 rectangle essentially occupies most of the surface along its bottom side.
           
           The surface bounds are ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Therefore, the valid placement area for object 10 is:  *above* the previously placed object 5. The lower y-bound is now *y=-0.53*.
           
           With this modified surface, I will implement a similar strategy to before: placing several objects in x-positions across the space.  I will also rotate the object slightly. Specifically, I'll place the object at 5 different angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2), with 10 x positions for each angle for a total of 50 placements.  I'll then adjust the y-placement for the rotation.
           
           Let's calculate the available space and then carefully generate these 50 placements.  The logic is clear:  avoid the rectangle occupied by object 5 placements and utilize the remaining space efficiently for object 10.  I will generate the placements and return the values.
