(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to placing an object, let's call it `?green`, on `v18` and ensuring it's of a certain `type` (`v17`). Upon inspecting the initial state and definitions, it's clear that `v12` is the suitable candidate, as it is both of the correct type and is stackable on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought is to make `v12` be on `v18`, with some pose `#p1`, thus satisfying the initial goal of `on(?green, v18)`. Since the current state reveals `v12` is *supported* by `#p1` on `v18`, I can infer that `#p1` is the correct pose for `v12`.
           
           Now, the obvious path involves:
           1.  **Picking up `v12`:** This involves the arm and robot base reaching a suitable configuration.
           2.  **Moving `v12`:** Specifically to the target location on `v18`.
           3.  **Placing `v12`:** Correctly onto `v18` at the prepared pose `#p1`.
           
           Based on the available actions, the current configuration is `atpose(v12, v13)`. Now I have to determine the concrete steps:
           
           *   **Move Base to Picking Position:**  The robot base should go to `#q3` (as dictated by available kin relations), that is associated with an available action, to allow pick to operate.
           *   **Pick the object:** Using arm `v4`, I can use the existing `kin` relation at state `#q3` to pick up `v12` from its current pose `v13`. This action implies that I will no longer be *atpose*, and instead have a *grasp* on the object.
           *   **Move Base to Placement Position:**  After picking the object I need to move the robot base to `#q2` to execute placement, as per available `kin` relations.
           *   **Place the object:** Finally, arm `v4` can place `v12` at the target pose `#p1`. I need to make sure to check for potential unsafe actions, or configurations.
           
           So, the plan unfolds as follows:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #q3 #t8)` : Move robot to location for picking object.
           2.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q3 #t6)`: Pick up object from pose `v13`.
           3.  `(move_base #q3 #q2 #o0)`: Move robot to placement position.
           4.  `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q2 #t5)`: Place the object on its target location.
           
           Careful verification is crucial.  The preconditions of each action must hold and the state must evolve correctly. All conditions are considered in the above plan. I have rechecked the assumptions of each action by applying the stated assumptions to see if they hold. The `Negated unsafepose` condition assumes the action is safe and does not need to be asserted because there is no prior stated condition that should make it unsafe.
           
           The plan appears to be sound; the actions ensure that `on(v12, v18)` becomes true because of `atpose(v12, #p1)` and that `type(v12, v17)` is known to be true in initial state. Therefore, it solves `new-axiom@0()`.
