(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object (`?green`, in this specific scenario `v12`) "on" another object (`v18`).  This immediately triggers my understanding of the "on" axiom: it requires an object to be `supported` at a specific `pose`.  Looking at the facts and axioms, it's clear that `v12` (our green object) needs to be placed at a specific pose, specifically `#p1`, to be on `v18`. We already know that `v12` is supported by `v18` at pose `#p1`, so we know `atpose(v12, #p1)` is crucial.
           
           Now, my mind shifts to the current state.  `v12` is currently at pose `v13` and supported by object `v14`. To get from there to the goal (`atpose(v12, #p1)`), the obvious strategy is to first `pick` it up from its current location and then `place` it at the desired pose. Given the facts, I see two applicable actions: `pick` and `place`.
           
           I delve into the `pick` actions.  There are a few options, but only one seems relevant – the one where `v12` is currently at `v13`. We need to be able to manipulate `v12` and the action I see that works is the `pick` action that uses `v13` as a pose. Analyzing the preconditions for that `pick` reveals a crucial requirement: the base needs to be in a specific configuration (`#q3`).
           
           Now the focus is on `place`. Again, there are several `place` actions but only one that places at `#p1`, our goal location. The preconditions again dictate a necessary base configuration (`#q2`).
           
           Putting it all together, the plan becomes clear:
           
           1.  **Move the base** from its initial configuration (`v3`) to the configuration necessary for picking (`#q3`).
           2.  **Pick** `v12` from its current pose (`v13`).
           3.  **Move the base** from the picking configuration (`#q3`) to the placing configuration (`#q2`).
           4.  **Place** `v12` at the target pose (`#p1`).
           
           I carefully review each step, ensuring the preconditions of each action are met by either the initial state or the effects of the preceding action. This looks solid.
           
           To ensure the plan's feasibility, I mentally check the initial state. I am satisfied that all the preconditions necessary to execute each action will be met in order. After action execution the post-conditions also satisfy the conditions needed to achieve the goal: to satisfy `on(v12,v18)` which in turn satisfies `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           The green object (`v12`) will be on surface `v18`, supported by it at pose `#p1`. This coupled with knowing that the type of object is `v17` means `new-axiom@0()` is met.
           
           Therefore, this plan will successfully achieve the desired state. I'm ready to proceed with implementation.
