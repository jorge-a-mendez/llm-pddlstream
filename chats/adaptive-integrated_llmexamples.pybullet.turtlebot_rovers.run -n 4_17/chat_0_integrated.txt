           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two stores (v16), a lander (v9), and several rock and objective objects. Both rovers are equipped with a camera (v10) which supports mode v11. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having received images for all objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) in mode v11, and having analyzed rocks v8 (soil) and v4 (stone), and that both rovers (v12 and v14) are at their current configurations (v13 and v15 respectively) and have free stores (v16).
           
           Currently, neither rover has taken any images nor analyzed any rocks. The initial state already satisfies `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. Therefore, the plan needs to focus on achieving `receivedimage` for v17, v18, v19, v20 in mode v11, and `receivedanalysis` for v8 and v4.
           
           Both rovers have the capability to image all objectives and sample all rocks. They also both have `comvisible` to the lander v9.
           The rover v14 has imagevisible and imagerange predicates for objectives v17, v19, v18, and v20 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4. It also has above predicates for rocks v1, v7, v3, v5, v8, and v4 at configuration #o5. Additionally, it has comvisible with lander v9 at configuration #o0 with ray #o1.
           The rover v12 has similar capabilities with the same continuous parameters.
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` for all objectives, and `receivedanalysis` for specific rocks, and the rovers are already in their desired final configurations with free stores, the plan should focus on image acquisition, rock sampling, and data transmission. We should prioritize using the same continuous configurations for imaging, sampling, and communicating to minimize the need for new configurations.
           
           Let's break down the goal `new-axiom@0()`:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Already true.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Already true.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Already true.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Already true.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Needs to be achieved.
           9. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is an axiom for any stone rock, like v4.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means `receivedanalysis(v4)` needs to be achieved.
           11. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is an axiom for any soil rock, like v8.
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means `receivedanalysis(v8)` needs to be achieved.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
             - `calibrate` the camera.
             - `take_image` of the objective.
             - `send_image` to the lander.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
             - `sample_rock`.
             - `send_analysis` to the lander.
           
           We can use rover v14 for all imaging and analysis tasks.
           First, calibrate the camera for v14 at configuration #o3 with ray #o4, targeting any objective, for example, v17.
           Then, take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) using v14 at #o3.
           After taking all images, send them to the lander v9 from configuration #o0 with ray #o1.
           Then, sample rock v4 (stone) and rock v8 (soil) using v14 at configuration #o5.
           Finally, send the analysis of v4 and v8 to the lander v9 from configuration #o0 with ray #o1.
           
           Let's check for blocked rays. There are no `blocked` predicates in the initial state. The axiom `blocked(?y)` depends on `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`, which is a continuous check. We will assume the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates imply unblocked rays.
           
           We need to provide continuous values for #o0, #o3, #o4, #o5.
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: #o0 is a configuration for v14 to communicate with v9. v9 is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). v14 is at v15 which is (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0). A possible collision-free configuration #o0 could be close to v15, for example, (-1.0, -1.75), which is the center of v14. The center of v9 is (-1.9, -2.0). A simple direct line of sight from v14's current position to v9 should work for #o0.
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` (and v18, v19, v20): #o3 is a configuration for v14 to image v17. v17 is at ((-0.732, 1.791), (-0.646, 1.877)). v14 is at v15 which is (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0). The center of v17 is (-0.689, 1.834).
           For `above(v14, #o5, v1)` (and v3, v4, v5, v7, v8): #o5 is a configuration for v14 to sample rocks. For instance, for v1, its center is (0.7875, -0.9865). For v3, its center is (-1.817, -0.532). For v4, its center is (1.2255, 0.3995). For v5, its center is (-2.09, -0.193). For v7, its center is (-1.5655, 0.6095). For v8, its center is (-0.6385, -0.9205). Since all `above` predicates for v14 use the same #o5, this configuration must be suitable for all given rocks. This means #o5 must be general, for example, just directly above the center of a group of rocks, or a specific spot that is above each individual rock. Considering the coordinates, these rocks are spread out. However, if #o5 is provided to be applicable to all these rocks, we assume such a configuration exists and is reachable. Since there are no `move` actions to change from `atconf(v14, v15)` to `atconf(v14, #o5)`, it implies that #o5 should be very close to v15. Given that only `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` (staying at current position) is available, #o5 effectively means `v15` for sampling purposes.
           
           Let's use v14 to perform all the necessary actions.
           The plan needs to ensure `calibrated` before `take_image`.
           The plan needs to ensure `haveimage` before `send_image`.
           The plan needs to ensure `analyzed` before `send_analysis`.
           
           Considering the `motion` facts, only `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` are allowed, meaning the rovers essentially cannot move from their initial configurations. This implies that the configurations #o0, #o3, and #o5 *must* be identical to the rover's current configuration or kinematically reachable from it without changing its base pose. Since the task states that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state, these are intended to be specific configurations. If the only available motions are to stay in place, then #o0, #o3, #o5 must effectively refer to the current configuration of v14, which is v15. This is a critical constraint.
           
           So, let's assume #o0, #o3, and #o5 all refer to the base configuration v15 of rover v14.
           This means:
           - `comvisible(v14, v15, #o1, v9)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, v15, #o4, v17)` (and v18, v19, v20)
           - `above(v14, v15, v1)` (and v3, v4, v5, v7, v8)
           
           This simplifies the plan as no movement is required.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid actions only includes `move` actions that keep the rovers in their current positions, and `drop_rock` actions. None of the actions required to achieve the goal state (i.e., `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are present in the list of valid actions. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal from the initial state with the given constraints.
