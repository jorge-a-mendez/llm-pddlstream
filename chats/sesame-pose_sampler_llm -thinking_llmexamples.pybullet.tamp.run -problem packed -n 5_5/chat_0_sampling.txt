(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a nearly square object with dimensions approximately 0.075 x 0.075, on a square surface of size 0.27 x 0.27, denoted as surface 0. A stable placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and (x, y) coordinates of the object's center. For stability, the rotated object's bounding box must be entirely within the surface's bounding box.
           
           Given the square nature of both the object and the surface, the problem exhibits rotational symmetry. To generate diverse placements, I'll leverage this symmetry by exploring various rotation angles and strategically sampling positions within the valid placement area for each rotation.
           
           First, I calculate the effective size of the object's bounding box for a given rotation. For a square object, this is simply its half-dimension multiplied by the sum of the absolute values of sine and cosine of the rotation angle. Then, to determine valid placements I compute the boundary coordinates in x and y directions.
           
           I've selected 7 equally spaced rotation angles: 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, 5pi/12, and pi/2.  For each angle, I define a grid of 9 positions. This grid includes the center (0,0), positions along the midpoints of the valid x and y range boundaries and the four corners of this valid range. I will filter out any duplicates. Finally, I will iterate over the rotation angles and the grid positions, to find the 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **My Updated Placement Strategy for Object 8**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object ID 5 has been successfully placed at (0, 0, 0, 0) on surface 0, and I need to avoid collisions with it when I place object 8. This new object is a square with side length 0.09086, which is basically a smaller square than the surface bounds.
           
           The surface itself is a rectangle from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I've already figured out object 5's AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box), which is a small square centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.07494 x 0.07494, and I know that when I apply any rotation to object 8 I'll have to use its half-dimensions to compute where I can place the object's center. 
           
           I've determined that the best way to handle the collision is to use a set of angles, as before, but the key is to ensure I'm checking each angle's available area to avoid collision by object 5. Now, instead of picking arbitrary points, I am calculating `D` which represents the minimum distance from the origin that the center of object 8 must be. With that, I can now compute the outer range and generate the necessary placements for a non-collision and place the object within its constraints and also be more specific with the angles since object 5 is already fixed at (0,0) with theta=0.
           
           Then, for theta=0, I am now finding an approach where I define a set of 'valid' x and y for each valid placement, and making a matrix so that each coordinate is not placed in collision, which can happen with all angles from 0 to pi/2, but only when they're colliding with object 5. Now, I can use 30 positions and 20 positions to generate a total of 50 distinct positions by checking and making sure the points are within the surface bounds, and also the non-collision rule. This should give me the diversity I need for object 8's final placement.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, taking into account existing objects (ID 5 and ID 8) and their AABBs.  Object 4 has a square shape and dimensions that determine its half-dimension (obj4_half_dim).  The allowable area for placement is constrained by surface 0 (defined by a half-side surf_half_side). The center of object 4 is described by the coordinates (x_4, y_4), and its rotation by theta_4.
           
           **Constraints Analysis:**
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** To ensure object 4 remains within the surface, its center must be a sufficient distance away from the surface edges. This is defined by max_boundary_4.
           
           2.  **Avoiding Object 5:** Object 5 is located at the origin. To avoid collision, object 4's center must be sufficiently far away from object 5's half-dimension (obj5_half_dim). Collision avoidance is defined by D_4_5.
           
           3.  **Avoiding Object 8:** Object 8 is located at a specific point on the surface. Collision detection relies on the AABB of object 8 and object 4, the test is complex due to rotations.  I need to ensure the placement of object 4 does not cause its AABB to overlap with that of object 8.
           
           **Rotation and Placement:**
           
           I considered rotation for object 4. I found that if theta_4 is pi/4 or a multiple, the object will collide with object 5. So, for easy calculation, the valid rotations are limited to 0 (and pi/2), in which case `R4_half_dim = 0.03617`.
           
           I'll use a grid search to find valid positions, where `x` and `y` represent the coordinates of the center.
           1.  **Generate a Grid:** A grid of points within the surface bounds.
           2.  **Collision Checks:** For each point, I need to check:
               *   **Object 5 Collision:** Ensure the center's distance from origin satisfies the condition to avoid overlap.
               *   **Object 8 Collision:** Use the AABB test to check if the point would cause overlap.
           
           I am testing points, and I can now define `x_coords` and `y_coords`. I will filter out any points where both collision requirements are met.
           I can then generate points for placement.

           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0, while ensuring I avoid any collisions with the objects already present: ID 5, ID 8, and ID 4. This is a task that combines geometry, collision detection, and a bit of detective work.
           
           **Initial Considerations:**
           *   **Surface:** The working area (surface 0) is a square: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Target Object (ID 7):** Object 7 is a square with a known size, specifically `size_x = 0.09262756616826973`, and `size_y = 0.09262756616826973`. Its half-size is critical, so `obj7_half_dim = 0.046313783084134865`.
           *   **Existing Objects and their Bounding Boxes (AABBs):**  These are the obstacles I must avoid. My primary method for avoiding these obstacles is to calculate their AABBs and then exclude placements that will cause overlap.
               *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** Centered at the origin.
               *   **Object 8 (ID 8):** Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.08956863843114577, -0.08956863843114577)`.

           **Key Learning and Adaptation:**
           *   During previous placements, a potential anomaly arose: Objects 4 and 8, both of which were deemed "successful" by the system, *overlap* when I calculate their AABBs. My initial instinct is to consider it a collision, but the system said the placements were successful.
           *   **Interpretation:** Given that the system reported these overlapping placements as "successful", I'll *assume* the system's collision detection has some tolerance, uses different coordinates or that the collision model focuses on fixed obstacles. In my model, I'm defining a robust approach that does not overlap these AABBs.
           *   The "success" feedback may mean I *need not* avoid the collision I calculate, as the success is an implicit non-collision. Thus, I will proceed with my calculations by treating the region *covered* by objects 4 and 8 *as* a valid region for object 7. I *still* avoid calculated collisions. This strategy acknowledges system behavior.
           *   I will employ a set of rules to make sure there are non-colliding AABBs.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Rotation Selection:** The square object must be placed in a valid rotation. I assume the most valid rotations are `0` and `pi/2`.
           2.  **Surface Containment:** Limit placements to the area within the surface, accounting for the object's size and my rotation choice.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** Check AABBs of any potential locations against the established and fixed objects (5, 8, and 4) to ensure non-overlap. The AABB checks need to be robust with a tiny tolerance to make sure all placements work.
           
           **Algorithm:**
           
           *   Define a method to robustly calculate the AABB's given their center (x, y) coordinates and dimensions.
           *   Generate a grid of potential `(x, y)` locations using small increments (0.005) to ensure I cover the entire surface, taking care to respect its boundaries.
           *   For each candidate location:
               *   **Verify Surface Containment:** Is the center (x, y) within surface bounds?
               *   **Check for Collisions:** Is the AABB of ID 7's at `(x, y)` without overlap with AABBs of ID 5, 8, and 4? I must not collide with any prior placement, or even any calculated overlaps.
           
           **Collision Check Function (Essential)**
           Use a highly robust function to identify non-overlapping regions for placing the new square object, against objects 4, 5, and 8. The use of a small epsilon value ensures boundary placements are valid and will not overlap with any placements. The use of `+epsilon` and `-epsilon` in `check_collision

               *   **Check for Collisions:** Is the AABB of ID 7's at `(x, y)` without overlap with AABBs of ID 5, 8, and 4? I must not collide with any prior placement, or even any calculated overlaps.
           
           **Collision Check Function (Essential)**
           Use a highly robust function to identify non-overlapping regions for placing the new square object, against objects 4, 5, and 8. The use of a small epsilon value ensures boundary placements are valid and will not overlap with any placements. The use of `+epsilon` and `-epsilon` in `check_collision
