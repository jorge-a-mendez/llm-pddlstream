User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.057, -0.458), (0.151, -0.365)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.11, 0.358, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.883).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.161, 0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.469, 0.883).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, 0.521, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.061, 0.998).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.257, 0.482), (-0.179, 0.56)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.104, -0.412, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.222, 0.975).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.062, 0.309), (0.159, 0.407)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.113, 0.443), (0.21, 0.54)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to reposition four objects, v8, v12, v14, and v16, so they're all resting on v18. Initially, I observe that these objects are located on v11 or v18. Specifically, v16, v8, v12, and v14 are currently on v11. My ultimate objective is to achieve the following: on(v8, v18), on(v12, v18), on(v14, v18), and on(v16, v18).
           
           To accomplish this, I must essentially "pick" each of these objects from v11 and "place" them on v18. The "on" predicate is fundamental here, derived from the "supported" and "atpose" predicates. For "on(?o, ?r)" to be true, both "supported(?o, ?p, ?r)" and "atpose(?o, ?p)" must be simultaneously valid. It seems that there is a common pose (#o2) for all of them on v18.
           
           Here's the problem: The only permissible action instance, according to the provided information, is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a significant constraint. I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects' `atpose` states.
           
           Since I am strictly limited to the provided action, and I am not permitted to use any actions outside of the allowed list, the goal is simply unattainable. This constraint effectively locks me out of changing the objects' atpose predicates. I can't modify their locations or satisfy the on predicates without these fundamental pick and place actions.
           
           The bottom line is that I'm restricted to only one action, move_base. Without the critical 'pick' and 'place' actions, I cannot modify the atpose predicate to reach my goal. Therefore, given these constraints, achieving the desired object arrangement is impossible. My analysis clearly points to the inherent lack of necessary actions within the problem's scope.
