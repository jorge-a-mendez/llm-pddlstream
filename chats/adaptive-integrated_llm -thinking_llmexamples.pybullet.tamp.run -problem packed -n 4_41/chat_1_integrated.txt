User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.057, -0.458), (0.151, -0.365)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.11, 0.358, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.883).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.161, 0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.469, 0.883).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, 0.521, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.061, 0.998).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.257, 0.482), (-0.179, 0.56)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.104, -0.412, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.222, 0.975).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.062, 0.309), (0.159, 0.407)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.113, 0.443), (0.21, 0.54)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Objective and My Initial Approach**
           
           My goal is to devise a plan to move four objects, identified as `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, from their current location on a table (`v11`) to a designated surface (`v18`). The initial setup indicates that these objects are supported by their specific poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17` respectively) on table `v11`. The key principle here is the `on` predicate, which is true if an object is supported by a surface and positioned at a specific pose. Therefore, I need to pick each object from its initial pose on `v11` and place it onto a new pose on `v18`.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of the Problem and Available Information**
           
           Let's begin by cataloging the objects and their current status:
           
           *   `v8`: `atpose(v8, v9)`, `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `graspable(v8)`, and `grasp(v8, #o1)`.
           *   `v12`: `atpose(v12, v13)`, `supported(v12, v13, v11)`, `graspable(v12)`, and `grasp(v12, #o1)`.
           *   `v14`: `atpose(v14, v15)`, `supported(v14, v15, v11)`, `graspable(v14)`, and `grasp(v14, #o1)`.
           *   `v16`: `atpose(v16, v17)`, `supported(v16, v17, v11)`, `graspable(v16)`, and `grasp(v16, #o1)`.
           
           The ultimate objective for each object is `on(o, v18)`. This translates to identifying a new pose, `#o2`, that meets the conditions `supported(o, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(o, #o2)`.
           
           **Analyzing Parameters and Available Actions**
           
           Key continuous parameters:
           
           *   `grasp(v8, #o1)`, `grasp(v12, #o1)`, `grasp(v16, #o1)`, `grasp(v14, #o1)`: All use a common grasp `#o1`, indicating they can be handled using the same grasping method.
           *   `pose(v8, #o2)`, `pose(v12, #o2)`, `pose(v16, #o2)`, `pose(v14, #o2)`: Representing each object's new position on `v18`. Here, I'll need to define a unique pose for each object.
           *   `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v16, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v14, #o2, v18)`: The target support states.
           
           The robot in this scene has two arms: `v4` and `v6`. Both are in an `handempty` state. Furthermore, it is known that `ataconf(v4, v5)` and `ataconf(v6, v7)` are true, and that the robot base is configured as `atbconf(v3)`. It is also possible to move the base with `canmove()` enabled.
           
           The `kin` predicates provide the necessary kinematics information for both picking and placing with arm `v4`.
           These predicates, specific to picking and placing with arm `v4`, also leverage a generic base configuration parameter (#o3) and a generic trajectory. (#o4). Therefore, picking `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) would be described by `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. Similarly, placing `v12` in a new position `#o2` would be described by `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           **Planning: A Step-by-Step Approach**
           
           My plan involves a sequence of pick and place actions for each object. Since all available `kin` predicates are associated with arm `v4`, I will utilize arm `v4`. The base configuration (`#o3`) is described as `#o3`. However, the present base config is `v3` and the only base motion operation is `basemotion(

(Thoughts: **The Impasse of Immovable Objects**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. That prior plan? Toss it. Completely unusable.  The core issue is crystal clear: the *only* action at my disposal is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, I can nudge my base around, but that's it.  It's a frustratingly limited instruction set.  No `pick`, no `place`, nothing to actually *do* anything with the objects.
           
           The goal, as I see it, is to get four objects: v8, v12, v14, and v16, all stacked neatly on top of v18. Currently, they're all piled on v11, according to my initial state.  The rub?  I can't *touch* them! The only operation I can perform is to move myself from base location v3 to location v3. 
           
           The problem is stark. I have a collection of objects to arrange on a new location, but I don't have the mechanisms. My "toolbox" is empty! I can maneuver my base, but that has absolutely *no* effect on the objects' positions. They're utterly stationary. 
           
           Given the constraints of my action repertoire, the state change I'm being asked to implement is simply impossible.  There's no path to a solution; the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable. It's a fundamental mismatch between the allowed actions and the desired outcome.
