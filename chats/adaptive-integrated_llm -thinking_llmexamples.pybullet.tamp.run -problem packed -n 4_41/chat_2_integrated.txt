User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.057, -0.458), (0.151, -0.365)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.11, 0.358, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.47, 0.883).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.161, 0.491, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.469, 0.883).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, 0.521, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.061, 0.998).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.257, 0.482), (-0.179, 0.56)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.104, -0.412, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.222, 0.975).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.062, 0.309), (0.159, 0.407)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.113, 0.443), (0.21, 0.54)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to move the four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18, keeping in mind I have to account for continuous parameters:**
           
           I understand I'm working with a robot that has two arms, but only arm v4 is relevant here, currently at aconfig v5. My initial base configuration is v3, but the action instances I have suggest that I'll need to move to base configuration #o3 for the pick-and-place actions. The objects are currently located at poses v9, v13, v15, and v17 respectively.
           
           My primary goal is to sequentially move each of these objects to v18. I'll need to define four different physical locations on v18, which I am logically defining with the same pose name, `#o2`. I will make sure the locations are distinct.
           
           **Here's the breakdown of my approach:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I'll begin by moving the robot's base from its current configuration, v3, to #o3 using `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The existing actions require the base to be at configuration #o3 to perform any further actions.
           2.  **Object Iteration:** For each object (v8, v12, v14, and v16), I will execute a *pick* and *place* action.
               *   **Pick:** Use the action `(pick v4 <object> <current pose> #o1 #o3 #o4)` to pick up the object from its current pose. The robot has the kinematic facts that let it pick each object.
               *   **Place:** Then, use `(place v4 <object> #o2 <o1 #o3 #o4)` to place each object at its respective #o2 pose on surface v18.
           
           **Considerations and Adjustments:**
           
           I need to make sure I've properly defined the `atpose` of #o2 for each object. Each object will get its own set of distinct coordinates that are within the surface bounds for v18. For each `#o2`, I've assigned distinct values.
           I'll also keep track of what predicates need to be met for each action in the plan to be valid. The axioms for `on` are the basis of ensuring the place operations are valid.
           I have a solid understanding of the preconditions and effects associated with each action to ensure that all requirements are met.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Details:**
           
           *   **PPDL bconf:**  I will define the base configuration #o3 to be at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), assuming the robot can reach all the necessary pick-and-place points from this location.
           *   **Poses**: Since the `pose(object, #o2)` is already defined in the initial state, I will need to give the values for each instance of #o2, since the instances reference each object and the goal. The x, y, and z coordinates will be within the boundaries of surface v18 with z=0.781. The theta values will default to 0.
           
           By implementing this structured plan and carefully defining the continuous parameters, I'm confident in achieving the final goal of placing all four objects onto surface v18.
