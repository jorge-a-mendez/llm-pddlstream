           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Achieving the `new-axiom@0()` Goal: A Comprehensive Plan**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. The main objective is to satisfy the conditions of the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which boils down to getting the rover, `v14`, to take images and analyze rocks, then send everything to the lander, `v9`. This involves a specific sequence of actions, and each must meet certain conditions.
           
           First up: `receivedimage`. I need to get images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20` with mode `v11`. Rover `v14` will handle this. It's currently at `v15` and needs to move to an imaging configuration I'll call `#o3`. Then the plan includes these steps:
           1.  Move the rover to `#o3`, the imaging config
           2.  Use the `calibrate` action to make sure the camera (`v10`) on `v14` is ready for the first image (`v17`)
           3.  Use the `take_image` action to get the first image
           4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining objectives
           5.  Move the rover to a communication configuration called `#o0` for sending images and analysis
           6.  Use the `send_image` action to get images to the lander.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`, I need to analyze rocks of types `v2` and `v6`. I'll do this after sending images.
           
           My plan has these rock analysis steps:
           1.  Move to a sampling configuration called `#o5`
           2.  Use the `sample_rock` action to analyze rock `v4` (type `v2`) which will fill the store.
           3.  Move back to the communication configuration.
           4.  Use the `send_analysis` action for `v4`.
           5.  Drop the analyzed rock `v4`.
           6.  Repeat steps 1 - 4 for another rock `v7` (type `v6`)
           7. Move back to initial config
           
           This should make sure all images are received and both rock analyses are done.
           
           Now, for those tricky continuous values:
           
           *   For the imaging configuration `#o3`, I'm going with `(0.0, 2.0)`. This should allow the rover's camera to see all four targets. I'm choosing a compromise, as the 2m range might be slightly exceeded.
           *   For the communications configuration `#o0`, I'm putting it at `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This will be the point rover `v14` moves to to send images to the lander.
           *   For the sampling configuration `#o5`, I'm going with `(1.26, -0.98)` to be directly above the rock and allow the sample to be taken.
           
           With these continuous values defined and this detailed action sequence, the `new-axiom@0()` goal should be achievable!

           First up: `receivedimage`. I need to get images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20` with mode `v11`. Rover `v14` will handle this. It's currently at `v15` and needs to move to an imaging configuration I'll call `#o3`. Then the plan includes these steps:
           1.  Move the rover to `#o3`, the imaging config
           2.  Use the `calibrate` action to make sure the camera (`v10`) on `v14` is ready for the first image (`v17`)
           3.  Use the `take_image` action to get the first image
           4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining objectives
           5.  Move the rover to a communication configuration called `#o0` for sending images and analysis
           6.  Use the `send_image` action to get images to the lander.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`, I need to analyze rocks of types `v2` and `v6`. I'll do this after sending images.
           
           My plan has these rock analysis steps:
           1.  Move to a sampling configuration called `#o5`
           2.  Use the `sample_rock` action to analyze rock `v4` (type `v2`) which will fill the store.
           3.  Move back to the communication configuration.
           4.  Use the `send_analysis` action for `v4`.
           5.  Drop the analyzed rock `v4`.
           6.  Repeat steps 1 - 4 for another rock `v7` (type `v6`)
           7. Move back to initial config
           
           This should make sure all images are received and both rock analyses are done.
           
           Now, for those tricky continuous values:
           
           *   For the imaging configuration `#o3`, I'm going with `(0.0, 2.0)`. This should allow the rover's camera to see all four targets. I'm choosing a compromise, as the 2m range might be slightly exceeded.
           *   For the communications configuration `#o0`, I'm putting it at `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This will be the point rover `v14` moves to to send images to the lander.
           *   For the sampling configuration `#o5`, I'm going with `(1.26, -0.98)` to be directly above the rock and allow the sample to be taken.
           
           With these continuous values defined and this detailed action sequence, the `new-axiom@0()` goal should be achievable!

(Thoughts: **Summary of Revised Plan and Configuration Adjustments**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that highlighted some key issues with my initial plan. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:
           
           First, with `#o3`, the imaging configuration, there was a collision issue. The previous configuration (0.0, 2.0) for the rover `v14` directly clashed with a wall object `v21` at x=0. To fix this, I'm now choosing a new configuration for the rover at (0.06, 2.0). I'm confident that with this shift, line of sight to the objectives, particularly `v17, v18, v19, v20`, will be maintained. The crucial point here is the `imagevisible` predicates, explicitly stated in the initial conditions, which assures me such a configuration is possible.
           
           Second, the system flagged an unreachable configuration for `#o0`, my communications setup, at `(-1.0, -1.5)`. Since I know v14 starts at (-1.0, -1.75) this is quite confusing. So, to ensure reachability, I'm now moving the configuration for `#o0` to (-1.7, -1.8). This placement is far better, closer to the target lander and still with clear line of sight.
           
           Third, there's a problem with the format for `#o5` which will be used for sampling. The feedback requested a specific format of "(<pose_name> <rover_name> <ray_name> <target_name>): (<x> <y>)". I have to adapt this format even though ray naming doesn't apply to the `above` predicate of sampling rocks. In adherence with all rules, I will use `#o4` as the ray object, even though that's meant for rays from `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. The two target rocks are v4 and v7. For v4, I need a position `(1.26 -0.98)`, and for v7, I will choose `(1.56, -0.02)`.
           
           I've made sure to cover the rover configuration and visibility distances per the rules, and checked for collision with the `x=0` wall. The system has indicated the format, and I will follow it.
           
           The plan structure now:
           
           1.  Move to `#o3` (0.06, 2.0)
           2.  Take images of all targets
           3.  Move to communication
           4.  Send images
           5.  Move to rock v4 sampling
           6.  Sample
           7.  Send the analysis
           8.  Drop v4
           9.  Move to the v7 sampling
           10. Sample
           11. Send the v7 sample analysis
           12. Move home to v15.

(Thoughts: **A Revised Strategy for the Rover**
           
           Okay, so I've been through this plan again, and after several tries, I think I've got a handle on the issues. The previous configurations had problems with collisions and reachability, and I needed to re-evaluate them. 
           
           Firstly, it's clear I need separate "#o3" configurations for each imaging target. The single "#o3" approach was causing conflicts given the spread of the objectives and distance constraints. So, I will define a unique "#o3" value for each objective, aiming to stay within the 2m imaging range.
           
           Here's the new setup:
           
           *   **Imaging Configurations (#o3):**
               *   For `v17`: Use `(-2.0, 1.7)`. This is near v17 and should be safe.
               *   For `v18`: Use `(-0.4, 1.8)`. Near `v18`, safe from collisions.
               *   For `v19`: Use `(2.1, 1.9)`. Near the objective, away from the obstacle.
               *   For `v20`: Use `(0.5, 2.0)`. This should meet the criteria for a good camera view.
           
           *   **Communication Configuration (#o0):** I'll be using `(-1.3, -1.5)`. This is clear of the lander and far enough to stay in range.
           
           *   **Sampling Configurations (#o5):** These configurations will be close to the rocks, and I'll make sure they are directly above the rocks. So I will ensure the distance is good.
               *   For `v4`: Use `(1.26, -0.90)`. (Centered on `x`, slightly above `maxy`). This is much better, much closer, than before.
               *   For `v7`: Use `(1.56, 0.10)`. (Centered on `x`, slightly above `maxy`).
           
           Importantly, since "reachable" means a complete and connected set of moves, I need the rover to move close to the rocks and take readings. The same goes for the imaging. The robot needs to go near the target to get all the data. I'm choosing `v12` as the rover, since `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v15` will get the rover close to the sampling targets and improve reachability. The system should generate trajectories for `#o2`.
           
           So, the new plan is: The rover will navigate in sequence to each `#o3`, take a picture, then to `#o0` for sending communications, then to `#o5` rocks, sample the rock, then send analysis and drop the rock, and finally return to the initial location `(1.0, -1.75)`. I'll implement this revised sequence of steps. Hopefully this revised strategy will now give a successful result.

(Thoughts: **Revisiting the Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so here's where I stand, after quite a bit of back-and-forth with those stubborn continuous parameters. My goal is still `new-axiom@0()`, but the previous attempts kept hitting snags with collisions or reachability. I've re-examined the key issues and re-evaluated the rover-target assignments to improve the chance of success.
           
           The fundamental challenge remains the same: I need both rovers to reach specific poses to image and sample while avoiding collisions and remaining within range constraints.
           
           The crucial constraint is that I must *move* the rovers. They can't stay put, because the *initial* configurations for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are not feasible for all objectives within range. I have to find a pose within 2m (for imaging) and 4m (for communication) of each target object.
           
           Here's my revised strategy:
           
           1.  **Imaging Assignments:**
               *   **Rover `v14`:** Will handle imaging `v17` (near (-2.1, 1.8)) and `v18` (near (-0.5, 1.9)).
               *   **Rover `v12`:** Will handle imaging `v19` (near (2.1, 2.0)) and `v20` (near (0.5, 2.1)).
           
           2.  **Communication:** Both rovers use lander `v9`.
           
           3.  **Sampling:**
               *   **Rover `v12`:** Will sample rock `v4` and rock `v7`.
           
           **Important Considerations:**
           
           *   *Specific Configuration Coordinates:* I *must* provide different `(#o3 v14 v17)` `(#o3 v14 v18)` `(#o3 v12 v19)` `(#o3 v12 v20)` values, even though they all have name `#o3`, to satisfy individual predicates. This is the crucial adjustment in my approach. The same goes for communication configurations `#o0` and the sampling `#o5`.
           *   *Reachability:* I've carefully re-calculated the coordinates and included some "buffer" space around obstacles to guarantee both collision-free paths and target visibility. I confirmed each coordinate is within range, and that the distance from the rover's initial position to its target destination is *also* reachable.
           *   *Store Management:* I'll ensure Rover `v12` drops rocks after the analysis to satisfy the goal predicate `free(v12,v16)`.
           
           **Plan for Rover `v14`:**
           
           1.  Move from `v15` to `#o3 v17` (a pose near `v17` for imaging).
           2.  Calibrate and image `v17`.
           3.  Move from `v17` to `#o3 v18` (a pose near `v18` for imaging).
           4.  Calibrate and image `v18`.
           5.  Move to `#o0` to send images to `v9`.
           6.  Send both images to the lander `v9`.
           7.  Return to `v15`.
           
           **Plan for Rover `v12`:**
           
           1.  Move from `v13` to `#o3 v19` (a pose near `v19`).
           2.  Calibrate and image `v19`.
           3.  Move from `#o3 v19` to `#o3 v20` (a pose near `v20`).
           4.  Calibrate and image `v20`.
           5.  Move to `#o0` to send the images to `v9`.
           6.  Send images.
           7.  Move to `#o5 v4`.
           8.  Sample Rock `v4`.
           9.  Move to `#o0` to send analysis for `v4`.
           10. Drop rock (to free store v16)
           11. Move to `#o5 v7`
           12. Sample rock `v7`
           13. Move to `#o0` to send analysis for `v7`
           14. Finally, move back to `v13`.
           
           Hopefully, this re-evaluation, revised plan, and the attention to specific *(#object name)* assignments will resolve the issues I've been facing. The *key* here is that the `#oX` continuous objects are distinct for *each* (rover, target) combination even if the generic name is the same.

Model:     **Revisiting the Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so here's where I stand, after quite a bit of back-and-forth with those stubborn continuous parameters. My goal is still `new-axiom@0()`, but the previous attempts kept hitting snags with collisions or reachability. I've re-examined the key issues and re-evaluated the rover-target assignments to improve the chance of success.
           
           The fundamental challenge remains the same: I need both rovers to reach specific poses to image and sample while avoiding collisions and remaining within range constraints.
           
           The crucial constraint is that I must *move* the rovers. They can't stay put, because the *initial* configurations for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are not feasible for all objectives within range. I have to find a pose within 2m (for imaging) and 4m (for communication) of each target object.
