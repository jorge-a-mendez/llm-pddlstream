           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal `new-axiom@0()` that boils down to a conjunction of conditions.  My primary objective is to build a plan to satisfy these conditions. The goal requires getting images of certain objects and analyzing specific types of rocks.  The initial state provides some key components: two rovers, v12 and v14, a camera v10, a mode v11 (likely a science mode), a lander v9, and a store v16.  I notice that the initial configuration and the initial predicates give us a hint towards the strategy. My initial thought is that both rovers are capable of achieving most of what's described in the goal.
           
           **Focusing on Reachability and Action Availability**
           
           The first four conditions of `new-axiom@0()` are already satisfied in the initial state, so the key task is to focus on the imagery and rock analysis. The problem comes down to leveraging available actions. The challenge is in moving to and from named configurations that are critical to these operations, which is often done in such situations. Now I need to explore these actions. I realize I have to work with: `move`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `drop_rock`. 
           
           **Diving into Action Preconditions and Effects**
           
           My next step is to examine the preconditions for each action, in a systematic manner. For `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, I need `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.  Each of these requires the robot's configuration to be at a particular location, described by the `#o` configurations. The problem states that I need a configuration where each target can be observed and communicated with. For `receivedanalysis(?r)`, sampling and sending analysis are required. `sample_rock` needs the store to be free. The action has a `full` effect on the store, meaning I must drop it, with `drop_rock`.
           **Re-evaluating Constraints and Interpretations**
           
           The restrictions placed on using specific action instances are a hurdle. The core concern here is that *precise* actions are defined. No action instance can be used if it's not present in the allowed list, especially if a configuration is mentioned. I have a problem since I only have the `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` for moves. This implies that the rovers are restricted to self-loop movements.
           
           **The Implicit Nature of Configuration Movement**
           
           Because the goal requires getting to other configurations, and there are no direct movements, I realize I might have to use some form of interpretation. The problem *implies* that the rover can move to these configurations if the geometry supports. The text states: "...must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene..." So, as I will use the `#` configs for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above`, I need to use the `move` action. The problem says I must ensure line of sight, and this means the values for such configurations are important.
           
           **Formulating the Plan**
           
           I now understand that I'll need a way to build this in a systematic order. The plan includes the following high-level actions: image capture, image transmission, rock sampling, and analysis transmission, with careful attention to the store to handle the full/free state.
           
           **Detailed Step-by-Step Plan and Configuration Definition**
           My plan for rover v14 will be:
           1.  Move to `#o3` (imaging). This is an *implicit move* and I will assign a value later.
           2.  Calibrate and take images, *recalibrating* for each objective.
           3.  Move to `#o0` (communicating). Another *implicit move* that I will configure later.
           4.  Send images.
           5.  Move to `#o5` (above the rocks) for `sample_rock`.
           6.  Send analysis, after moving back to `#o0` (com).
           7.  Drop the rocks and *free* the store.
           
           For configurations, I will use:
           `#o3`: For `v14` imaging. Central location for all objects. Set as (0.0, 1.5, 1.57).
           `#o0`: For `v14` communicating with lander, pick same starting position, but with orientation facing the lander, at (-1.0, -1.75, -1.57).
           `#o5`: For *above* rock, using coordinates as the rocks, so (0.705,

           2.  Calibrate and take images, *recalibrating* for each objective.

           7.  Drop the rocks and *free* the store.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           I've been re-evaluating the plan, forced to be more conservative about what the rovers can *actually* do. Previously, I assumed that movements *to* configurations mentioned in `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates were implied. This was a crucial misstep. The feedback is crystal clear: only the actions explicitly listed in `valid action instances` are permitted.
           
           This drastically limits the rovers' mobility. The only allowed move actions are ones that *keep* the rovers in their initial configurations: v12 at v13 and v14 at v15.
           
           Given this restriction, I'm now certain the plan won't work. Let's break it down:
           
           *   **Imaging:** Both rovers need to be at `#o3` to image, according to the `imagevisible` facts. They *cannot* get there. The current position (`v13` and `v15`) is incompatible with imaging any targets.
           *   **Communication:** Communicating with the lander (`v9`) requires being at `#o0` according to `comvisible`. Again, this is unreachable.
           *   **Sampling:** Sampling rocks requires being "above" them. This implies being at `#o5`, which is also unreachable.
           *   **Dropping Rocks:** Requires stores to be full. They are empty initially.
           
           Without the ability to move, the preconditions for any action that could achieve the goal (imaging, sampling, and communication) are *not* met. The initial state doesn't provide these elements at the locations where the rovers are allowed to be.
           
           The problem specifically says if the goal is unreachable to simply report that. Because of the extremely restrictive interpretation of 'valid action instances', the goal *is* unreachable from the initial state. The restricted move action is insufficient. Therefore, no plan is viable.

           This drastically limits the rovers' mobility. The only allowed move actions are ones that *keep* the rovers in their initial configurations: v12 at v13 and v14 at v15.
           
           Given this restriction, I'm now certain the plan won't work. Let's break it down:
           
           *   **Imaging:** Both rovers need to be at `#o3` to image, according to the `imagevisible` facts. They *cannot* get there. The current position (`v13` and `v15`) is incompatible with imaging any targets.
           *   **Communication:** Communicating with the lander (`v9`) requires being at `#o0` according to `comvisible`. Again, this is unreachable.
           *   **Sampling:** Sampling rocks requires being "above" them. This implies being at `#o5`, which is also unreachable.
           *   **Dropping Rocks:** Requires stores to be full. They are empty initially.
           
           Without the ability to move, the preconditions for any action that could achieve the goal (imaging, sampling, and communication) are *not* met. The initial state doesn't provide these elements at the locations where the rovers are allowed to be.
           
           The problem specifically says if the goal is unreachable to simply report that. Because of the extremely restrictive interpretation of 'valid action instances', the goal *is* unreachable from the initial state. The restricted move action is insufficient. Therefore, no plan is viable.
