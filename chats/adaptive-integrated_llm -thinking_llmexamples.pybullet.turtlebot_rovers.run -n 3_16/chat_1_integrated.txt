           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Path to New Discoveries**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a task in the `rovers` domain. It looks complex, but like any good scientist, I'll approach it step-by-step. The initial state reveals the current conditions. I can see that the configuration and storage states, as well as the initial `atconf` and `free` conditions are true right from the beginning. However, I need to focus on some missing pieces: the images and rock analysis.
           
           I've identified these key objectives: transmit images for objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19` using mode `v11`, and analyze and send the results for rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, and `v8`.
           
           The plan starts with using rover `v14` for imaging, and since I can see it has access to a camera and suitable mode, this is a reasonable choice. Then, I move to ensure visibility of key objectives, then perform `calibrate` and `take_image`, before using the move action to reach the communication configuration and `send_image`. This part is all about getting those images out.
           
           Next, I need to analyze those rocks. So, `v14` will then move to a new position to perform the sampling, use `sample_rock` to collect and analyze the rock samples, and then `drop_rock`. Once done, I will move to the communication configuration and `send_analysis`, thus sending the results.
           
           Now, all conditions are satisfied. After that, I will move the rover to satisfy `atconf`. The final configuration and analysis transmissions will complete my goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Here are the precise continuous values:
           *   `#o3`:  Rover `v14` moves to the position of **(0.0, 1.5)** to take the images.
           *   `#o0`: Rover `v14` moves to the position of **(-1.5, -2.0)** to transmit the data.
           *   `#o4`: The vector **(0.35, 0.33)** indicates the sightline to v18 from o3.
           *   `#o1`: The vector **(-0.4, 0.0)** indicates the sightline to v9 from o0.

(Thoughts: **Revising Configurations for a Collision-Free Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've got a plan generated, but the system flagged two collisions: my initial configurations for `#o3` and `#o0` are problematic.  Time to revisit those.
           
           First, `#o3`.  This is the image configuration for the rover `v14` when it's taking pictures. The system says my original choice `(0.0, 1.5)` is colliding with obstacle `v20`.  Looking at the obstacle description, `v20` is essentially a thin wall located at `x=0`.  Doh! My choice was *right on* that wall.  
           
           So, I need a new `#o3` configuration that avoids `x=0`. The rover needs to be able to "see" objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I know the rover is initially at `v15`, but that's not really relevant here, just the "visibility" constraints for the images. The problem statement says I can define different configurations for each target if I need to, but I'll try to find a single `#o3` that works for all three targets first.
           
           I need a point that is "visible" to these three target areas and within a distance of 2.  I've done the math on the target positions and determined some x and y limits.  After trying a few potential points near y = 1.0, the best way to get visibility is to try setting y = 1.7. This means I'll move back and try a x value, maybe closer. I ended up with `(-0.05, 1.7)` since the new x is slightly negative of `x=0` from my first choice (0.0).  That keeps the rover, `v14`, away from that pesky wall, `v20`.  I validated that this position is within the distance range for each of the targets.
           
           Next, I need to fix `#o0`, the communication configuration for `v14`. My previous choice of `(-1.5, -2.0)` was *inside* the lander, `v9`! Not very smart. The system is set up to provide line of sight to the lander using the predicate `comvisible`.
           
           So, I need a configuration *near* `v9`, but not inside it. The lander's center is roughly at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.  After looking at the lander's bounding box, and the fact that I want a communication range of 4, I'm going with `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This point is outside the lander and, from the geometry, should have line of sight to it. I confirmed the distance constraint is satisfied.
           
           The rest of the plan is fine; it *should* work without changes. The plan uses `#o5` for sampling, but that doesn't need a specific value assigned because it's not used in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates (the constraints).
           
           So, final configurations:  `#o3 = (-0.05, 1.7)` and `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)`.  The plan *should* work now! Let's see if the system agrees.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Configuration Constraints and Plan Refinement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous `#o3` and `#o0` configurations aren't valid. The main issue is that a single `#o3` can't possibly work for all three imaging targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) due to the obstacle `v20`.  The user has pointed out that the goal requires the system to send the images from the same camera on both robots (v10). Therefore, a solution needs to be found that ensures all requirements are met.
           
           Let's break this down. The problem statement says I need to provide continuous values for `#o` objects. So, it appears I can't use a single `#o3` value for all three images. The crucial clarification, then, is that if I have multiple (rover, target) pairs that need the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, I need a different continuous value for *each* pair.  
           
           My revised strategy will be:
           
           1.  Use `(-1.0, 1.0)` as `#o3` for `v17`. This should allow taking the images of `v17` and avoid collision with `v20`.
           2.  Use `(0.5, 1.0)` as `#o3` for `v18`. This should allow taking the images of `v18` and avoid collision with `v20`.
           3.  Use `(1.5, 1.0)` as `#o3` for `v19`. This should allow taking the images of `v19` and avoid collision with `v20`.
           4.  For communication with the lander `v9`,  use `(-1.0, -1.70)` as `#o0`. This is close to the start location of `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and should be easily reachable.
           
           The motion predicates also confirm that I can freely travel between the different `o3` configurations. Finally, I will provide the appropriate direction vector for the rays. With this change, the issue from the previous attempt that was caused by a single `#o3` being impossible, should be resolved.

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for Rover v14**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get this rover moving and achieving our objectives. The key is addressing those pesky "not reachable" errors. It seems the planner isn't happy with the previously suggested configurations for imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0) relative to v14's starting point (v15). So, I'm going to rethink those.
           
           **My Guiding Principles:**
           
           *   **Proximity:** I'll keep the new configurations close to v15 (-1.0, -1.75) as much as possible, hoping to avoid whatever reachability issues the planner is detecting.
           *   **Clear Line of Sight:** I must ensure the rover has a clear line of sight to the communication target (Lander v9) and the imaging targets (v17, v18, v19) without crashing.
           *   **Minimal Moves:**  I want to make as few moves as possible to reduce the chances of running into these reachability snags.
           
           **My Configuration Strategy**
           
           *   **Communication (#o0):** Instead of using v15, I'll *explicitly* set `#o0` to (-1.0, -1.8). It's close enough to v15 that it should be reachable. Plus, it's very close to Lander v9 at (-1.9, -2.0), so the communication range (4 units) should be easily satisfied.
           *   **Imaging (#o3):**  Since the objectives are spread out, I need three distinct image configurations:
               *   **For v17:** (x=-1.935, y=2.129), I'll set `#o3_v17` to (-1.0, 0.5). That puts the rover at y=0.5, which gives a good view of v17.
               *   **For v18:** (x=0.349, y=1.829), I'll set `#o3_v18` to (0.1, 0.5). The x coordinate ensures I am safely away from v20, and I still have a good look at target v18, which has y=1.83.
               *   **For v19:** (x=1.86, y=1.821), I'll set `#o3_v19` to (1.0, 0.5).
           
           **My Plan - Detailed**
           
           1.  **Move v14 to (-1.0, 0.5)** (where it can observe v17). Take the image of v17.
           2.  **Move v14 to (0.1, 0.5)** (where it can observe v18). Take the image of v18.
           3.  **Move v14 to (1.0, 0.5)** (where it can observe v19). Take the image of v19.
           4.  **Move v14 to (-1.0, -1.8)** to communicate with v9.
           5.  Send the images.
           6.  *Sampling and dropping of rocks, I will skip the details of this, since I am not providing the values.*
           7.  Move v14 to (-1.0, -1.8) to communicate with v9.
           8.  Send rock data to v9.
           9.  Return to v15 (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           **Why This?**
           
           *   **Minimize Reachability Risk:** Keeping the rover's movements closer to its initial y coordinate (for communication and for imaging) helps avoid the unknown reachability constraints and obstacles.
           *   **Clear Lines of Sight:** These positions are chosen because the coordinates will give a good line of sight to the targets to which it must image.
           *   **Simplicity:** I'm sticking with a single rover (v14) to keep things as simple as possible.
           
           Let's see if this revised plan works!

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I'm getting feedback that my previous configurations were either not reachable or were colliding. Time to re-evaluate based on the scene:  I've got `v14` (the rover) starting at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. There's this pesky obstacle, `v20`, a thin wall centered around the Y-axis (AABB: x between -0.05 and 0.05).  We've also got the lander `v9` at approximately (-1.9, -2.0) and three objectives: `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. The crucial point is the "not reachable" issue. My previous attempts have failed, so I'll need to rethink my approach.  I also have to remember the constraints: imaging range of 2 units, and comms range of 4 units.
           
           The "not reachable" problem is a bit of a mystery, but here's my hunch: since the parameters are *trajectories*, a "reachable" configuration *should* imply a valid path. The previous configurations might have been too far from the starting configuration, or there could be unseen obstacles that are complicating the direct paths.  So, I will try to stay close to the current position (`v15`) as much as possible, while achieving visibility and avoiding `v20`.
           
           **Revised Imaging Configurations:**
           
           *   **For `v17` (approx. (-1.935, 2.129)):** I need to move from the starting configuration to be able to see this one. Previous moves north were not possible, so I will try another position at `(-1.5, 0.5)`. This will place the rover far enough from `v20` (`x = -1.5`) with a distance of `1.68`, which is less than the required range of 2 units, while remaining accessible.
           *   **For `v18` (approx. (0.349, 1.829)):**  Previous attempts were in collision. So, I will move to `(0.5, 0.5)` to avoid `v20`, (x > 0.05). The distance is `~1.33` which is less than the required 2.
           *   **For `v19` (approx. (1.86, 1.821)):**  As before, I'll need to avoid collision. So, I will try `(1.5, 0.5)`.  This gives me a distance of `~1.37` and avoids the collision (`x=1.5`).
           
           **Revised Communication Configuration:**
           
           *   **For `v9` (lander, approx. (-1.9, -2.0)):**  I need to stay within the 4-unit comms range. I had problems previously, but I'll try `(0.1, -1.5)`. This is a decent path and avoids the x-range of the `v20` barrier. The distance to the lander is only `~2.06`.
           
           **Final Configurations:**
           
           *   `#o3` (to see `v17`): `(-1.5, 0.5)`
           *   `#o3` (to see `v18`): `(0.5, 0.5)`
           *   `#o3` (to see `v19`): `(1.5, 0.5)`
           *   `#o0` (to communicate with `v9`): `(0.1, -1.5)`
           
           I'll double-check everything, make sure I'm still avoiding `v20`, and hope these configurations work! Hopefully these modifications will also result in reachable configurations.

Time to re-evaluate based on the scene:  I've got `v14` (the rover) starting at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. There's this pesky obstacle, `v20`, a thin wall centered around the Y-axis (AABB: x between -0.05 and 0.05).  We've also got the lander `v9` at approximately (-1.9, -2.0) and three objectives: `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. The crucial point is the "not reachable" issue. My previous attempts have failed, so I'll need to rethink my approach.  I also have to remember the constraints: imaging range of 2 units, and comms range of 4 units.
           
           The "not reachable" problem is a bit of a mystery, but here's my hunch: since the parameters are *trajectories*, a "reachable" configuration *should* imply a valid path. The previous configurations might have been too far from the starting configuration, or there could be unseen obstacles that are complicating the direct paths.  So, I will try to stay close to the current position (`v15`) as much as possible, while achieving visibility and avoiding `v20`.
           
           **Revised Imaging Configurations:**
           
           *   **For `v17` (approx. (-1.935, 2.129)):** I need to move from the starting configuration to be able to see this one. Previous moves north were not possible, so I will try another position at `(-1.5, 0.5)`. This will place the rover far enough from `v20` (`x = -1.5`) with a distance of `1.68`, which is less than the required range of 2 units, while remaining accessible.
           *   **For `v18` (approx. (0.349, 1.829)):**  Previous attempts were in collision. So, I will move to `(0.5, 0.5)` to avoid `v20`, (x > 0.05). The distance is `~1.33` which is less than the required 2.
           *   **For `v19` (approx. (1.86, 1.821)):**  As before, I'll need to avoid collision. So, I will try `(1.5, 0.5)`.  This gives me a distance of `~1.37` and avoids the collision (`x=1.5`).
           
           **Revised Communication Configuration:**
           
           *   **For `v9` (lander, approx. (-1.9, -2.0)):**  I need to stay within the 4-unit comms range. I had problems previously, but I'll try `(0.1, -1.5)`. This is a decent path and avoids the x-range of the `v20` barrier. The distance to the lander is only `~2.06`.
           
           **Final Configurations:**
           
           *   `#o3` (to see `v17`): `(-1.5, 0.5)`
           *   `#o3` (to see `v18`): `(0.5, 0.5)`
           *   `#o3` (to see `v19`): `(1.5, 0.5)`
           *   `#o0` (to communicate with `v9`): `(0.1, -1.5)`
           
           I'll double-check everything, make sure I'm still avoiding `v20`, and hope these configurations work! Hopefully these modifications will also result in reachable configurations.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.5 1.0) for rover v14 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Problem Definition**
           
           I'm facing a challenge: the planner keeps flagging proposed configurations as either colliding or unreachable. The "unreachable" feedback is particularly vexing because I lack a detailed kinematic model or a path planner to rigorously assess this. My reasoning relies on the abstract `motion` predicates, which obscure the actual path planning details.
           
           The goal is to achieve specific states: both rovers at their initial positions, both stores free, images from three objectives received, and analyses from six rocks received.
           
           **Scene & Object Analysis**
           
           We have two rovers (`v12`, `v14`), a camera (`v10`), a store (`v16`), a lander (`v9`), three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), six rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`), and a thin wall (`v20`) at x=0. The scene geometry:
           - Rover `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` & `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           - The lander is to the left of these starting points.
           - Objectives are a 2-unit range away.
           - Wall `v20` goes between those objectives and rovers.
           
           **Reachability & Target Distribution**
           
           The repeated "not reachable" errors suggest a conservative strategy. Using a rover for all tasks is problematic given the spread of targets.
           
           **Rover `v14` Analysis**
           
           - `v14` cannot image any targets from its starting position.
           
           **Rover `v12` Analysis**
           
           - `v12` has a similar problem. The image range limit and wall `v20` prevent it from imaging targets from its starting position.
           
           **The Crucial Insight**
           
           It's clear *neither* rover can reach the targets from the initial positions. They have to move. The key is in understanding `conf`.
           
           **Understanding `conf(rover, #name)` & Configuration Specificity**
           
           The system provides `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, suggesting valid configurations already exist. If I *use* `#oX` configurations provided by the system, I *must* provide values. The system's internal planner will find those values. My incorrect calculations were bad values for those placeholders.
           
           **Revised Strategy: Collaboration & Target Assignment**
           
           Given the reachability problem, I need a two-rover approach:
           - `v14` will *only* handle imaging the left target (`v17`), sampling, and sending analyses.
           - `v12` will image `v18` and `v19` and send those images.
           
           **Detailed Plan**
           
           1.  **v14 (Imaging, Sampling, Analysis)**
               *   Moves from `v15` to `#o3_v17`.
               *   Calibrates, takes `v17` image.
               *   Moves to `#o0` (v15).
               *   Sends image of `v17`.
               *   Moves to `#o5` (a suitable sampling pose).
               *   Samples each rock, dropping them.
               *   Moves to `#o0` (`v15`).
               *   Sends rock analyses, drops remaining rock.
           2.  **v12 (Imaging)**
               *   Moves from `v13` to `#o3_v18`.
               *   Calibrates, takes image of `v18`.
               *   Moves to `#o3_v19`.
               *   Calibrates, takes image of `v19`.
               *   Moves to `#o0` (v13).
               *   Sends images of `v18` and `v19`.
           
           **Key Configuration Values & Rationale**
           
           -   `#o0` (comms)
               *   `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14` (stay in v15)
               *   `(1.0, -1.75)` for `v12` (stay in v13).
               *   Collision-free for comms with the lander.
           -   `#o3` (imaging)
               *   v14 will image at `(-1.0, 1.0)`
               *   v12 will image from `(0.5, 1.0)` & `(1.5, 1.0)`
           
           The primary concern is the large *y* changes during the imaging motion. If such vertical moves are implicitly forbidden, then
