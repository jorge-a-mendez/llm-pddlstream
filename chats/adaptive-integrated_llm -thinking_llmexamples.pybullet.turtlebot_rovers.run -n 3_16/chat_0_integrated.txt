           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to fulfill the specified goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This goal necessitates the satisfaction of several conditions, with four already met within the current state: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`.  The remaining subgoals, however, are unattainable due to an inherent restriction within the problem's design. These remaining goals require taking, receiving, and analyzing images, as well as sending the analyzed results. These goals require moving to other configurations.
           
           The plan hinges on the ability to perform actions such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These operations are dependent on rovers being in the correct configurations. Unfortunately, I'm constrained to the available action instances, which consist only of self-loop moves and dropping rocks. 
           
           The essential actions to achieve our goal have preconditions tied to configurations (`atconf(?v, ?q)`). To fulfill these, the rovers (`v12`, `v14`) must be at specific locations for taking images, sending them, sampling rocks, and analyzing them. The only movement actions available (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`) don't actually move the rovers. They are self-loops, meaning the rovers cannot change their configurations.
           
           Given the restrictions, it is not possible to achieve the remaining subgoals necessary to fulfill the desired `new-axiom@0()` goal. The provided action list is not sufficient to satisfy all preconditions. The goal is, therefore, unreachable given the current action instances.
