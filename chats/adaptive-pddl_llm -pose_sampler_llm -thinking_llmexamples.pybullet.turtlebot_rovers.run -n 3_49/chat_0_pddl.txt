           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Expert Assessment: Unreachable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I've delved into this `rovers` planning problem, aiming for that `new-axiom@0()` goal. My initial instinct, given my deep understanding of PDDL planning, was to build a multi-step plan involving image acquisition, communication, rock sampling, and analysis, all using the available rovers and their equipment. I meticulously broke down the goal's components - those `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates - and identified the necessary actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. I mapped out object assignments, particularly rovers, lander, cameras, and rock samples, and I made sure to consider state changes caused by `calibrate` actions so that it would be possible to take multiple pictures. It looked good. I figured out how to use one rover to acquire images and the other to stay put.
           
           But then, I noticed a very specific instruction: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." That changed everything. The only action instances I was given were two `move` actions (self-loops) and two `drop_rock` actions. None of those actions are capable of bringing us closer to the goal.
           
           The available `move` actions would maintain the state of the rovers at their initial positions, and the `drop_rock` actions could only affect the state of the stores for the rovers.
           
           Since the goal requires achieving a lot of predicates, and the only actions available do not enable any of those predicates to be achieved, I have to conclude that **the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given constraints.** This restriction on allowed actions is the key. My domain expertise tells me that this kind of problem is meant to be a trick.
