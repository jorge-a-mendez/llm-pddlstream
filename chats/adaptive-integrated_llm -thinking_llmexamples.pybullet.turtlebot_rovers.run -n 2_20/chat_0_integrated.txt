           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: A Plan Does Not Exist**
           
           I've carefully analyzed the problem and the constraints. My primary goal is to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which breaks down into four subgoals: acquiring images of two objectives (`receivedimage`), and receiving analyses of a stone and soil sample (`receivedanalysis`). My initial approach was to leverage the available actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These actions are necessary to achieve the subgoals. However, the problem statement provides a severely limited set of permitted action instances: moves that are essentially no-ops and `drop_rock`. 
           
           Here's the critical issue:  The required `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, along with their enabling actions like `calibrate`, are explicitly *not* allowed in this plan, based on the problem constraints. I can't construct the plan using the expected actions.
           
           Furthermore, the "move" actions in the restricted list only move the rovers from and back to their *same* current configurations (v13 and v15), which do *nothing* to get to configurations where communication or image capture are possible. The `drop_rock` actions in the restricted list are also not useful, since the initial state has no rocks to drop.
           
           Given that none of the allowed actions can achieve the subgoals of receiving images or receiving analyses, I've concluded that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is **unreachable** with the provided constraints. There is no valid plan. This seems to be a deliberate, subtle constraint.
