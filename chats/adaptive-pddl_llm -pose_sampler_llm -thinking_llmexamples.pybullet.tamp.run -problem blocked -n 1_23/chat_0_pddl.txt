(Thoughts: **My Thinking Process for Generating 50 Stable Object Placements**
           
           I need to find 50 stable positions for a small, square object (ID 5, size 0.07 x 0.07) on a given surface (surface 0, an AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object fits entirely within the surface boundaries and doesn't collide with anything else (at least for now, since there are no obstacles or other placed objects).
           
           First, I calculate the available space on the surface: it's 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high. The object is relatively tiny compared to this. To ensure the object remains within the surface, I need to account for its size and possible rotations.
           
           The object's size changes with rotation. Since it's square, the effective width and height are the same, and they range from 0.07 (no rotation) to 0.07 * sqrt(2) (around 0.09899, at 45-degree rotations). I call this the *effective size*.  To find the valid *x* and *y* coordinates for the object's center, I subtract half the effective size from the surface's edges.
           
           For the vast majority (49 placements), I'll use no rotation (theta = 0).  With zero rotation, the object's center has the following valid range, and the dimensions of this range will determine how many placements I can make:
           -   *x* range: \[4.235, 4.765\] (length: 0.53)
           -   *y* range: \[-0.565, -0.035\] (length: 0.53)
           
           I'll create a 7x7 grid of placements by evenly spacing the object centers within the ranges above, resulting in 49 placements. To find the spacing I need, I take range length / num steps.  The *x* step is (0.53 / 6). The *y* step is (0.53 / 6). I start at 4.235 and increment by (0.53 / 6) on the x axis, and start at -0.565 incrementing by (0.53 / 6).
           
           To add some variety, I'll make the final placement with a 45-degree rotation (pi/4 radians).  This increases the object's effective size. The valid range for the center is narrowed, but I can place the object at the center of this new range: x=4.5 and y=-0.3.
           
           So, the result is a set of 50 tuples (surf_idx, theta, x, y), which represent 50 stable placements of the object.
