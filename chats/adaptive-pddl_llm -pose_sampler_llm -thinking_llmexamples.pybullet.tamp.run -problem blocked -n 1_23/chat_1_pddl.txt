           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've expanded. This boils down to ensuring an object, represented by `?green`, is both "on" a specific object, `v18`, and of type `v17`. I've determined that `?green` can be either `v12` or `v8`.
           
           My initial thought is to try and move one of the objects to `v18`. From my analysis, the `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` axiom hinges on `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I can see that both `v12` and `v8` could potentially satisfy `on(?green, v18)` if they are placed at the correct poses. Specifically, I'm aiming for `atpose(v12, #o2)` or `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           However, my initial assessment of the provided initial state shows some potential trouble. The robot's actions are limited to `move_base`. The `move_base` actions do not change the base configuration to one needed by the `pick` or `place` actions. The `pick` and `place` actions require the base configuration to be `#o3`. However, the robot is currently at `v3`, and the provided action does not provide the capability of changing the base configuration.
           
           The only available action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, appears to be a no-op, at least from the perspective of changing base configuration. It essentially negates and then re-asserts the `atbconf(v3)` predicate and also negates `canmove()`.
           
           The key constraint here is that the `kin` facts, which are essential for `pick` and `place` operations, all require the robot's base configuration to be `#o3`. But my current base configuration is `v3`, and the `move_base` action doesn't change it.
           
           Since there's no way to modify the base configuration to `#o3`, I'm stuck. It's impossible to execute the `pick` and `place` actions needed to position either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Therefore, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is currently unreachable with the given actions and initial state.  I cannot achieve the desired state.
