User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) at x = 0, spanning the entire y-range. Other obstacles are smaller. I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target point (-0.5401306359567406 -0.0637159752940212) and avoid known obstacles. I will try to place positions on both sides of the vertical obstacle 5 at x=0. Since the target is to the left of x=0, I will prioritize positions on the left side of x=0. I will consider a few directions around the target point for the robot's base.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now (0.6388093829154968, 1.9874992370605469).
           My previous attempts had issues.
           (-1.5401306359567406 -0.0637159752940212) was no line of sight, which is expected as the target is to the right of x=0 and this position is far to the left of the vertical obstacle.
           (-0.5401306359567406 1.9362840247059787) collided with obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)). This makes sense since the y-coordinate of the proposed position is within the y-range of this obstacle, and the x-coordinate is also within its x-range.
           (-0.5401306359567406 -2.0637159752940213) was no line of sight.
           
           Given the target is at (0.63, 1.98), I should focus on positions to the right of the x=0 obstacle.
           I will try to stay away from the existing obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10 which are all in the range of y=1.75 to 2.25. The target is also in this range.
           I will try a position directly below the target, within the range.
           Then I'll try positions slightly to the left and right of the target.
