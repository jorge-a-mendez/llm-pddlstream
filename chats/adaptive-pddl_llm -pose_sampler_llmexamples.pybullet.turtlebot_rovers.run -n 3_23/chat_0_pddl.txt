User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central square obstacle (obstacle 0) with a vertical wall (obstacle 5) down its middle. There are also outer walls (obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4) forming a boundary for the environment. Several smaller obstacles are scattered around, including two in the top corners (7, 8), two in the top middle (9, 10), and various smaller rectangular obstacles (6, 11-21). I need to find positions that are within 2 units of the target point and avoid these obstacles. I will try to place the robot in open areas, favoring locations away from the known obstacles, and considering different directions around the target.
           
           Positions:
           (0.4 -0.5)
           (0.2 0.5)
           (1.0 0.0)
