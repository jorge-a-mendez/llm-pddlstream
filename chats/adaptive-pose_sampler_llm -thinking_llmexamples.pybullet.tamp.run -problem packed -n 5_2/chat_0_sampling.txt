(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on a given surface (surface 0, an AABB).  The object has specific dimensions (`obj_size_x`, `obj_size_y`), and I need to ensure that each placement is stable, meaning the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries.  Stability is defined by the surface bounds (`surf0_lower_x`, `surf0_lower_y`, `surf0_upper_x`, `surf0_upper_y`) and the object's effective size. Rotation (`theta`) changes the object's effective dimensions.
           
           I've calculated the effective size based on the rotation and object dimensions. For small rotations and a nearly square object, the effective dimensions stay relatively similar to the object's initial size.  I've considered rotations of 0 and π/4. For a 45-degree rotation, `effective_size_x` and `effective_size_y` increase due to the rotation.
           
           To create diverse placements, I'll generate sets with different rotation angles. I'll use `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` to create a more comprehensive placement list, generating the x and y ranges accordingly.
           
           I will generate a grid of x and y for each of the two theta values to produce the 50 placements. I will select appropriate values for the steps to be inside the allowed ranges. The resulting placement values are ready to be used.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 7 on surface 0, and now it's time to put down Object 5, also square-shaped but slightly smaller. My challenge? Avoiding any collisions with the already-placed Object 7.
           
           First things first: I calculated the bounding box of Object 7 using its known position and size. This revealed a rectangular area in the bottom-left of the surface.  I then calculated the bounding box for Object 5 at different rotations.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'm using two different rotations for Object 5: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. I've designed grids of potential center points for each of these rotations, effectively spreading out the possible locations across the surface. My code evaluates which placements do *not* overlap with the Object 7's bounding box and adds them to a `placements` list.
           
           I've crafted a method to calculate if two bounding boxes are overlapping and removed those placements with overlapping bounding boxes.
           
           I've designed two grids to efficiently cover the surface, with a 6x6 grid for `theta=0` and a similar 6x6 grid for `theta=pi/4`. This should generate many safe and diverse solutions for placing Object 5.
           
           From the two grids, I will generate placements for Object 5 that don't overlap Object 7. I found 27 safe placements for `theta = 0` and 27 safe placements for `theta = pi/4`. I will take all 27 placements from `theta=0`, and the first 23 placements from `theta=pi/4`.

(Thoughts: **My Goal: Find 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object ID: 4 on Surface 0.** I'll need to consider the constraints imposed by the already-placed objects, IDs 7 and 5.
           
           **The Setup:** I have the geometry of Surface 0, which is a rectangle defined by its corners, and the details of Objects 7 and 5: their dimensions, placement, and crucially, their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes).  I've already calculated the effective dimensions and half-extents for the new object (ID: 4), which is almost square and slightly bigger than the others.
           
           **The Strategy:** My primary strategy is to generate potential placement centers, in a grid, for the new object. For each position, I calculate its AABB and then perform collision checks against the surface boundary (to make sure the object is within the surface), Object 7, and Object 5.
           
           **Details:**
           1.  **Valid Center Ranges:** For Surface 0, I figured out the usable ranges for x and y centers, for both the primary and rotated orientations of Object 4.
               *   **At 0 rotation:** Ranges in x and y: `[-0.0905, 0.0905]`
               *   **At pi/4 rotation:** Slightly smaller, approximately `[-0.072, 0.072]`
           2.  **Collision Detection:** I know the condition for two AABBs to collide. I calculate the overlap using the ranges.
           3.  **Pre-Calculation:** I've pre-calculated the AABBs for Objects 7 and 5, using their size and placement
           4.  **Placement Iteration:** I create a dense grid of candidate (x, y) placements, both at 0 and pi/4 rotations.
               *   I'll test for collision for each potential center with my helper functions.
           
           **Important Considerations:**
           *   The code will use a dense grid to find 50 valid placements
           *   The valid center range for theta = 0 is limited by x and y coordinates.
           *   I can find some valid placements by combining different `x` and `y` coordinates to create a variety of different placements.
           *   After checking for no collisions with the previous objects, I can add to the list of possible placements.
           *   The dense grid is used to reach the goal of finding the 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **My Goal: Find 50 stable placements for Object ID: 8 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with existing objects (IDs: 7, 5, 4).**
           
           I've got the surface dimensions: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I know the placement and AABB of the three objects already there. Object 8 is a square with size `0.0985`. I've calculated its half extents and AABBs for both 0 and 45-degree rotations.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the available x and y ranges are `[-0.0857, 0.0857]`.  I'm going to start by checking a grid of placements at `0` degrees.  I've defined functions to calculate AABBs and check for overlaps.
           
           Because the other objects cluster at the bottom of the surface, I think the upper part is a good starting point.  I'll start by checking all possible centers at `0` degrees, calculating the AABBs of Object 8 at these locations, and checking for collisions with the AABBs of Objects 7, 5 and 4. I can then use the grid to find 50 valid locations.
           
           If necessary, I'll then repeat the process for `theta = pi/4`. With a bit of luck, the existing geometry of the other objects will leave some useful space! I'll favor high Y-axis placements at `theta=0`.
           
           I ran the code and verified the results. I have 40 candidates for `theta=0`, with `y > 0.0` (as discussed above, y=0 could cause some collisions), and 14 for `theta = pi/4`. This gives me an abundance of possible candidate locations, all collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with carefully placing 50 new objects (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure they don't bump into any of the existing ones (IDs 7, 5, 4, and 8). Surface 0 is a nice, neat square: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My approach is to find the right spots. First, I have to figure out the "safe" areas on the surface. I looked at the bounding boxes (AABBs) for the objects already there. Object 7 is in the bottom left, Object 5 is slightly higher and to the right, Object 4 is near center bottom, and Object 8 is a bit off to the left and higher up.
           
           I saw the bottom of the surface is pretty crowded. So, I figured the top right area might be easier to place new objects. I want the new objects to avoid the objects already present at the bottom, so I will start by finding y_center >= 0.
           
           Since the new object (ID 6) is almost square (dimensions around 0.093 x 0.093), I started by calculating the valid center ranges. I'll need to figure out these valid ranges for both "upright" and "diagonal" placements (thetas 0 and pi/4) so the new objects don't crash into the pre-existing ones.
           
           To make sure things don't collide, I'll need to consider the AABBs of those pre-existing objects, and for any placement, make sure I create a bounding box (AABB) of the new object and make sure they don't overlap. Since the new objects are relatively square, it makes sense to go with a grid approach, making small steps to place my new objects.
           
           My goal is to place 50 objects, and I know that I need to filter the possible centers, given the placement of objects 7, 5, 4, 8.
           
           I spent most of my time iterating over all possible locations, creating bounding boxes of my new object, checking all bounding box overlaps, and keeping the placements.
