User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a 5x5 square defined by obstacles 0-4, which form the outer walls. There's a vertical wall in the middle (obstacle 5) at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I need to find 3 valid base positions within a 2-unit radius of the target point. I will try to place positions that avoid these obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are likely to be clear, avoiding areas near the center wall and other small obstacles, especially those close to the target. I will also try to keep a diverse set of positions around the target.
           
           Positions:
           ({x_1} {y_1})
           ({x_2} {y_2})
           ({x_3} {y_3})
