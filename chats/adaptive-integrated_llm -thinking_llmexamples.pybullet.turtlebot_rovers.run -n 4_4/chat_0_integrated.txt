           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've analyzed the problem, and here's the deal: I'm trying to achieve a goal (`new-axiom@0()`) that boils down to getting images and analysis reports. The problem is, my hands are tied.
           
           The plan involves taking images of objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and getting analysis of stone/soil samples (v1, v5). I need to *take* images, *send* them, *sample* rocks, and *send* analyses. To do this, I would normally use actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the problem explicitly states that I can only use actions from a *given list* and that's the kicker!
           
           That given list is tiny: two *move* actions (both self-loops) and two *drop_rock* actions. That's it!  I can't *move* anywhere useful, and I can't do anything that generates the goal conditions using the tools I need. My starting configuration is at `atconf(v12, v13)`, I need to get to other positions for imaging or analysis, and so the current plan is just a self-loop. The required predicates `receivedimage` (for all objectives) and `receivedanalysis` are not true in the initial state and can not be true with actions I can use.
           
           So, the conclusion is clear: with the limited set of actions available, the goal is *unreachable*. It's impossible to generate the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts.
