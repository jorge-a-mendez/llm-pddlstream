           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the `new-axiom@0()` Goal and Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. This looks like it requires a combination of imaging and analysis of rocks. I need to figure out a plan, but first, I've got to break down the axiom's conditions. I see it requires getting images and analyses, which means I'll need rovers to take pictures, landers to receive them, and rocks to be analyzed.
           
           I start by checking the initial state, which confirms that some preconditions are already met. The key is now gathering images and analyses. I know I have rovers, a lander, and a store. The tricky part is the "what", and "where".
           
           *   I need images of objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` with a certain mode.
           *   I also need analyses of rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil).
           
           Now, let's explore my toolbox. My main actions are:
           
           *   **`move`**: Doesn't seem relevant now, as the rovers are already in their positions.
           *   **`take_image`**: Requires the camera to be *calibrated*.
           *   **`calibrate`**: Need that *before* taking images.
           *   **`send_image`**: Send a completed image to the lander.
           *   **`sample_rock`**: This is how I get rocks analyzed.
           *   **`send_analysis`**: Sending the analyses.
           *   **`drop_rock`**: Dropping rocks in the store.
           
           I have these rovers: `v12` and `v14`. They are equipped with a camera.
           
           The immediate problem is, the rovers have a specific position (`atconf`) listed in my initial condition.
           
           **The Configuration Bottleneck**
           
           I need the rovers to *move*.
           
           The critical issue is the `atconf` predicate. To take images, I need the rovers to be at configuration `#o3`. To communicate, I need config `#o0`. To sample rocks, I need config `#o5`. But, my *only* available move actions are effectively no-ops: they keep the rovers at their initial `atconf` locations (`v13` and `v15`, respectively). The movement actions are useless in their present forms. This is really bad.
           
           **The Path Forward is Blocked**
           
           I analyze the dependencies, thinking of the whole process. I have to go through the whole chain.
           
           *   To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll use `take_image` and `send_image`.
           *   To achieve `receivedanalysis`, I'll use `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.
           *   The fundamental requirement for *all* these actions is to *be at the right configuration*.
           
           However, I cannot move my rovers to any of these required locations!
           
           I also considered potential `blocked` ray conditions, but that's not the critical issue here.  Even if the rays weren't blocked, the rovers are still stuck in their starting configs.
           
           **Conclusion: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Because I am unable to manipulate the `atconf` predicate using the provided action set, I cannot move the rovers to the necessary configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`) to fulfill the preconditions of actions that lead to the `new-axiom@0()` goal. My plan is essentially blocked. I have to inform the user that their goal is not achievable with the provided resources.
