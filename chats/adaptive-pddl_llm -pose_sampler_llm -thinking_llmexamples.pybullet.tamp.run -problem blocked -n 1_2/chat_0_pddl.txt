           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) of dimensions approximately 0.079 x 0.079, on a given surface with bounds (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since the object is small relative to the surface and no other constraints (obstacles or other objects) are initially present, finding valid placements requires ensuring the object is fully contained within the surface and considering its rotational freedom.
           
           I begin by calculating the valid range for the object's center point.  I recognize that even if the object is rotated, it must be completely enclosed within the surface bounds. To account for all possible rotations, I calculate the diagonal of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). Half of this diagonal (approximately 0.0559) represents the maximum distance the object's center can be from the surface edge, regardless of rotation.  This ensures containment even with extreme rotations. This conservative approach, while not optimal for specific rotations, is robust and necessary to satisfy the requirement of 'full containment' under all circumstances.
           
           Using this half-diagonal, I establish the valid center ranges:  4.256 to 4.744 for the x-coordinate, and -0.544 to -0.056 for the y-coordinate.  I then create a 5x5 grid of center points within these ranges, generating 25 unique (x, y) coordinates.  To introduce diversity, I then apply two rotation angles: 0 degrees and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) to each coordinate.  This results in 50 distinct (surf_idx, theta, x, y) placement configurations as required. The object ID (10) is a tracking identifier, and doesn't impact placement logic. I have ensured that the AABB formed around the object *will* be contained within the AABB of the surface.
