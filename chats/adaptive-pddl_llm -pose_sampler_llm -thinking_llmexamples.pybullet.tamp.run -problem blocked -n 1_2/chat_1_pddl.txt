           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Base Configuration Constraint**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* a particular object. Specifically, I need `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified that the objects `v12` and `v8` satisfy `type v17`.  Now I need to get one of them onto `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was to examine the initial state. I have `on(v12, v14)` and `on(v8, v11)`.  No problem there. However, to get `v12` or `v8` *on* `v18`, I need the robot to perform a `pick` and `place` sequence. Specifically, to make `on(v8, v18)` true, I need to get `atpose(v8, #o2)` such that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`.
           
           Here's the snag: the `pick` action requires the robot to be at a particular base configuration, represented by `#o3`.  To achieve that, I'd need to use a `move_base` action. But, the only `move_base` action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change the robot's base configuration! I remain in `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           Therefore, the preconditions of the `pick` and `place` actions, including the necessary base configuration, will *never* be met. Since I can't move the objects, I can't modify their `atpose` states. Furthermore, no object of type `v17` is *already* on `v18`.
           
           Conclusion: since I can't move the necessary objects to achieve the target, the goal is *unreachable*.
