           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` which are graspable and stackable. There are also several poses `v9`, `v13`, `v16`, `#o2` and regions `v10`, `v11`, `v14`, `v18`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`. Both are initially handempty. The robot's base is at `v3` and `v4`'s arm is at `v5`, and `v6`'s arm is at `v7`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`. So `?green` can be `v8` or `v12`. We also have `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`. So if we can get `v8` or `v12` on `v18`, the goal will be satisfied.
           
           Currently, `v8` is on `v11` (supported by `v9` on `v11`). `v12` is on `v14` (supported by `v13` on `v14`). `v15` is on `v11` (supported by `v16` on `v11`).
           
           We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`. So we can pick up `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2` which is on `v18`.
           Similarly, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. So we can pick up `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2` which is on `v18`.
           
           Let's choose `v8`. We have the following `kin` relations for `v4` and `v8`:
           `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (for picking `v8` from `v9`)
           `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (for placing `v8` at `#o2`)
           
           The plan would be to pick `v8` from `v9` using `v4`, then place it at `#o2` which is on `v18`.
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies we don't need to move the base, as `v3` is the initial base configuration and the goal base configuration is also `v3`. The `kin` relations already specify `#o3` (a base configuration) as `bconf(#o3)`, and this `#o3` can be `v3`. The trajectory `#o4` and grasp `#o1` are continuous parameters that will be solved.
           
           Preconditions for pick:
           `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Provided.
           `atpose(v8, v9)`: Provided.
           `handempty(v4)`: Provided.
           `atbconf(#o3)`: Since `#o3` can be `v3`, and `atbconf(v3)` is provided, this is satisfied.
           `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)`: Assumed to be false if not explicitly stated true.
           `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: Assumed to be false if not explicitly stated true.
           
           Preconditions for place:
           `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Provided.
           `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`: Achieved by pick action.
           `atbconf(#o3)`: `atbconf(v3)` is provided.
           `NegatedAtom unsafepose(v8, #o2)`: Assumed to be false.
           `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, #o2, #o1)`: Assumed to be false.
           `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: Assumed to be false.
           
           Therefore, this plan should work.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies, I misunderstood the constraint regarding the action instances. I can only use the provided `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` action.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. To achieve this, an object `?green` (which could be `v8` or `v12` as they are `type(?green, v17)`) must be placed on `v18`. This involves a `pick` and `place` action.
           
           However, the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the robot's base from configuration `v3` to `v3` (i.e., no actual movement) and costs `distance(v3,v3)`. It does not change the state in a way that would allow for an object to be moved or placed.
           
           Since `pick` and `place` actions are not available in the list of valid action instances, it's impossible to move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` to satisfy the `on` predicate of the goal. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of valid actions.
