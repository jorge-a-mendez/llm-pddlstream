(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` on top of object `v20`. The governing principle here is the `on` axiom: to have an object "on" another, it must be supported and in the correct pose.  I've broken down this goal for each individual object, ensuring each needs to be supported by, and correctly positioned upon, `v20`.
           
           The initial state provides crucial information.  I've noted the existing `atpose` and `supported` facts for each object.  Crucially, I've observed that `v8` can be supported by `v20` via `supported(v8, #o2, v20)`, and I know what that means for each of the objects.  Therefore, to achieve the `on` goal for each object, I need to manipulate their positions until I have `atpose` facts matching the `supported` facts.  For instance, `v8` needs to go from its current `atpose(v8, v9)` state to `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           I've examined the `pick` and `place` actions that I can leverage. They're my tools for moving the objects. Each action has preconditions to be met to ensure that the arm's actions are safe and valid, and effects of the action describe the change in the state of the objects and the arm. This will determine my actions for placing objects down and picking them up.
           
           The robot's current state is `handempty` and `atbconf(v3)`. I know that to execute a pick and place operation, my actions need to be: Pick an object, then move the base, then place it down.
           
           Looking at `v8` as an example, I need to use a `move_base` action before any other actions, so I can successfully use the `pick` action to move the object, after `move_base` action.
           
           Then, the sequence of actions must be:
           1.  Move the robot's base configuration to `#o3`.
           2. Pick and place v8 onto v20 at a specific pose.
           3. Repeat 2 for the rest of the objects.
           
           The exact steps are well-defined: I start by moving the base to a specific config `#o3`, and then I repeatedly pick each object from its initial pose and place it at pose `#o2` on `v20`, using the provided parameters for arm, grasp, base config, and trajectory.  Importantly, because the `supported` predicate is already in place, the `on` axiom will be satisfied as soon as each object is placed. This is straightforward due to how my system interprets these states. Each pick and place action must meet its preconditions. This leads to a systematic solution for stacking the objects as desired.
           
           The final plan is simple and elegant: I move the base, then I iteratively pick and place. There are no unforeseen complications and I have verified the robot's mobility at each stage.
