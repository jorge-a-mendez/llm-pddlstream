User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to find three possible spots for a robot's base, given a target point, avoiding collisions, and ensuring a clear line of sight.  I'm constrained by a maximum range of 2 units from the target and the robot's base must be within the square x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. I have a list of AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes) representing fixed obstacles.  
           
           First, I need to understand the workspace.  The provided AABBs define the overall playable area, with internal obstacles like a vertical wall at x=0, some blocks in the top and bottom corners, and a scattering of smaller obstacles. The central vertical wall is especially tricky as it will severely limit where I can place the robot's base.
           
           My strategy is to:
           
           1.  **Define a Search Area:**  A circle of radius 2 centered on the target point.
           2.  **Filter by Workspace Bounds:** Eliminate any potential base positions outside x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           3.  **Generate Candidates:**  I will aim to create diverse positions. I'll consider locations at different angles from the target (0, 45, 90 degrees and so on) and at varying distances (closer and further within the max range).
           4.  **Collision Check:** I will verify each candidate position is not inside any of the obstacles' AABBs, with a small safety margin.
           5.  **Line-of-Sight Check:** The line segment from a candidate base to the target must not intersect any obstacle's AABB.
           
           The key to this problem is line of sight. I will use a simplified approach for line of sight and prioritize positions that are likely clear. The feedback from the system will correct if there are issues. The core logic will check the distance to other fixed obstacles. The vertical wall is the most important to take into account.
           
           To implement the LOS and collision checking, I will use some custom functions:
           *   `is_point_in_aabb(point, aabb)`: determines if a point is within the bounds of a given AABB.
           *   `check_segment_aabb_intersection(p1, p2, aabb)`: a function that performs segment-AABB intersection check for LOS purposes.
           
           I will attempt to generate three distinct robot base positions using a combination of the above, attempting to avoid collision with those AABBs. My core logic generates candidate locations using the specified ranges and target position. For each candidate position, I check if it falls inside any obstacle's AABB; if so, that position is deemed invalid. For the line of sight, I use `check_segment_aabb_intersection` to make sure each obstacle is not interfering.
           The last key is if the target is inside an obstacle, which by the line of sight definition, means it's blocked, so no positions will be found. However, I have to ensure I always return three results, even if I have no valid options, as stated by the directions. If there are no obvious base locations, I have to fall back on basic fallback points around the target, and report those, with the understanding that they may not be valid.
