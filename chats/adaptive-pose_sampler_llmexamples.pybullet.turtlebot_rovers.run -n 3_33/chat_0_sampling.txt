           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) at x = 0. There are various other smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, some of which are aligned in rows. My strategy is to pick points that are within range of the target, and prefer positions in open areas. I will try to space out the positions to give diverse options.

           The previous target was (-0.5827526450157166, 1.8620948791503906). The proposed points (-0.9754941913709669, 0.4871927581729227) and (-1.975494191370967, 1.4871927581729227) were "not reachable". This is surprising given they are within the [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. Perhaps this means there's an unseen obstacle or a general reachability issue that needs to be considered. The point (-0.9754941913709669, 2.4871927581729225) collided with obstacle 0, which is the northern wall. This means I should be careful not to propose points too close to the boundaries, especially in the Y direction.

           For the previous target (2.0911097526550293, 2.125476121902466):
           - (-0.5827526450157166, 0.8620948791503906) had no line of sight. This point is far from the target and likely behind obstacle 5 (at x=0) or other obstacles in the middle.
           - (0.4172473549842834, 1.8620948791503906) collided with obstacles 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) and 20 ((0.2745611599055286, 1.795000665482616), (0.3729882308873181, 1.8934277364644054)). These obstacles are in the top-right quadrant, just to the right of the y-axis, and are quite small. This tells me to be careful in this region.
           - (-1.5827526450157166, 1.8620948791503906) collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). This obstacle is in the top-left quadrant.
           
           Given these failures, I need to be more mindful of the obstacles within the quadrants and consider positions closer to the target but also in open areas. The previous positions were too far from the target or too close to known obstacles.
