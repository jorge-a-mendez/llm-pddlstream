           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.056, -0.429), (0.155, -0.33)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.241, -0.38), (-0.142, -0.281)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.105, -0.38, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.373, 0.928).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.192, -0.331, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.383, 0.924).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.119, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.135).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Move Objects**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get three objects, v8, v12, and v14, onto surface v16.  They're all currently sitting on surface v11.  The rules are straightforward: I need to use the available "pick" and "place" actions to move each object individually.  The crucial part is understanding how to specify the final resting place on v16.
           
           The provided information clearly indicates that all three objects can be placed at the same *pose template* `#o2` on v16, but with distinct *continuous values* for each object at that pose.  This is a key insight. I'll need to generate three distinct poses, let's call them `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v14`, which all have the name `#o2`. These unique pose values will be in continuous coordinates, and I'll carefully consider their x, y, z, and theta values to ensure each object is placed without colliding with anything else.  The key is to generate unique continuous values.
           
           The robot has two arms, but only one (v4) has valid pick and place actions available.  I'll be using arm v4.  I also have to work with base configurations. The initial base configuration is v3. However, based on the provided action instances, I think I need to *move* the base from v3 to a different configuration `#o3` before picking up the objects.  This movement is necessary because the available pick and place actions require the base to be at configuration `#o3`.  This action will cost `distance(v3, #o3)`.
           
           My plan is going to be simple:
           1.  Move the base from `v3` to `#o3` (if necessary).
           2.  Pick up v8 from its current position on surface v11.
           3.  Place v8 at the new pose `#o2_v8` on v16.
           4.  Pick up v12 from its current position on surface v11.
           5.  Place v12 at the new pose `#o2_v12` on v16.
           6.  Pick up v14 from its current position on surface v11.
           7.  Place v14 at the new pose `#o2_v14` on v16.
           
           The core of the challenge is generating those specific pose values for each object on v16.  I need to ensure these poses are:
           *   Within the boundaries of v16.
           *   Stable placements.
           *   Collision-free.
           
           I've determined that the z-coordinate for all the objects on v16 should be the same as their initial placement z coordinate (0.781) because that's their stable placement position. Now, I need to decide on the x and y coordinates.
           
           For `#o2_v8` on `v16`, I'll place the center at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781).
           For `#o2_v12` on `v16`, I'll place the center at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781).
           For `#o2_v14` on `v16`, I'll place the center at (0.0, -0.08, 0.781).
           
           Given that I know the initial state has the "supported" predicate, I am confident that these locations will satisfy the plan constraints.
           
           The actions are all defined, with base movement cost and the pick and place costs already determined. I have confirmed that those costs are `distance(v3, #o3)` and 1 respectively for pick and place.
