           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategy for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           My goal is to create a plan to satisfy the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, which requires receiving specific images and analyses, while maintaining certain initial rover configurations. Let's break down the plan into manageable steps:
           
           1.  **Preparation**: First, I analyzed the goal and identified the following necessary conditions:
               *   Rover `v12` must be at its initial configuration, and its store `v16` must be free.
               *   Rover `v14` must be at its initial configuration, and its store `v16` must be free.
               *   Receive an image of objective `v17` in mode `v11`.
               *   Receive an image of objective `v18` in mode `v11`.
               *   Receive an image of objective `v19` in mode `v11`.
               *   Receive an analysis of a stone of some type `v2`.
               *   Receive an analysis of soil of some type `v6`.
           
               Based on the initial state, the first four conditions are already met. Thus, I need to focus on completing image reception and analysis, ensuring that the initial rover configurations and store availability are maintained.
           
           2.  **Image Acquisition and Transmission**: Rover `v14` will be responsible for obtaining and sending the required images. It is possible for it to view all three objectives `v17, v18, v19` from a single configuration, and that makes it easier to keep the plan simple.
           
               *   `v14` will first move to a configuration `#o3`, defined at `(-0.709, 2.0095)`, that allows it to capture all images.
               *   From there, it will calibrate its camera, take images of each objective in mode `v11`, and move to a configuration `#o0` at `(-1.9, 0.0)` for communication.
               *   At the configuration `#o0`, it will send all three captured images to the lander `v9`, and return to its initial state `v15` for goal achievement.
           
           3.  **Soil and Stone Analysis**: Rover `v12` will handle the sample collection and analysis processes.
           
               *   It begins at its initial configuration `v13` and must end the process at that position.
               *   It will first move to a configuration `#o5`, whose geometry is specified implicitly by the initial conditions, to collect samples.
               *   It will obtain stone and soil samples in its store. Because each `sample_rock` action creates a `full` state, and the final state requires a free store, `sample_rock` action must be followed by `send_analysis`, `drop_rock` pairs to free the store.
               *   It will then move to configuration `#o0` at `(-1.9, 0.0)` for communication.
               *   It will transmit the analyses of the stone and soil to the lander. The prompt did not specify which order the rover performs tasks so any sequence of stone and soil analysis will do, but each analysis will require a movement from the sample configuration (`#o5`) and to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
               *   Rover `v12` will drop each sample from store, and return to its initial configuration `v13`.
           
           4.  **Final Checks**: All the image, and analysis requirements would be met. Both rovers must be in their initial configurations, and their stores must be free.
           
               To conclude, the `conf` for configuration, `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements are critical for the plan's validity. While the PDDL plan uses symbols, the given requirements are interpreted to require specific values to be associated with these symbols.
           
               Thus, to satisfy the instructions:
               *   `#o3 = (-0.709, 2.0095)` (rover `v14`, objectives `v17, v18, v19`)
               *   `#o0 = (-1.9, 0.0)` (for both `v14`, `v12` with the lander `v9`).
           
               The PDDL code itself will utilize the specified action, with `#o0` and `#o3` configuration, but the underlying system would use the given numerical (x, y) coordinates.

               *   Rover `v12` must be at its initial configuration, and its store `v16` must be free.
               *   Rover `v14` must be at its initial configuration, and its store `v16` must be free.
               *   Receive an image of objective `v17` in mode `v11`.
               *   Receive an image of objective `v18` in mode `v11`.
               *   Receive an image of objective `v19` in mode `v11`.
               *   Receive an analysis of a stone of some type `v2`.
               *   Receive an analysis of soil of some type `v6`.
           
               Based on the initial state, the first four conditions are already met. Thus, I need to focus on completing image reception and analysis, ensuring that the initial rover configurations and store availability are maintained.
           
           2.  **Image Acquisition and Transmission**: Rover `v14` will be responsible for obtaining and sending the required images. It is possible for it to view all three objectives `v17, v18, v19` from a single configuration, and that makes it easier to keep the plan simple.
           
               *   `v14` will first move to a configuration `#o3`, defined at `(-0.709, 2.0095)`, that allows it to capture all images.
               *   From there, it will calibrate its camera, take images of each objective in mode `v11`, and move to a configuration `#o0` at `(-1.9, 0.0)` for communication.
               *   At the configuration `#o0`, it will send all three captured images to the lander `v9`, and return to its initial state `v15` for goal achievement.
           
           3.  **Soil and Stone Analysis**: Rover `v12` will handle the sample collection and analysis processes.
           
               *   It begins at its initial configuration `v13` and must end the process at that position.
               *   It will first move to a configuration `#o5`, whose geometry is specified implicitly by the initial conditions, to collect samples.
               *   It will obtain stone and soil samples in its store. Because each `sample_rock` action creates a `full` state, and the final state requires a free store, `sample_rock` action must be followed by `send_analysis`, `drop_rock` pairs to free the store.
               *   It will then move to configuration `#o0` at `(-1.9, 0.0)` for communication.
               *   It will transmit the analyses of the stone and soil to the lander. The prompt did not specify which order the rover performs tasks so any sequence of stone and soil analysis will do, but each analysis will require a movement from the sample configuration (`#o5`) and to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
               *   Rover `v12` will drop each sample from store, and return to its initial configuration `v13`.
           
           4.  **Final Checks**: All the image, and analysis requirements would be met. Both rovers must be in their initial configurations, and their stores must be free.
           
               To conclude, the `conf` for configuration, `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements are critical for the plan's validity. While the PDDL plan uses symbols, the given requirements are interpreted to require specific values to be associated with these symbols.
           
               Thus, to satisfy the instructions:
               *   `#o3 = (-0.709, 2.0095)` (rover `v14`, objectives `v17, v18, v19`)
               *   `#o0 = (-1.9, 0.0)` (for both `v14`, `v12` with the lander `v9`).
           
               The PDDL code itself will utilize the specified action, with `#o0` and `#o3` configuration, but the underlying system would use the given numerical (x, y) coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Problem Definition**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed, and it seems the culprit was the configuration for image capture (`#o3`) and communication (`#o0`). They were, to put it mildly, poorly chosen. I need to re-evaluate those continuous values while keeping a few constraints in mind. First, the `imagevisible` distance is a maximum of 2 units, and `comvisible` is a maximum of 4 units. There's also the need to avoid collisions, a crucial, and somewhat embarrassing, oversight last time. Finally, the chosen configurations must be reachable by the rovers, a constraint implicitly handled by the motion predicates but that needs explicit consideration in the value selection.
           
           **Objective Re-Evaluation**
           
           Let's revisit the objectives. I've got `v17, v18, and v19`, and they’re scattered across the map. The previous attempt at `#o3` was a central location, but that resulted in a collision with `v20` and `v18` itself. That's a no-go. I need to find a `#o3` that is within 2 units of all three objectives, is collision-free, and is reachable from `v14`'s initial position (`v15`). The wording "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the imagevisible or comvisible predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" is interesting, does it imply that if I have `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` I need to provide different #o3 values? It could, but given the structure of the problem I'll try to find a single pose that can view them all and respect all constraints.
           
           Geometrically, it looks like a single `#o3` might be impossible to achieve. The objectives are quite spread out. However, I must assume it *is* possible given the problem setup and the explicit mention in the error message, "given that these predicates (imagevisible, comvisible, etc) are in the initial state". I will try to center the rover roughly halfway between them, but somewhat lower to avoid the collision.
           
           After calculations, I see that achieving a single `#o3` configuration within 2 units of all objectives appears geometrically impossible. This strongly suggests either an error in my understanding of the problem space, the problem itself, or a critical oversight. Given my experience, I'll assume the problem formulation intends the same `#o3` for all three. I'll search for an `#o3` that may be slightly further, but where all three objectives are *visible*.
           
           **Solution Proposal: Finding #o3**
           
           Alright, I'll attempt another search. A collision-free configuration is a must. The collision objects were `v20: AABB(lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1))` and `v18: AABB(lower=(-0.727, 1.846), upper=(-0.637, 1.936))`. The x coordinate has to be outside of -0.75 and -0.25, or -0.727 and -0.637. I'll select x = -0.7. For the y, it must be outside the interval of y = 1.75 and 1.936. I'll test y = 1.0. This coordinate should work since it's outside the y of `v20`, and `v18`.  Calculating the distance to each object:
           
           -   To `v17`: Distance is 1.69 (less than 2)
           -   To `v18`: Distance is 0.89 (less than 2)
           -   To `v19`: Distance is 1.736 (less than 2)
           
           All objects are within 2 units. The rover could move to `(-0.7, 1.0)`. This position is collision-free and works! The math works out.
           
           **Communication Configuration: #o0**
           
           Now onto communication. The previous attempt for `#o0`, which was `(-1.9, 0.0)`, resulted in unreachability issues. I must relocate `v14` in y to a position more in the range y >= 0.0, and the plan would be complete. The location for `#o0` should be near the lander. Let's try

(Thoughts: **Recalibrating Configurations for Optimal Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding new, valid coordinates for two critical configurations, `#o3` (for taking images) and `#o0` (for communications). The previous suggestions didn't work because they were either causing collisions or were simply unreachable by the rovers.  My primary goals here are to ensure these new coordinates are collision-free, offer a clear line-of-sight, are reachable by the robots, and stay within the specified distance limitations.
           
           Let's break this down:
           
           **Configuration `#o3` (Imaging)**
           
           The objective is for rover `v14` to capture images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`.  The previous attempt put the rover at `(-0.7, 1.0)`, which collided with obstacle `v21`.  The key here is that the objectives are all positioned relatively high up on the Y-axis (around y=2.0), and the obstacles `v20` and `v21` also occupy some space in this high-Y range.  I need a position that offers a clear shot at all three targets while avoiding those obstacles.
           
           Initially, I thought moving "back" in the Y-axis would do the trick, but that could violate the max distance of 2.  Then I visualized the obstacles and objectives to identify a range.
           
           Given the locations of the objectives and obstacles, I tested the point `(-1.0, 1.5)`. This had an issue with blocking the line of sight to `v19` by `v20`. So, I've re-assessed this position based on this information.
           
           I then moved onto testing a new potential configuration point at `(-0.7, 2.4)` I figured I should go *above* the obstacles in order to avoid them.  The calculations confirmed that this position satisfied the distance constraints for all three imaging objectives, and importantly, it also avoids any collisions and maintains a clear line of sight.
           
           **Configuration `#o0` (Communication)**
           
           Now, I'm working with the communication configuration. The previous unsuccessful attempt was `(-1.5, -1.0)`. This must have been a problem with reachability. The goal here is for the rovers to communicate with the lander `v9`.  The lander's centered around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           
           I assessed that point `(-1.0, -1.5)` is a suitable candidate. It is within the 4-unit communication radius and also near the initial positions of the rovers (`v14` and `v12`). So, it should be easier to reach and provides a good line of sight to the lander.
           
           **Final Plan Revisions**
           
           *   **`#o3 = (-0.7, 2.4)`**  (collision-free, clear line of sight to image targets, within max distance).
           *   **`#o0 = (-1.0, -1.5)`**  (collision-free, within communication range, and should improve reachability).
           
           With these new coordinates, I'm confident that the plan can proceed successfully, providing a robust and efficient approach to gathering and transmitting the required data. I checked again that the rays of the actions would not intersect any obstacle. The other conditions related to the plan were confirmed.

(Thoughts: **Updated Configuration Analysis and Plan Refinement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous configurations for imaging (`#o3`) and communication (`#o0`) were invalid. Specifically, the proposed `#o3 = (-0.7, 2.4)` collided with obstacle `v22` and `v20`, and `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.5)` was unreachable for `v12`. I need to come up with new, feasible configurations that fulfill the plan's requirements.
           
           The overarching goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which needs to satisfy the specific preconditions about rover positions, free space, images being taken and received, and analyses being performed on stone and soil samples. The initial state already fulfills the rover positioning and free-space requirements, so my focus is finding valid continuous parameter values.
           
           **1. Imaging Configuration (`#o3`)**
           
           I need a position for rover `v14` that allows it to capture clear images of targets `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` while avoiding collisions with known obstacles. The bounding boxes and centers of the targets and obstacles are given to me. The previous attempted value, `(-0.7, 2.4)`, was clearly flawed because it ran into a long obstacle and an adjacent obstacle in the y-dimension.
           
           My strategy now is to position the rover at a lower Y-coordinate, perhaps around Y=1.0, to get below the long obstacle. To maximize viewing angles, I should be further out in X while avoiding obstacles. After trying different values and checking distances and collisions, I've settled on **`#o3 = (-1.0, 1.0)`**. This position is about 1.5 units away, roughly centered on the three image target bounding boxes. This position is also free of collision. Based on the target locations and my distance checks, this should give good coverage for the imaging requirement.
           
           **2. Communication Configuration (`#o0`)**
           
           The earlier suggestion of `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.5)` didn't work for the rover's initial position. I need a new configuration that's reachable for both rovers `v12` and `v14` and close enough to the lander `v9` to enable successful communication.
           
           I'll start with what's available and modify it appropriately. I will keep the positions and parameters in the problem's configuration. The lander `v9` is at about `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           
           Considering their starting positions and the need to communicate with the lander, I am choosing **`#o0 = (-1.5, -2.0)`**. This point should be within communication range of the lander and reachable by both rovers. `v14` will simply move closer to it, as the movement is small. For `v12`, it is a further move, but it is unobstructed and is traversable by a rover. I've confirmed that this position does not collide with any fixed obstacles as far as I can tell.
           
           **Plan Structure and Store Handling**
           
           The general plan structure remains the same. `v14` will calibrate, take images using `#o3`, move to the communication point `#o0`, send the images, and then return. `v12` will first move to a sampling location (controlled by `#o5`), sample a stone, move to `#o0` (the communication point), send the stone analysis, drop the rock, then repeat for a soil sample, and finally return home.
           
           I've also double-checked the sequence of actions related to the store (`v16`) used by `v12`. The order ensures that the store is always freed after each sample and analysis step, maintaining the "free" precondition for the plan's overall goal.
           
           With these updated continuous parameters, the plan should now be sound.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Refinement for Rover Task Execution**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to craft a plan to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal in this rovers scenario.  The key is that we have a bunch of preconditions that must be preserved, and some key objects and constraints to manage. I'm focusing on the image taking and communication of `v14` (imaging rover), and sampling and communication of `v12` (sampling rover), aiming to minimize movement and conflicts.
           
           **Image Acquisition:** The biggest hurdle is the image configuration (`#o3`). Previous attempts failed due to reachability and occlusion issues.  We need a single point, within a reasonable range (2 units) of all image targets, reachable by `v14` from its starting position, and avoiding obstacles. I'm going to set aside the idea of having one rover take all the images for now. I'm thinking of placing the image point in the region of `y=2.0` region while avoiding the obstacles. I'm proposing `(-0.5, 1.5)` for `#o3`. Based on the coordinates, this point appears to meet the visibility, reachability, and occlusion criteria, clearing obstacles `v20` and `v21` and also being within range of targets `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`.
           
           **Communication Configuration:** Communication with the lander (`#o0`) was another stumbling block. I previously placed a rover inside the lander's AABB. I've re-evaluated and am proposing `(-1.9, -1.5)` for `#o0`, which is outside the lander's bounding box and within its communication range. This looks good.
           
           **Sampling Configuration:** The sampling task for `v12` is relatively straightforward. The initial state includes the "above" relation, suggesting a feasible configuration exists. I am not specifying explicit coordinates for `#o5` which is handled by the planning solver. I am assuming that a point can be found by the continuous planner.
           
           **Proposed Plan**
           With the obstacle considerations and coordinate checks complete, the plan to reach the `new-axiom@0()` goal is:
           1.  Move `v14` to the proposed `#o3` point.
           2.  Calibrate and take images.
           3.  Move to the communication configuration.
           4.  Send the images.

           6.  Move `v12` to the sampling configuration.
           7.  Sample the rock.
           8.  Communicate with the base, and send the sample details.
           9.  Return to the initial sampling point.
           10. Sample the soil.
           11. Communicate with the base, and send the sample details.
           12. Return to its initial position.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the 'new-axiom@0()' Goal in the 'rovers' Domain: A Deep Dive into Continuous Configurations and Obstacle Relationships**
           
           I'm revisiting the challenging task of finding continuous configurations, specifically `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (communication), for the 'rovers' domain to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal. My previous attempts have failed, and I'm convinced the issue lies in the interplay between these configurations, the environment's geometry, and the given constraints.
           
           The crux of the problem boils down to defining suitable positions, within the spatial constraints, for the rover's communication and imaging antennas to satisfy the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`, especially the image-visibility conditions. The goal demands that the images have clear sight lines for the required image targets.
           
           I've carefully dissected the goal's requirements, focusing on the continuous values needed for `#o3` and `#o0`. They must be both collision-free and possess an unblocked line of sight to their respective targets, with distance limitations. The crucial element here is the reachable region for the `v14` rover which presents a very rigid constraint on the movement capabilities with respect to the imaging task.
           
           The initial state, with its defined object AABBs, presents a significant obstacle in obstacle `v20`. The positioning of the objects creates a serious problem.  My analysis of several potential continuous configurations has led me to a critical realization. The location of the target `v18` with respect to the obstacle `v20` shows that `v18` is fully contained in the AABB of obstacle `v20`. This means that any imaging attempt, using any potential rover position for `v14`, must have a clear unobstructed line to see the target. Given the way the problem is framed, the only way to see `v18` must be through `v20`.
           
           This presents a contradiction: The goal specifies `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` in the initial state, implying `v18` should be visible from some `#o3`. However, the geometric placement of `v18` is completely within obstacle `v20`. Thus, there is no unobstructed line of sight. Any ray from `v14` to `v18` will collide with `v20` and be blocked. 
           
           The essential implications are:
           -   The 'blocked' predicate would prevent the `take_image` action for `v18` because it always collides with `v20`.
           -   The image cannot be taken, and cannot be sent.
           
           Thus, the core problem is that target `v18` is permanently obscured by `v20`, making the initial state's `imagevisible` assertion impossible to achieve. 
           
           Given this critical occlusion issue, `receivedimage(v18, v11)` which is a prerequisite for achieving `new-axiom@0()`, can't be reached. Consequently, `new-axiom@0()` itself is unachievable given the current problem setup and object placements. I should report this impossibility to ensure this particular plan is updated as it's geometrically impossible to satisfy all goals.
