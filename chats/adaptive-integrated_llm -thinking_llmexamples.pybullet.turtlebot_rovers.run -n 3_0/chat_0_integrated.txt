           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Limited Actions**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This involves satisfying several conditions, including receiving images and analyses of specific stone and soil samples. I've broken down the axiom into its constituent parts and analyzed the initial state.
           
           The initial state satisfies several conditions related to rover positions. However, the key challenge lies in the actions I'm allowed to execute. The provided action instances are severely limited, consisting only of "move" actions that maintain the current rover configurations and "drop_rock" actions, which cannot be triggered due to an initial state constraint.
           
           To achieve image and analysis reception, I need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis`. These require the rovers to be in specific configurations (#o0, #o3, #o5) based on the image and communication visibility predicates.  However, the "move" actions only allow me to stay at the initial rover locations (v13 and v15). There are no transitions to the required configurations, rendering the actions requiring those configurations unavailable.
           
           Since I cannot manipulate the rover configurations to enable image capture, communication, and analysis, I am unable to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. Therefore, given the strictly limited actions available, I conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable.
