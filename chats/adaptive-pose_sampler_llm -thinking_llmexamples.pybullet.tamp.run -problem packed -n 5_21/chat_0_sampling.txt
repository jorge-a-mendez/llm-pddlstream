(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 8 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing object ID 8, which is a nearly square object with dimensions approximately 0.081m x 0.081m, on surface 0, a 0.27m x 0.27m square surface. I need to generate 50 stable placements, considering I haven't received any prior collision information.
           
           The core idea is to use a grid of positions and then vary the object's orientation. Since the object is almost square, I'll strategically choose rotation angles. I'll consider 0 and pi/2 radians (90 degrees) initially. These represent two distinct orientations. Using 0 and pi/2 is good for an almost square object as it covers reasonable variation without too many angles.
           
           To determine valid positions, I'll calculate the *effective* width and height of the object, which change depending on the rotation. Let's call the object's half-dimensions `half_sx` and `half_sy`. At an angle `theta`, I can calculate:
           
           *   `effective_half_width(theta) = half_sx * abs(cos(theta)) + half_sy * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `effective_half_height(theta) = half_sx * abs(sin(theta)) + half_sy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           The surface has bounds `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. The placement center (x, y) must satisfy these constraints relative to the object's rotation:
           
           *   `surf_min_x + effective_half_width(theta) <= x <= surf_max_x - effective_half_width(theta)`
           *   `surf_min_y + effective_half_height(theta) <= y <= surf_max_y - effective_half_height(theta)`
           
           Now for the specifics. I'll use a 5x5 grid of `x` and `y` coordinates for `theta = 0` and again for `theta = pi/2`. This covers the surface well. The grid steps will be calculated precisely based on these formulas with the surface bounds and the effective half-dimensions at each angle. 25 coordinates * 2 angles = 50.
           
           I've already calculated the specific x, y ranges and steps. For `theta = 0` (or multiples of pi), the calculation gives the object center constrained to `[-0.09437, 0.09437]` for both x and y. Similarly, at 90 degrees I will get nearly the same range, since the object is almost a square. The bounds *will* vary slightly. It is best to calculate the bounds for theta to generate valid coordinates. This is a sound strategy!
           
           Here are the 50 placement results. These are valid and diverse, and ready for stability testing!

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 4 (Square)**
           
           Alright, so the task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a surface, avoiding collision with a pre-placed square object (ID 8). Object 8's placement is already confirmed successful: `(0, 0.0, -0.09437014389802609, -0.0943701438980261)`.  The surface is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I'll assume `theta` is 0 for object 4 for simplicity.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 4 has sides of `0.07639258884353772` length, so its half-side is `0.03819629442176886`. Object 8 has sides of `0.08125971220394781`. I calculate the AABB for object 8, which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.053740287796052184, -0.053740287796052205))`.
           
           The key is to define where *not* to place object 4.  I expand the AABB of object 8 by half-width of object 4. This means I create a forbidden region around the pre-placed object.  Object 4's center must not be within this region, which goes from `(-0.173, -0.173)` to `(-0.0155, -0.0155)`.
           
           I then calculate the valid placement area on the square table `surf`, which has valid x/y center positions in  `[-0.09680370557823114, 0.09680370557823114]`. I divide the total space into 3 areas:
           *   **Area 1:** Bottom Left region `[-0.0968, -0.0155) x [-0.0155, 0.0968] `(object 8 is placed there, so I want to avoid the corner. In this calculation, the end range of x and y is defined with -1e-9)
           *   **Area 2:** Bottom-Right region `[-0.0155, 0.0968] x [-0.0968, -0.0155)`
           *   **Area 3:** Top-Right region `[-0.0155, 0.0968] x [-0.0155, 0.0968]`
           
           To fill 50 positions, I will populate the areas with 15 + 15 + 20 positions respectively.
           
           To generate the x/y positions in the areas, I partition their respective areas with a even spacing.
           I will use the coordinates for all 50 objects for the final placement plan.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, making sure to dodge collisions with objects ID 8 and 4.
           
           First, I looked at the surface, which is a square with coordinates from -0.135 to 0.135 in both the x and y directions.
           
           Next, I noted that object 5 is almost perfectly square. This lets me use two orientations: theta = 0 (aligned with the axes) and theta = pi/2 (rotated 90 degrees).  I’ll need to figure out the safe area for the center of object 5, accounting for its size (approximately 0.0926 by 0.0926). Since its dimensions are so similar, the safe area calculations will be largely the same for both orientations.  The key is to consider the half-extents of the object: they're about 0.0463.
           
           I then went over the data on the existing objects.
           
           *   Object 8 is centered at (-0.094, -0.094) and has dimensions of about 0.081 by 0.081. Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is from -0.135 to -0.053 in x and y.
           *   Object 4 is centered at (-0.096, -0.015) and has dimensions of about 0.076 by 0.076. Its AABB is from -0.135 to -0.058 in x and -0.053 to 0.022 in y.
           
           To avoid collisions, I’ll need to make sure the center of object 5 stays away from the regions occupied by objects 8 and 4.  That means I need to “inflate” the AABBs of objects 8 and 4 to include the half-extents of object 5. For example, the smallest X placement for object 5 will be surface_min_x + half extent of object 5. I will then subtract the extended regions from the surface area to place objects.
           
           I’ve calculated how to limit these new region placements based on existing obstacles and the surface. I also figured the minimum and maximum coordinates.
           
           To place object 5, I will make 25 placements at theta = 0 and 25 at theta = pi/2.
           
           For the placements at each theta, I have to ensure the objects won't be touching the surface limits (based on their half-extents). This creates two regions: the surface range and the valid surface range after expanding the bounding box of existing obstacles.
           
           To find valid center-placement coordinates, I computed the region of the available valid placements and divided them into sections to ensure even coverage.
           Region 1 for `theta=0`: Five points along y=0.078
           Region 2 for `theta=0`: A 5x4 grid.
           Region 1 for `theta=pi/2`: Five points along y=0.078
           Region 2 for `theta=pi/2`: A 5x4 grid.
           This ensures a wide distribution across the open areas and a decent chance for collision avoidance. I will then use that information to test placement.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new, almost-square object (ID: 7) on Surface 0, a 0.27m by 0.27m square centered at the origin, while avoiding collisions with three existing objects (IDs: 8, 4, and 5).
           
           First, I need to consider object 7's geometry. It’s nearly square, meaning its effective half-width and height are roughly the same regardless of rotation.  I'll approximate these values as 0.046m. I need to calculate where object 7 can be placed on the surface to avoid any overlap with other objects.
           
           Next, I look at the AABBs for the existing objects. AABB stands for Axis Aligned Bounding Box, and it's simply a box which covers all points of a given object. The positions and dimensions of these objects are important. 
           
           Now, I understand collision avoidance. For my strategy, two objects collide when their AABBs overlap. I can determine if a proposed placement is valid. Let's start with no rotation, I calculate the boundaries for object 7's center:
           *   x_valid_min = -0.0888
           *   x_valid_max = 0.0888
           *   y_valid_min = -0.0888
           *   y_valid_max = 0.0888
           
           Then, I will calculate the forbidden regions for the center. If object 7's center falls inside any of the forbidden regions, that placement will be a collision. I must take into account all the previous objects' positions and extents and use them to determine valid and forbidden regions in order to find where to place object 7. I use the known equations and constraints to create accurate AABBs.
           
           To generate the placement candidates, I will generate placements from 8 discrete angles, for an exhaustive search of stable placements. The code will generate a grid of candidate points (7x7) for each of the 8 angles. I check for valid placements, while taking into account rotations. I create a grid of (x,y) positions for the center of object 7, for each angle. The code will run the collision check against the placed objects (AABBs), and if the placement is valid (i.e. no collision), I record it. The search stops when it finds 50 stable placements. I will output the 50 positions.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for this new, almost square object (ID 6) on Surface 0. The catch? I need to avoid colliding with the four existing objects (IDs 8, 4, 5, and 7) already in place. Surface 0's dimensions are pretty tight: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First things first, I've crunched the numbers: object 6's dimensions are roughly `0.09598 x 0.09598`, giving it a half-size of about `0.048` in both dimensions. I'll need these later to properly calculate collisions.
           
           Next, I've got to understand where the existing objects are and how much space they occupy. I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each of the four obstacles. This involves using their known positions and dimensions (assuming they're at a rotation of 0) to define their "collision footprint." For example, Object 8's AABB is approximately `((-0.135, -0.135), (-0.054, -0.054))`.
           
           **Key Observation:** All the existing objects are concentrated on the left side of the surface, with a little overlap into the bottom-left corner. This means the right side and top-right corner *should* be relatively clear. I'll try to exploit this.
           
           Now, to find good placement spots. I need to figure out where I *can't* place the new object. For this, I'm going to expand each of the existing objects' AABBs by the half-size of my new object. The areas created will represent the "forbidden zones" for the center of my new object.
           
           Next, I generated a series of x and y coordinates within the surface, at `theta = 0.0` and `theta = pi/2`. With this grid in place, I will check each location for potential collision. 
           
           If all goes well, this systematic approach will allow me to pinpoint a variety of stable locations, all while sidestepping the existing obstacles. If I don't find 50, I will have the flexibility to make the grid larger.
