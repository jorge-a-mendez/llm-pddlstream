           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy:**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the condition `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing images and analyses. The initial state analysis reveals that I'm essentially "ready to go," as I already satisfy several core conditions. The key is to acquire images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`, then get the stone (`v1`) and soil (`v5`) analyzed and send the reports. I need to plan actions with rover `v12` to handle image acquisition and rover `v14` for soil and rock analysis, using existing resources. I'll need to use the available "take_image," "send_image," "sample_rock," and "send_analysis" actions.
           
           **Image Acquisition with v12:**
           
           To get the image of the targets, I plan to use rover `v12` to do the image acquisition.
           *   First, I need to calibrate the camera on `v12` (represented as `v10`) by calling `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)`. The `imagevisible` predicate requires me to associate `#o3` with `v13` (where the rover *is*). So I assume that `#o3`,  `v13` and the communication configuration `#o0` are equivalent, given there are no move actions. After a successful calibration, I can proceed with the next steps.
           *   Next, I take images using the 'take_image' action. I'll use `v13` (rover's current position), `#o4` (ray to the image), `v17` (target), `v10` (the camera), and `v11` (mode). I assume `#o3` is equivalent to `v13` here as well (for the image).
           *   Then, I plan to send the image using 'send_image' to `v9` (the lander). This requires the rover to use a communication ray `#o1`. I have already assumed that communication ray `#o1`'s position `#o0` can be used.
           
           I'll repeat the same for the second image, `v18`.
           
           **Soil and Rock Analysis with v14:**
           
           Rover `v14` will be used for analyzing.
           *   First, `sample_rock(v14, v15, v1, v16)` to take a sample from the rock `v1`. I assume `#o5` is equivalent to the rover's location `v15` for the sample to be analyzed and stored in store `v16`.
           *   After the analysis, I send the data. I assume the communication pose is `#o0` and it is equal to `v15` and ray to `v9` for communication is `#o1`.
           *   I can also apply this to a soil sample with `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` for the soil sample.
           *   Finally, `drop_rock(v14, v16)` to free the store.
           
           **Final Plan:**
           
           1.  `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           4.  `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5.  `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6.  `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           7.  `sample_rock(v14, v15, v1, v16)`
           8.  `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v1)`
           9.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           10. `sample_rock(v14, v15, v5, v16)`
           11. `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v5)`
           12. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           I'm confident this plan accomplishes `new-axiom@0

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v1 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 v15 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan Evaluation: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, the user's critique is valid. The previous plan's actions are out. Now, I need to work exclusively with:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.
           
           Let's see. The initial state is: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`. Also, there are rocks of type `v2` and `v6`.
           
           The goal is to get `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The problem is immediately apparent. The only move actions are no-ops. They don't change the rovers' locations or the free/full status of their storage.  And the `drop_rock` actions require the storage to be `full`, which it isn't.
           
           Therefore, with *only* these actions, I can't do anything to achieve the goal.  I can't take images, analyze rocks, or even fill the rovers' storage units.  I need actions like `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis`...which are conveniently *not* available.  This is a constraint violation, plain and simple.
           
           The goal is demonstrably unreachable given the action set. It's a dead end. We need a different set of actions or a different approach to solve this. I must inform the user that this plan cannot succeed and needs revision.
