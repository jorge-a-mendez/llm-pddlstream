           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Placement Strategy**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface. The object is a nearly square shape with dimensions of approximately 0.0905 x 0.0905. The surface is defined by its dimensions: -0.135 to 0.135 in both the x and y directions.
           
           A "stable" placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is fully contained within the surface's AABB.  The placement is defined by a surface index (0 in this case), rotation angle (theta), and center coordinates (x, y).
           
           **Interpreting the Problem Statement**
           
           The key ambiguity lies in interpreting "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". The most straightforward and typical interpretation in this context is that these x and y dimensions *always* represent the dimensions of the object's AABB, regardless of its rotation. If rotation *did* affect the AABB's dimensions, it would usually be stated as "unrotated AABB" or "local AABB".
           
           For collision checking, this simpler assumption makes sense. With this interpretation, `theta` simply changes the object's appearance visually, but the collision box remains unchanged.
           
           If, for some reason, the geometry *does* rotate, I will re-interpret the prompt and account for rotated AABBs with formula such as `eff_w = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|` and `eff_h = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|`.
           
           **Placement Calculation**
           
           Under the main assumption, I calculated the bounds of the object's center coordinates (x, y) to ensure stability:
           -0.089757 <= x <= 0.089757
           -0.089757 <= y <= 0.089757
           
           Given the object is close to a square, the stable region in the surface is also close to a square. I'm choosing a grid to create 49 evenly spaced points. Since I need 50 points, I added the 50th at the center with `theta = pi / 4`. This is a diverse set of placements.
           
           **Generating the Placements**
           
           I will provide the placements in the desired format:
           ```
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.08975709028585586, -0.08975709028585587)

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object ID 5 onto surface 0 without it colliding with the existing object, ID 4.  Here's how I'm approaching this:
           
           1.  **Understanding the Constraints:** Object 5 has dimensions of `size_x = 0.09895642493092344` and `size_y = 0.09895642493092338`. Surface 0 has bounds of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 4's location is known: `(0, 0.0, -0.08975709028585586, -0.08975709028585587)`.  Importantly, I need to ensure stable placement and *no collisions*.
           
           2.  **Determining the Valid Placement Region:** First, I've calculated the boundaries within which object 5's *center* can be located on surface 0: x must be within `[-0.0855, 0.0855]` and y within `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`.
           
           3.  **Accounting for Object 4:**  I know that object 4 is positioned at roughly `(-0.089, -0.089)` with dimensions that cause it to take up the space `[-0.135, -0.044514] x [-0.135, -0.044514]`. I need to avoid this region.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance Strategy:**  To ensure no collision, I've calculated a "forbidden zone" for object 5's center.  Since the object's dimensions aren't rotating, I reasoned that collision would be avoided if object 5's center's x coordinate `x_c5` is greater than or equal to 0.004964, OR if object 5's center's y coordinate `y_c5` is greater than or equal to 0.004964, thus staying clear of the region occupied by object 4. In other words, I'm aiming to place object 5 in the top-right, top-left (skipping the y of obj 4), or bottom-right, or even in the center.
           
           5.  **Placement Grid:** To generate a diverse set of safe placements, I've set up a grid covering the valid region for the object 5. The grid uses a `10x10` step pattern to efficiently cover the valid space. I have also pre-calculated that a simple grid with `x >= x_collision_threshold` OR `y >= y_collision_threshold` condition gives us more than enough safe placements. I picked 50.
           
           6.  **Theta Assumption:** I'm assuming that the problem's phrasing and object representation imply a fixed AABB size. If so, `theta` has no effect on AABB-AABB collision for this problem, so I am setting it to `0`. If further details specify an object's actual dimensions, then I'll use those to refine my grid.
           
           7.  **Final Checks:** I've re-verified the collision condition and confirmed the bounds of the objects and calculated that a 10x10 grid is enough to give the right `50` placements which are free of collision and valid. I will now generate the placements.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan:** I need to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with the existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I'm given the dimensions of the surface, as well as the position and dimensions of the existing objects.
           
           **Here's the setup:** Surface 0 is a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at (0,0). Object 4 is in the bottom-left corner with dimensions 0.0905 x 0.0905 meters, and Object 5 is to its right, at the left edge of the square, with dimensions 0.0990 x 0.0990 meters. The object I need to place is also a square, with dimensions 0.0987 x 0.0987 meters.
           
           **The Constraints:**
           
           1.  **Placement within Surface 0:**  I can calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates for the *center* of the new object, ensuring it stays within the square.
           2.  **No Collisions with Object 4:**  I need to check if the new object's AABB overlaps with Object 4's AABB. I can calculate the conditions for non-collision based on the AABBs.
           3.  **No Collisions with Object 5:**  Same as above, but with Object 5.
           
           **The Approach:**
           
           I'll use a grid-based approach. I will divide the valid region (within the surface and not colliding) into a grid and examine each cell to see if I can place the object there. For simplicity, I will try to place the object with a `theta = 0`.  I'll use the *center* of the object's AABB as the grid point and then check for collisions. The code uses the formula to check the bounds of the objects. It uses helper functions to calculate the AABB intersections.
           
           I will create a 20x20 grid to cover the possible locations.  The main loop will iterate through this grid and check the collision. The loop will stop as soon as it finds 50 valid placements. The code is structured to avoid common edge conditions and will stop as soon as it finds 50 placements.
