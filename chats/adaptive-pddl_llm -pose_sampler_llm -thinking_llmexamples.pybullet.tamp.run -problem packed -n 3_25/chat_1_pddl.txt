           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. Simple enough conceptually: pick them up from v11 and put them on v16. The initial state tells me precisely where these objects are – each supported by v11 at a specific pose.  The key here is that they need to be at `#o2` on v16.
           
           Looking at the actions, I've got move_base (but it's just a no-op!), pick, place, clean, and cook. Since the goal involves repositioning objects, I'm focusing on pick and place. I've got two robot arms, both currently handempty, and my base configuration is at v3.
           
           The facts about *kin* are really interesting. It tells me that the robot arm (specifically v4) *can* pick and place these objects, both from their initial pose on v11 and to their final target pose `#o2` on v16. Great! Except... every single kin fact explicitly *requires* the base configuration to be `#o3`.  There's a base configuration `#o3` related fact. However, the initial configuration given is `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           Here's the problem: The *only* move_base action I can use is the identity action (moving from v3 to v3).  I *cannot* change the base configuration to `#o3`, or to anything else for that matter.  This means I can't meet the precondition `atbconf(?q)` for any pick or place action because I'm stuck at `v3` and the robot is required to be at `#o3` to perform any action on the specified objects.
           
           In other words, no matter what I do, I can't pick up or place any object. This is a dead end. Since there's no way to reach the required base configuration, the goal is *unachievable* within the constraints given. I've got to conclude that this plan is infeasible.
