(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` (represented by `v12` in this specific scenario) *on* `v18`, and ensuring `v12` is of a specific type `v17`.  Since `type(v12, v17)` is true initially, we really just need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           From the available axioms and initial state, achieving `on(v12, v18)` requires that `v12` is *supported* by `v18` at some pose and is *at* that pose.  The initial state tells us `v12` can be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2` (`supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true).  Therefore, we need to get `v12` to `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.  So, the plan hinges on moving `v12` from `v13` to `#o2`. This requires the familiar `pick` and `place` actions, combined with a `move_base` action if necessary.
           
           Let's break it down:
           
           1.  **`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`**:  The robot's base is currently at `v3`. We need the base to be at `#o3` (which is needed for the `pick` action), so we first move it from `v3` to `#o3`. The preconditions for this action are met initially (`basemotion`, `atbconf`, `canmove`). The effect of this action is the robot's base will now be located at the desired pose, allowing us to perform the pick.
           
           2.  **`pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`**:  Now that the base is correctly positioned, we can pick up object `v12` from its current pose `v13`. The `kin`, `atpose`, and `handempty` preconditions are all met. Crucially, the base's location `#o3` is now correctly set after `move_base`. The parameters `#o1` and `#o4` correspond to poses for approach and trajectory. The effect of this action is that `v12` will now be held by the robot and the current pose `v13` will no longer be valid for `v12`.
           
           3.  **`place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`**:  With `v12` in hand, the next step is to place it onto `v18` at pose `#o2`. The preconditions like `kin`, `atgrasp`, and `atbconf` are now satisfied, and we can safely place `v12` onto pose `#o2`. After this step, the robot hand will be empty, and now `v12` is at pose `#o2`.
           
           After executing this sequence of actions, `v12` will be `atpose(#o2)`, and also supported by `v18`. Therefore `on(v12, v18)` would be satisfied, and also `type(v12, v17)`, and the final goal will be completed.  This achieves `new-axiom@0()`.
