(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, here's my plan for finding those stable placements. My expert intuition tells me this is the most efficient and robust way to proceed:
           
           **Understanding the Problem:**
           
           I'm dealing with object ID 5, a nearly-square object, on surface 0, which is a square surface. The goal is 50 stable placements, which means the object needs to be completely within the surface bounds after any rotation. I know from my deep understanding that the key is calculating the object's effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) after rotation.
           
           **Key Calculations:**
           
           *   **Surface Definition:** The surface is simple; a box from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           *   **Object Dimensions:** Object ID 5 has very similar dimensions, basically a square with a side length of around `0.09038`. Let's approximate it as `obj_s = 0.09038` to streamline things.
           *   **Effective AABB and Rotation:** The effective AABB depends on rotation (`theta`). The dimensions are:
               *   `rotated_sx = obj_sx * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_sy * abs(sin(theta))`
               *   `rotated_sy = obj_sx * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_sy * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Rotation Sampling:** Since the object is almost square, I'm going to only need a small set of rotation angles to cover different valid poses. I'll pick:
               *   `theta = 0`:  This is no rotation and the minimal bounding box.
               *   `theta = pi/4`: (45 degrees) Because the object is almost square this is its "widest" bounding box.
           
           2.  **Valid Center Range:** For each rotation, I'll determine the valid range for the center coordinates `(x, y)` of the object within the surface using the rotated dimensions calculated above.
           3.  **Grid Generation:** For each selected rotation angle, I'll create a grid of placement points for the `x` and `y` coordinates. With 5 points for both x and y at both rotation, that will provide the total of 50 stable placement.
               *   Since I need 25 placements at theta = 0, and 25 placements at pi/4. I'll define an even spread over valid ranges, with coordinates like `-0.045`, `0`, and `0.045` for theta = 0, and `-0.035`, `0` and `0.035` for theta = pi/4.
           
           **The Grid Coordinates:**
           
           *   For `theta = 0`, I'll use the AABB dimensions of the object as a rectangle:
               *   `x_coords_0` =  `[-0.089, -0.044, 0, 0.044, 0.089]`
               *   `y_coords_0` = `[-0.089, -0.044, 0, 0.044, 0.089]`
           *   For `theta = pi/4`, I'll use `x_coords_pi4` & `y_coords_pi4` that are the same as each other, and are defined as:
               *  `x_coords_pi4` & `y_coords_pi4`  `[-0.071, -0.035, 0, 0.035, 0.071]`
           
           **Result:**
           
           This process will provide the 50 distinct stable placements, which I will then list using the `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` format. This approach is efficient and directly addresses the problem's constraints.

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Placement for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put a new object (ID 7) on the surface, making sure it doesn't bump into object 5. Object 5 is chilling at (0, 0.0, -0.0898, -0.0898). I've got the dimensions of object 7 and the surface bounds.
           
           My main strategy is to pick a few rotation angles, then try a grid of placements and filter out any that collide with object 5.
           
           First things first, I calculate the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for object 5. Since object 5 isn't rotated, its AABB is pretty straightforward. It occupies a region in the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           Then I get the info for object 7. I'll start with no rotation, and the object's square dimensions.  I need to figure out where I can place object 7 on the surface, *without* colliding.
           
           I need 50 non-colliding placements.
           I'm going to set `theta = 0` (no rotation) and `theta = pi/4` to try.
           
           For `theta=0`:
           I calculate the possible center points, respecting the surface boundaries. Then, I check for overlaps between the potential object 7 and object 5, based on their AABBs. I'll need to generate a grid of candidate points, and then check each.
           I generate a 7x7 grid of center points, which means I'll use 49 points.
           
           The collision check requires me to determine if the minimum/maximum x and y values for object 7 overlap in any way the values for the pre-placed object 5. I created a robust, AABB-based method for filtering collisions.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           I repeat the same process, but the bounding box is rotated, so I account for that, then calculate the positions and do collision filtering with object 5. Again, use a 7x7 grid.
           
           Once the collision checking is done for both rotation angles, I combine the non-colliding points, and take the first 50. I will generate a list of safe placement coordinates. I verified my calculations.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 4 on Surface 0: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           My primary objective is to strategically place 50 instances of Object ID 4, which is almost square, onto Surface 0, ensuring they remain stable and do not collide with two existing obstacles: Object ID 5 and Object ID 7. My approach will involve a methodical grid-based placement strategy, with calculations designed to guarantee successful and collision-free configurations.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** Defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Object ID 4:** With dimensions of approximately `(0.09095, 0.09095)`, it's nearly a square.
           *   **Object ID 5:** A rectangle fixed at `x = -0.0898`, `y = -0.0898` spanning the x-range `[-0.135, -0.0446]` and the y-range `[-0.135, -0.0446]`.
           *   **Object ID 7:** Another rectangle fixed at `x = -0.0863`, `y = 0.0287`, extending from `-0.135` to `-0.0377` in the x-dimension and from `-0.0198` to `0.0774` in the y-dimension.
           
           The key challenge is to place our new object without overlapping the space occupied by Objects 5 and 7.
           
           **My Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Exploiting Rotation:** To improve coverage and stability, I will consider two rotation angles: `theta = 0` (no rotation) and `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees). This handles the AABB changes to better pack the objects.
           
           2.  **Calculating the Effective Object AABB:**
               *   **For `theta = 0`:** The dimensions of the object remain `0.09095 x 0.09095`, effectively creating an object that occupies an AABB from `[-0.04547, -0.04547] to [0.04547, 0.04547]` relative to its center.
               *   **For `theta = pi/4`:** The dimensions become approximately `0.1286 x 0.1286` to handle rotations. This provides a more efficient approach with the diagonal.
           
           3.  **Generating Valid Placement Centers:**
           
               *   **Surface Bounds:** I will ensure all placements stay within the confines of Surface 0: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
               *   **Collision Avoidance:** To prevent collisions, I'll restrict my search space based on the existing obstacles. Objects are fixed, and I need to calculate which positions would be colliding.
                   *   To avoid overlap with Object 5 and Object 7, I need to make sure the x-coordinate of the center of my object to be placed will be in the right side of the occupied region. I found the `x_centers` that overlap with the `max_x = -0.0377` coordinate by using `half_sx`.
           
               **For `theta = 0`:** The allowed `x_range` for the center will be from `0.007757` to `0.089524`, and for `y` it will be from `-0.089524` to `0.089524`.
               **For `theta = pi/4`:** The allowed `x_range` for the center will be from `0.02658` to `0.0706`, and for `y` it will be from `-0.0706` to `0.0706`.
           
               Using the surface coordinates and the half of the dimension of the object, I'll construct a 5x5 grid of center placements for each `theta`.
           
           4.  **Collision Checks:** For each candidate position (surface index, `theta`, x, y), I'll calculate its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) to represent its extent, and I'll perform a standard AABB overlap test to ensure that the new AABB does not overlap with any of the existing obstacle AABBs (Object 5 and Object 7).

               **For `theta = pi/4`:** The allowed `x_range` for the center will be from `0.02658` to `0.0706`, and for `y` it will be from `-0.0706` to `0.0706`.
           
               Using the surface coordinates and the half of the dimension of the object, I'll construct a 5x5 grid of center placements for each `theta`.
           
           4.  **Collision Checks:** For each candidate position (surface index, `theta`, x, y), I'll calculate its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) to represent its extent, and I'll perform a standard AABB overlap test to ensure that the new AABB does not overlap with any of the existing obstacle AABBs (Object 5 and Object 7).

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I'm tasked with placing object ID 6 (a square of size 0.09828 units) on Surface 0, which is a square bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  The challenge is to find 50 *stable* positions, meaning the object's AABB (after any rotation) must fit within the surface's boundaries.  Crucially, these placements have to avoid collisions with the objects already on the surface: ID 5, ID 7, and ID 4.
           
           I've got the dimensions and exact AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) coordinates for each of those existing objects. Essentially, I need to carve out enough *free* space on Surface 0 for object 6 to fit.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Placement Generation:** I'm using a systematic search strategy. I'll consider two primary rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  This is a good starting point to cover different orientations. For each rotation, I'll calculate the *effective* width and height of object 6 (because it's square, the calculations are relatively straightforward). This informs the maximum "playable" (or, I should say, the possible center) region.
           2.  **Grid Search:** I'll set up a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for the center of object 6 *within* the surface boundaries.  I'm using a denser grid.  These grid points are where I'll attempt placements, checking them one by one. I want a minimum of 50 valid, collision-free placements.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I calculate object 6's AABB for each candidate placement using its center coordinate and size. I check against the fixed obstacle AABBs using an efficient overlap calculation. If a candidate AABB overlaps with *any* existing object's AABB, it's discarded. I'm using a good, efficient AABB overlap function.
           4.  **Angle Increment:** If after searching a base grid density, I don't have 50 placements, I will try additional rotations at different grid densities to find them.
           
           The code now runs a denser grid across the surface. This strategy systematically seeks valid positions, discarding any that result in collisions. Given the layout of the obstacles, I can expect to find a sufficient number of valid placement candidates. The python code ensures that I'll return *at least* 50 valid placements. The final output is ready to go!
