(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 6, which is essentially a square (0.0864 x 0.0864 meters), on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27 meters). My primary concern is ensuring the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains *within* the surface's boundaries for all rotations.  This is a classic optimization problem with geometric constraints.
           
           Given the almost square dimensions of the object, I've decided to treat it as a perfect square for simplification without significant loss of accuracy.  This simplifies the calculations significantly, allowing me to focus on the key variables: position (x, y) and rotation (theta).
           
           I know the maximum diagonal of the object when rotated 45 degrees (pi/4) is the determining factor for finding safe placements. Calculated, the maximum diagonal of a square-like object of dimension  0.0864 m will be  0.12217637 m, which is considerably less than half the surface width (0.27 m / 2 = 0.135 m). This means I'm good to go! Even at a 45-degree angle, the object will fit.
           
           My plan is to use a combination of strategic rotations and grid-based placements. Here's the breakdown:
           
           1.  **Theta = 0 (and Pi):**  I'll start with the object aligned with the axes (no rotation) and place a 5x5 grid of objects, ensuring the boundaries are correct and within surface bounds
           2.  **Theta = Pi/4 (and 3Pi/4):** Rotating by 45 degrees, which has the greatest effective dimension, I'll place a 3x3 grid ensuring the boundaries are correct and within surface bounds
           3.  **Theta = Pi/2 (and 3Pi/2):**  Rotating by 90 degrees, I will place a 3x3 grid to fill surface bounds
           4.  **Theta = Pi/8 (and 3Pi/8):** Then I realized I am short on placements, so I will add 4 placements to theta pi/8
           
           This should give me a good spread of placements across different orientations.  To verify, I carefully calculated the effective dimensions for each rotation and the corresponding permissible center ranges within the surface. The chosen grid points for each rotation *must* fall within these safe center ranges.
           
           All the math checks out. I've considered how different angles affect the object's footprint and how much free space is left on the surface and made sure that there were enough positions to meet the 50 placement requirement. Now, I will double check my output and ensure the correct format for the result.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis and Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, making sure it avoids collision with the already placed object ID 6. Object 6 is positioned at (-0.08, -0.08) with no rotation, and I need to keep that in mind.
           
           First, I need to understand the dimensions of object 5. Its provided coordinates (obj_x, obj_y) define its size, and I'll need to account for how its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) changes based on rotation. I've already calculated the effective width and height (W_eff, H_eff) for both 0 and pi/4 rotations. This gives me my ranges for the object centers on the grid.
           
           Now, considering object 6's position, I've calculated its AABB coordinates. Based on this, I need to prevent overlap between the AABB of object 5 and object 6. So, I will be generating a grid of potential placements (center point x, center point y) across surface 0 and checking for non-collision by verifying the separation of the object's BBox's on all sides.
           
           I've determined that with a theta=0 placement, avoiding collision, object 5's center must be to the right of 0.01266, or above 0.01266. I will then pick points from a grid and do a non-collision check, and append them. I need to get at least 50 valid, collision-free placements. For this, I am using a simple x-y grid, but it needs to ensure all angles are added into the mix to be more robust. The condition `(x5_max < x6_min) or (x5_min > x6_max) or (y5_max < y6_min) or (y5_min > y6_max)` will tell me if there is collision or not. I've made sure to cover the 50 total placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 4**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 4) on Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with existing objects: Object ID 6 and Object ID 5. Surface 0 is a rectangular area defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the extents and positions of the existing objects. Object 6 has an AABB of roughly `[-0.123, -0.036] x [-0.123, -0.036]`, and Object 5 has an AABB of approximately `[-0.029, 0.069] x [-0.129, -0.030]`. Object 4's extents are nearly square, with dimensions close to `0.0914`.
           
           To find valid placements, I need to consider various rotations (theta). I've calculated the effective dimensions of Object 4 for `theta = 0` (no rotation) and `theta = pi/4` (45-degree rotation). My strategy is to generate a grid of potential center points (`x_c`, `y_c`) within Surface 0 and check for collisions with the existing objects for each rotation.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective half-width and half-height of Object 4 are approximately `0.0457`.  I determined that a safe zone for `y_c` values is where `y_c > 0.0157`. This will prevent overlap with existing objects in the Y direction.  I'll generate a grid of x and y points within this safe zone. For the x axis it's `[-0.08, 0.08]` in steps of `0.02` and y between `0.02` and `0.08`, using a `0.02` step as well.  The total is `36` unique positions.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, the effective half-width and half-height are approximately `0.06465`. To calculate for the other 14 positions I will use coordinates `x_c in [-0.06, 0.06]` in steps of `0.02` and `y_c in [0.04, 0.06]`, and steps of `0.02`.
           
           If I have to search for more positions, I will look at different angles.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out where to place this new object (ID 7) on surface 0 while avoiding all the existing obstacles and staying within the boundaries. The surface is a simple rectangle: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've calculated the AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes) for the three existing objects (IDs 6, 5, and 4) which will help with collision detection:
           
           *   **Object ID 6:**  AABB `[-0.12318, -0.03682] x [-0.12318, -0.03682]`
           *   **Object ID 5:** AABB `[-0.02948, 0.06948] x [-0.12948, -0.03052]`
           *   **Object ID 4:** AABB `[-0.12571, -0.03429] x [-0.02571, 0.06571]`
           
           These objects appear to form an "L" shape in the bottom-left corner.  Combining the footprints of all objects to estimate occupied space, it looks like approximately the region `[-0.125, 0.069] x [-0.129, 0.065]` is occupied.
           
           Since I have a square object (ID 7) with a size of approximately `0.097`, I need to calculate where I can place it stably. First, let's consider the boundaries: I need to ensure that the new object, no matter its orientation, fits within the rectangle.
           
           I will start by trying to place the new object with a `theta = 0` and check for collisions. I want to prioritize the areas *not* occupied by objects. Given the rough shape, that appears to be the top-right corner, or along the right and top edges. I'll test some placement coordinates and iterate from those that seem likely to not have collisions.
           
           I've made a collision check function to make things easier, and I'll use a grid to explore possible placements.
           
           The plan is to try different angles and coordinates until I've found 50 valid, stable placements for the object.
