               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Immovable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to position objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto region `v18`. I've analyzed the initial state, which reveals that all four objects are currently situated on region `v11` at their respective poses, and they're all supported by `v10` and `v18` with a pose `#o2`. The crux of the challenge lies in leveraging the available actions (`move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, `cook`) to transition these objects. However, the plan's feasibility hinges upon satisfying the preconditions of crucial actions.
           
           My assessment indicates a significant hurdle. Each object has to be moved by a `pick` and `place` action using arm `v4` with a current base configuration of `v3`. The crucial problem is that I am bound to `v3` due to the lack of available `move_base` actions that let the robot change its base configuration to `#o3`. All kinematics facts for picking and placing rely on the robot being at base configuration `#o3` (as described in the `kin` facts). Since my state is restricted to `v3`, all `pick` and `place` actions will be blocked, making it impossible to satisfy the goal. I've re-examined the available actions, but the only `move_base` action instance available (`move_base v3 v3 #o0`) represents a no-op, preventing me from changing the robot's base configuration. The goal therefore is not reachable.
