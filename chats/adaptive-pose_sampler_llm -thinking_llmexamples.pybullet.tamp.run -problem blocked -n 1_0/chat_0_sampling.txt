           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan for generating 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface surf_0, ensuring I cover a good range of orientations and positions:**
           
           My key constraint is stability: the object's base needs to rest on the surface. Since the surface is an AABB, this means its bottom edge must align with the surface's top edge (y=0.0 in this case). The object is a square of size 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           To ensure stability and containment, the object is placed on the top of the surface, at y = surface_top_y + effective_half_height.
           *   **Bounding Box and Effective Dimensions:**
               I'll consider the object's center coordinates (x, y) and its rotation, `theta`. The effective dimensions depend on the rotation. An object rotated by `theta` has an effective width of `size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y * abs(sin(theta))` and an effective height of `size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + size_y * abs(cos(theta))`. Given that it's a square, these effective width and height values are the same. Let's call this half-dimension `half_dim_eff`.
           
           *   **Stable Placement Strategy:**
               The y-coordinate of the object's center must be `y = surface_top_y + half_dim_eff`. For surf_0, y becomes `half_dim_eff`. The x-coordinate, x, is determined by the surface extents. The object's center should be within `surface_lower_x + half_dim_eff <= x <= surface_upper_x - half_dim_eff`.
           *   **Specifics for the given object and surface:**
               Here, the object size is 0.07, and surf_0 extends from x=4.2 to x=4.8. 
               So, 4.2 + half_dim_eff <= x <= 4.8 - half_dim_eff. 
               The maximum half_dim_eff will be at theta = pi/4 with a value of half_dim_eff=0.035 * sqrt(2). The max width of the object with any orientation,  2*half_dim_eff is less than surface_width (0.6), so there is room.
           
           *   **Generating 50 placements**
               I will generate a set of evenly spaced theta values: `[0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2]`. I will calculate half_dim_eff at each of the thetas. I will calculate y. For each theta, I will then calculate the range of x-coordinates available and generate 10 evenly spaced x values within this range, y being constant for a theta.
               In the end, I'll have 50 unique placements: (surf_idx, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy for Object Placement Stability**
           
           Okay, so the feedback made it clear: my previous method of placing the object "on top" of the surface wasn't cutting it. The critical issue was that the object's bounding box was extending *beyond* the surface's bounding box in the y-direction. The stability condition, as defined in the problem, requires the object to be *fully contained within* the surface's bounds, meaning its entire bounding box must fit *inside* the surface's volume. This isn't the usual interpretation of "on a surface", which had me thinking the object needed to just be touching.
           
           I re-evaluated the problem's stability condition, which translates into an AABB-containment constraint: the object's AABB (after rotation) must be entirely within the surface's AABB. This drastically changes how I need to generate valid placements. I'll need to calculate the effective half-width and half-height for each rotation, and use those to determine the valid range for the object's center coordinates. Importantly, the center *y*-coordinate must be within the surface, not on its top.
           
           My new approach:
           
           1.  **Define a set of `theta` values:** 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3\*pi/8, and pi/2.
           2.  **For each `theta`**:
               *   Calculate the effective half-width and half-height (`h_eff`) to determine object's AABB for different angles.
               *   Calculate valid `x_c` and `y_c` ranges. The y-coordinate is the key, and it needs to be *inside* the surface's y-bounds.
               *   Fixed the `y_c` at the center of its valid range for each `theta`. This will make the distribution more uniform.
               *   Generate 10 equally spaced `x_c` values to ensure a diverse set of placements.
           
           This way, the object will always be "stable" by the problem's definition: fully inside the surface volume. This approach should address the reported issue.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 10, that needs placement. The feedback on my previous attempt clarified that "stable" means the object's AABB must be *fully contained* within the surface's AABB. My initial understanding was wrong, and I've corrected my calculations. I've already verified my logic for calculating the `y_c` coordinate, and the midpoint approach works perfectly for keeping it fully contained and stable.
           
           Now I have a square object, approximately 0.07446 meters on each side. The surface is still `surf_0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. I need to figure out the right center coordinates, `(x_c, y_c)` and a rotation angle `theta` for this thing.
           
           My strategy is to try five different rotations: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.  For each, I'll calculate the *effective* half-dimension, `h_eff`,  based on the object's dimensions and the rotation.  Then, I'll determine the valid range for `x_c` and `y_c` to keep it stable.  Since this is a square, the correct `y_c` value is always -0.3.  Finally, I'll generate ten `x_c` values, evenly spaced, within the valid `x_c` range.
           
           Here's the breakdown of my calculations:
           
           *   **`theta = 0` (and `pi/2`):** `h_eff = 0.037230`. `x_min_c = 4.237230`, `x_max_c = 4.762770`, so `x_step = 0.058393`.
           *   **`theta = pi/8` (and `3*pi/8`):** `h_eff = 0.048652`. `x_min_c = 4.248652`, `x_max_c = 4.751348`, so `x_step = 0.055855`.
           *   **`theta = pi/4`:** `h_eff = 0.052646`. `x_min_c = 4.252646`, `x_max_c = 4.747354`, so `x_step = 0.054968`.
           
           With `y_c = -0.3` set, I now have the x-coordinates and rotation angles for placing object ID 10 on the surface. Now it's a matter of actually generating the placement commands!
