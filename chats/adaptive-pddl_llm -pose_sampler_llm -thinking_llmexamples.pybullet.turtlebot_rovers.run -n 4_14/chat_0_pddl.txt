           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to:
           
           1.  Having four images received (`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`).
           2.  Having analysis of two specific rocks received (`receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`).
           
           The initial state provides some facts: rovers `v12` and `v14` are at specific configurations (`atconf`), both have a free storage space (`free`), and their cameras (`v10`) are onboard. We have the necessary cameras, objectives (for imaging), communication visibility, and initial facts to determine that our objective is achievable given the right action instances.
           
           To achieve the images I need actions to calibrate the camera and take the image, and a sending actions. To achieve the analysis I need an action to perform the analysis, and a action to send the rock sample to the lander.
           
           However, here's the rub: I'm only allowed to use a very restricted set of actions, specifically: `move`, and `drop_rock`. No actions to take the image, send the image, analyze samples, or send samples.
           
           To capture the images, I need `take_image` and `send_image`.  To get the sample analyzed, I need `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. Those actions are NOT in the list.
           
           The goal is to be able to achieve the desired state using those actions. But since none of the image or analysis-related actions are available, the plan fails. It's like having all the ingredients for a delicious meal but not being allowed to use the stove! The problem is constrained in a way that makes it impossible to achieve my goal. The plan is therefore unsolvable, given the limitations.
