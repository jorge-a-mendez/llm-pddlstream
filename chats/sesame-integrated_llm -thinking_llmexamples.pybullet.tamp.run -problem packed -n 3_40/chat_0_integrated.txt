           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.087, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.462, 0.887).

           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.228, -0.456, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.051, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.094, -0.405, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.95, 0.312).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.287), (-0.038, -0.189)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).

           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.143, -0.453), (-0.045, -0.356)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the objective is to arrange three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on a surface named v16. It's clear that I need a plan to achieve this "on" condition for all three. The current situation is that these objects are scattered on another surface, v11, at their respective initial poses (v9, v13, and v15). I've got the bounding box information (AABB) for both v11 and v16. Importantly, there's a constraint, the robot can only use arm v4, and it's currently at base config v5, with handempty. Arm v6 is handempty too but will not be used.
           
           The task translates into individual sub-goals: placing v8, v12, and v14 onto v16. The solution will involve picking each object from its initial pose and placing it onto the target surface. My main challenge is determining where to place these objects, and how to avoid collisions. The constraint on the `on` predicate tells me that each object will need its own instantiation of the same logical pose variable `#o2`. The trick is that even though the plan uses the same symbolic name, the robot will place each object at a distinct physical location.
           
           **Planning and Action Sequencing**
           
           The plan is straightforward: 
           1.  Move the base to the appropriate configuration, likely close to the target surface.
           2.  Pick v8 from its current position and place it on v16 at a specific pose.
           3.  Pick v12 and place it on v16 at its own specific pose.
           4.  Finally, pick v14 and place it on v16 at a third specific pose.
           
           I'll be using pick and place actions, for which the available actions use `#o3` for `bconf` and `#o4` for `atraj`. The `move_base` action would likely be the initial one. The `kin` relations are supplied and specify the preconditions for pick and place operations. I will rely on the `kin` facts as they will work.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Instantiation**
           
           I am now going to define values for the continuous parameters. I need to come up with locations for the individual objects. The AABB of surface v16 has a small area (0.27m x 0.27m) which restricts my placement choices. Given that the objects' starting positions are given at 0.781 Z height, I can assume the placement will be at the same height to make the problem easier. My calculations show that it is not possible to place three of the objects side-by-side or stacked without overlapping. Therefore, I will need to devise placements that take up the full area of the object. My solution is the following poses for the object:
           
           For v8, x: -0.049, y: -0.086, z: 0.781, theta = 0.
           For v12, x: 0.0495, y: -0.086, z: 0.781, theta = 0.
           For v14, x: 0.0, y: 0.001, z: 0.781, theta = 0.
           
           These arrangements ensure the robot will not overlap.
           
           **Plan Refinement and Cost Evaluation**
           
           The plan and the poses should be executable given the state of the problem.
           1. `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`
           2. `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3. `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4. `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5. `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6. `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7. `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           The overall cost will involve the cost of base motion from v3 to `#o3`, 3 for picking, and 3 for placement. It is a straightforward problem of picking each object at its initial position and placing it to the new position.
