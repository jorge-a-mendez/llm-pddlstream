           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.07382767700584658, 0.07382767700584614)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular and relatively small. I need to find 50 stable placements for the object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface's bounding box. Since the object is small, I can try placing it at various positions and orientations within the surface. I will prioritize placing the object in the center of the surface, as well as along the edges, and at the corners, considering different rotations. Since the object is nearly square (size_x and size_y are very close), rotation won't significantly change its footprint, but I'll still include some rotations for diversity.
           
           Surface 0: x from 4.2 to 4.8, y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           Surface 0 width: 0.6, height: 0.6.
           Object size: 0.0738 x 0.0738 (let's call it `s` for short).
           
           For an object with dimensions (w, h) placed at (x, y) with rotation theta, its extent in the x-direction is `w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and in the y-direction is `w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`.
           In this case, w = h = s. So the object's extent in x and y will always be `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value ranges from `s` (when theta is 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) to `s * sqrt(2)` (when theta is pi/4, 3pi/4, etc.).
           `s = 0.07382767700584658`. `s * sqrt(2) = 0.104407`.
           The surface has a width and height of 0.6. The object is small enough to fit even at its maximum extent.
           
           I will try to distribute placements across the surface, varying x, y, and theta.
           The center of the surface is (4.5, -0.3).
