           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **I need to devise a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to gathering specific information through the rovers.** This breaks down into several key conditions: I need images of two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, and analysis reports for at least one rock of type `v2` and one rock of type `v6`. I have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and both start at base configurations. Rover `v10` is a shared camera.
           
           **My strategy involves using both rovers concurrently to optimize the data gathering.** I'll use `v12` primarily for image-related tasks and `v14` for sampling and analysis. Because the initial state has certain visibility conditions (expressed by predicates like `imagevisible` and `comvisible`), and I'm constrained by the continuous values that I'm able to provide for these visibility conditions, I will need to be very explicit and careful in how I proceed.
           
           **For `v12`, the primary workflow involves imaging objectives.**  This requires a sequence of steps. First, move `v12` from its starting position (`v13`) to a specific imaging configuration (`#o3`).  This configuration must allow the camera to see the targets `v17` and `v18`.  `#o4` is a ray that relates to `imagevisible` and represents the target objects and where I need to set the location, direction and orientation of the rover. This value is part of the constraints as it is an object in the PDDL file.  I must calibrate the camera, take an image of `v17`, then calibrate and take an image of `v18`. After these, it will be moved to a separate communication configuration (`#o0`) to relay the image data to `v9`.
           
           **For `v14`, I concentrate on sampling and analysis.** I need this rover to move from its starting position (`v15`) to a sampling configuration (`#o5`) to collect the analysis data. I need to sample one rock of type `v2` and one rock of type `v6`. So first, I will have `v14` sample a rock, then `drop_rock` (i.e. empty the sample store), and then sample another rock. After that, I move to communication config (`#o0`) and send the analysis to the lander.
           
           **To handle the configuration and visibility challenges, I need to choose configurations carefully.** The configurations have specific continuous values that meet visibility requirements given in the problem statement, which is the key constraint I must meet in order for the plan to be valid. The values given in the prompt,  `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, have requirements and must be evaluated.
           *   For `#o3`, I need this configuration for `v12` such that both images can be taken.
           *   For `#o0`, both `v12` and `v14` will need configurations for communicating with `v9`.
           *   For `#o5`, `v14` must achieve "above" conditions.
           
           The final step for ensuring the plan meets the goals are returning both rovers to their initial positions and returning their storage space to free.
           The key to completing this is assigning the location of the rovers to meet all constraints.
           For each `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` value, I must also calculate the ray direction when setting the location and orientation to meet constraints.
           These continuous values need to be evaluated and checked to satisfy the stated image and communication visibility requirements. Once these values are set, the plan will be in full compliance with the PDDL file.

(Thoughts: **Recalibrating My Strategy: A Comprehensive Review**
           
           I've been given some critical feedback on the initial plan, and it's time to refine my approach, being the expert I am in this field. Several key issues need immediate attention, and I'm addressing them in a structured way:
           
           1.  **The Perils of Proximity:** The primary challenge is ensuring that my configurations for both imaging and communication are collision-free. I must meticulously assess the rover's trajectory and potential collision points. For instance, the original imaging configuration for `v12` collided with obstacle `v19`. I've now identified that a (1.0, 1.0) pose, which I've designated as `#o3`, should be a collision-free alternative.
           2.  **Reachability Requirements:**  Crucially, any new configuration must be reachable from the rover's starting point. I've re-evaluated the initial and final configurations for both rovers to ensure a viable path exists. I've accounted for reachability in my calculations and path planning.
           3.  **The Format Fiasco:**  I've identified and corrected my errors in the configuration format.  I've revised the structure to accurately reflect the target for the imaging or communication predicate. My new format clearly distinguishes between configuration and target.
           4.  **Strategic Sampling:** For the rover's sampling actions, the instruction requires that the sampling configuration (`#o5`) is provided in the initial state with `above` predicate, but it does not need to be calculated. The configurations for sampling are not provided in the same format.
           5.  **A Refined Strategy:** With these adjustments, I've crafted a far more robust plan. Here's a concise breakdown of my planned solutions.
               *   **Rover `v12`:** A path for imaging and communicating while avoiding collisions. I will move to (#o3): (1.0 1.0) and then (0.0, -1.75).
               *   **Rover `v14`:** A structured approach for sampling, analyzing, and communicating, leveraging an existing state, with sampling at (#o5). I will move and drop and communicate.
               *   I did the checks to ensure the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements are valid.
           
           **Revised Configuration Coordinates**

(Thoughts: **Strategic Refinement and Configuration Selection**
           
           Okay, so the initial feedback highlighted some reachability and collision concerns. Let's reassess our plan, focusing on those crucial `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (communication) configurations.  We've got the goal `new-axiom@0()`, meaning we need rovers at specific configurations, imaging certain objectives, and receiving analyses of stone and soil.  We know that rover `v12` is imaging, which has posed some issues with reachability for a continuous range. Rover `v14` will sample the rocks, and communicate all the data. 
           
           **Re-evaluating the Imaging Rover `v12`:**
           
           Previously, we were having trouble finding configurations for imaging objective `v17` and `v18`. The system indicated unreachability or invalid configurations. The rover has max imaging distance of 2. We'll refine the plan, utilizing separate `#o3` values (which is acceptable, as each (rover, target) pair needs separate ranges for #o3).
           
           1.  **Imaging `v17` (around 0.4, 2.0) and `v18` (around 1.9, 1.8):**
               *   Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75) initially.
               *   **For `v17`:**  Tried to have `v12` near (0.4, 2.0), but didn't have enough information about obstructions. Need to test with two positions. Tested with (0.4, 0.5), which is plausible, now.
               *   **For `v18`:** Rover v12 will try to view at near (1.9, 0.5), we tested and this configuration is plausible, as well.
               *   Call these configurations `#o3a` and `#o3b`, respectively.  We determined that **(1.0, 1.5)** works to get the image, so we're set, now.
               *   Since these two imaging ranges are so close together, we can use a single `#o3` for both, and this will be defined as (1.0, 1.5).
           
           2.  **Communication for `v12`:**
               *   Rover needs a pose to communicate with `v9`, lander
               *   We can use the previous location and avoid the `v20` obstacle, so let's try moving the robot to (0.2, -2.0)
           
           **Revised Rover `v14` Plan (Sampling and Analysis):**
           
           1.  **Sampling from `v1` and `v8`:**
               *   Rover is above these objects, at `#o5`. This is a non-continuous variable.
               *   We don't need a coordinate value, unless it's for `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, which it isn't, so it's not needed.
           
           2.  **Communication for `v14`:**
               *   The robot, again, needs to contact `v9`.
               *   Previous (communicating pose) was not reachable.
               *   The rover is at `(-0.5, -2.0)`.
           
           **Key Continuous Value Selections**
           
           *   `#o3` (imaging): For rover `v12`: **(1.0, 1.5)**.
           *   `#o0` (communication): For rover `v12`: **(0.2, -2.0)**, for `v14`: **(-0.5, -2.0)**.
           *   `#o5` (above): No coordinate needed as it's not used with `imagevisible` or `comvisible`.
           
           We will also update our plan with the required ray coordinates as well. For `imagevisible` predicates, the ray coordinates `(#o4)` will be the vector difference between the rover position and the target position.  For `comvisible` predicates, the ray `(#o1)` is the difference between the lander and the rover. We'll ensure these are properly incorporated.
           
           Based on these configurations, the plan seems complete and sound to accomplish the necessary requirements.  Each of these steps will meet our goal. We're on the right track!

(Thoughts: **My Thinking Process for Planning**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. I'm aiming to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but that needs several things to happen: Rovers need to be back in their starting spots, their stores need to be empty, and we need images and analyses sent. My past attempts failed because of where things were located or how they were presented. Specifically, I've had issues with rovers not being able to move where they needed to, collisions with obstacles, and the way the instructions said to format rays and poses.
           
           So, I'm going to carefully plan out where the rovers need to be for imaging and communication, making sure they're reachable, and don't collide with anything. I've recalculated the average coordinates for the rovers, objectives, obstacles, and lander.
           
           For Rover `v12` (imaging):
           *   I need a spot `#o3` to image `v17` and `v18`. I'm choosing (0.5, 1.0) because it looks reachable, and I've checked distances and that it won't collide with the obstacle `v19` or `v20`.
           *   I need a communication spot `#o0`. I'm choosing (0.7, -2.0) for Rover v12 because I've verified it's reachable and collision-free.
           
           For Rover `v14` (sampling and analysis):
           *   I need a spot `#o5` for sampling rocks. Because the problem statement is ambiguous, and because `#o5` is explicitly in the initial state, I'm assuming it doesn't have to be *above* both rocks, only able to sample rocks. I've placed `#o5` at (-1.0, 0.5).
           *   For communication, I need a spot `#o0`.  I had to avoid colliding with the lander. I'm choosing a new spot at (-1.0, -1.0).
           
           With these locations decided, I reevaluated which configuration values I need to provide.  Only the configurations that are arguments to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` need coordinate values. The rule is, that because `#o0` and `#o3` are in the initial setup, I need to provide their coordinates. I don't need to specify the ray vectors; those are automatically determined, I believe.
           
           My detailed plan is now:
           *Rover v12: move to imaging spot, take images, move to communication spot, and send the pictures.
           *Rover v14: move to sampling, sample, drop, sample, send analyses, and then move back to original place.
           
           I also revised the ray vectors, checking all the steps to see how each action affects the rovers, ensuring that all preconditions are met before any plan action executes.
           The final coordinates are:
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.5 1.0)`
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (0.5 1.0)`
           `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (0.7 -2.0)`
           `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.0 -1.0)`

           *   For communication, I need a spot `#o0`.  I had to avoid colliding with the lander. I'm choosing a new spot at (-1.0, -1.0).
           
           With these locations decided, I reevaluated which configuration values I need to provide.  Only the configurations that are arguments to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` need coordinate values. The rule is, that because `#o0` and `#o3` are in the initial setup, I need to provide their coordinates. I don't need to specify the ray vectors; those are automatically determined, I believe.
           
           My detailed plan is now:
           *Rover v12: move to imaging spot, take images, move to communication spot, and send the pictures.
           *Rover v14: move to sampling, sample, drop, sample, send analyses, and then move back to original place.
           
           I also revised the ray vectors, checking all the steps to see how each action affects the rovers, ensuring that all preconditions are met before any plan action executes.
           The final coordinates are:
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.5 1.0)`
           `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (0.5 1.0)`
           `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (0.7 -2.0)`
           `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.0 -1.0)`
