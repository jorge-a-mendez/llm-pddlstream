           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's my game plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`: I've broken down the conditions, and I see I need to get images, analyze some rocks, and make sure everything is in its place. The first four conditions are already met, so that's a good start.
           
           **Gathering the Data: The Image Acquisition**
           
           I need images of objects `v17` and `v18` with a camera `v10` supporting mode `v11`. I can do this with either rover, but given their starting points, let's use `v14` at `v15` for the imaging tasks.
           
           To get the images, I'll need to use these steps: First, I'll `calibrate` the camera `v10` on `v14` for those two specific objectives.  And since the action of `calibrate` has `imagevisible` preconditions, I'll need to define continuous values in the configuration to match the current locations of the rover to be set by the action. Since `v14` is fixed at `v15`, these configurations would just be the existing positions.
           
           After the calibration, I will use `take_image` to capture the images, and then I will use the `send_image` action to get the images.
           
           **Analysing and Dropping the Rocks**
           
           Now, on to the rocks! I have rocks of types `v2` and `v6` to analyze. Rover `v14` is near a rock of type `v2` and can handle the analyses, but it's not enough to analyze. It needs to *sample* using the action `sample_rock`. The preconditions `above` and `free` must be true.  So it's as simple as using `#o5` which corresponds to the current location, and the sampling is performed.
           The last step for the rover to do is to drop the rock it sampled. After the analysis, I'll have to make sure both rovers use a `drop_rock` action to make sure they are again `free`.
           
           For `v12` I will use a similar procedure for the `v6` type.
           
           **The Plan: Actions and Configurations**
           
           Now that I have a clear path, here are the detailed steps:
           
           **Configurations (because I'm dealing with those '#' objects):**
           
           *   **For `v14`:**
               *   `#o3` (used for `imagevisible`) set to: *(-1.0, -1.75)*
               *   `#o0` (used for `comvisible`) set to: *(-1.0, -1.75)*
           *   **For `v12`:**
               *   `#o0` set to: *(1.0, -1.75)*.
           
           **The Action Sequence**
           
           *   **Rover `v14` (at `v15`):**
               1.  `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10)`
               2.  `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
               3.  `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
               4.  `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v18, v10)`
               5.  `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
               6.  `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
               7.  `sample_rock(v14, v15, v1, v16)`
               8.  `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v1)`
               9.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           *   **Rover `v12` (at `v13`):**
               10. `sample_rock(v12, v13, v5, v16)`
               11. `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v5)`
               12. `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           
           I believe this plan will satisfy all the constraints. It handles all the tasks in the right order and

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Infeasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a problem, and the user's feedback rightly points out a crucial flaw in my initial approach: I completely overlooked the constraint on valid actions.  I was working with a broader set of actions, but the problem explicitly limits me to just `move` and `drop_rock`.  That's a game changer.
           
           Let's break this down from a planning perspective. I need to achieve a specific set of goals, but they're now severely restricted. My goals are: maintaining two initial `atconf` states, restoring two `free` states that will become `full` at the start, and two `receivedimage` predicates and two `receivedanalysis` predicates as well. Unfortunately, with the provided restricted action set, this goal state is not achievable. `Move` actions essentially do nothing for my purpose, and `drop_rock` has preconditions that cannot be initially satisfied.  Crucially, I lack the ability to manipulate the image and analysis goals. 
           
           The problem specifies that any fact not explicitly stated as true in the initial state is false.  Since I can't *make* these image and analysis facts true using `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, the plan is doomed from the start. I'm essentially stuck with a situation where I can't fulfill those critical requirements.  The problem is inherently unsolvable with this given action set. I must conclude that the goal is unattainable.
