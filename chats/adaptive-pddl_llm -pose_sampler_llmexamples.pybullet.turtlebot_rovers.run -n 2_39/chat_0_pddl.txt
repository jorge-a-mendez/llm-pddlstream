User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, with dimensions roughly -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle (box 5) at x=0. Numerous smaller obstacles (boxes 6-20) are scattered throughout the room.
           
           My strategy is to try to find positions around the target point that avoid the known obstacles and the central wall. I will generate positions by moving along a circle of radius between 0.5 and 2 around the target point, and also try positions close to the target point. I will prioritize positions that are clearly in open areas and are not too close to the boundaries of the room or the central wall. I will also make sure the positions are within the x and y limits.
           
           The target point is (0.9126435300588882, 0.4727181056581896).
           
           1.  **Position 1:** I'll start by trying a position to the right and slightly above the target point. This seems to be an open area. I'll pick a point at radius 1.5.
               *   `x = target_x + 1.5 * cos(angle)`
               *   `y = target_y + 1.5 * sin(angle)`
               *   Let's try angle = 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).
               *   `x = 0.9126 + 1.5 * cos(pi/4) = 0.9126 + 1.5 * 0.7071 = 0.9126 + 1.0606 = 1.9732`
               *   `y = 0.4727 + 1.5 * sin(pi/4) = 0.4727 + 1.5 * 0.7071 = 0.4727 + 1.0606 = 1.5333`
               *   Check collision with obstacles:
                   *   Not colliding with the central wall (x=0).
                   *   Box 11: ((1.3977, 0.9672), (1.5284, 1.0978)). Our point is (1.97, 1.53), which is outside this box.
                   *   Box 12: ((2.1017, -0.5382), (2.2313, -0.4086)). Our point is (1.97, 1.53), outside.
                   *   Box 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). Our point (1.97, 1.53) is not inside this box but is somewhat close to its lower edge. This seems like a reasonable spot.
           
           2.  **Position 2:** I'll try a position to the left and slightly below the target, at a radius of 1.2.
               *   Let's try angle = 225 degrees (5*pi/4 radians).
               *   `x = 0.9126 + 1.2 * cos(5*pi/4) = 0.9126 + 1.2 * (-0.7071) = 0.9126 - 0.8485 = 0.0641`
               *   `y = 0.4727 + 1.2 * sin(5*pi/4) = 0.4727 + 1.2 * (-0.7071) = 0.4727 - 0.8485 = -0.3758`
               *   Check collision with obstacles:
                   *   Not colliding with the central wall (x=0). Our x is 0.0641, so just to the right of it.
                   *   Box 14: ((-0.5784, -0.1118), (-0.4421, 0.0244)). Our point (0.06, -0.37) is outside.
                   *   Box 15: ((0.3208, 0.3774), (0.4429, 0.4995)). Our point (0.06, -0.37) is outside.
                   *   Box 18: ((-0.3689, 0.1007), (-0.2465, 0.2231)). Our point (0.06, -0.37) is outside.
                   *   This position is close to the central wall (x=0) and relatively close to box 14 and 18 on the other side of the wall. However, our x-coordinate is positive. This looks plausible.
           
           3.  **Position 3:** I'll try a position directly below the target point, at a radius of 1.0. This is usually a good bet as it minimizes horizontal movement.
               *   Let's try angle = 270 degrees (3*pi/2 radians).
               *   `x = 0.9126 + 1.0 * cos(3*pi/2) = 0.9126 + 1.0 * 0 = 0.9126`
               *   `y = 0.4727 + 1.0 * sin(3*pi/2) = 0.4727 + 1.0 * (-1) = -0.5273`
               *   Check collision with obstacles:
                   *   Not colliding with central wall (x=0).
                   *   Box 12: ((2.1017, -0.5382), (2.2313, -0.4086)). Our point (0.91, -0.52) is far from this.
                   *   Box 16: ((-1.3569, -2.2902), (-1.2196, -2.1529)). Far from this.
                   *   This seems like a very open area.
           
           Positions:
           (1.9732 1.5333)
           (0.0641 -0.3758)
           (0.9126 -0.5273)
