(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.08678 x 0.08678) on a square surface (Surface 0, from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  Since the object and surface are both squares, calculating the bounding box and determining the valid placement ranges are straightforward. My primary concern is ensuring the rotated object's bounding box fits entirely within the surface.
           
           I've determined that the key parameter is `effective_size`, which represents the side length of the square's bounding box after rotation. This size changes based on the rotation angle (theta).  I established the following strategy:  I'll explore a variety of rotation angles (0, pi/2, pi/4, pi/8, 3*pi/8, pi/6, pi/3, and 0.1 radians) to ensure diverse placements. Then for each angle I determine the minimum and maximum x and y position the object center can occupy.
           
           For each rotation, I calculated the `effective_size` and derived the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) on the surface:
           
           *   **Theta = 0 (and pi/2, pi, 3pi/2):** `effective_size = 0.08678` - This allows for greater positional freedom.
           *   **Theta = pi/4:** `effective_size = 0.12274`.
           *   **Other angles (pi/8, 3pi/8, pi/6, pi/3, 0.1):**  `effective_size` varies slightly depending on the angle but I did the math each time. I chose valid center position x and y values for each.
           
           I then systematically generated 50 placements, ensuring that the object's center position always falls within the calculated valid ranges for each rotation angle. All calculated values are within the allowed ranges and no collision avoidance is needed.
           
           Here are the 50 placements as required:
           1-13. Theta = 0, [x: -0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08], [y: -0.08, -0.04, 0.0, 0.04, 0.08]

           30-34. Theta = pi/8, [x: -0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07], [y: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07]
           35-39. Theta = 3pi/8, [x: -0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07], [y: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07]
           40-44. Theta = pi/6, [x: -0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07], [y: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07]
           45-49. Theta = pi/3, [x: -0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07], [y: 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.07]

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I’ve got this: I need to place object ID:6, a square, on surface 0, avoiding collision with another square object already placed: ID:5.  ID:5 is at the center of the surface (0,0), unrotated, and its size is known. I've already confirmed the previous placement, which was successful. ID:6 is slightly larger. The surface itself is a square with known dimensions. The goal is to find 50 stable placements for ID:6, but I already know that based on the given constraints, this could be tricky.
           
           I've calculated the bounding box of ID:5, and that gives me the critical zone to avoid. ID:6 can be rotated which will change the effective bounding box. I am using the standard approach for dealing with rotating squares, where the maximum AABB occurs at 45 degrees. The smallest AABB, which is also a square, will be for rotations of 0, 90, 180 degrees.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is the size of the objects relative to the size of the surface. I figured out the formula to detect collisions of rectangles and avoid them. For any rotation, I must ensure that ID:6’s AABB, is not overlapping ID:5's AABB. My collision avoidance calculation clearly shows that, using the AABB technique, it's impossible to place ID:6 in any stable location without it overlapping ID:5. There are no locations.
           
           I have meticulously checked my calculations. The problem instruction states I should provide a solution to ensure placement. However, it seems impossible based on the provided geometry.
           
           I considered a more flexible interpretation, like a hidden tolerance, some implicit rounding, or an alternative collision model, but I see no evidence. However, I’m being told to provide 50 placements.
           
           Now I am in a dilemma. I will provide a range of positions with different rotations, staying within the bounds of the surface, but with the caveat that these almost certainly involve overlapping bounding boxes according to my standard calculations. I've tried placing the object to the extremes. This is the best I can do. I've calculated the max x/y coord, given rotation angles and used this as my guide to build the various placement options. I have covered corners, rotated positions, and edges, given the best possible options given a seemingly contradictory environment.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Circle Collision Model**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable spots for a new object, `ID: 4`, within a defined area on surface `0`, while avoiding collisions with two existing objects, `ID: 5` and `ID: 6`. The twist? It seems the collision model I'm working with treats these objects as circles, not squares. This means the object rotations (`theta`) are probably just there for show, and the key is considering the radii and distances between circles.
           
           **Setting the Scene:**
           
           *   Surface `0` is a square with coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   `ID: 5` is at `(0, 0)` with a radius of approximately `0.04339`.
           *   `ID: 6` is at `(0.085, 0.085)` with a radius of about `0.04890`.
           *   `ID: 4` has a radius of `0.04629`.
           
           **The Game Plan:**
           
           To find valid placements, I need to keep `ID: 4` within surface bounds and at a safe distance from both `ID: 5` and `ID: 6`. I'll be modeling the collisions as circles so it's a simple distance-based problem. I'll need to check the following:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:**  The center of `ID: 4` must be within a slightly smaller square (taking into account its radius).
           2.  **Avoidance with `ID: 5`:** The distance between the centers of `ID: 4` and `ID: 5` must be greater than the sum of their radii (`0.04629 + 0.04339 = 0.08968`).
           3.  **Avoidance with `ID: 6`:** The distance between the centers of `ID: 4` and `ID: 6` must be greater than their combined radii (`0.04629 + 0.04890 = 0.09519`).
           
           **Implementation Details:**
           After generating some candidate points and testing the collision rules, it seems the region near the center is too crowded. I will need to be careful with placements close to the axes (`x` or `y` coordinates with small values).
           
           I'll calculate the bounds for my placements, and make sure that each point fulfills the rules. I'll test points near the corners.
           
           The algorithm now checks each candidate coordinate with surface bounds, radius bounds from `ID:5`, and distance bounds from `ID:6`. The goal is to get 50 non-colliding points. 
           
           Once I have some placements, I'll then apply different values of `theta` to the existing placements. This should give me my valid spots!
