           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break this down from my perspective.**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to place an object, which I'll call `?green`, onto `v18` and ensure that `?green` has a specific type, `v17`.
           
           I've examined the initial state and identified two candidate objects that fulfill the type requirement: `v8` and `v12`. Both have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`.
           
           The crucial step is to get one of these objects "on" `v18`. The `on` predicate requires an object to be at a specific pose that is supported by `v18`. Looking at the initial state and the provided axioms, both `v8` and `v12` already have support relationships to `v18` via `#o2`. I'll focus on `v8` for now.
           
           For `v8`, I need to find a way to place it at `#o2`. This means placing it on `v18`. Initially, I noticed `atpose(v8, v9)`. So, the initial action would be moving it, picking it up, and placing it at `#o2`.
           
           The initial state reveals a graspable robot arm `v4`, initially `handempty(v4)`, and the base configuration `atbconf(v3)`. I've also verified that there are valid kinematic paths. This means I can pick and place `v8` with the arm `v4` and base config `#o3`.
           
           Given this information, I can construct a plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I need to move the robot's base from its current configuration `v3` to `#o3`, as the pick and place kinematics are defined for `#o3`. There's a `move_base` action that supports this. The `basemotion` is provided in the initial state, and it is a simple move.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I can execute the `pick` action with `v4` (the arm), `v8` (the object), `v9` (initial pose), `#o1` (grasp), `#o3` (base configuration), and `#o4` (trajectory). The preconditions for `pick` are satisfied.
           
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I can execute the `place` action with `v4`, `v8`, `#o2` (final pose, supported by `v18`), `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4`. The preconditions for `place` are satisfied.
           
           The plan should result in `v8` being "on" `v18` and still satisfying the type. The subsequent state will include `on(v8, v18)` and the initial condition `type(v8, v17)`.
           
           I've thoroughly checked that the initial state facts and the kinematics support this plan and that I will have fulfilled all of the necessary predicates for the `new-axiom@0()` goal. All the kinematics are related to the same robot configurations. This is critical for achieving a valid plan.
