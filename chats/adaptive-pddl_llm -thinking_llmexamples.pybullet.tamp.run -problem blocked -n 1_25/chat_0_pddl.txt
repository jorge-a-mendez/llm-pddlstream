           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to finding an object `?green` that is both on `v18` and has the type `v17`. My analysis began by examining the initial state for relevant facts about `on` and `type` predicates. I identified two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. However, neither is initially on `v18`; `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.
           
           To achieve the goal, I would ideally use `pick` and `place` actions to move one of the objects onto `v18`. I formulated a plan to pick `v8` (for example) and place it on `v18`. However, I then discovered a crucial constraint: the only permitted action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action effectively does nothing, as it moves the robot base from `v3` to `v3`.
           
           Since I am restricted to this single, non-effecting action, I cannot manipulate the objects in a way that would satisfy the goal. The `move_base` action does not affect the `on` predicate. Thus, if an object is not initially on `v18`, it cannot be made to be on `v18` using the permitted action.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of the problem and the permitted action instance, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. I have carefully analyzed the initial state, the goal, and the permitted action to arrive at this conclusion.
