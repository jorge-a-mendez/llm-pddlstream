           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` that's both `on v18` and has `type(?green, v17)`. I immediately identify two candidate objects that satisfy the `type` constraint: `v8` and `v12`. Now, the challenge is getting either of them `on v18`.
           
           I delve into the `on` axiom, understanding that to be `on` something requires being supported by it and having a specific pose. For both `v8` and `v12`, I find they are *currently* on different objects due to their initial `supported` and `atpose` states.  Critically, *neither* is initially supported by `v18`.  However, I can see that *both* can be supported by v18 if they are at the pose `#o2`.
           
           This is where the problem hits a snag.  To move `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`, I'd need `pick` and `place` actions. I analyze the available actions, and the *only* action allowed is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is useless. It only moves the base, and doesn't change the pose of any objects.
           
           I then dig deeper into the knowledge base, confirming the existence of the necessary `kin` (kinematic) facts for the `pick` and `place` actions, and also the `atbconf` (at base config) and `handempty` (hand empty) facts. But it doesn't matter, *because* the list of available actions *explicitly* excludes any instantiation of `pick` or `place`.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint on allowable action instances, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is *unachievable*.
