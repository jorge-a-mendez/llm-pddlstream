Model:     The scene contains a large central square obstacle (obstacle 0) with a vertical wall (obstacle 5) passing through its center. There are also outer walls (obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4) forming a larger square. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. I need to find positions that are within a 2-unit radius of the target point and avoid these obstacles. I will try to find positions around the target point, considering both the fixed obstacles and the possibility of unknown dynamic obstacles.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.878579020500183, 1.897620677947998). My proposed positions had issues.
           (-0.70718698, 1.40879669) was occluded. This suggests there might be an obstacle between this point and the target, possibly related to obstacle 16 or other small objects.
           (-1.01018698, 1.71179669) collided with obstacle 16: ((-1.2362666388570085, 1.5390180090845809), (-1.0948724488199935, 1.680412199121596)). This is a small obstacle located to the south-east of the target.
           (-1.31318698, 1.40879669) was not reachable, meaning it was outside the robot's allowed [-2.5, 2.5] x and y range, or perhaps too far from the target. Looking at the x coordinate, -1.31318698 is well within the [-2.5, 2.5] range, but given the target y of 1.897620677947998, a position with y=1.40879669 is within the range. The issue might be that it's too far (distance greater than 2) from the target given the actual target in the previous request.
           
           I need to be more careful with the proximity to obstacle 16 and consider moving further away from the dense cluster of obstacles in the upper left quadrant. The target is still in the upper left quadrant. Given the failures, I'll aim for positions that are further away from the center of the scene and also away from the known small obstacles, and specifically avoid obstacle 16. I will try to place the robot closer to the boundary walls if possible, or directly to the left of the target, where there seems to be more open space.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.878579020500183, 1.897620677947998).
           My previous set of positions, (-2.0, 1.0), (-2.4, 2.0), (-2.2, 1.5), were not evaluated for this specific run. The failures listed are from the *first* attempt. I need to make sure I am responding to the *current* request and its associated target point, while using the history of *all* previous failures as learning.
           
           The previously known failures were:
           1. Proposed position: (-0.70718698, 1.40879669) -- no line of sight to target due to occlusion. This position is significantly to the right and slightly below the target (-1.87, 1.89). This suggests an occlusion from an obstacle between (-0.7, 1.4) and the target. Obstacles 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), 16 ((-1.23, 1.53), (-1.09, 1.68)), and 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) are potential culprits.
           2. Proposed position: (-1.01018698, 1.71179669) -- collides with obstacle 16: ((-1.2362666388570085, 1.5390180090845809), (-1.0948724488199935, 1.680412199121596)). This confirms obstacle 16 is a problematic small object near the target.
           3. Proposed position: (-1.31318698, 1.40879669) -- not reachable for robot base. This suggests it's out of range of 2 units from the target or out of the general [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. Given the previous target was (-1.87, 1.89), this position has a distance of sqrt((-1.87 - -1.31)^2 + (1.89 - 1.40)^2) = sqrt((-0.56)^2 + (0.49)^2) = sqrt(0.3136 + 0.2401) = sqrt(0.5537) approx 0.74, which is well within 2. It must have been an unknown boundary for robot placement, or the previous target point was misread. I will prioritize positions within the [-2.5, 2.5] range for x and y.
           
           The target point is still (-1.878579020500183, 1.897620677947998). This point is in the upper-left quadrant. Obstacle 16 is around (-1.1, 1.6). Other obstacles in this quadrant include 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and 19 ((-1.91, 1.86), (-1.84, 1.93)).
           Obstacle 19 is very close to the target point, and obstacle 8 also encompasses parts of the region near the target.
           
           I need to find positions that are within 2 units of (-1.878579020500183, 1.897620677947998) and avoid all these obstacles.
           Given the target is at (-1.87, 1.89), and obstacle 8 is ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), the target is inside obstacle 8. This is a problem. The target is given, so the robot should be able to view it. This implies either the target is just outside the obstacle, or that it represents a point *on* the obstacle, or that the obstacle is not fully opaque. Since the robot needs to *view* the target, I should assume the target itself is not an obstacle.
           
           The failed positions indicate issues to the right and slightly below the target due to collision with 16 or occlusion.
           I will try positions further to the left, and slightly above/below, maintaining distance from obstacle 16. I also need to be careful with the outer wall obstacle 4 ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)).
           
           New positions will aim to be:
           1. To the left of the target, towards the outer wall.
           2. Avoiding the collision points and occluded areas.
           3. Within the max range of 2 from the target.

Model:     I have received new failure information, and it seems the target point has changed. The previous target was (-1.878579020500183, 1.897620677947998). The *new* target point for the *current* request is now (2.0720465183258057, 2.0238335132598877). I must carefully adapt my strategy to this new target.
           
           Let's break down the failures from the *previous* request (which had a target of (-1.878579020500183, 1.897620677947998)):
           1. (-0.70718698, 1.40879669) -- no line of sight to target due to occlusion. (Near the previous target)
           2. (-1.01018698, 1.71179669) -- collides with obstacle 16: ((-1.236, 1.539), (-1.094, 1.680)). (Near the previous target)
           3. (-1.31318698, 1.40879669) -- not reachable for robot base. (Near the previous target)
           
           Now, let's look at the failures from my *most recent* attempt for the *new* target point (2.0720465183258057, 2.0238335132598877).
           The target is now in the upper-right quadrant.
           4. Proposed position: (-2.4, 1.5) -- collides with obstacle 4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)). This is the left boundary wall. This is a common failure for positions too close to the environment limits.
           5. Proposed position: (-2.0, 2.3) -- collides with obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) and obstacle 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). Obstacle 1 is the top boundary wall. Obstacle 8 is a small block in the upper-left. It makes sense this position would collide with both given its location.
           6. Proposed position: (-1.5, 2.2) -- no line of sight to target. This is very far from the new target (approx 3.7 units away), so it's not surprising it was occluded.
           
           My previous positions were for the old target. Now the target is (2.072, 2.023), which is in the top-right corner. I need to generate new positions near *this* target.
           Obstacles near the new target:
           - Obstacle 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - top wall, close to the target's y.
           - Obstacle 3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - right wall, close to the target's x.
           - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - a small block in the upper-right. The target (2.072, 2.023) is *inside* this obstacle. As before, I'll assume the target itself can be viewed, even if within an obstacle's bounds.
           - Obstacle 20: ((2.022, 1.974), (2.121, 2.073)) - a very small block *very* close to the target. The target is (2.072, 2.023), which is inside this obstacle as well.
           
           Given the target is at (2.072, 2.023), and there are obstacles 7 and 20 directly around it, I need to place the robot carefully. I'll aim for positions:
           1. To the bottom-left of the target, to avoid the top and right walls (1 and 3) and possibly gain line of sight past obstacles 7 and 20.
           2. Within the 2-unit max range.
           3. Within the [-2.5, 2.5] x and y range.
           
           Target point: (2.0720465183258057, 2.0238335132598877)
           
           Positions:
           (1.5, 1.5)
           (1.8, 1.0)
           (2.2, 1.8)
