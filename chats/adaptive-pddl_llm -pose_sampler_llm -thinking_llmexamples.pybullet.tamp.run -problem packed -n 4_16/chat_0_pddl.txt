           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **The placement problem involves a square object (ID 4) with dimensions 0.0988562586432502 x 0.0988562586432502, and a square surface (ID 0) with extents (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I need to generate 50 stable placements of this object on the surface. "Stable" means the object must be entirely contained within the surface, regardless of its rotation. The object is a square, so I need to account for how rotations affect its AABB relative to the surface's AABB.**
           
           **I reasoned that to maximize placement possibilities and adhere to the "stable placement rule", the best approach is a combination of uniform placements with a rotation of 0 (or PI/2, PI, 3PI/2) and one placement at the center with a rotation of PI/4.**
           
           **I calculated the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates of the object for theta = 0, which corresponds to the easiest orientation (no rotation). With 0 rotation, object extents are the exact same as its side lengths, so the surface extent range needs to be reduced by half the side length in each dimension to center the square within the surface. The range [-0.0855718706783749, 0.0855718706783749] in x and y dimensions is valid for theta=0. Then I did a 7 x 7 grid to account for this.**
           
           **For the PI/4 orientation, which is when the maximum bounding rectangle occurs, the calculation changes, thus I had to calculate the max AABB's value with the appropriate rotation formula. This range is smaller, and therefore, safe. The range is [-0.0650980615300192, 0.0650980615300192].**

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a successful placement for object 4, which means I know its valid position.  I need to use this information to make sure object 6, a square, doesn't collide with it. The challenge is to find 50 stable placements for object 6 on surface 0, while keeping it safe from object 4. I already know the valid placement range for surface 0 and I've also calculated the collision zone for the placements of object 6 at theta=0. The main goal is to avoid any overlap between object 6 and the established AABB of object 4.  I've found that the safest approach is to limit the placement region for object 6 to be either primarily to the right of object 4 or above object 4. I've set up a 9x9 grid to generate points, then filtering out those which would collide with object 4, leaving me with a set of coordinates that satisfy the no-collision constraint, which should provide a good selection of placements.

(Thoughts: **My current focus is on placing a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with objects already placed (IDs 4 and 6).** I've carefully examined the dimensions, positions, and bounding boxes (AABBs) of these existing objects, noting any overlaps or proximity. My goal is to find 50 stable, non-colliding placements for object 5.
           
           First, I established the occupied region based on the AABBs of objects 4 and 6, creating a conservative rectangular bounding box. Then, I calculated the valid x and y ranges for object 5 on the surface, ensuring that it remains within the surface boundaries and is sufficiently far from the existing objects.
           
           To avoid collisions, I defined collision-free regions, considering both the existing objects' positions. Essentially, any placement must be *above a threshold y-value* or *to the left of a threshold x-value* or *to the right of a threshold x-value* to avoid overlaps.
           
           I've decided to employ a grid-based approach. I generated candidate placements by systematically creating a grid of potential locations within the surface boundaries. Then, I filtered these points based on the collision-avoidance logic I had devised, ensuring that the selected placement would meet all the criteria. I ordered the generated points by decreasing y and then x in order to have the algorithm prioritize placing objects from the top.
           
           By carefully considering the positions, bounding boxes, and collision rules, I am now confident that the list I have created represents a set of 50 stable and collision-free placements for object 5.
