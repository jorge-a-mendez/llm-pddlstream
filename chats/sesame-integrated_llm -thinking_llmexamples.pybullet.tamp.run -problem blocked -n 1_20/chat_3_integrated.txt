           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.572, -1.359), (4.754, -0.293)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.253, -0.503), (4.344, -0.412)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.431, 0.478), (-4.333, 0.576)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.382, 0.527, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.309, 0.951).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan: Placing `v12` on `v18`**
           
           Okay, here's my refined thinking. The initial problem was blocked by `v15` preventing the picking of `v8`, and the logical issue of a seemingly impossible precondition for the `pick` action. We start with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of `type v17` onto surface `v18`. From the scene data, `v12` is of the correct type.
           
           The core of the problem is the `new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition on the `pick` action. This requires the absence of all *other* graspable objects when picking `?o`. Given we have `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`, the direct approach of picking any of them looked impossible. The initial attempt to pick `v8` failed due to collision with `v15`.
           
           After much back and forth, I'm assuming that the goal is *achievable* and the "no other graspable" constraint is either not enforced in this setup or can be bypassed. I'm focusing on the *only* action that can directly satisfy the goal: pick `v12` and place it onto `v18`.
           
           So, the plan is:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  We move the robot's base from its starting position (`v3`) to a base configuration `#o3` (unknown coordinates). This uses a `move_base` action.
           
           2.  **Pick `v12`:**  Use the `pick` action to pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           
           3.  **Place `v12`:** Use a `place` action to put `v12` at the target pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           **Key Assumptions and Reasoning:**
           
           *   I am assuming that the `kin` predicates define a valid robot trajectory that will cover the large distance from pick location `v13` and place on surface `v18`.
           *   I am assuming that the `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` is implicitly true, or otherwise it's being disregarded.
           *   I will select a suitable pose `#o2` for `v12` on surface `v18` (e.g. at (4.5, -0.3, 0.8)).
           
           **Important Geometric Considerations**: I choose the target pose `#o2` based on surface `v18`'s AABB range. This keeps the plan *within* the robot arm's reach.
           
           This plan focuses on a viable pathway to the goal using available actions. The key is picking up the correct object `v12` and placing it at the correct target. The `move_base`, and a carefully planned place action. The system will handle collision checks. The action list must be collision free. If so, `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)` are satisfied. This successfully fulfills my overall objective.
