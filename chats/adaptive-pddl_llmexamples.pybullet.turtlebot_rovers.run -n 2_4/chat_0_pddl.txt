           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12, v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a storage bin (v16), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8). There are also objectives v17 and v18, and a mode v11.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents the following conditions:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13.
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15.
           *   `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12's storage v16 is free.
           *   `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14's storage v16 is free.
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           *   `type(?stone, v2)`: Some stone has type v2.
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of that stone has been received.
           *   `type(?soil, v6)`: Some soil has type v6.
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of that soil has been received.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1.  **Rover configurations and storage:**
               *   `atconf(v12, v13)` is already true.
               *   `atconf(v14, v15)` is already true.
               *   `free(v12, v16)` is already true.
               *   `free(v14, v16)` is already true.
               So, the first four conditions are met by the initial state.
           
           2.  **Received images:**
               *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are *not* true initially. This means the rovers need to take images and send them to the lander.
               *   Rover v14 has camera v10 onboard, which supports mode v11.
               *   Rover v12 also has camera v10 onboard.
               *   Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, suggesting they can take and send images.
           
           3.  **Received analysis:**
               *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6` are *not* true initially.
               *   There are rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and type `v6` (v5, v7, v8).
               *   This implies a rover needs to sample a rock of each type and send the analysis.
           
           Now, let's look at the available actions:
           *   `move`: Only allows moving rovers v12 and v14 to their current configurations (v13 and v15 respectively) which means no actual movement. This action doesn't change anything relevant to the goal.
           *   `drop_rock`: This action requires `full` storage, which is not true in the initial state (`free` is true for both). This action is not useful for achieving the `free` condition as it's already met.
           
           Crucially, the available action instances only include `move` and `drop_rock`. There are no action instances for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. Without these actions, the rover cannot take pictures, send analyses, or even sample rocks. Therefore, the conditions for `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be met.
           
           The goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
