(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Goal Achievement: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object is both "on" a specific surface (`v18`) and has a particular "type" (`v17`). Upon closer inspection, I've identified that the object `v12` satisfies the `type` condition. My focus is now on manipulating `v12` to satisfy the "on" condition.
           
           Initially, `v12` is "on" another surface (`v14`), but the initial state reveals a supporting relationship with a more promising target, `v18`. This hints that I need to reposition `v12` to be "on" `v18`. I need to execute `pick` and `place` actions to change the current "pose" of `v12`. I have access to an arm, `v4`, which I can control.
           
           The system provides me with the crucial `kin` facts, specifying the valid kinematic configurations for both `pick` and `place` actions involving `v4` and `v12`. Importantly, all `kin` facts rely on a continuous base configuration parameter, `#o3`, and the action instances rely on available objects, a specific trajectory, and a specific grasp. The key to the plan hinges on whether `#o3` can be equal to `v3`, the robot's initial base configuration. The problem states that the base configuration is a continuous parameter, which means its value will be computed later. Since the only available `move_base` action instance permits the robot to stay at its current base configuration, I have to *assume* `#o3` could be `v3` for me to be able to use `kin` information and formulate a valid sequence. 
           
           Given the available facts and this assumption, the plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Use arm `v4` to pick object `v12` from its current pose using the grasp configuration `#o1`.
           2.  **Place:** Use arm `v4` to place object `v12` at pose `#o2` onto surface `v18`.
           
           Assuming the continuous parameters can be solved using motion planning:
           -   `v12` will be `on` surface `v18` after the `place` action, which satisfies a goal predicate.
           -   We've already established that `v12` satisfies the `type` requirement from the problem's initial state.
           
           With this interpretation, the defined sequence, using `v12` as the desired `?green` object, satisfies the goal conditions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Problem with Strict Action Constraints**
           
           Okay, it's clear now. The previously suggested plan was using actions that are not permitted. I was explicitly instructed to stick to the given action instance, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, and nothing else. This severely limits what's possible.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked to mean I need an object that is both of type `v17` and on `v18`. Initially, I checked what objects fit the bill.
           
           Looking at the initial state facts, I see several objects of type `v17`: `v12` and `v8`. Unfortunately, their current "on" relationships are `v12` on `v14` and `v8` on `v11`.  My analysis showed that, for each object that might be `?green`, to achieve the goal I would need to modify their positions with permitted actions, which cannot be done. Specifically:
           
           *   For `v12`, I'd need it `atpose(#o2)` to be `on(v18)`.
           *   For `v8`, I'd need it `atpose(#o2)` to be `on(v18)`.
           
           Since the *only* allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does *nothing* to alter object positions or relations, it's immediately obvious that the goal is *impossible* to achieve. This move merely toggles `canmove` and sets the base from `v3` to `v3` - which accomplishes absolutely nothing toward getting an object onto `v18`.
           
           So, with this restricted action set, the goal is simply *unreachable*. I am unable to fulfill the requirements of `new-axiom@0()` given the available actions. There's no way to manipulate the world state to satisfy the desired 'on' predicate.
