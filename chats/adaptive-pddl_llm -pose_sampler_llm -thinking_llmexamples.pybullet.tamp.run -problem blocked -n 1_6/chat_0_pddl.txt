           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           Given the task of finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) on surface 0, I've devised a strategy that focuses on systematically varying both the object's rotation and its position on the surface. The object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) dimensions are provided, and I know that a stable placement requires the object to be entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           The surface is a square of size 0.6 x 0.6, and the object's dimensions are roughly 0.081 x 0.081. This size difference allows for a dense packing of the object on the surface. The challenge lies in efficiently exploring the space of possible rotations and positions to find a diverse set of stable configurations.
           
           To achieve this, I've broken down the problem into two key components:
           
           1.  **Rotation:** I'm considering rotations from 0 to pi/2 radians. Due to the symmetry of the object and AABB definition, rotations beyond pi/2 will result in equivalent placements. I've chosen 10 distinct angles, spaced equally from 0 to pi/2.
           2.  **Position:** For each rotation, I'm generating 5 unique (x, y) positions within the valid placement area on the surface, ensuring the AABB, at that given angle, remains inside the surface's boundary.
           
           To determine the valid placement area for a given rotation, I first calculate the AABB dimensions (width and height) of the rotated object using the object's intrinsic dimensions and the rotation angle. Then, I ensure that the object's center point falls within a valid range that accounts for the object's rotated AABB dimensions. To generate (x, y) coordinates, I systematically choose 5 points across the ranges to adequately cover the valid placement area.
           
           This structured approach guarantees a diverse set of 50 stable placements, exploring the possible rotations and locations while ensuring all generated configurations are valid and stable.
