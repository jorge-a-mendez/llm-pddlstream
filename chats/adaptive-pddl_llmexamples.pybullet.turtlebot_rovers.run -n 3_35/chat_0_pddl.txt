           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each with a camera `v10` capable of imaging. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) of different types (`v2`, `v6`). There's also a lander `v9` for communication. Both rovers are at specific configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) and have a free storage `v16`. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires specific conditions:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2.  `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are also already true in the initial state.
           3.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This means images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` need to be taken and sent to the lander using mode `v11`.
           4.  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means any rock of type `v2` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. The rocks `v1`, `v3`, and `v4` are of type `v2`.
           5.  `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means any rock of type `v6` needs to be analyzed and the analysis sent. The rocks `v5`, `v7`, and `v8` are of type `v6`.
           
           The provided valid action instances are extremely limited, only allowing `move` and `drop_rock` actions, and specifically `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))` which are self-moves (moving to the same configuration, essentially doing nothing). `drop_rock` also cannot be used as no rocks have been sampled.
           
           Crucially, there are no actions provided for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. Without these actions, it is impossible to:
           *   Take and send images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`.
           *   Sample and analyze rocks of type `v2` and `v6` and send the analysis.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is not achievable as the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis, calibrate) are not available in the provided list of valid action instances.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is not achievable as the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis, calibrate)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous response incorrectly attempted to explain the unreachability of the goal as a plan. I apologize for this error.
           
           Upon re-evaluating the problem with the strictly limited set of available actions, it's clear that the goal remains unachievable. The goal requires:
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are true initially.
           2.  `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are true initially.
           3.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This requires `take_image` and `send_image` actions, which are not in the allowed list.
           4.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`: This requires `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions, which are not in the allowed list.
           
           The only allowed actions are `move` (which are self-moves and do not change the state meaningfully for the goal) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be used as no rocks have been sampled and stored, meaning `full(v, s)` is never true).
           
           Since there are no actions to perform imaging, sending images, sampling rocks, or sending analysis, it is impossible to achieve the parts of the goal that require `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. Therefore, the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be satisfied.
