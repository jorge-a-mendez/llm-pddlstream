           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to figure out three good spots for a robot base (x, y) near a given target, making sure the robot can "see" the target and avoiding collisions with obstacles. I'm given the target point, and the robot can be no farther than a distance of 2 from it. The robot's facing direction will automatically adjust to look at the target. Also, the robot needs to stay within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds.
           
           First, I need to understand the environment. I've got the boundaries of the room, which are rectangular, and a few other obstacles. A big deal is the vertical wall in the middle (at x=0). The target point in this scenario is at (-0.5, 0.0).  I'll focus on how to place robot base locations for this target.
           
           The core strategy is to:
           1.  Generate candidate points around the target within the 2-unit range.
           2.  Filter out any points that are outside the room bounds.
           3.  Check each candidate point for collisions by seeing if it's inside any of the obstacle bounding boxes (AABBs).
           4.  Verify line-of-sight (LOS) from each candidate to the target by checking if the direct line between them intersects any obstacle.
           5.  If any previously failed spots are seen for the same target, I should avoid them (I do not have any failed spots for this target yet).
           
           I'll start with helper functions to simplify these steps. I'll need a function to determine if a point is inside an AABB (simple comparison) and another to determine if a line segment intersects an AABB. The line segment one will be more involved, and I will define a helper function for this.
           
           **Obstacle Analysis and Candidate Point Generation**
           
           Given the central wall and the target's position at (-0.5, 0.0), I realize that any robot location on the opposite side of the target (right side of the wall at x=0) won't have a clear line of sight. So, the x-coordinate of all robot base positions must be < -0.05. I'll take this into account for every choice.
           
           I'll generate points in a circular pattern around the target point. First, try an offset of 1.5 units and angles of 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, and their intermediate values.
           
           Specifically: The candidate positions will be along a circle with a radius r = 1.5, around the target.
           
           **Candidate Point Evaluation**
           
           I started by computing three candidate points on a circle radius of 1.5. I determined that the robot had to be on the left-hand side of the main wall, since the target is. I went back and recomputed candidate points with this restriction.
           
           My refined candidates include:
           *   (-2.0, 0.0)
           *   (-1.56, 1.06)
           *   (-1.56, -1.06)
           
           These positions are all valid since they are within the acceptable range, within range (r<=2) from the target, and on the same side as the target (x < -0.05). I then verified that there are no collisions with any of the obstacles. Lastly, I verified line of sight by ensuring the line segment between the robot and the target does not intersect any obstacles.
           
           **Final Robot Base Positions**
           
           After all that, I feel comfortable with the following coordinates for the robot base:
           
           *   **(-2.0, 0.0)**
           *   **(-1.56, 1.06)**
           *   **(-1.56, -1.06)**
           
           These seem like good, collision-free locations with a clear line of sight to the target and should meet the requirements.

(Thoughts: **Revised Position Strategy for Target (-0.5, 0.0)**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The request for the *same* target point (-0.5, 0.0) again strongly suggests that a previous position failed.  Since I didn't get specific feedback, I'm going to assume there was an unforeseen obstacle or implicit collision in my previous attempts. My priority is to generate new positions.
           
           I know the robot needs to be positioned to the left of the central wall (x = -0.05), and within a range of 2 from the target. My understanding of the scene hasn't changed.
           
           Given these constraints and the need to explore, I'm proposing these three new positions:
           
           1.  **P1 = (-2.4, 0.0):** This places the robot further left along the horizontal axis, exploring a different "viewing angle" than before.  The distance to the target is 1.9, which is within the allowed range. The x-coordinate is -2.4 which is less than -0.05.
           
           2.  **P2 = (-0.5, -1.5):** This is located directly below the target. It's a new approach to the goal. This also meets the distance requirement, with a distance of 1.5. The line of sight is clear, and the x-coordinate is -0.5 which is less than -0.05.
           
           3.  **P3 = (-0.5, 1.5):**  This is positioned directly above the target. Like P2, this allows for a new vantage point. The distance to the target is 1.5. This coordinate satisfies the position constraint since the x-coordinate is -0.5 which is less than -0.05.
           
           These positions are designed to be distinct from previous positions, covering different regions.  I've carefully checked line-of-sight and potential collisions with the obstacles I'm aware of in the environment.  Given the lack of specific failure information, I believe this is the best course of action.
