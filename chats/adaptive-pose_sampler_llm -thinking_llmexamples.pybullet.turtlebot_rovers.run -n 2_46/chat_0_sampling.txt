User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Position Strategy for Target Viewing**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find three safe spots for the robot base to "see" the target point at (0, 0).  The core constraint is that I need to be within a 2-meter radius of the target, and obviously, within the robot's operating bounds of [-2.5, 2.5] in both x and y. No problem there, since the radius 2 is easily within those bounds. The real challenge is avoiding collisions with those AABB obstacles and making sure I have line-of-sight to the target.
           
           I've got a pretty good grasp of the scene: a room defined by the initial AABBs, with a central wall (AABB 5) that's going to be the main headache.  The other AABBs are scattered around, but those close to (0,0) are the ones I need to keep in mind. The crucial bit I've realized is that the target point *itself* is inside the central wall obstacle! That changes everything.  If I'm placing the base point outside that central wall, any line-of-sight would seem to be blocked.
           
           Here's how I'm approaching this: I need to assume that since the target is inside the central obstacle, that obstacle's boundary doesn't block the line-of-sight to the target. It's like the target is *part* of the wall, or located on its surface for visibility.  If it *did* block line-of-sight, this problem would be trivial, and there would be no valid positions.  The point is that I *cannot* be inside that obstacle though.  So, I *must* avoid collision and ensure that my line of sight to (0,0) isn't blocked by the *other* obstacles.
           
           The best strategy, given my interpretation, is to find points:
           
           1.  **Within the 2-meter radius**, so the distance from the robot base to (0, 0) <= 2
           2.  **Outside the central wall**, so that x is not between -0.05 and 0.05.
           3.  **Collision-free** with every obstacle except the central one for line-of-sight purposes to (0,0).
           4.  **LOS is unobstructed** to (0,0) by all obstacles except the one that's containing the target point.
           
           My plan is to choose 3 positions that are as diverse as possible. I want to try one from the right side, positive Y, one from the left, and one in the top-left quadrant for the third. I started by checking a few positions on both sides to avoid LOS blockage.
           
           I've settled on the following:
           
           *   **(1.0, 1.0)** Right side, positive Y.  This should be far enough from obstacles and a good starting place to test from the right.
           *   **(-1.5, 0.0)** Left side. This gives a good variety in positions, and should be clear.
           *   **(-1.0, 1.0)** Left side again, but closer to the top.
           
           I will need to run the final collision and line-of-sight checks against the simulator, but I believe I have the right plan. I want to verify these with obstacle data to ensure that they are valid.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **My analysis of the user's feedback and the target point is as follows:**
           
           I've been given a new request, but the key is the previous feedback was for a different, though similar, target. The new target I'm working with is `(-1.9694, 1.9821)`, which I'll call `T`. The distance limit for my base is 2.  I've received some feedback that previous positions like (1.0, 1.0), (-1.5, 0.0), and (-1.0, 1.0) didn't work. The feedback suggests some of those failed placements, because the line of sight was blocked by a central wall, *and* by a hidden, non-fixed obstacle. The problem implies I may need to learn about how non-fixed obstacles influence the "no line of sight" condition.
           
           I need to get *close* to `T`, to achieve line of sight. From the existing feedback, and considering the geometry of the obstacles, I can determine that:
           
           *   The target point is inside Obstacle 19 and inside Obstacle 8. That may suggest those obstacles are "transparent" for line-of-sight.
           *   The position `(-1.0, 1.0)` is *not* reachable. That's likely non-fixed. The line `(-1.5, 0.0)` to `T` also did not work. That is an issue I have to avoid.
           *   To get line of sight, I need to be close to the target `T`, but avoid the line-of-sight from the user feedback.
           
           I will propose three alternative base positions:
           
           1.  `(-1.97, 0.5)`
           2.  `(-0.5, 1.98)`
           3.  `(-1.97, 2.25)`
           
           I'm confident these points are now more valid, due to my close analysis of obstacles and the feedback.
