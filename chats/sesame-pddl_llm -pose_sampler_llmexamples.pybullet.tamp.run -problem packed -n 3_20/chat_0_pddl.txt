           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 4) -- 0.08794007031088077, 0.0879400703108808)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object is also square, with side length approximately 0.08794. Since the object is square, its orientation (rotation) does not affect its bounding box, so we can consider theta = 0 for simplicity.
           
           To find stable placements, the object's bounding box must be fully contained within the surface's bounding box.
           For surface 0:
           Lower x = -0.135, Upper x = 0.135
           Lower y = -0.135, Upper y = 0.135
           Surface width = 0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27
           Surface height = 0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27
           
           Object width = 0.08794
           Object height = 0.08794
           
           The object is significantly smaller than the surface, so there's plenty of room.
           The center of the object (x_obj, y_obj) with orientation 0 must satisfy:
           -0.135 + (0.08794 / 2) <= x_obj <= 0.135 - (0.08794 / 2)
           -0.135 + (0.08794 / 2) <= y_obj <= 0.135 - (0.08794 / 2)
           
           This means:
           -0.135 + 0.04397 <= x_obj <= 0.135 - 0.04397
           -0.09103 <= x_obj <= 0.09103
           -0.09103 <= y_obj <= 0.09103
           
           I will generate a variety of placements within this range, primarily focusing on (0,0) and then spreading out to the corners and edges. I will use theta = 0 for all placements as the object is square.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with side length approximately 0.085735. Its orientation (rotation) does not affect its bounding box.
           We have a previously placed object (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), with side length 0.08794.
           
           For the new object (ID: 5) to be placed stably, its bounding box must be fully contained within the surface's bounding box and must not collide with object 4.
           Object 5 dimensions: 0.085735 x 0.085735.
           Max x/y for center of object 5:
           -0.135 + (0.085735 / 2) <= x_obj5 <= 0.135 - (0.085735 / 2)
           -0.135 + 0.0428675 <= x_obj5 <= 0.135 - 0.0428675
           -0.0921325 <= x_obj5 <= 0.0921325
           The same applies for y_obj5.
           
           Collision avoidance with Object 4:
           Object 4 is centered at (0,0) and has size 0.08794.
           Its AABB spans from -0.08794/2 to 0.08794/2 in x and y.
           Which is approximately -0.04397 to 0.04397 in x and y.
           
           For Object 5 (size 0.085735) not to collide with Object 4:
           The distance between their centers must be greater than (Object4_half_size + Object5_half_size).
           Object4_half_size = 0.04397
           Object5_half_size = 0.0428675
           Minimum separation for centers along one axis = 0.04397 + 0.0428675 = 0.0868375.
           
           So, for x and y, the center of Object 5 cannot be in the range:
           (-0.0868375, 0.0868375) if placed directly adjacent to object 4 along a single axis.
           More generally, the absolute difference in x coordinates must be greater than 0.0868375 OR the absolute difference in y coordinates must be greater than 0.0868375.
           Since object 4 is at (0,0), this means |x_obj5| >= 0.0868375 OR |y_obj5| >= 0.0868375.
           Combined with the surface bounds:
           -0.0921325 <= x_obj5 <= 0.0921325
           -0.0921325 <= y_obj5 <= 0.0921325
           
           This means that valid positions for the center of object 5 are very close to the boundaries of the allowed region, either near x = 0.0868375, x = -0.0868375, y = 0.0868375, or y = -0.0868375. I will pick positions close to the maximum allowed values.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with side length approximately 0.09272. Its orientation (rotation) does not affect its bounding box.
           
           We have two previously placed objects:
           Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), with side length 0.08794. Its AABB is approximately (-0.04397, -0.04397) to (0.04397, 0.04397).
           Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0), with side length 0.085735. Its AABB is approximately (0.09 - 0.0428675, -0.0428675) to (0.09 + 0.0428675, 0.0428675), which is (0.0471325, -0.0428675) to (0.1328675, 0.0428675).
           
           For the new object (ID: 6) to be placed stably, its bounding box must be fully contained within the surface's bounding box and must not collide with Object 4 or Object 5.
           
           Object 6 dimensions: 0.09272 x 0.09272.
           Half-size of Object 6 = 0.09272 / 2 = 0.04636.
           
           Max x/y for center of object 6, considering surface bounds:
           -0.135 + 0.04636 <= x_obj6 <= 0.135 - 0.04636
           -0.08864 <= x_obj6 <= 0.08864
           The same applies for y_obj6.
           
           Collision avoidance with Object 4 (center (0,0), half-size 0.04397):
           Minimum separation for centers (Obj6 vs Obj4) = 0.04636 + 0.04397 = 0.09033.
           So, for Obj6, |x_obj6| >= 0.09033 OR |y_obj6| >= 0.09033 to avoid Obj4.
           
           Collision avoidance with Object 5 (center (0.09,0), half-size 0.0428675):
           Minimum separation for centers (Obj6 vs Obj5) = 0.04636 + 0.0428675 = 0.0892275.
           So, for Obj6, |x_obj6 - 0.09| >= 0.0892275 OR |y_obj6 - 0.0| >= 0.0892275 to avoid Obj5.
           
           Let's check the constraints:
           Surface bounds for Obj6 center: (-0.08864, 0.08864) in both x and y.
           Collision with Obj4 implies: x_obj6 not in (-0.09033, 0.09033) or y_obj6 not in (-0.09033, 0.09033).
           This means that based on Obj4, there are no available placements within the surface bounds.
           Wait, that is incorrect.
           The *surface bounds* are (-0.08864, 0.08864) for the center.
           The *collision exclusion zone* for Obj4 is (-0.09033, 0.09033).
           This means that the allowed regions for the center of Obj6, considering only Obj4, are x <= -0.09033 or x >= 0.09033 or y <= -0.09033 or y >= 0.09033.
           However, the surface bounds restrict x_obj6 and y_obj6 to the range [-0.08864, 0.08864].
           This implies that no placement is possible for object 6 if it needs to satisfy the *OR* condition for collision avoidance with object 4, because it cannot be outside the range [-0.09033, 0.09033] while being inside [-0.08864, 0.08864].
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition for AABBs.
           Two AABBs, A and B, collide if their x-intervals overlap AND their y-intervals overlap.
           AABB A: [(Ax_min, Ay_min), (Ax_max, Ay_max)]
           AABB B: [(Bx_min, By_min), (Bx_max, By_max)]
           They overlap if (Ax_min < Bx_max and Ax_max > Bx_min) AND (Ay_min < By_max and Ay_max > By_min).
           
           Object 4 AABB:
           x: [-0.04397, 0.04397]
           y: [-0.04397, 0.04397]
           
           Object 5 AABB:
           x: [0.0471325, 0.1328675]
           y: [-0.0428675, 0.0428675]
           
           Object 6 AABB (center (x,y), half-size 0.04636):
           x: [x - 0.04636, x + 0.04636]
           y: [y - 0.04636, y + 0.04636]
           
           Constraints for Obj6 center (x,y):
           1. Surface bounds:
              -0.08864 <= x <= 0.08864
              -0.08864 <= y <= 0.08864
           
           2. No collision with Obj4:
              NOT ((x - 0.04636 < 0.04397 and x + 0.04636 > -0.04397) AND (y - 0.04636 < 0.04397 and y + 0.04636 > -0.04397))
              Simplify terms for x: x < 0.04397 + 0.04636 = 0.09033 AND x > -0.04397 - 0.04636 = -0.09033 => x in (-0.09033, 0.09033)
              Simplify terms for y: y < 0.04397 + 0.04636 = 0.09033 AND y > -0.04397 - 0.04636 = -0.09033 => y in (-0.09033, 0.09033)
              So, Obj6 does not collide with Obj4 if NOT (x in (-0.09033, 0.09033) AND y in (-0.09033, 0.09033)).
              This means x <= -0.09033 OR x >= 0.09033 OR y <= -0.09033 OR y >= 0.09033.
           
              However, the surface bounds require x and y to be within [-0.08864, 0.08864].
              This means that the collision avoidance conditions for Obj4 (x outside [-0.09033, 0.09033] or y outside [-0.09033, 0.09033]) cannot be met if x and y are strictly within the surface bounds.
              This seems to indicate that there is no space for object 6 if object 4 is at the center. The maximum extent for Obj6's center is 0.08864. The minimum required for non-collision with Obj4 along an axis is 0.09033. This means that if Obj4 is at (0,0), Obj6 must overlap it in at least one axis if its center is within the surface.
           
           Let me double check my reasoning about the half-sizes and collision.
           If object A (width WA) and object B (width WB) are centered at xa and xb, they collide if |xa - xb| < (WA/2 + WB/2).
           For Obj6 and Obj4, WA = 0.09272, WB = 0.08794. xa = x_obj6, xb = 0.
           So, collision if |x_obj6| < (0.09272/2 + 0.08794/2) = 0.04636 + 0.04397 = 0.09033.
           So, to avoid collision, |x_obj6| >= 0.09033 OR |y_obj6| >= 0.09033.
           
           The surface limits the center of Obj6 to x, y in [-0.08864, 0.08864].
           Comparing [0.08864] to [0.09033]:
           0.08864 < 0.09033.
           This means that any x or y coordinate for the center of Obj6 that is *within* the surface bounds will *also* be within the collision zone of Obj4 for that axis.
           Therefore, it's impossible for Obj6 to avoid collision with Obj4.
           
           This is a critical finding. If the previous feedback (Obj4 at (0,0) is stable) is accurate, and my calculations are correct, then there is no valid placement for object 6 on surface 0 if object 4 is present.
           
           However, the prompt states "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." This implies I should still provide placements. It could be that my interpretation of "stable" and "collision" in this context has some nuance I am missing, or the collision detection is not strictly AABB-based in a way I expect, or the prompt expects me to try despite theoretical impossibility. It's more likely that the collision check will succeed for *some* placements, even if my theoretical AABB intersection predicts otherwise.
           
           Given the strict geometric constraints, I will try to place Object 6 as far away from Object 4 and Object 5 as possible, even if my current AABB-based logic suggests it's impossible to avoid Obj4. I will pick positions close to the extreme corners or edges, where it is "least overlapping" according to my current model, or where a slight relaxation of the collision model might allow it. I will keep theta = 0 for consistency.
           
           Let's re-examine the collision for Obj5 (center (0.09, 0), half-size 0.0428675).
           Collision if |x_obj6 - 0.09| < (0.04636 + 0.0428675) = 0.0892275.
           AND |y_obj6 - 0.0| < (0.04636 + 0.0428675) = 0.0892275.
           So, Obj6 does not collide with Obj5 if |x_obj6 - 0.09| >= 0.0892275 OR |y_obj6| >= 0.0892275.
           
           This means:
           x_obj6 - 0.09 >= 0.0892275 => x_obj6 >= 0.1792275 (outside surface bounds)
           OR x_obj6 - 0.09 <= -0.0892275 => x_obj6 <= 0.0007725
           
           y_obj6 >= 0.0892275 (outside surface bounds for center of Obj6, max is 0.08864)
           OR y_obj6 <= -0.0892275 (outside surface bounds for center of Obj6, min is -0.08864)
           
           So, to avoid Obj5 along the y-axis, y_obj6 must be outside [-0.0892275, 0.0892275]. But the surface limits y_obj6 to [-0.08864, 0.08864]. So, Obj6 must overlap Obj5 in y if it is on the surface.
           This means for Obj6 to avoid Obj5, we must have x_obj6 <= 0.0007725.
           
           Summary of conditions for Obj6 center (x,y):
           1. Surface bounds: x in [-0.08864, 0.08864], y in [-0.08864, 0.08864].
           2. Avoid Obj4: (x <= -0.09033 OR x >= 0.09033) OR (y <= -0.09033 OR y >= 0.09033).
              This cannot be satisfied for x or y alone, as the max allowed for x or y by surface is 0.08864. So any placement within the surface bounds will satisfy `x in (-0.09033, 0.09033)` AND `y in (-0.09033, 0.09033)`, which means it will collide with Obj4.
           3. Avoid Obj5: (x <= 0.0007725) OR (|y| >= 0.0892275).
              The y part of this condition cannot be met because max |y| is 0.08864.
              So, to avoid Obj5, x must be <= 0.0007725.
           
           Combined collision conditions for Obj6 to NOT collide with both Obj4 and Obj5, based on my strict AABB model:
           ( x <= -0.09033 OR x >= 0.09033 OR y <= -0.09033 OR y >= 0.09033 ) AND ( x <= 0.0007725 )
           
           The first part says that at least one of x or y must be "far away" from zero. But the second part says x must be "close to or less than 0".
           If x is close to 0 (e.g., x=0), then to avoid Obj4, y must be far away. But y cannot be far away (max 0.08864).
           If x is negative and far from 0 (e.g. x = -0.088), then this could satisfy the Obj4 condition x <= -0.09033 if I push it to the limit. But it's 0.088, not 0.09033.
           
           This implies no such placement exists. I must provide 50 placements. I will generate them assuming a slightly different collision model, or perhaps with the understanding that collision detection at the edges is imprecise, or that my half-size calculations have slight precision errors that prevent finding a solution. I will try to place it in the most "empty" corners. For example, the quadrant (negative x, negative y) or (negative x, positive y) is currently less populated than the positive x side.
           
           Given the theoretical impossibility by strict AABB, I will try placing the object at the valid extreme positions within the surface boundaries that are "furthest" from the existing objects, or in the quadrants that have less existing objects.
           The quadrant x < 0, y < 0 is currently empty.
           The quadrant x < 0, y > 0 is also empty.
           The maximum valid center coordinates are around x,y = +/-0.088.
           I will place Obj6 at the edges and corners of the surface, particularly in the negative x half of the surface.
