(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is essentially a square with a side length of approximately 0.076, on a square surface defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A stable placement means the square is fully within the surface's boundaries, no matter the rotation.
           
           Since we are dealing with a square, its bounding box size is key to determining stability. For an object rotated by an angle θ, the bounding box changes size.  I've figured out that the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of a square will have the same size (s x s) if it's aligned with the square’s local frame.
           Therefore, my strategy will be to place the object in the surface with a spread of both angle and position.
           
           I will iterate 10 different angles, from 0 to 2*pi, generating a diverse set of orientations. In other words,  I'll start with the object oriented in a square with the edge parallel to the axes, then rotate it 10 evenly-spaced times.
           
           For each of these angles, I will also have 5 distinct locations, also evenly-spaced. This should give me a good variety of different placements.
           
           The code generates the list of object locations, which are of the form: `<surf_idx_1>, <theta_1, <x_1>, <y_1>`.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to place object ID 7 in the scene, and it needs to *not* collide with object ID 4, which is already placed. Object 4 is a square at the bottom-left corner. Surface 0 is a square, and I need to generate 50 valid placements for object 7 on this surface.
           
           I'll start by generating a set of candidate placements by rotating object 7 in 10 steps from 0 to pi (or 0 to 2pi/10, where all rotations are unique), then performing 5 linear sampling passes on both the x and y axes. This generates 250 candidate placements.
           
           For each candidate, I'll calculate the *effective* size of object 7, considering its current rotation angle. The rotation will determine the shape's minimum bounding rectangle. This `s_eff` will be computed as the side length of object 7 multiplying by (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))). Then, I’ll take half of that length to be able to calculate the AABB.
           
           After that, I'll need to calculate the *actual* AABB for object 7. I’ll make a grid of sampling points, calculate an AABB for those points, and test if those AABBs overlap. I will test for collision in both the x and y directions.
           
           Then I’ll reject any placement where the *AABB* of object 7 overlaps with the *AABB* of object 4. Object 4 is located at `(-0.097, -0.097)` with a side of `0.075`.
           
           My plan is to iterate through this process and only return stable and collision-free locations. Finally, I’ll limit this list to the first 50 stable placements. I will not have any guarantee of how spread-out these placements are, but I’ll use diverse angles.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 5) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects: ID 4 and ID 7.  The surface is relatively small, so this is a bit of a spatial puzzle!
           
           First, I need to account for the object's orientation.  I generate ten different angles for ID 5, from 0 to 2π radians. For each angle, I calculate its effective side length (the side length of its AABB) using its actual size and the absolute values of the sine and cosine of the angle.  This is a crucial step to correctly determine the area the object occupies, irrespective of rotation. Then, I determine the valid placement region (in x and y) on surface 0 considering the object's effective size. This is a bit tricky, I have to ensure the center of the object isn't too close to the edge of the surface, or the rotation will make it overlap, which I need to avoid.
           
           Within the valid placement region, I create a 10x10 grid of potential center positions. For each potential placement (angle + center position), I calculate the AABB of the rotated object. Then, I check for overlap between the object's AABB and the AABB's of objects 4 and 7. The check is a simple bounding box check; if no overlap, it goes on the list. 
           
           The collision check requires careful consideration because the AABBs of existing objects are already computed. If there is no overlap, the placement is valid.
           After testing for overlaps, I iterate and store up to 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Placement Plan for Object ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable, non-colliding placements for object 6, a square with a side of approximately 0.087, on surface 0, which is a square region spanning (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I need to factor in the already-placed objects: object 4 at (-0.097, -0.097), object 7 at (0, 0), and object 5 at (-0.051, 0.086).  Each object will need its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) determined to avoid collisions.
           
           The strategy is as follows. First, for each angle from 0 to 2*pi in increments, I will check several positions for object 6, each position represented by (x, y).  Because object 6 can be rotated, I'll need to account for each orientation.  For each rotation `theta`, I'll calculate the *effective* side-length of the object's enclosing AABB. Then I'll iterate through this list to confirm valid placements.
           
           To generate the candidates, I need to define the valid *x* and *y* ranges. These are the surface's boundary, minus the effective half-size of the object in that rotation. I will also generate 10 by 10 points within this valid region and then check for collisions using the calculated AABBs.
           
           The collision check is fundamental: I need to test if the calculated AABB for *any* candidate location overlaps with any existing object's AABB.  This is a quick interval intersection test.  If a potential placement doesn't overlap with any existing AABB, it is within the surface bounds, and can be added to the output.
           
           After checking for all 250 (10 x 10 x 10 rotations) placements, I’ll have a set of safe candidates. My algorithm will iterate through the placement candidates and pick the first 50 unique collision-free placements.
