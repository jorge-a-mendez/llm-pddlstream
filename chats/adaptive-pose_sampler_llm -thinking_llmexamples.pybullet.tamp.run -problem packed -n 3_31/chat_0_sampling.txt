(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Stable Object on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I've got this object, ID 5, and it's practically a square with dimensions around 0.088 units. I need to find 50 stable placements for it on a single surface, surface 0, which is also a square, centered at (0,0) and with a side of 0.27 units. Stability means the object has to fit entirely within the surface boundaries. Right now, I'm ignoring collisions with other objects since this is the first one.
           
           My strategy is to rotate the object through a range of angles and, for each angle, generate a few diverse positions for the object's center. I'll define a placement as (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate of the center, y-coordinate of the center).
           
           I'll start by pre-calculating the bounding box dimensions. Given an object rotated by `theta`, the half-width and half-height of its bounding box are influenced by `cos(theta)` and `sin(theta)`. Since the object is nearly square, calculating those values is pretty straightforward. I'm taking the surface boundaries and subtracting the rotated object's bounding box to determine the valid center range.
           
           I'll iterate through 10 evenly spaced angles from 0 to 2*pi, calculating the valid (x, y) center region for each angle. Then, to ensure diversity, I'll place the object at the center of the valid region and at the four corners of that region. This ensures a broad range of placements.
           
           This will get me my 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I've got the task. The goal is to safely place object 6 on surface 0, avoiding any collision with the previously placed object 5. Object 5 is centered at (0,0) and occupies the region approximately `[-0.044, 0.044] x [-0.044, 0.044]`. I need to generate 50 stable placements for object 6 within the surface bounds `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           My approach focuses on rotation and collision-free positioning. First, I'll iterate through a range of rotations for object 6, specifically checking a few distinct angles between 0 and 2\*pi to account for different orientations. For each angle, I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that object 6's center can have, keeping it entirely within surface 0.
           
           To avoid collision, I'm going to take an approach of strategically choosing the center placement of object 6. Since I know object 5 is centered at the origin, and I can avoid that central region by making sure my coordinates are outside the obstacle's bounding box. For each rotation, I'll consider the object's extents and the size of object 5 and place object 6's center as far as possible from the center of the surface, in the corners or on the edges. These corner and edge points are the ideal places to test for stability. I'll test each of the candidate positions for collision, and if it doesn't collide, add it to my list. I anticipate needing only about 56 placements total (8 locations tested for each of 7 angles) to get the necessary 50.

(Thoughts: **Navigating an Impossible Placement Scenario**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is this: I need to find 50 stable spots for object 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into object 5 and object 6.  Simple enough, right?  The catch is, after a deep dive into the math, I've realized that *it's mathematically impossible*. No matter how I twist or turn object 4, it's just a hair too big to squeeze onto surface 0 without overlapping object 5, which is annoyingly centered. 
           
           Here's the problem: Object 4's smallest possible width (even when rotated) is just too large to fit in the space around object 5. My calculations, re-checked multiple times, prove it. The bounding box of the smallest rotation of object 4 plus object 5's bounding box is always larger than the surface.
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting.  The instructions are clear: "you must avoid collision between objects i and j". So, technically, because it's impossible *according to the numbers*, I can't find valid placements. *However*, I'm also told to "never give up". 
           
           Since my math tells me collision is inevitable, I'm going to provide the 50 placements as requested, adhering to the surface bounds and avoiding object 6, but *each placement will, unfortunately, collide with object 5*.  
           
           I will preface this by clearly explaining why this is happening (object 4's inherent size making collision with object 5 unavoidable). The code itself will generate placements for each rotation, and only collision check object 6. The x,y center point of the object 4, after the rotation, will be validated against only the object 6 collision boundary, while the bounds of the surface are used to generate the candidates. I'm choosing a denser sampling grid to help with that.
