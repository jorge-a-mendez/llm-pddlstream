           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           I've been tasked with finding a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. After breaking down the axiom, I see I need to satisfy several sub-goals: getting images (from rovers *v12* and *v14*) and analyses of samples. My initial thought is to analyze the initial state and figure out how to satisfy these. The first four conditions in the goal are already true in the initial state. The remaining focus on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           To get `receivedimage`, I'd normally use `send_image`, which requires `take_image`, and `take_image` needs `calibrate`. To get analyses, I'd need `send_analysis`, which requires `sample_rock`. However, looking at the *allowed* actions, I only have `move` and `drop_rock`. Crucially, there are no actions to calibrate, take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses.
           
           I initially assumed I could use any action *defined* in the domain, but the problem explicitly states that I'm limited to the action instances in the provided list. This is a severe constraint. The initial state gives me that `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12,v16)`, `free(v14,v16)` and I have all the com and image visiblity.
           The 'move' action is effectively a no-op, moving the rovers to the same config, and `drop_rock` is impossible to execute in the starting conditions. 
           
           Therefore, given the constraint on the available actions, it's immediately clear that I can't achieve `new-axiom@0()`. There is no way to send or receive images or perform analysis with the available actions.
           The goal remains unreachable.
