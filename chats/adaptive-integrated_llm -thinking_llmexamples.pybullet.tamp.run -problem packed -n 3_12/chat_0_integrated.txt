User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.221, -0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.519, 0.855).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.269, -0.301), (-0.174, -0.207)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.12, 0.266, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.825, 0.566).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.091, -0.232, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.654, 0.756).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.052, -0.271), (0.131, -0.192)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.165, 0.22), (-0.075, 0.311)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)

           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)

           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16.  This translates directly to achieving the `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` predicates.  Currently, v8, v12, and v14 are resting on v11, supported by it, according to the initial state. I've got two robot arms, but the key issue here is the available actions.
           
           To make this happen, I'd *ideally* need to pick each object from its current location (v9, v13, v15, respectively), and then *place* them on v16 at a pose (#o2) that's supported. The initial state does provide supporting predicates for `#o2` on `v16`. But, here's the kicker: the only allowed action instance I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  No pick, no place.
           
           Without pick and place, I'm effectively stuck. The entire goal hinges on altering the `atpose` predicate of these objects.  I could analyze the poses and the AABBs and all that, which I did, to confirm that placement on the surface v16 could be achieved if it *were* possible. But it's all academic.
           
           I have to adhere to the given list of allowed actions. The problem explicitly states that any action not in that list is off-limits.  Since pick and place are not in the list, then the goal can't be reached. I've verified the required *conditions* for those actions to work, and, I even worked out the details about poses and placements, but it's moot. I am constrained by the limited action set. Therefore, this goal is *unachievable* within the provided action instance constraints.
