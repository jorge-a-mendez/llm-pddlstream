User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.165, 0.22), (-0.075, 0.311)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.269, -0.301), (-0.174, -0.207)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.12, 0.266, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.825, 0.566).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.052, -0.271), (0.131, -0.192)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.221, -0.254, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.519, 0.855).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.091, -0.232, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.654, 0.756).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto v16.**
           
           The objective is straightforward: get these three objects onto the surface of v16.  I've analyzed the initial state and the provided axioms, and it seems the approach involves picking each object from its initial pose and placing it onto v16. The key constraint is that the base of the robot remains fixed at configuration v3, and the arm is v4.
           
           Since `on(o,r)` is defined as `supported(o, p, r)` and `atpose(o, p)`,  I need to identify poses for each object on v16 where they are supported and then move the objects to those poses.  I'm provided `supported` relations indicating that v8, v12, and v14 can be supported by v16 using a shared symbolic pose, `#o2`. I interpret this as "somewhere on v16".  This simplification means I do not need to generate a new symbolic name for each object; all can use `#o2`.
           
           The robot has two arms but only `v4` has the required kinesthetic properties given.   The plan is to pick and place sequentially using `v4` because there's no movement of the base and all actions are performed from position `v3`.
           
           The initial plan:
           
           1.  **Pick:**  Take `v14` from its starting position at `v15`.
           2.  **Place:** Move `v14` to a pose on `v16`.
           3.  **Pick:**  Take `v12` from its starting position at `v13`.
           4.  **Place:** Move `v12` to a pose on `v16`.
           5.  **Pick:**  Take `v8` from its starting position at `v9`.
           6.  **Place:** Move `v8` to a pose on `v16`.
           
           The critical part is choosing where on v16 to place the objects.  I used the given AABB information to ensure each object's placement is collision-free and fully contained within the square surface of v16.  I've defined a stacking arrangement that is centered on the X-axis of v16.  Objects are stacked vertically along the Y-axis.
           
           The placements I've chosen are all centered at X=0, with Z=0.781 (the height of the initial poses).
           
           -   `v14` will be placed on v16 at position `(0.0, -0.088, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           -   `v12` will be placed on v16 at position `(0.0, -0.0015, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           -   `v8` will be placed on v16 at position `(0.0, 0.0835, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           
           This ensures that they all remain within v16's boundaries.
           
           I've carefully considered the safety requirements based on the prompt, specifically about `unsafe...` conditions. Given that none of the unsafe predicates are explicitly *true* in the initial state, I'm proceeding under the assumption that they are *false*. This is crucial for planning valid pick and place actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unattainability**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the provided plan, and it's a non-starter. The key issue is the constraint on valid actions. I was trying to use `pick` and `place` operations, which are clearly necessary to reach the goal state of having objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. However, the only "valid action instance" I was given is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's just a movement action—specifically, a move *from* and *to* the same location, which is essentially a no-op trajectory.
           
           The setup is straightforward:  `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently on `v11`, and I need to get them all onto `v16`. Simple enough *conceptually*, but fundamentally impossible given the available toolset. I need to be able to *manipulate* the objects. I need `pick` and `place` instances, and those simply don't exist in the provided constraint.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the problem is *unsolvable*. The robot's capability is limited to moving its base within a single location; it has *no* means to interact with the environment to achieve the target state. I need a more complete set of actions to even begin to consider a viable plan.
