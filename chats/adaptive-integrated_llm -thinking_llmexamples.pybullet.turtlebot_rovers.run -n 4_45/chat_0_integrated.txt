           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **PDDL Planning Attempt: Unreachable Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a complex statement requiring several preconditions.  I've carefully analyzed the initial state and the necessary actions, focusing on the key sub-goals: achieving `receivedimage` for various objectives and `receivedanalysis` for stone and soil.  My analysis of the initial state shows that key preconditions for taking, sending images and analysis and that these actions cannot be executed.  The rovers can't use the configuration requirements.
           
           The critical issue is the rovers' inability to move. The only permitted "move" actions are essentially no-ops, keeping them fixed at their initial configurations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15).  This severely restricts the applicability of actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, and `sample_rock`. These actions require the rover to be *at* certain configurations (`#oX`) which are different than the initial positions, namely `v13` and `v15`.
           
           The initial state defines that the images are visible at configurations `#oX`, where `#oX` represents the numerical configurations which cannot be reached by the available actions. There are no initial state predicates that say images are visible at their locations to the rovers.
           
           I've checked the preconditions for `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. All rely on the `atconf` predicate being true for some configuration. Without the ability to change the `atconf` state via movement, these actions will fail. 
           
           The strict interpretation of the PDDL rules, particularly "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*" makes this conclusion inevitable. Because the initial state does not say that it is possible, or that the rovers can be at the configurations required for them to act, the goal is unreachable.
