(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) of size (0.08674950732107456, 0.0867495073210745) on surface 0, defined by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The object is an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB).  To be stable, the object's AABB must be fully within the surface's AABB.  Since the object is effectively a square (obj_w and obj_h are equal), the rotation doesn't change its bounding box.  Therefore, I'll fix the rotation (theta) at 0 for most placements.
           
           The surface 0 has a width and height of 0.27. The valid x and y range for the object's center is [-0.09162524633946272, 0.09162524633946272], with each containing a length of 0.18325049267892544.  I will construct a grid of points within this valid range. I generate x_coords and y_coords, 7 values of each. I then use these to generate the (x,y) coordinates. The grid would yield 49 placements, therefore I will add an extra one to generate 50 distinct placements.
           
           For the placements, I will create a 7x7 grid to ensure the required number of placements and will add `(surf_idx, theta, x, y) = (0, PI/2, 0, 0)` as the 50th placement.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, and now I need to figure out where to put object 5 without them bumping into each other. I've calculated the bounding box (AABB) of object 4, which is in the bottom-left corner. Object 5 is almost square, so the AABB is also almost a square.  I've done the initial placement and calculations for where Object 5 can go using the math and parameters.
           
           First, I need to define the surface bounds of object 5. So, I will create a grid of potential placement locations, basically covering the whole surface area.  Then, I need to check each potential placement in this grid to make sure its AABB does not overlap with the AABB of object 4. I will need to iterate through the whole space in order to calculate this.
           
           I've generated the placement grid using those calculation and calculations.
           
           I then check each placement for potential collision.  Those which do not collide will be selected. I will use the placement with theta=0 for these. To be safe, I also selected theta=PI/2 for the remaining slots. This should give me a good distribution of placements, and they can be checked to ensure no AABB overlaps. This is my plan.
           
           For the placements, I generated 7x7 grid for both the x and y coordinates. This results in 49 positions. For this method, I can filter the locations which intersect object 4. Since 9 of those have an overlap, I selected the remaining 40 to move onto the next step.
           
           For the next 10, the theta would need to be PI/2, and I selected another set of points based on the constraints.
           
           Using the bounding box calculations I can select the required locations to complete the required 50. The calculations would have provided me with a placement list of 50 possible locations for this particular object and surface space.

(Thoughts: **Thoughts on Generating Safe Placements for Object 6**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 6) on a surface, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (ID: 4 and ID: 5). This is a familiar problem, and I'll approach it systematically.
           
           **1. Understanding the Scene:**
           *   **Geometry:** I've got the surface dimensions and the object's square-like shape (with extents `s6_x` and `s6_y`), giving me its half-extents (`h6_x`, `h6_y`).
           *   **Collision Zones:** I have the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the previous objects, essential for preventing overlaps. Object 4's AABB is `[-0.135, -0.048] x [-0.135, -0.048]`, and object 5's is `[-0.135, -0.058] x [-0.038, 0.038]`.
           
           **2. Placement Strategy:**
           *   **Valid Region:**  I'll first define the general region where I can safely place the object, considering its size.
           *   **Collision Checks:** I need to check for overlaps with existing objects for different rotations. I'll need to use code to test quickly.
           
           **3. Implementation:**
           *   **AABB Calculation:**  I've defined functions to calculate the AABB of object 6, given its center (`x`, `y`) and rotation angle (`theta`). This is critical for collision testing.
           *   **Collision Detection:**  I have a function that checks for AABB overlap. This will be the workhorse for validating placements.
           *   **Grid and Check:** I'll create a grid of potential locations and check each one for collisions. I'll initially try a 7x7 grid and iterate over a list of angles (0, pi/2, pi, etc.). If I don't get enough placements, I'll try a finer grid (10x10) for the main angles.
           *   **Optimizing the Process:** By first using the most restrictive placement method for theta, and then checking it against other angle rotations, I can optimize the speed of the check.
           
           **4. Code-Based Analysis:**
           *   I've coded the logic and run it, starting with a 7x7 grid for theta=0 and pi/2. I needed to refine the AABB based on the object dimension.
           *   I carefully analyzed the python code to find the proper coordinates. I also ensured that I did not generate duplicate coordinates.
           *   It looks like the collision function (which compares the AABBs) is working, and the valid positions are being generated. I'll try generating 50 with these parameters.
           
           **Output:**  The list of valid surface placements for object 6 will be generated and printed.
