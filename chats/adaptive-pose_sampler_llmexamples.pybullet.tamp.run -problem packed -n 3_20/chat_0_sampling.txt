           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object is also square, with side lengths of approximately 0.08.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface.
           For surface 0:
           Lower x-bound: -0.135
           Upper x-bound: 0.135
           Lower y-bound: -0.135
           Upper y-bound: 0.135
           
           Object dimensions:
           size_x = 0.08005536558541787
           size_y = 0.08005536558541793
           
           Since the object is square-like, its effective size will be the maximum of size_x and size_y, which is roughly 0.08.
           When placed at an angle theta, the half-width and half-height of the object's AABB will be:
           half_width_rotated = 0.5 * (size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y * abs(sin(theta)))
           half_height_rotated = 0.5 * (size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + size_y * abs(cos(theta)))
           
           For theta = 0 or pi/2, the half-dimensions are approximately 0.04.
           The surface's half-width and half-height are 0.135.
           So, the maximum x-coordinate for the center is 0.135 - 0.04 = 0.095.
           The minimum x-coordinate for the center is -0.135 + 0.04 = -0.095.
           Similarly for y.
           
           This gives a large range of possible placements. I will generate a diverse set of placements, varying both position and orientation. I will try to place the object near the center, and also near the edges and corners, with different rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           I have successfully placed object 6 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 6 is centered on surface 0 with no rotation.
           
           Now I need to place object 5.
           Object 5 dimensions:
           size_x = 0.0860810872392746
           size_y = 0.08608108723927455
           
           Object 5 is also square-like, with side lengths of approximately 0.086.
           
           Constraint: Object 5 must not collide with Object 6.
           Object 6 is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with dimensions (0.080055, 0.080055).
           Its AABB for collision checking (when aligned with axes) extends from -0.04002768 to 0.04002768 in x and y.
           
           For object 5, its half-dimensions are approximately 0.086 / 2 = 0.043.
           The maximum x-coordinate for the center of object 5, when placed without rotation, would be 0.135 - 0.043 = 0.092.
           The minimum x-coordinate for the center would be -0.135 + 0.043 = -0.092.
           
           To avoid collision with object 6 (which occupies approximately x from -0.04 to 0.04 and y from -0.04 to 0.04), object 5's AABB cannot overlap with object 6's AABB.
           If object 5 is placed without rotation, its AABB extends from (x - 0.043, y - 0.043) to (x + 0.043, y + 0.043).
           To avoid collision with object 6, the center (x, y) of object 5 must satisfy:
           abs(x) > 0.04002768 + 0.043 = 0.08302768
           OR
           abs(y) > 0.04002768 + 0.043 = 0.08302768
           
           So, I need to choose x and y such that they are outside the central region defined by object 6.
           I will try to place object 5 near the corners or edges, away from the center. I can also try rotations. When rotated by pi/4, the effective half-width of object 5 would be roughly `0.5 * (0.086 * sqrt(2))` which is `0.5 * 0.1216 = 0.0608`. This means the maximum x or y coordinate for the center would be 0.135 - 0.0608 = 0.0742. This greatly restricts the available space. Therefore, unrotated placements are more likely to succeed.
           
           Let's try placing it near the corners/edges, with some margin. I'll aim for coordinates like +/- 0.09 or so.

           Known placements of objects:
           Object 6 (ID: 6) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with dimensions (0.080055, 0.080055).
           Its AABB extends from -0.04002768 to 0.04002768 in x and y.
           
           Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) with dimensions (0.086081, 0.086081).
           Its AABB (unrotated) extends from (0.09 - 0.0430405) to (0.09 + 0.0430405) in x, i.e., from 0.0469595 to 0.1330405.
           And from -0.0430405 to 0.0430405 in y.
           
           Now I need to place object 4.
           Object 4 dimensions:
           size_x = 0.09590518687791189
           size_y = 0.09590518687791194
           
           Object 4 is also square-like, with side lengths of approximately 0.0959.
           Its half-dimensions are approximately 0.0959 / 2 = 0.04795.
           
           Constraints: Object 4 must not collide with Object 6 or Object 5, and must be within surface 0.
           
           Surface bounds: x from -0.135 to 0.135, y from -0.135 to 0.135.
           For object 4 (unrotated), its AABB needs to be within:
           x: [-0.135 + 0.04795, 0.135 - 0.04795] = [-0.08705, 0.08705]
           y: [-0.135 + 0.04795, 0.135 - 0.04795] = [-0.08705, 0.08705]
           
           Collision check:
           Object 6: AABB x: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
           Object 5: AABB x: [0.0469595, 0.1330405], y: [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
           
           Let's consider possible placement regions for object 4 (unrotated):
           1. To the left of object 6: need x_center + 0.04795 < -0.04002768 => x_center < -0.08797768
              Maximum x for center is -0.08705. This means there is no space to the left of object 6 *if* object 4 is placed unrotated and if we consider only horizontal separation.
              Wait, -0.08705 (surface bound) vs -0.08797 (collision bound). This means the surface boundary cuts off the valid collision-free region. So, strictly to the left of object 6 is not possible if `abs(x_center) + half_size > abs(obj6_x_min)`. No, it's `x_center - half_size > obj6_x_max` or `x_center + half_size < obj6_x_min`.
              For object 4, if x_center < -0.08797768 (which would be -0.08705), then x_max for obj4 would be -0.08797768 + 0.04795 = -0.04002768, which barely touches obj6.
              No, the minimum x for obj4 to be clear of obj6 is x_center - 0.04795 > 0.04002768, so x_center > 0.08797768.
              And to the left: x_center + 0.04795 < -0.04002768, so x_center < -0.08797768.
           
              The available x range for object 4's center, if unrotated, is [-0.08705, 0.08705].
              The available y range for object 4's center, if unrotated, is [-0.08705, 0.08705].
           
              Collision regions:
              Object 6: x: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
              Object 5: x: [0.0469595, 0.1330405], y: [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
           
              So if object 4 is unrotated, its center x cannot be in:
              [0.04002768 - 0.04795, 0.04002768 + 0.04795] = [-0.00792232, 0.08797768] (due to object 6)
              [0.0469595 - 0.04795, 0.1330405 - 0.04795] which is roughly [-0.00099, 0.08509] (due to object 5). More precisely, for object 5 collision avoidance:
              obj4_x_max < obj5_x_min => x + 0.04795 < 0.0469595 => x < -0.0009905
              obj4_x_min > obj5_x_max => x - 0.04795 > 0.1330405 => x > 0.1809905 (this is outside surface)
           
              Let's check the y-axis overlap for object 5 as well:
              obj5_y_min: -0.0430405, obj5_y_max: 0.0430405
              obj4_y_range for collision with obj5: [-0.0430405 - 0.04795, 0.0430405 + 0.04795] = [-0.0909905, 0.0909905]
           
           Combined forbidden regions for center (unrotated object 4):
           X-forbidden regions:
             From Object 6: [-0.00792232, 0.08797768]
             From Object 5 (if y overlaps): The region where obj4 AABB intersects with obj5 AABB.
               For horizontal separation: x_center must be less than -0.0009905 OR greater than 0.1809905.
               If x_center is in range [-0.08705, 0.08705], then x_center has to be < -0.0009905.
               However, if x_center is in [-0.0009905, 0.08705], it might still collide if y values overlap.
           
           This suggests that for object 4 (which is slightly larger than the previous objects), space is very tight, especially near the center.
           Let's analyze the y-axis for potential placements.
           Y-forbidden regions:
             From Object 6: [-0.00792232, 0.08797768]
             From Object 5: [-0.0909905, 0.0909905]
           
           This is getting complicated. Let's think about clear zones.
           The left edge of Object 6 is at x = -0.04002768.
           The right edge of Object 6 is at x = 0.04002768.
           The left edge of Object 5 is at x = 0.0469595.
           The right edge of Object 5 is at x = 0.1330405.
           
           So, the space on the surface is occupied in x by:
           [-0.04002768, 0.04002768] (Obj 6)
           [0.0469595, 0.1330405] (Obj 5)
           
           This means the central x region [-0.04, 0.04] is mostly blocked, and the x region [0.047, 0.133] is blocked.
           The area between 0.04 and 0.047 is very narrow.
           
           Let's try placing object 4 unrotated.
           It needs to be entirely contained within [-0.08705, 0.08705] in x and y.
           
           We can try placing it in the negative x region, i.e., to the left of object 6.
           x_center must be less than -0.04002768 - 0.04795 = -0.08797768.
           The maximum x_center for the surface is -0.08705.
           This means there is no horizontal space to the left of object 6 for object 4 when unrotated and aligned along the x-axis.
           
           What about vertically?
           Below object 6: y_center < -0.04002768 - 0.04795 = -0.08797768.
           Maximum y_center for surface is -0.08705. Again, no clear space directly below object 6.
           Above object 6: y_center > 0.04002768 + 0.04795 = 0.08797768.
           Minimum y_center for surface is 0.08705. Again, no clear space directly above object 6.
           
           This is very tight. Let me re-check calculations carefully.
           Surface half-side = 0.135
           Obj4 half-side = 0.04795
           Max allowed center coord = 0.135 - 0.04795 = 0.08705
           
           Obj6 half-side = 0.04002768
           Obj5 half-side = 0.0430405
           
           Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
           Obj5 AABB: x in [0.09 - 0.0430405, 0.09 + 0.0430405] = [0.0469595, 0.1330405]
                      y in [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
           
           For Obj4 at (x_c, y_c) with rotation 0:
           Obj4 AABB: x in [x_c - 0.04795, x_c + 0.04795], y in [y_c - 0.04795, y_c + 0.04795]
           
           Collision conditions with Obj6:
             abs(x_c) < 0.04002768 + 0.04795 AND abs(y_c) < 0.04002768 + 0.04795
             abs(x_c) < 0.08797768 AND abs(y_c) < 0.08797768
           Collision conditions with Obj5:
             abs(x_c - 0.09) < 0.0430405 + 0.04795 AND abs(y_c) < 0.0430405 + 0.04795
             abs(x_c - 0.09) < 0.0909905 AND abs(y_c) < 0.0909905
           
           Now consider regions where Obj4 can be placed:
           Max |x_c| = 0.08705, Max |y_c| = 0.08705
           
           If we try to place Obj4 far left (negative x):
           x_c = -0.08705
             Obj4 AABB: x in [-0.08705 - 0.04795, -0.08705 + 0.04795] = [-0.135, -0.0391]
             This range barely avoids collision with Obj6's left edge (x=-0.04002768). So, if x_c = -0.08705, and y_c is far away from Obj6/Obj5, it could work.
             For y_c = 0.08705 (top edge):
               Obj4 AABB: y in [0.08705 - 0.04795, 0.08705 + 0.04795] = [0.0391, 0.135]
               This AABB (x in [-0.135, -0.0391], y in [0.0391, 0.135])
               Does not overlap x-range of Obj6 or Obj5.
               Does not overlap y-range of Obj6 or Obj5.
               This seems like a valid placement! (0, 0.0, -0.08705, 0.08705)
           
           Let's try to find more corners:
           1. Top-left corner: x_c = -0.08705, y_c = 0.08705
           2. Bottom-left corner: x_c = -0.08705, y_c = -0.08705
              Obj4 AABB: x in [-0.135, -0.0391], y in [-0.135, -0.0391]
              This also avoids collision.
           3. Top edge, away from objects: x_c = 0.0, y_c = 0.08705
              Obj4 AABB: x in [-0.04795, 0.04795], y in [0.0391, 0.135]
              This collides with Obj6 in x, but only if y also overlaps.
              Y range of Obj6 is [-0.04002768, 0.04002768].
              Y range of Obj4 is [0.0391, 0.135]. These y ranges do not overlap. So no collision with Obj6.
              Y range of Obj5 is [-0.0430405, 0.0430405].
              Y range of Obj4 is [0.0391, 0.135]. These y ranges do not overlap. So no collision with Obj5.
              This seems valid: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08705)
           
           Let's verify the "no collision" reasoning. Two AABBs [x1, x2]x[y1, y2] and [x3, x4]x[y3, y4] do not collide if x2 < x3 OR x1 > x4 OR y2 < y3 OR y1 > y4.
           So for (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08705):
           Obj4 AABB: x: [-0.04795, 0.04795], y: [0.0391, 0.135]
           Obj6 AABB: x: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
             y2 (0.135) > y3 (-0.04002768) is true. Wait, that means they *could* collide in y. No, I meant that y_min_obj4 > y_max_obj6.
             y1 = 0.0391, y2 = 0.135
             y3 = -0.04002768, y4 = 0.04002768
             Condition for no Y-overlap: y2 < y3 OR y1 > y4.
             0.135 < -0.04002768 (false)
             0.0391 > 0.04002768 (false)
             Therefore, there IS Y-overlap between Obj4 and Obj6.
             Since there is also X-overlap between Obj4's [-0.04795, 0.04795] and Obj6's [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], it will collide.
           
           My collision check was flawed. The condition for no collision is simpler:
           `max(x1, x3) < min(x2, x4)` OR `max(y1, y3) < min(y2, y4)`. No, that's not quite right.
           No collision if `x2 < x3` (obj1 right of obj2) OR `x1 > x4` (obj1 left of obj2) OR `y2 < y3` (obj1 above obj2) OR `y1 > y4` (obj1 below obj2).
           
           Let's re-evaluate (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08705):
           Obj4 AABB: x: [-0.04795, 0.04795], y: [0.0391, 0.135]
           Obj6 AABB: x: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y: [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
             X-overlap: max(-0.04795, -0.04002768) = -0.04002768. min(0.04795, 0.04002768) = 0.04002768. -0.04002768 < 0.04002768. So they overlap in X.
             Y-overlap: max(0.0391, -0.04002768) = 0.0391. min(0.135, 0.04002768) = 0.04002768. 0.0391 < 0.04002768. So they overlap in Y.
             Conclusion: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08705) would collide with Obj6.
           
           My available space for Obj4 is severely limited.
           Since Obj4 is wider than Obj6 and Obj5 combined (almost), I'll need to place it far from them.
           The "corners" were promising:
           1. Top-left corner: x_c = -0.08705, y_c = 0.08705
              Obj4 AABB: x in [-0.135, -0.0391], y in [0.0391, 0.135]
              Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
                No X-overlap: -0.0391 < -0.04002768. TRUE. So no collision with Obj6.
              Obj5 AABB: x in [0.0469595, 0.1330405], y in [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
                No X-overlap: -0.0391 < 0.0469595. TRUE. So no collision with Obj5.
              This placement (0, 0.0, -0.08705, 0.08705) is indeed valid!
           
           2. Bottom-left corner: x_c = -0.08705, y_c = -0.08705
              Obj4 AABB: x in [-0.135, -0.0391], y in [-0.135, -0.0391]
              Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
                No X-overlap: -0.0391 < -0.04002768. TRUE. So no collision with Obj6.
                No Y-overlap: -0.0391 < -0.04002768. TRUE. So no collision with Obj6.
              Obj5 AABB: x in [0.0469595, 0.1330405], y in [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
                No X-overlap: -0.0391 < 0.0469595. TRUE. So no collision with Obj5.
                No Y-overlap: -0.135 < -0.0430405. TRUE. So no collision with Obj5.
              This placement (0, 0.0, -0.08705, -0.08705) is valid!
           
           What about rotating Obj4?
           If Obj4 is rotated by pi/4, its effective half-side becomes `0.5 * (0.0959 * sqrt(2))` = `0.5 * 0.1356` = 0.0678.
           Max allowed center coord: 0.135 - 0.0678 = 0.0672.
           This is much smaller, making it even harder to avoid collisions.
           For example, (0, pi/4, 0, 0) for Obj4:
           Obj4 AABB: x in [-0.0678, 0.0678], y in [-0.0678, 0.0678]
           Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
             X overlap: -0.04002768 < 0.04002768. True.
             Y overlap: -0.04002768 < 0.04002768. True.
             Collides with Obj6.
           
           So, unrotated placements in the "left" quadrants seem to be the only viable options.
           I will generate placements close to these valid corners.
           I need to be very careful with the collision boundaries.
           Let's consider the region `x_c < -0.08797768` for x-separation from Obj6. My `x_c = -0.08705` (surface bound) is actually slightly larger than this, meaning Obj4's right edge `x_c + 0.04795` will be ` -0.08705 + 0.04795 = -0.0391`. This is *to the right* of ` -0.04002768` (Obj6's left edge), meaning they *do* overlap in X.
           
           Oh, this is critical. `Obj4_x_max (-0.0391)` vs `Obj6_x_min (-0.04002768)`.
           No X-overlap condition `Obj4_x_max < Obj6_x_min` is `-0.0391 < -0.04002768`, which is FALSE.
           So (0, 0.0, -0.08705, 0.08705) actually collides with Obj6!
           This means there is no space on this surface for an unrotated object 4.
           
           Let's re-evaluate all available space.
           Surface 0: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135]
           
           Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
           Obj5 AABB: x in [0.0469595, 0.1330405], y in [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
           
           Obj4 half-size_x (unrotated) = 0.04795
           Obj4 half-size_y (unrotated) = 0.04795
           
           Let's try to find gaps:
           1. Try the region `x < -0.04002768`.
              For Obj4 to be fully to the left of Obj6: x_c + 0.04795 <= -0.04002768 => x_c <= -0.08797768
              But the maximum x_c allowed by the surface is -0.135 + 0.04795 = -0.08705.
              Since -0.08705 > -0.08797768, this means no value of x_c will keep Obj4 entirely to the left of Obj6 and still be on the surface.
              So no pure horizontal separation to the left of Obj6.
           
           2. Try the region `x > 0.04002768`.
              For Obj4 to be fully to the right of Obj6: x_c - 0.04795 >= 0.04002768 => x_c >= 0.08797768
              Maximum x_c by surface is 0.08705.
              Since 0.08705 < 0.08797768, no value of x_c will keep Obj4 entirely to the right of Obj6 and still be on the surface.
              No pure horizontal separation to the right of Obj6. This also means no pure horizontal separation to the left or right of Obj5, as Obj5 extends further right.
           
           3. Try the region `y < -0.04002768`.
              For Obj4 to be fully below Obj6: y_c + 0.04795 <= -0.04002768 => y_c <= -0.08797768
              Maximum y_c allowed by surface is -0.08705.
              No pure vertical separation below Obj6.
           
           4. Try the region `y > 0.04002768`.
              For Obj4 to be fully above Obj6: y_c - 0.04795 >= 0.04002768 => y_c >= 0.08797768
              Maximum y_c allowed by surface is 0.08705.
              No pure vertical separation above Obj6.
           
           This analysis means that any placement of Obj4 must overlap in *either* x *or* y with both Obj6 and Obj5, and rely on the other dimension for separation.
           
           Let's reconsider the case of `y_c = 0.08705` (top edge).
           Obj4 AABB: x in [x_c - 0.04795, x_c + 0.04795], y in [0.0391, 0.135]
           Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
           Obj5 AABB: x in [0.0469595, 0.1330405], y in [-0.0430405, 0.0430405]
           
           No collision with Obj6 (y-axis): Obj4_y_min (0.0391) > Obj6_y_max (0.04002768). This condition is FALSE (0.0391 is not greater than 0.04002768).
           This means there *is* Y-overlap for Obj4's top-edge placements with Obj6's Y-range! This is true for any y_c > 0.04002768 - 0.04795 = -0.00792232.
           So for any placement of Obj4, its y-range will overlap with Obj6's y-range.
           This means for Obj4 to avoid Obj6, its x-range must be completely separated.
           So either x_c + 0.04795 < -0.04002768 (x_c < -0.08797768) OR x_c - 0.04795 > 0.04002768 (x_c > 0.08797768).
           As calculated, neither of these ranges for x_c is available due to surface bounds.
           This means an unrotated object 4 cannot be placed on the surface without colliding with object 6.
           
           This is a very strong conclusion. Let me check my math again.
           Surface Max X_center for Obj4 = 0.135 - 0.04795 = 0.08705.
           Surface Min X_center for Obj4 = -0.135 + 0.04795 = -0.08705.
           Surface Max Y_center for Obj4 = 0.08705.
           Surface Min Y_center for Obj4 = -0.08705.
           
           Obj6's X-range = [-0.04002768, 0.04002768].
           Obj6's Y-range = [-0.04002768, 0.04002768].
           
           For Obj4 to NOT collide with Obj6 (unrotated):
           (abs(x_c) >= 0.04002768 + 0.04795) OR (abs(y_c) >= 0.04002768 + 0.04795)
           (abs(x_c) >= 0.08797768) OR (abs(y_c) >= 0.08797768)
           
           But, the maximum possible value for abs(x_c) or abs(y_c) is 0.08705 (due to surface bounds).
           Since 0.08705 < 0.08797768, neither of these conditions can be met.
           This means an unrotated object 4 *will always* collide with object 6.
           
           This implies that object 4 *must* be rotated.
           If object 4 is rotated by pi/4 (or 3pi/4, etc.), its effective half-side is:
           half_size_rotated = 0.5 * (0.095905 * sqrt(2)) = 0.5 * 0.1356499 = 0.06782495.
           Max allowed center coord for rotated Obj4 = 0.135 - 0.06782495 = 0.06717505.
           Min allowed center coord for rotated Obj4 = -0.06717505.
           
           So, the placement region for Obj4 is now x in [-0.06717505, 0.06717505] and y in [-0.06717505, 0.06717505].
           This region is much smaller, and more likely to collide.
           
           Collision check for rotated Obj4 with Obj6:
           Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768], y in [-0.04002768, 0.04002768]
           Obj4 AABB (rotated): x in [x_c - 0.06782495, x_c + 0.06782495], y in [y_c - 0.06782495, y_c + 0.06782495]
           
           For Obj4 (rotated) to NOT collide with Obj6:
           (abs(x_c) >= 0.04002768 + 0.06782495) OR (abs(y_c) >= 0.04002768 + 0.06782495)
           (abs(x_c) >= 0.10785263) OR (abs(y_c) >= 0.10785263)
           
           But the maximum possible abs(x_c) or abs(y_c) is 0.06717505.
           Since 0.06717505 < 0.10785263, neither condition can be met.
           This implies that a rotated object 4 *will always* collide with object 6.
           
           This is a surprising and strong conclusion. This means given the current setup of Obj6 and Obj5, and the size of Obj4, it is impossible to place Obj4 on surface 0 without colliding with Obj6.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. Perhaps my analysis of the collision between the previous objects is slightly off, or the problem setter expects me to try and fail before finding such a conclusion. Or perhaps there is a small sliver of space I am missing, or my AABB collision check is too conservative for a slightly non-square object.
           
           Let me re-check the definition of collision. It's about AABBs.
           Object 6: 0.08005536558541787, 0.08005536558541793 -> half size 0.04002768
           Object 5: 0.0860810872392746, 0.08608108723927455 -> half size 0.04304054
           Object 4: 0.09590518687791189, 0.09590518687791194 -> half size 0.04795259
           
           Placement of Obj6: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
           Obj6 AABB: x_c +- 0.04002768, y_c +- 0.04002768
           
           Placement of Obj5: (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)
           Obj5 AABB: x_c +- 0.04304054, y_c +- 0.04304054
              x-range: [0.09 - 0.04304054, 0.09 + 0.04304054] = [0.04695946, 0.13304054]
              y-range: [-0.04304054, 0.04304054]
           
           Placement of Obj4: (x_c, y_c)
           Obj4 (unrotated) AABB: x in [x_c - 0.04795259, x_c + 0.04795259], y in [y_c - 0.04795259, y_c + 0.04795259]
           Surface bounds for Obj4:
             x_c in [-0.135 + 0.04795259, 0.135 - 0.04795259] = [-0.08704741, 0.08704741]
             y_c in [-0.08704741, 0.08704741]
           
           Collision check for Obj4 with Obj6:
           No collision if:
             (x_c + 0.04795259 < -0.04002768) OR (x_c - 0.04795259 > 0.04002768) OR
             (y_c + 0.04795259 < -0.04002768) OR (y_c - 0.04795259 > 0.04002768)
           
           Simplifying for x_c:
             x_c < -0.08798027 (left of Obj6) OR x_c > 0.08798027 (right of Obj6)
           For y_c:
             y_c < -0.08798027 (below Obj6) OR y_c > 0.08798027 (above Obj6)
           
           Possible x_c on surface: [-0.08704741, 0.08704741]. None of these satisfy `x_c < -0.08798027` or `x_c > 0.08798027`.
           Possible y_c on surface: [-0.08704741, 0.08704741]. None of these satisfy `y_c < -0.08798027` or `y_c > 0.08798027`.
           
           Since all of these must be False for a collision to happen, it means that for any unrotated placement of Obj4 on the surface, it will overlap in both X and Y with Obj6's collision range. Hence, it will collide with Obj6.
           
           If Obj4 is rotated by PI/4:
           Its effective half-width/height is max(0.04795259 * abs(cos(theta)) + 0.04795259 * abs(sin(theta))) when (theta = pi/4 or 3pi/4)
           = 0.04795259 * sqrt(2) = 0.06782495.
           Surface bounds for rotated Obj4 center:
             x_c in [-0.135 + 0.06782495, 0.135 - 0.06782495] = [-0.06717505, 0.06717505]
             y_c in [-0.06717505, 0.06717505]
           
           Collision check for Obj4 (rotated) with Obj6:
           No collision if:
             (x_c + 0.06782495 < -0.04002768) OR (x_c - 0.06782495 > 0.04002768) OR
             (y_c + 0.06782495 < -0.04002768) OR (y_c - 0.06782495 > 0.04002768)
           
           Simplifying for x_c:
             x_c < -0.10785263 OR x_c > 0.10785263
           For y_c:
             y_c < -0.10785263 OR y_c > 0.10785263
           
           Possible x_c on surface: [-0.06717505, 0.06717505]. None of these satisfy the conditions.
           Possible y_c on surface: [-0.06717505, 0.06717505]. None of these satisfy the conditions.
           Therefore, a rotated object 4 *will also always* collide with object 6.
           
           My mathematical reasoning consistently leads to the conclusion that no stable placement for object 4 is possible given the current fixed objects. This is unexpected, as the problem implies that I should always be able to find a placement.
           
           Could it be that the collision check only applies to objects that have already been placed in the scene as "fixed obstacles" (e.g. from a previous feedback)? Or that the "fixed obstacles" are implicit and the feedback about collisions with "non-fixed obstacles" tells me about other objects?
           The prompt says: "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." and "when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           This means I must avoid collision with previously placed objects (6 and 5).
           
           Perhaps the collision check for previous objects is not an AABB vs AABB check for rotation angles. For now, I will assume the conservative AABB for any rotation.
           Maybe I should assume an approximation where small overlaps are allowed or that there is a small tolerance.
           
           Since I *must* return 50 placements, I will generate some placements, even though my math tells me they should collide. I'll prioritize positions that are furthest away from the existing objects, or try rotations that may minimize the effective AABB overlap.
           
           The least overlapping positions would be the ones that push against the surface bounds in the direction opposite to the existing objects.
           Obj6 is at (0,0). Obj5 is at (0.09,0).
           So, try to go to (-0.08, 0), (0, -0.08), (-0.08, -0.08), (0, 0.08), etc.
           As established, for unrotated, max abs(x_c) is 0.08704741.
           For rotated by pi/4, max abs(x_c) is 0.06717505.
           
           Let me retry positions that try to maximize distance from Obj6 and Obj5.
           For example, x_c = -0.06, y_c = -0.06 for Obj4 (rotated pi/4).
           Obj4 AABB will be: x in [-0.06 - 0.0678, -0.06 + 0.0678] = [-0.1278, 0.0078]
                             y in [-0.06 - 0.0678, -0.06 + 0.0678] = [-0.1278, 0.0078]
           Obj6 AABB: x in [-0.04, 0.04], y in [-0.04, 0.04]
           X-overlap: max(-0.1278, -0.04) = -0.04. min(0.0078, 0.04) = 0.0078. -0.04 < 0.0078. Overlap in X.
           Y-overlap: max(-0.1278, -0.04) = -0.04. min(0.0078, 0.04) = 0.0078. -0.04 < 0.0078. Overlap in Y.
           This would collide.
           
           The problem states "find a stable placement". If no placement exists, this is a contradiction.
           Perhaps the fixed obstacles are *only* the AABB of the original object, and not the combined AABB.
           Or perhaps "stable placement" means within the surface bounds and not necessarily non-colliding with non-fixed obstacles. But the rule "avoid collision between objects i and j" suggests that collision avoidance with previously placed objects is paramount.
           
           Let's assume there *is* a tiny margin somewhere. I will try the placements that were "almost" valid based on my previous, slightly incorrect collision reasoning. It might be due to floating point precision or a slight margin in the system.
           
           I will try to place at the extreme corners of the surface, with minimal and maximal rotation.
           I'll also try a central location with a variety of rotations in case my AABB collision is too conservative (e.g., if the objects are circles or rounded squares, they might just touch without AABB overlap). The objects are explicitly described by their AABB extents.
           
           Since my analysis points to no solution, I will provide placements that attempt to maximize distance from the existing objects, or place them very close to the edge of the surface. I will use 0.08 for max abs(x_c, y_c) for unrotated, and 0.06 for max abs(x_c, y_c) for pi/4 rotated. These are the largest possible values that fit on the surface without any object interaction.
           
           Given the tight constraints, I will try extreme valid (according to surface bounds) positions and rotations.
