User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.042, 0.316), (0.055, 0.414)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.044, -0.288), (0.053, -0.191)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.268, -0.38), (-0.169, -0.281)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.087, -0.396, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.64, 0.768).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.177, 0.22), (-0.088, 0.309)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.007, 0.365, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.885, -0.466).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.005, -0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.878, 0.479).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.128, -0.437), (-0.046, -0.355)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.331, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.933, 0.361).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.133, 0.265, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.581, 0.814).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Objects on Surface v20**
           
           My objective is to precisely position five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto surface v20.  Currently, these objects are supported by v11, with those already in pose #o2 supported by v20 or v10.  The plan involves a series of pick-and-place operations using arm v4, which will move objects from their initial poses on v11 to defined, collision-free locations on v20.  The robot base v3 remains fixed.
           
           The core challenge is identifying suitable, collision-free positions for each object on the limited surface area of v20.  The coordinates are:
           -   v18: (-0.09, 0.09, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v12: (0.0, 0.09, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v14: (0.09, 0.09, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v16: (-0.09, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           A grid-like formation of 5 poses, with the centers of the object AABBs offset from the v20's center by approximately the object dimensions to ensure collision-free placement. These positions are within the confines of v20's AABB.  The height is fixed at z=0.781, aligning with the pose coordinate system.
           
           The movement plan includes a "no-op" `move_base` action and a sequence of ten actions (five pick-place pairs), and the continuous values for each object on surface v20 are detailed above. This plan is designed for maximum efficiency in achieving the object arrangement on surface v20.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list:

(Thoughts: **A Grim Assessment of the Current Situation**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a bit of a constraint. Apparently, those `pick` and `place` actions I was planning on using? Not on the approved list.  The *only* action I'm allowed to perform is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  Frankly, that's not going to get me anywhere.
           
           The task is crystal clear: get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from surface v11 to surface v20.  Simple enough in principle, but the toolset I've got is woefully inadequate.  Without the ability to manipulate objects directly – no picking or placing – this is an impossible task.  I'm essentially a fancy paperweight.  My analysis indicates, quite definitively, that the goal state is unreachable within the parameters I've been given. Time to tell them that this isn't going to work.
