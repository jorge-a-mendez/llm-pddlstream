           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.331, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.933, 0.361).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Achieving the Goal with Given Constraints**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to position objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 onto surface v20, effectively satisfying the predicates `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`.  To achieve this, I need to understand how the `on` predicate is defined within this particular planning domain.
           
           The `on` predicate is derived from two other predicates: `supported(o, p, r)` and `atpose(o, p)`.  This means an object `o` is considered "on" a surface `r` if it is supported at a pose `p` on that surface, and that object is currently at that pose `p`.  In the current initial state, all the target objects are supported on surface v11, but the goal is for them to be on surface v20.
           
           To move these objects, I would need to modify their `atpose` values.  Specifically, I would need to find a suitable pose `p` for each object such that `supported(o, p, v20)` is true, and then move each object to that pose.  The actions that are designed to do this involve picking the object from the current pose and then placing it on the desired surface.
           
           However, I've encountered a crucial constraint: the available action instances list only contains the `move_base` action.  This action only alters the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) and does not modify the positions of any objects.
           
           The instruction explicitly states that only actions present in the given list are permitted for use in the plan. Since no `pick` or `place` action instances are provided, I am unable to change the `atpose` of any object. Therefore, without the ability to pick and place objects, it is fundamentally impossible to alter their positions to satisfy the desired `on` predicates.
           
           Given this restriction, I must conclude that the provided goal is unattainable within the confines of the permitted actions.
