User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Placement Strategy for Target Point**
           
           My objective is to generate 25 feasible base positions for a robot, given a target point (2.13, 0.3). These positions need to be within a 4-unit radius of the target and confined to a rectangular area defined by x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Crucially, I must avoid collisions with known fixed obstacles and ensure a clear line-of-sight to the target, understanding that I'll need to learn about any non-fixed obstacles through iterative feedback.
           
           The environment is a square room, with a central vertical wall at x = 0 dividing it. This wall presents a significant constraint, as ideally, the robot should be on the same side of the room as the target (right side, x > 0). The detailed map of fixed obstacles, represented as AABBs, will be used to generate clear positions. The room's outer boundaries are defined by a larger AABB spanning the full playing area.  The central dividing wall (AABB 5) at x=0 effectively halves the space. Additional AABBs further subdivide the right side of the room, requiring careful avoidance and line-of-sight analysis. The critical fixed obstacles in proximity to the target on the right are at coordinates 7, 9, 13, 14, 17, 20, and 22, so those should be analyzed for placement.
           
           The strategy involves finding a valid search space for the robot base by considering the target point and its corresponding maximum range. The robot's position needs to be within `x: [0.05, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`, which covers all possible valid placements. Next, to generate robot base locations, I first generate points surrounding the target at varying distances (radii of 0.7, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 units) and angles. Then, these points undergo careful filtering. The filtering is broken down into distance and collision checks, then into line-of-sight checks with heuristics: positions are avoided if a collision occurs.
           
           The analysis led to the following 25 feasible positions:
           
           ```
           (2.4, 0.3), (2.4, 1.0), (2.4, -1.0), (2.4, 2.0), (2.4, -2.0), (2.3, 0.0), (2.3, 0.5), (2.3, -0.5), (2.0, 2.4), (2.0, -2.4), (2.2, 0.8), (2.0, 1.0), (2.2, -0.5), (1.5, 1.0), (1.5, 1.5), (1.5, -0.5), (1.0, 1.0), (1.0, -1.0), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -0.5), (0.1, 1.0), (0.1, -1.0), (0.5, 1.5), (0.5, -1.5), (1.8, 1.5)
           ```
           These positions are designed to comply with boundary conditions, remain within the required distance from the target, and avoid all fixed obstacles as thoroughly as possible. After careful review, these should provide the requested set of valid robot base positions.
