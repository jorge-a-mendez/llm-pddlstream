           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Initial Assessment and Plan Development:**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I've been given a complex goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to achieving a series of specific facts, primarily centered around taking images of objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) and analyzing rock and soil samples. The initial state is defined, and importantly, I'm limited to a specific *list of valid action instances*. That list is crucial.
           
           First, I broke down the goal into manageable subgoals: get three images (`receivedimage`), analyze a rock of type `v2`, and analyze soil of type `v6`. I've also noted that the initial state already satisfies the 'atconf' predicates for the two rovers (`v12` and `v14`) at positions `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the fact that both stores are initially `free`.
           
           Next, I delved into how to achieve those subgoals. To get the images, I have to *use* `send_image`, but that action has a few preconditions. Similarly, I identified the preconditions for *using* `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. These preconditions create a hierarchy of steps: I have to *get* `haveimage` before I can *send* it, and I need to *analyze* a rock before sending it.
           
           The available actions seem to be about *moving* and *dropping* rocks from storage. Rover `v12` seems to be closer to soil type `v7` while `v14` will be closer to `v18`. These are good starting points.
           
           Here's where things get interesting. I've to *allocate tasks and order actions*. The prompt states that to satisfy `receivedimage` I can `calibrate` then `take_image` using a specific camera mode before `send_image`. This gives me the sequence: calibrate, take_image, send_image. The challenge, it seems, lies in getting past these preconditions. For the samples, it is sample_rock and then send_analysis.
           
           **Identifying the Bottleneck (and the Problem!):**
           
           It all looks straightforward, but I then noticed the catch: *The ONLY available actions are 'move' and 'drop_rock'*. All the actions *I need* to perform -- `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `calibrate` -- are *not* on that list of allowed actions. They aren't in the list of valid action instances.
           
           This is a serious roadblock. Those actions are the *only* ones that can set the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to true. The rovers are *stuck* at their starting positions, unable to take images or analyze samples. Also, the rovers cannot do anything about `drop_rock` because the stores are free!
           
           **Conclusion: The Plan is Unreachable**
           
           The key problem is that the *allowed* actions do not let me achieve the *goal*. Given the *limited* action instances, those subgoals cannot be satisfied. Thus, `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable from the initial state using only the listed action instances. I'm stuck, and the plan is doomed!
