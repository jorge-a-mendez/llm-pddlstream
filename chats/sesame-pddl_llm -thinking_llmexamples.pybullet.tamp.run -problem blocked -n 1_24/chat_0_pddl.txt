           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's the plan I've come up with to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` (placing a green object of a specific type on `v18`)**.
           
           First, it's clear that I need to determine which object qualifies as green and of the specified type.  I see that both `v8` and `v12` meet the type requirement (`type(v17)`). My analysis shows I can achieve the 'on' predicate by placing either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.  Since `v8` is initially supported by something else, let's start with getting that object in the right place. The state tells me the pose `#o2` is crucial, given it is already supported by the desired location, `v18`, so I'll target that pose.
           
           I've decided to proceed with `v8`. The initial state reveals the robot arm `v4` can grasp `v8`. The plan: Pick `v8`, place it at the correct pose.
           
           **Here's the detailed plan:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must move the robot base from its initial configuration (`v3`) to a suitable base configuration (`#o3`).  The necessary `move_base` action is available.  This action is needed to provide `v4`'s arm a proper base to execute actions.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Now that my base is in the correct position, I'll then use the `pick` action to pick `v8` from its initial pose (`v9`). This requires that the arm be empty and ready. After this action, the arm will hold the object.
           
           3.  **Place:** Finally, use the `place` action to put `v8` on the correct location (`#o2`). This action will place the grasped object. Then I can verify my goal state is attained by the rules. The `on` and `type` axioms should then be satisfied.
           
           I've reviewed the preconditions for each action to confirm they are satisfied by the initial state and previous actions, which confirms the sequence is feasible. I also confirmed assumptions about the "unsafe" predicates are valid because there's no reason to believe they should be `true`. This solution is acceptable, given that the plan's feasibility has been proven.
