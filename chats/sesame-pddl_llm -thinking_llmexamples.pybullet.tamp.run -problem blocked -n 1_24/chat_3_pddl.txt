(Thoughts: **My Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in `pr2-tamp`**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* another object.  Specifically, it wants to have *green* (which I'll call `v12`) on `v18`.  `v12` is also initially supported by `v14`
           
           First, I need to figure out how to get `v12` on `v18`.  Looking at the initial state and the `on` axiom, the key is to have `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` be true. I already know that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true in the initial state so I think the final pose is `#o2` so I should plan around that.
           
           Given the available actions, I can move `v12` using a `pick` and a `place` sequence.  I see `v12` is initially at pose `v13` so my plan requires these steps
           
           1.  **Move the base.**  I need the robot base to be configured so that it can reach `v12` and then `v18`, it is currently at `v3` and requires base configuration `#o3` for pick and place. So, I start with `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           2.  **Pick `v12` from its current pose.**  I then plan to use the arm `v4` to pick `v12` at pose `v13` with grasp `#o1`, using configuration `#o3` and trajectory `#o4`. I need to ensure that the robot is currently in configuration `#o3`.  This is `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           3.  **Place `v12` on `v18`.**  After picking, I'll use the same arm, grasp, base config, and arm traj, to place `v12` to `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           I've checked the preconditions for each action, particularly the base configuration and the `kin` and `atpose` facts.  I'm making the assumption that the `unsafe` predicates (like `unsafeapproach`) are false, since they don't appear to be set to true in the initial state.  If that is incorrect, then I will need to refine my plan.
           
           After the `place` action, `v12` will be `atpose(#o2)` and since the predicate `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is already true, the goal will be achieved.  The initial state also indicates that `v12` is of the correct type, therefore, `new-axiom@0()` should be satisfied.  I think this will work.
