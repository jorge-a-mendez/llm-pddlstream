           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've got a handle on this. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions. My initial assessment is that the simpler conditions regarding the rovers' initial configurations and the availability of storage are already satisfied. However, achieving the core elements – obtaining images (`receivedimage`) and performing analyses (`receivedanalysis`) – presents a significant hurdle.
           
           Specifically, to realize these image-related goals, I'd need to employ the `send_image` and `take_image` actions, and to run analysis, I'd need the `send_analysis` and `sample_rock` actions.  These actions have prerequisites of their own, like `calibrate` to enable `take_image`.
           
           The current set of actions I am allowed to use is critically limited: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, `((drop_rock v14 v16))`. These only address rover movement to their current positions and rock dropping.
           
           I've carefully examined the problem definition, and the restricted action set clearly indicates that achieving the image-related goals and analysis is impossible. I can't construct a plan that includes `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` because I am *explicitly forbidden* from using any action not in the predefined list.
           
           I've verified my approach several times and confirmed that the goal is unattainable.
