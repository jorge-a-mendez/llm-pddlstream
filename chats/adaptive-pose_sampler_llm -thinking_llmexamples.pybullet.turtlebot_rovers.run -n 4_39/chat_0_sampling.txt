User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Final Robot Base Positions and Justification**
           
           Okay, here's what I've concluded. My primary objective is to find three safe and optimal base positions for the robot, all within a maximum distance of 2 units from the target point at (-1.6033, -0.6625), while also ensuring clear line-of-sight and avoiding collisions with the given fixed obstacles and environment limits. I will ensure all chosen positions have `x < -0.05` to avoid occlusions by the vertical wall at `x=0`.
           
           After carefully analyzing the target point's location and the surrounding obstacles, I've identified the following positions:
           
           1.  **P1: (-2.0, -0.6625)** - This position is directly to the left of the target. I selected this spot to get as close to the target as possible, and it also avoids the occluding obstacle 14 ((-0.25, -0.68), (-0.15, -0.58)) directly to the right. The x-coordinate constraint of x < -0.05 is also satisfied here. This position will enable the robot to face the target head-on.
           
           2.  **P2: (-2.1033, 0.3375)** - Located further to the left and slightly above the target. I chose this position to provide a different viewing angle, potentially offering a better perspective for target acquisition or avoiding any blind spots. The offset is to ensure all x-range < -0.05 for clear line of sight, and this y-coordinate position is clear from surrounding obstacles.
           
           3.  **P3: (-2.1033, -1.0)** - Located to the bottom-left of the target. This provides a complementary perspective to P2 and also helps to avoid obstacles in the y-range of obstacle 6. The position `(-2.1033, -1.0)` will fulfill the range constraint and the vertical wall constraint too.
           
           **Rationale:**
           
           My approach focused on the following principles:
           
           *   **Proximity:** Ensuring each base position is within the required 2-unit range of the target.
           *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** Meticulously checking for collisions with each obstacle, particularly those close to the target, to ensure unobstructed line-of-sight. The x-position and vertical wall constraint are key considerations.
           *   **Environmental Constraints:** Verifying that all base positions remain within the environment's boundaries (x: \[-2.5, 2.5], y: \[-2.5, 2.5]).
           *   **Diverse Vantage Points:** Choosing positions that provide varied perspectives on the target, enabling the robot to navigate and achieve its goal effectively.
           
           I have validated all three positions against all the constraints and obstacles. They should all be valid and produce no collisions.
