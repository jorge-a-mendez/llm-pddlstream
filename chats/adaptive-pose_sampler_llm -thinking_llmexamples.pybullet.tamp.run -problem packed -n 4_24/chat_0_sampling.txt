(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions `0.07375 x 0.07375` on Surface 0, which is a square surface defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Given the object's near-square shape, I'm employing a strategic approach to ensure even coverage and maximal stability.
           
           The object's dimensions dictate its "effective" size on the surface after rotation. Since the dimensions are essentially equal, the rotated bounding box is approximately `max(obj_w, obj_h)`, and rotating by 45 degrees significantly reduces the valid placement region. Therefore, to maximize placements, I'll focus on rotations of `0` and `pi/2` radians (90 degrees).
           
           To ensure stability, I have calculated the valid range for the object's center `(x, y)` based on rotation angle.  For rotations of 0 and pi/2, the usable range for x and y is approximately [-0.098, 0.098]. I'm going to create a 5x5 grid (25 placements) using these ranges for the center of the bounding box. This will provide a fine distribution in valid areas.
           
           To do this, I will use:
           
           `x_coordinates = [-0.09, -0.045, 0, 0.045, 0.09]`
           `y_coordinates = [-0.09, -0.045, 0, 0.045, 0.09]`
           
           This generates 5 * 5 = 25 placements at `theta=0` degrees, which yields an upright orientation. The x and y values from the list above will be used. Then, I will rotate the same grid by 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), which provides the same distribution in the valid area.
           
           This will generate 25 more placements for a total of 50. All these values are well within the surface constraints, providing a suitable range. The values will generate a dense placement pattern with even coverage.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object 4 on surface 0, and I need to come up with 50 stable, collision-free placements. Object 4 is pretty close to a square with side length L4 = 0.072. Surface 0 is a rectangle, and I'm aware of a successful placement for another object, object 5, which helps me deduce constraints.
           
           Object 5 was placed at (-0.09, -0.09) with dimensions (0.07375, 0.07375), and I'm using that placement as a reference.
           
           My initial thought is that the available region is `[-0.09899, 0.09899]` for the x and y coordinates of object 4's center.
           
           Since I have dimensions for object 5 and the knowledge of its successful placement, I can calculate its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and determine the region it occupies, roughly x in `[-0.1268, -0.0531]` and y in `[-0.1268, -0.0531]`. My goal is to prevent any overlap between this "forbidden" area and object 4's AABB. I know I have a range of `(-0.017, 0.0989]` for both x and y.
           
           To avoid a collision, I must keep object 4's center outside this critical region. With this, I am establishing a region of `x >= -0.017` and `y >= -0.017` as valid. The region of invalid placement would be `[-0.0989, -0.0171] x [-0.0989, -0.0171]`
           
           I'll use a grid of points within the valid space to test potential placements. Because I need 50, and rotations 0, and pi/2 are my options, I need to come up with many x and y combinations. I will use the set `[-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` for both x and y coordinates.
           
           I am aware there is a collision region of interest. After careful consideration, I have found that the problem area for x and y coordinates can be represented as coordinates in `[-0.0989, -0.0171] x [-0.0989, -0.0171]`. I created an exclusion zone for the center coordinates `(x, y)` to avoid overlapping the object in the region of interest with object 5, thereby minimizing the chance of an undesirable placement. This should be a robust plan.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with placing object 7 (a near-square with dimension `L7 = 0.0734`) on surface 0, given that surface dimensions are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I've got to avoid collisions with objects 5 (placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09)`) and 4 (placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0)`) which are also nearly square.  Object 7 needs to have 50 stable positions.
           
           First, let's nail down object 7's valid placement region. Its center,  `(x7, y7)`, needs to be within `[-0.098, 0.098]` for both the x and y axes, to avoid it going over the surface edge.  Then I have to consider the collisions.
           
           Object 5 has an AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of approximately  `[-0.126, -0.053]` for both x and y. So, I need to make sure `x7` isn't within `[-0.163, -0.016]` and same for `y7`.
           
           Object 4 has an AABB around `[-0.126, -0.054]` for x and approximately `[-0.036, 0.036]` for y.  `x7` cannot be in `[-0.162, -0.017]` and `y7` cannot be in `[-0.072, 0.072]`.
           
           I'll define a grid-based approach. Since I am given the placement locations of O5 and O4, so I will define a candidate list of center points for O7 that are within the valid surface and avoid collision:
           The Grid is defined in range x `[-0.09, 0.09]` and y `[-0.09, 0.09]` with a step of 0.03.
           
           I've determined collisions will occur at `(-0.09, -0.09)`, `(-0.06, -0.09)`, and `(-0.03, -0.09)`.
           After considering surface bounds and collision avoidance, I determined a total of 31 possible combinations of (x, y).
           
           I've checked the collision condition for O5 and O4 using the Grid List. This provides me the exact list of locations, considering rotation `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2` for each point:
           I'm confident I can achieve 31 placements with zero rotation, then top it off with 19 placements with pi/2 rotation.
           This meets the requirement of total 50.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object, ID 6, on the surface, making sure it doesn't bump into anything already there.  The object is basically a square, with dimensions very close to 0.082. I'll use 0.082 and its half extents are therefore 0.041. I'm focusing on two orientations: 0 degrees and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians).
           
           The surface itself is a nice square, from -0.135 to 0.135 on both x and y. Given the object's size, that means the center of Object 6 needs to be within a slightly smaller square, from -0.0942 to 0.0942.
           
           Now, the important part: avoiding collisions. I've got three objects already placed: 5, 4, and 7. I need to calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to determine the "forbidden zones" where Object 6 can't go.  I've gone through the process of calculating the AABBs for each, and then, for each of the pre-existing objects, expanding their AABB to represent the forbidden area for the center of Object 6. For Object 5, it's a specific forbidden zone. Similarly, Object 4's forbidden zone is a region, and Object 7's.  I can define the region.
           
           I've got the ranges of x and y for each of the forbidden regions, but now, I need to translate this into some viable placement locations. Using some of my grid-based strategies, I have chosen 0.03 as the grid step, for points x = [-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09] and y = [-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]. After checking each grid point to see if it collides with one of the pre-placed objects, it turns out that the x coordinates -0.09, -0.06 and -0.03 are entirely blocked by the existing objects.
           
           So, I have valid (x,y) locations, and then I place it in an organized fashion in the code. I found that I can generate 28 placements using theta = 0, and then I will generate another 22 placements with theta = pi/2, to make up the 50 desired locations. I will systematically generate 50 valid coordinates for these placements!
