(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface. Both are centered at the origin. The surface has sides of length 0.27, and the object has sides of length 0.0984.  To ensure the placements are stable and contained, the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) after rotation must stay within the surface's bounds.
           
           Since the object is square, its bounding box size changes with rotation. I calculate this based on the rotated angle.  The maximum extent (bounding box side) occurs at 45 degrees, and the minimum extent occurs at 0 degrees.
           
           For the placement strategy, I'll use 5 different angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2 radians.  For each angle, I calculate the maximum allowable x and y coordinates, then I generate a grid of positions within that range. I use a 4x4 grid for the 0-degree angle to get more placements for that direction, and 3x3 grids for the others, which gives me a total of 52 placements, and I only need 50. I should be able to place the object without any collisions. The Python code can generate the list of placements with the following format: (surf_idx, theta, x, y)

(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Strategy for Object 8 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, Object 8, that I need to place 50 times on Surface 0. This surface is pretty straightforward: it's a rectangle, specifically defined by the bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 8 itself is almost a perfect square, which simplifies some things. Its extents are approximately 0.0945 x 0.0945.
           
           The challenge is Object 4, which is already placed. It's sitting in the bottom-left of the surface, roughly at (-0.0858, -0.0858), and its AABB extents are about 0.0984 x 0.0984. Object 4’s AABB goes from roughly -0.135 to -0.0366 in both X and Y. My task is to avoid any collision between Object 8 and Object 4.
           
           I'm thinking about rotations. Since Object 8 is nearly square, its overall bounding box won't change drastically with rotation, but I still need to account for it. If I rotate it, the effective bounding box will stretch along the diagonal. The maximum will occur around 45 degrees. The largest dimension is about 0.133694. This means I can’t just place it anywhere because I need to consider rotations and bounding boxes of the rotated object and make sure they don't overlap with the bounding box of Object 4.
           
           Now, my strategy is to consider a few key angles for Object 8: 0 degrees, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2. I'll need to generate a grid of potential center points for Object 8 on the surface and then check for collision with Object 4 for each position.
           
           To prevent collision, I'll calculate `x_avoid_threshold` and `y_avoid_threshold` based on object 4's bounding box and the rotated bounding box for the object I am placing. These are important for placements: the new object's x-center must be at least the amount, or its y-center must be.
           
           I'm doing the calculations here to try to define a strategy for avoiding the object and I'll keep the numbers precise: there are 50 placements.
           I'm calculating `w_prime` and `h_prime` as the rotated sizes of Object 8 and generating the grid based on this.
           
           I'm going to determine a grid for the center values and generate them accordingly and check for collision.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Alright, my goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 7, a square object, on surface 0.  I need to avoid any collisions with objects 4 and 8, which are already in place.  Surface 0 is a square region centered at the origin, with sides of length 0.27.
           
           First, I define the bounding box (AABB) of the surface and of objects 4 and 8. Using these bounds, I can derive an area map. Object 4 is located at the bottom left, and object 8 is located just above it at the left side of the surface. Based on the position of object 4 and object 8, much of the left side of the surface is already occupied.  Object 7 also is square.
           
           I will generate possible placements by using different rotation angles. The rotation angles are `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3*pi/8`, and `pi/2`. Using these rotations, I will rotate the object and determine the resulting bounding boxes in the corresponding direction. The key for a square is to use 0 and pi/4, because the bounding boxes stay relatively similar after a rotation.
           
           To ensure non-overlapping placements, I generate a grid, and verify which grid positions are valid for each of the rotated directions.
           I am using a function to check for collisions between the placement of object 7 and existing objects.  If it doesn't collide with object 4 or object 8, I will add it to the final result.
           
           The goal is to find 50 positions that do not overlap with existing objects. If no placements are found, it will try less rotations, and it will return the placements found.
           
           I also double-checked the logic and the AABB calculations to be sure. I will execute the script and see what happens.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5: A Detailed Approach**
           
           I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of Object 5, a square, onto Surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with previously placed objects (4, 8, and 7).  My primary considerations are avoiding collisions and efficiently utilizing the available space, given the known constraints and the shapes of the existing objects.
           
           First, I need to precisely define the boundary of Surface 0, which is a square region:  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Object 5, while square, presents a challenge since it can be rotated.  Therefore, I'll analyze multiple rotations (theta: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2).
           
           The object's extents are `(0.09794327575366835, 0.09794327575366835)`. At `theta=0`, its half-extents are simply the side length divided by two, `0.048971637876834175`. However, as I rotate it, the effective half-extents will change. Using trigonometry, I'll calculate the new `effective_half_x` and `effective_half_y` for each rotation.  These values determine the accessible placement range along the surface.
           
           I'll calculate the AABBs for Object 5 at each rotation.  Knowing the locations and extents of Objects 4, 8, and 7, I can calculate their AABBs: AABB_4, AABB_8, and AABB_7.  With these AABBs, I'll check for any overlaps, which signify collisions.
           
           For placement, I'll generate a grid of potential locations within Surface 0. For `theta = 0` and `pi/2`, I will use a 5x5 grid. For the remaining angles I will use a 4x4 grid. I prioritize placement in the top-right quadrant and middle-right regions where space is likely available.  By iterating systematically, calculating the AABBs, and performing the collision checks, I will find 50 stable placements. I'll need to carefully avoid overlaps to ensure there are no collisions.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement - ID: 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing object ID 6, a square with sides of about 0.0989, onto surface 0.  I need to avoid collisions with the existing clutter: objects 4, 8, 7, and 5. This space is getting tight, very tight. The surface is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've got the data on all the existing objects, including their axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs).  I've analyzed the available space and it looks like a real puzzle.  The existing objects are pretty evenly distributed, leaving small pockets and channels. The central area seems blocked.
           
           My plan is to be methodical:
           
           1.  **Rotation is Key:** I'll consider 5 rotations: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.
           2.  **Define Placement Area:** For each rotation, I'll calculate the AABB's boundaries considering surface limits.  I'll then step through valid center points, avoiding collisions at each step.
           3.  **Iteration:** For each candidate position, I'll check:
               *   **Surface containment**
               *   **AABB collision checks** with existing objects 4, 8, 7, and 5.
           
           I'll be smart about it: I'll prioritize starting my checks in the less-crowded areas and moving towards the congested spaces.
           
           I'll iterate from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner of the object, checking collision as I move. It's time to let the code execute this process, the space is really limited and it is hard to find 50 valid placements manually.

               *   **AABB collision checks** with existing objects 4, 8, 7, and 5.
           
           I'll be smart about it: I'll prioritize starting my checks in the less-crowded areas and moving towards the congested spaces.
           
           I'll iterate from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner of the object, checking collision as I move. It's time to let the code execute this process, the space is really limited and it is hard to find 50 valid placements manually.
