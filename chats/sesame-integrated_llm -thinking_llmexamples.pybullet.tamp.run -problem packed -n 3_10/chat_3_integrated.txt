           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q5', '#t12'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q5', '#t7'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q2', '#t9'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g2', '#q2', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q4', '#t13'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g1', '#q4', '#t6'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q1', '#t10'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g1', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q0', '#t11'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q3', '#t8'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g0', '#q3', '#t5'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v14', 'p5', 'v8', 'p3')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Repositioning for a Collision-Free Arrangement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to get these three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto the surface v16, and I need to do it without any collisions. The tricky part is that the previous attempt failed when v14 was placed at pose p5 and v8 was at pose p3. I've got to avoid that combination.
           
           My analysis tells me that I have to work with the following setup:
           *   **Initial Setup:** v8 begins at v9, v12 at v13, and v14 at v15, all supported by v11.
           *   **Goal:**  All three objects must end up "on" surface v16.
           *   **Available Poses on v16:** p3 for v8, p4 for v12, and either p5 or #o2 for v14.
           
           The fact that p3 and p5 don't work together means I need to use the open pose, #o2, for one of the objects. I decided to use #o2 for v14 because it offers more flexibility in positioning.
           
           **My Approach:**
           1.  **Coordinate Check:**
               I've worked out the most likely coordinates (x, y, z) to avoid a collision. The objects, and their suggested "safe" placement will look like:
               *   **v8:** Placed at p3 which is (0.0, 0.0, 0.782), with the world x range between (-0.035, 0.035) based on my calculations.
               *   **v12:** Placed at p4 which is (0.05, 0.0, 0.782), with the world x range between (0.065, 0.135).
               *   **v14:** This is the key. I will set this at #o2 with the world coordinates of (0.0, 0.08, 0.782), with the world x range between (-0.085, -0.015).
           
               The objective is to make sure none of their ranges overlap.
           
           2.  **Obstacle Free Calculation**
               I then went through multiple calculations of these objects' positioning on the new platform. After these calculations I came up with an understanding that the ideal surface to avoid the collision mentioned early is a 2D surface.
           
           3.  **Action Plan:**
           
               *   Move the robot base to a centralized configuration.
               *   Pick v8 from its initial location and place it at p3.
               *   Pick v12 from its initial location and place it at p4.
               *   Pick v14 from its initial location and place it at #o2, with the new coordinates of (0.0, 0.08, 0.782).
           
           This will give a successful outcome, the proper positioning of the objects, without collision.
           
           **Poses of the objects**:
           
           *   p3: (0, 0, 0.782) with no rotation
           *   p4: (0.05, 0, 0.782) with no rotation
           *   #o2: (0, 0.08, 0.782) with no rotation
