           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Problem: A Robot's Object Placement Challenge**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got three objects, v8, v12, and v14, currently resting on a supporting surface, v11. My goal is to get all three objects onto a new surface, v16.  This means I need to define poses for each of these objects such that they are "on" v16. There's also this common pose,  `#o2`, which seems critical since it is supported by the target surface v16, and v10.  We'll get back to that later!
           
           The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant here, given the available actions. Currently, the robot is at base configuration v3, but to perform the pick and place, it needs to be at bconf `#o3`. There is a `basemotion` that can move the robot base between the initial location v3 and the intermediate location `#o3`.
           
           Each object is linked to arm v4 by `kin` facts and will be grasped with the same grasp `#o1`. The cost of each pick and place is 1, and the base movement cost is the distance traveled.
           
           So, here's how I'm thinking about it:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** The robot needs to move from its initial base configuration, v3, to `#o3`. The relevant action here is `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This incurs a cost.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:** For each object (v8, v12, v14), the plan will have these actions:
               *   `Pick` the object from its initial pose.
               *   `Place` the object at the target pose, `#o2`, supported by v16.
           
           3.  **No Return Required**: The problem doesn't specify a requirement for the robot to return to v3, so, for simplicity, it will stay put at the intermediate bconf location `#o3`.
           
           **The Continuous Values and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Now, here's where it gets interesting: I need to assign continuous values to `#o2`. Since the goal requires us to put multiple objects at the same location, and each `#o2` pose is different for each object, I have to specify unique poses for v8, v12 and v14 on v16.
            I'll avoid collisions by making sure they don't overlap, while ensuring the objects all stay within the confines of v16.
           
           v16 is a small surface area which has a size of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           *   For v8, I'll place its center at `(0.06, 0.06)` within v16.
           *   For v12, its center will be `(-0.06, 0.06)`.
           *   For v14, its center will be `(0.0, -0.06)`.
               These poses are all roughly equivalent (in terms of position relative to each other) to the original `v9`, `v13`, `v15` which had a height (z) = 0.781. I will assume this is true for all placement, and that there are no rotations (`theta=0`).
           
           We will assume that all the necessary collision checks have been pre-computed by the solver.
           
           The value for `#o3` needs a value, so I will choose the location `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` for the robot.
           
           **The Action Plan**
           
           Here's the planned action sequence, with costs:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` Cost: `distance(v3, #o3)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` Cost: 1
           3.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` Cost: 1
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` Cost: 1
           5.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` Cost: 1
           6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)` Cost: 1
           7.  `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` Cost: 
)

           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:** For each object (v8, v12, v14), the plan will have these actions:
               *   `Pick` the object from its initial pose.
               *   `Place` the object at the target pose, `#o2`, supported by v16.
           
           3.  **No Return Required**: The problem doesn't specify a requirement for the robot to return to v3, so, for simplicity, it will stay put at the intermediate bconf location `#o3`.

            I'll avoid collisions by making sure they don't overlap, while ensuring the objects all stay within the confines of v16.
           
           v16 is a small surface area which has a size of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           *   For v8, I'll place its center at `(0.06, 0.06)` within v16.
           *   For v12, its center will be `(-0.06, 0.06)`.
           *   For v14, its center will be `(0.0, -0.06)`.
               These poses are all roughly equivalent (in terms of position relative to each other) to the original `v9`, `v13`, `v15` which had a height (z) = 0.781. I will assume this is true for all placement, and that there are no rotations (`theta=0`).
