           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to getting images and analysis reports from certain objects. It's a pretty standard planning problem, but the rules are throwing me a curveball.
           
           My initial thought process was to use the usual robotics actions: take images, analyze samples, and send them to the lander. I broke down each required condition, starting with the image transmission, figuring out how to calibrate the camera and all that. No problem.
           
           However, the problem statement provides a severely restricted set of allowed *action instances*. I get a list of pre-specified, pre-parameterized actions that I can actually use.  Here's where the wheels came off.  
           
           The only permissible actions are movements where each rover essentially *does not move*. I'm allowed to do `drop_rock`, but I have no way to collect rocks, which is necessary to satisfy conditions related to soil and stones. The critical actions needed, like `take_image`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis`, are *not* on the list. 
           
           This means, in light of these restrictions, I can't fulfill the necessary conditions. The goal requires actions I am explicitly forbidden from taking. The problem statement is very clear: you *must* use only the provided actions.  
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. No plan can be created. I cannot generate the plan I require.
