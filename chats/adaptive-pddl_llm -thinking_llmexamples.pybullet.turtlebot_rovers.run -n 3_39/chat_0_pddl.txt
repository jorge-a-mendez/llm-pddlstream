           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Assessment: Unachievable**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable within the `rovers` domain. The primary hurdle lies in the requirement to acquire and receive images, specifically through the `receivedimage` predicates. To achieve this, the necessary actions are `take_image` followed by `send_image`. However, a critical constraint emerges: the rovers are locked into their initial configurations due to the limited set of available `move` actions.
           
           Specifically, rover `v12` is at configuration `v13` and rover `v14` is at `v15`. The only allowed "move" actions keep these rovers at their initial configuration. To take images, the rovers need to be at configuration `#o3` and to send images they must be at configuration `#o0`, as indicated by the preconditions of the relevant actions and the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts. Since no move action exists to get the rovers into the required configurations, the actions which are required to satisfy the `receivedimage` goal predicates will never be able to be called. Therefore, I conclude the objective is currently unattainable.
