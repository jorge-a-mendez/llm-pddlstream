           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles, including two large square obstacles in the upper corners (around (-2, 2) and (2, 2)), and several smaller square obstacles at y=2.0 (around (-0.5, 2), (0.5, 2)). There are also a number of small rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will prioritize positions that are not directly behind these known obstacles from the target's perspective. I will also ensure the positions are within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. I will try to space out the positions to increase the chances of finding a valid one.

Model:     My previous attempts failed due to collisions with fixed obstacles and no line of sight. The target point is (-1.979405164718628, 2.156381607055664).
           
           The position (-0.975487693963496, -0.1387600742194917) did not have line of sight. This means there's likely an obstacle between this point and the target. The target is in the upper left quadrant. The proposed point is in the lower left. The central vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0 is a likely culprit for blocking line of sight if the target's x is negative and the proposed x is positive. However, both points are to the left of x=0. Other obstacles in the middle of the scene, such as obstacle 11 or 18, could be blocking the view.
           
           The position (-2.0, -2.138760074219492) collided with obstacle 6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693)). This is a rectangular obstacle in the lower-left. My proposed y-coordinate was -2.13, which falls within the y-range of this obstacle, and the x-coordinate of -2.0 is also within its x-range. This collision is expected given the AABB definitions.
           
           The position (0.0, -2.138760074219492) collided with obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This is the central vertical wall. My proposed x-coordinate of 0.0 falls directly within its x-range, causing a collision. This is also expected.
           
           Given these failures, I need to be more careful about the obstacle locations. The target is at approximately (-1.98, 2.16). This is near obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), which is a square in the upper-left. I should try to place the robot in a clear area around this obstacle, within 2 units of the target.
           I will try to place the robot slightly to the right of the target and slightly below it, to avoid the obstacles in the far upper-left and the central dividing wall. I will ensure that the y-coordinate is not too low to avoid obstacle 6. I will also make sure the x-coordinate isn't 0 to avoid obstacle 5.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (0.6219953298568726, 1.8216183185577393) failed.
           
           The position (-1.0, 2.0) was "not reachable for robot base". This likely means it was out of the max_range=2 from the target. Let's check: distance = sqrt((0.62 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.82 - 2.0)^2) = sqrt((1.62)^2 + (-0.18)^2) = sqrt(2.6244 + 0.0324) = sqrt(2.6568) approx 1.63. This is within range. So, "not reachable" might imply a collision with an obstacle not explicitly reported, or an implicit constraint like being too close to a wall. Given it's at (-1.0, 2.0), this is near obstacles 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and the central wall.
           
           The position (-1.9, 0.5) had "no line of sight to target". This is a significant distance away from the target (around 2.5 units), so it's out of range. My apologies for that error. However, even if it were in range, it's very likely the central wall (obstacle 5) at x=0, or other obstacles in the middle of the scene (like 11, 18, etc.) would block the line of sight between (-1.9, 0.5) and (0.62, 1.82).
           
           The position (-0.5, 1.5) was also "not reachable for robot base". Distance = sqrt((0.62 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.82 - 1.5)^2) = sqrt((1.12)^2 + (0.32)^2) = sqrt(1.2544 + 0.1024) = sqrt(1.3568) approx 1.16. This is also within range. Again, this suggests a collision with an unseen obstacle or perhaps it's too close to obstacle 10, or potentially obstacle 11.
           
           The target point is now (0.6219953298568726, 1.8216183185577393). This is in the upper-right quadrant, near obstacles 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) and 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). Obstacle 9 is particularly close as it covers part of the target point's x-range.
           
           I should try to place the robot in open areas around the target. I will focus on positions within a 2-unit radius of (0.62, 1.82). I will avoid crossing the x=0 central wall (obstacle 5) and be mindful of the square obstacles at y=2 (obstacles 9, 10, 7, 8) and other small obstacles.
           
           Let's try:
           1. Directly below the target, avoiding the central wall.
           2. To the right of the target, slightly below.
           3. To the left of the target, slightly below, ensuring it's not too far left of the central divide. This one is tricky due to obstacle 9 being so close to the target.

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (-0.6742079257965088, 2.0422515869140625) also failed.
           
           The position (0.62, 0.82) collided with obstacle 13: ((0.6939553305071232, 0.5690438434046147), (0.8048004821378353, 0.6798889950353267)). My proposed point (0.62, 0.82) has an x-coordinate lower than obstacle 13's min x (0.69) and a y-coordinate higher than obstacle 13's max y (0.68). This indicates the collision was reported incorrectly, or my interpretation of the reported collision is wrong (i.e., the reported obstacle is merely *one* collision, and there are other reasons for failure). However, I will treat the reported collision as valid and avoid obstacle 13.
           
           The position (1.5, 1.5) had "no line of sight to target". The target is at (-0.67, 2.04). The central wall (obstacle 5) at x=0 is definitely between these two points, blocking line of sight.
           
           The position (0.0, 1.5) collided with obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This is the central vertical wall. My proposed x-coordinate of 0.0 falls directly within its x-range, causing a collision. This is expected.
           
           The target point is now (-0.6742079257965088, 2.0422515869140625). This is in the upper-left quadrant, near obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and obstacle 19 ((-0.7236988840426569, 1.9927606286679145), (-0.6247169675503607, 2.0917425451602107)). The target point itself is actually within the x and y bounds of obstacle 10. It is also very close to obstacle 19.
           
           I need to place the robot within 2 units of the target, while avoiding the central wall (x=0) and the obstacles in the upper-left. I should try to stay to the left of x=0. Given the target is surrounded by obstacles (10 and 19), finding a clear line of sight will be challenging. I will try to place the robot slightly below and to the left/right of the target, but staying within the negative x-quadrant.
