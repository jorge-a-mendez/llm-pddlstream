           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.08624052983745556, 0.08624052983745556)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions 0.08624 x 0.08624. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the given surface.
           
           Since the object is smaller than the surface, there's a large range of possible stable placements. I will try to distribute the placements across the surface, varying both the position (x, y) and the orientation (theta). Since the object is square, rotations by multiples of pi/2 will result in the same bounding box, but small rotations in between will create new valid bounding boxes. I will primarily use rotations of 0 and pi/4, as these are common and provide good coverage.
           
           For a square object of side `s` on a square surface of side `S` (from -S/2 to S/2), a stable placement at orientation 0 (or pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) requires:
           - `x_min = -S/2 + s/2`
           - `x_max = S/2 - s/2`
           - `y_min = -S/2 + s/2`
           - `y_max = S/2 - s/2`
           
           For an object rotated by theta, the effective dimensions `s_eff_x` and `s_eff_y` can be calculated as `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. For a square object this is `s * sqrt(2)` at theta = pi/4.
           However, since the object is square and its size is given as `size_x` and `size_y`, when rotated by `theta`, the effective width becomes `size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y * abs(sin(theta))` and effective height becomes `size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + size_y * abs(cos(theta))`. Since `size_x == size_y`, the effective width and height are the same: `size_x * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           So, for theta = pi/4, the effective size will be `0.08624 * (sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2) = 0.08624 * sqrt(2) = 0.12196`.
           
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object size is 0.08624 in x and y.
           
           For theta = 0:
           Min x: -0.135 + 0.08624/2 = -0.135 + 0.04312 = -0.09188
           Max x: 0.135 - 0.08624/2 = 0.135 - 0.04312 = 0.09188
           Range for x and y: [-0.09188, 0.09188]
           
           For theta = pi/4:
           Effective size: 0.08624 * sqrt(2) = 0.12196
           Min x: -0.135 + 0.12196/2 = -0.135 + 0.06098 = -0.07402
           Max x: 0.135 - 0.12196/2 = 0.135 - 0.06098 = 0.07402
           Range for x and y: [-0.07402, 0.07402]
           
           I will generate placements by choosing a `surf_idx` (only 0 available), then a `theta`, and then `x` and `y` within the valid range for that `theta`. I will focus on 0 and pi/4 rotations for simplicity and coverage. I will also include a few other angles.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I now know that object 5 has been successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 5 occupies the region [-0.04312, 0.04312] in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID: 7) has dimensions (0.08668, 0.08668), which is very similar to object 5.
           For object 7, the half-extents are 0.08668 / 2 = 0.04334.
           So at theta = 0, the object will occupy [-0.04334, 0.04334] if placed at (0,0).
           
           Since object 5 is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), its AABB is `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`.
           If object 7 is placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), its AABB would be `((-0.04334, -0.04334), (0.04334, 0.04334))`.
           These two objects would collide as their bounding boxes overlap. I need to ensure object 7's placement does not collide with object 5.
           
           The surface (0) is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Object 7 (ID 7) has `size_x = 0.08668` and `size_y = 0.08668`.
           
           For theta = 0:
           Object 7 half-extents = 0.04334.
           Valid x range on surface 0: [-0.135 + 0.04334, 0.135 - 0.04334] = [-0.09166, 0.09166].
           Valid y range on surface 0: [-0.09166, 0.09166].
           
           Object 5's AABB is `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`.
           To avoid collision with object 5, object 7's AABB (when theta=0) must not overlap this region.
           This means:
           - `obj7_x_max < -0.04312` OR `obj7_x_min > 0.04312`
           - `obj7_y_max < -0.04312` OR `obj7_y_min > 0.04312`
           
           If object 7 is placed at `(x, y)` with `theta=0`:
           `obj7_x_min = x - 0.04334`
           `obj7_x_max = x + 0.04334`
           `obj7_y_min = y - 0.04334`
           `obj7_y_max = y + 0.04334`
           
           So, to avoid collision:
           - `x + 0.04334 < -0.04312` => `x < -0.08646`
           - `x - 0.04334 > 0.04312` => `x > 0.08646`
           - `y + 0.04334 < -0.04312` => `y < -0.08646`
           - `y - 0.04334 > 0.04312` => `y > 0.08646`
           
           Combining with surface limits:
           Valid x on surface: [-0.09166, 0.09166]
           Valid y on surface: [-0.09166, 0.09166]
           
           So, for theta = 0, stable and non-colliding x positions are:
           `[-0.09166, -0.08646)` and `(0.08646, 0.09166]`.
           Similarly for y.
           This is a very small range for direct non-collision with AABBs.
           
           Let's try placing object 7 in these corners.
           For example, `x = 0.09`, `y = 0.0`. This means `x_min = 0.09 - 0.04334 = 0.04666`, `x_max = 0.09 + 0.04334 = 0.13334`. This is valid for the surface.
           And `x_min = 0.04666 > 0.04312`, so it doesn't collide with object 5 in x.
           `y_min = -0.04334`, `y_max = 0.04334`. This range for y *does* collide with object 5. So placing at `(0.09, 0.0)` is NOT collision-free.
           
           I need both x and y to be clear.
           So, I need to place object 7 such that it is entirely outside the square `[-0.04312, 0.04312] x [-0.04312, 0.04312]`.
           This means:
           1. `obj7_x_max < -0.04312` (left of obj5)
           2. `obj7_x_min > 0.04312` (right of obj5)
           3. `obj7_y_max < -0.04312` (below obj5)
           4. `obj7_y_min > 0.04312` (above obj5)
           
           Consider placing object 7 at `(x,y)` with `theta = 0`.
           Option 1: `x = -0.09`. `x_min = -0.09 - 0.04334 = -0.13334`, `x_max = -0.09 + 0.04334 = -0.04666`. This `x_max` is less than `-0.04312`. So, x is clear to the left.
           Now for y. If `y=0`, `y_min = -0.04334`, `y_max = 0.04334`. This overlaps with obj5 in y. So, `(-0.09, 0.0)` is not collision-free.
           I need to pick a y that is also clear.
           So, for `x = -0.09`, I need `y > 0.08646` or `y < -0.08646`.
           Smallest valid y: `y = 0.08646 + epsilon`.
           So, try `(-0.09, 0.087)`.
           This position has `x_min = -0.13334`, `x_max = -0.04666` (valid on surface and clears obj5 x).
           `y_min = 0.087 - 0.04334 = 0.04366`, `y_max = 0.087 + 0.04334 = 0.13034` (valid on surface).
           Also, `y_min = 0.04366 > 0.04312`. So it clears obj5 in y.
           This looks like a stable and collision-free placement!
           
           I will generate placements that are in the "corners" of the available space, far from the center where object 5 is.
           I'll use `x` and `y` values near the limits of the surface, ensuring they clear object 5.
           For `theta = 0`:
           Valid x/y range for center of object 7 on surface 0 is `[-0.09166, 0.09166]`.
           To avoid object 5 (at center), I need `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` to be large enough.
           `x > 0.04312 + 0.04334 = 0.08646`
           `x < -0.04312 - 0.04334 = -0.08646`
           Same for y.
           
           So the available (x,y) regions are:
           1. `x` in `[-0.09166, -0.08646]` AND `y` in `[-0.09166, 0.09166]` (but need to check y collision)
           2. `x` in `[0.08646, 0.09166]` AND `y` in `[-0.09166, 0.09166]` (but need to check y collision)
           3. `y` in `[-0.09166, -0.08646]` AND `x` in `[-0.09166, 0.09166]` (but need to check x collision)
           4. `y` in `[0.08646, 0.09166]` AND `x` in `[-0.09166, 0.09166]` (but need to check x collision)
           
           To guarantee no collision, I need to be in the corners:
           - `x` in `[-0.09166, -0.08646]` AND `y` in `[-0.09166, -0.08646]` (bottom-left)
           - `x` in `[0.08646, 0.09166]` AND `y` in `[-0.09166, -0.08646]` (bottom-right)
           - `x` in `[-0.09166, -0.08646]` AND `y` in `[0.08646, 0.09166]` (top-left)
           - `x` in `[0.08646, 0.09166]` AND `y` in `[0.08646, 0.09166]` (top-right)
           
           This is a very tight space for theta = 0. Let's try to pick points within these small regions.
           e.g., for top-right: `x = 0.088`, `y = 0.088`. This should be clear.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           Effective size: `0.08668 * sqrt(2) = 0.12259`
           Half-effective size: `0.061295`.
           Valid x/y range for center of object 7 on surface 0: `[-0.135 + 0.061295, 0.135 - 0.061295]` = `[-0.073705, 0.073705]`.
           Object 5 is still at `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`.
           To avoid collision for rotated object 7 at `(x,y)`:
           `x + 0.061295 < -0.04312` => `x < -0.104415` (not possible on surface)
           `x - 0.061295 > 0.04312` => `x > 0.104415` (not possible on surface)
           `y + 0.061295 < -0.04312` => `y < -0.104415` (not possible on surface)
           `y - 0.061295 > 0.04312` => `y > 0.104415` (not possible on surface)
           
           This means that for `theta = pi/4`, it's impossible to completely avoid object 5 along one axis using the bounding box of the rotated object. This implies the bounding box of object 7 when rotated will always overlap with the bounding box of object 5. This is true if I use the conservative AABB.
           However, if the object is square and rotated by pi/4, its actual geometry (a square diamond shape) might allow it to squeeze into corners, even if its AABB overlaps. But I am told to use AABBs for object and surface extents. The collision check is based on the actual geometry of the objects in the scene. I will assume my AABB collision check is correct, meaning at pi/4 it's very difficult to place it without AABB overlap with object 5. I should still try to place it as far from object 5 as possible.
           
           Given the single positive example for Object 5 at (0, 0, 0, 0), and the collision constraints, I will prioritize placing Object 7 at the extremities of Surface 0.
           
           Let's try a mix of orientations, but mostly concentrating on positions where the unrotated object 7 can fit without colliding with unrotated object 5.
           
           For theta = 0, the safe placement regions for the center of object 7 are approximately:
           `x` in `[0.0865, 0.0915]` and `y` in `[0.0865, 0.0915]` (top right corner)
           `x` in `[-0.0915, -0.0865]` and `y` in `[0.0865, 0.0915]` (top left corner)
           `x` in `[0.0865, 0.0915]` and `y` in `[-0.0915, -0.0865]` (bottom right corner)
           `x` in `[-0.0915, -0.0865]` and `y` in `[-0.0915, -0.0865]` (bottom left corner)
           
           I will also attempt placements outside these "corner" regions but away from the center, e.g., near the edges, to see if the actual collision detection allows them.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088)
           (0, 0.0, -0.088, 0.088)

Model:     I have two objects successfully placed:
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
             - Size: `(0.08624, 0.08624)`
             - AABB: `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`
           - Object 7 (ID: 7): `(0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088)`
             - Size: `(0.08668, 0.08668)`
             - AABB: `((0.088 - 0.04334, 0.088 - 0.04334), (0.088 + 0.04334, 0.088 + 0.04334))`
                     `((0.04466, 0.04466), (0.13134, 0.13134))`
           
           The new object (ID: 4) has dimensions `(0.09166, 0.09166)`. It's a square.
           Half-extents for object 4: `0.09166 / 2 = 0.04583`.
           
           Surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           For object 4 with `theta = 0`:
           Valid x/y range for center on surface 0:
           `[-0.135 + 0.04583, 0.135 - 0.04583]` = `[-0.08917, 0.08917]`.
           
           Now, I need to find positions for object 4 that do not collide with object 5 or object 7.
           Object 5 AABB: `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`
           Object 7 AABB: `((0.04466, 0.04466), (0.13134, 0.13134))`
           
           Let object 4 be placed at `(x, y)` with `theta = 0`.
           Its AABB will be `((x - 0.04583, y - 0.04583), (x + 0.04583, y + 0.04583))`.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center (0,0)):
           - `x + 0.04583 < -0.04312` => `x < -0.08895`
           - `x - 0.04583 > 0.04312` => `x > 0.08895`
           - `y + 0.04583 < -0.04312` => `y < -0.08895`
           - `y - 0.04583 > 0.04312` => `y > 0.08895`
           
           Collision with object 7 (center (0.088, 0.088)):
           - `x + 0.04583 < 0.04466` => `x < -0.00117`
           - `x - 0.04583 > 0.13134` => `x > 0.17717` (outside surface)
           - `y + 0.04583 < 0.04466` => `y < -0.00117`
           - `y - 0.04583 > 0.13134` => `y > 0.17717` (outside surface)
           
           So, to avoid object 7: `x < -0.00117` OR `y < -0.00117`. (This is considering only one side of object 7).
           More accurately:
           No overlap in x: `(x + 0.04583 < 0.04466)` OR `(x - 0.04583 > 0.13134)`
           No overlap in y: `(y + 0.04583 < 0.04466)` OR `(y - 0.04583 > 0.13134)`
           
           Let's look for corners/edges to place object 4.
           The surface's valid range for object 4's center is `[-0.08917, 0.08917]`.
           
           Consider the bottom-left corner of the surface: `x` and `y` are negative.
           Try `x = -0.089`, `y = -0.089`.
           Object 4 AABB: `((-0.089 - 0.04583, -0.089 - 0.04583), (-0.089 + 0.04583, -0.089 + 0.04583))`
                     `((-0.13483, -0.13483), (-0.04317, -0.04317))`
           
           Check collision with object 5 (at center):
           - Object 4's `x_max = -0.04317`. This is `< -0.04312`. *No collision in x.*
           - Object 4's `y_max = -0.04317`. This is `< -0.04312`. *No collision in y.*
           *No collision with object 5.*
           
           Check collision with object 7 (top-right):
           - Object 4's `x_max = -0.04317`. This is `< 0.04466` (object 7's `x_min`). *No collision in x.*
           - Object 4's `y_max = -0.04317`. This is `< 0.04466` (object 7's `y_min`). *No collision in y.*
           *No collision with object 7.*
           
           So, `(0, 0.0, -0.089, -0.089)` is a valid placement.
           
           Let's find other similar placements.
           - Top-left corner: `x = -0.089`, `y = 0.089`
             Object 4 AABB: `((-0.13483, 0.04317), (-0.04317, 0.13483))`
             - Collides with object 5? `x_max < -0.04312` (No), `y_min > 0.04312` (No) -> AABB overlap
               `x_max = -0.04317 < -0.04312` is technically true, but very close. Let's re-evaluate.
               Object 5 `x` range `[-0.04312, 0.04312]`
               Object 4 `x` range `[-0.13483, -0.04317]`
               They don't overlap in X.
               Object 5 `y` range `[-0.04312, 0.04312]`
               Object 4 `y` range `[0.04317, 0.13483]`
               They don't overlap in Y.
               *No collision with object 5.*
           
             - Collides with object 7?
               Object 7 AABB `((0.04466, 0.04466), (0.13134, 0.13134))`
               Object 4 AABB `((-0.13483, 0.04317), (-0.04317, 0.13483))`
               Object 4 `x_max = -0.04317 < 0.04466` (Object 7 `x_min`). *No collision in x.*
               Object 4 `y_max = 0.13483`. Object 7 `y_min = 0.04466`, `y_max = 0.13134`.
               Object 4 `y_min = 0.04317`. `y_min` for O4 is less than `y_max` for O7, and `y_max` for O4 is greater than `y_min` for O7. So, they overlap in Y.
               *Collision with object 7.* So `(-0.089, 0.089)` is NOT valid.
           
           This implies that for theta=0, I only have valid corner for `(-0.089, -0.089)`.
           Let's re-examine collision conditions carefully.
           
           Object 4 AABB (`obj4_xmin, obj4_ymin, obj4_xmax, obj4_ymax`) must not overlap with Object 5 AABB (`obj5_xmin, obj5_ymin, obj5_xmax, obj5_ymax`) AND must not overlap with Object 7 AABB (`obj7_xmin, obj7_ymin, obj7_xmax, obj7_ymax`).
           
           `obj5_xmin = -0.04312`, `obj5_ymin = -0.04312`, `obj5_xmax = 0.04312`, `obj5_ymax = 0.04312`
           `obj7_xmin = 0.04466`, `obj7_ymin = 0.04466`, `obj7_xmax = 0.13134`, `obj7_ymax = 0.13134`
           
           AABB overlap check:
           Two AABBs `A = (Ax1, Ay1, Ax2, Ay2)` and `B = (Bx1, By1, Bx2, By2)` overlap if:
           `Ax1 < Bx2` AND `Ax2 > Bx1` AND `Ay1 < By2` AND `Ay2 > By1`.
           To NOT overlap, at least one of these must be false.
           
           Let's use `x = -0.089`, `y = -0.089` for Object 4 (theta=0).
           `obj4_xmin = -0.13483`, `obj4_ymin = -0.13483`, `obj4_xmax = -0.04317`, `obj4_ymax = -0.04317`
           
           Against object 5:
           `obj4_xmin < obj5_xmax` (-0.13483 < 0.04312) -> True
           `obj4_xmax > obj5_xmin` (-0.04317 > -0.04312) -> True (Oh, this is a very close call. -0.04317 is just slightly smaller than -0.04312)
           `obj4_ymin < obj5_ymax` (-0.13483 < 0.04312) -> True
           `obj4_ymax > obj5_ymin` (-0.04317 > -0.04312) -> True
           Based on AABB overlap definition, this means it *DOES* overlap. My previous check was wrong.
           
           Let's refine the non-overlap condition:
           `Ax2 <= Bx1` (A is entirely to the left of B)
           OR `Ax1 >= Bx2` (A is entirely to the right of B)
           OR `Ay2 <= By1` (A is entirely below B)
           OR `Ay1 >= By2` (A is entirely above B)
           
           Back to `x = -0.089`, `y = -0.089` for Object 4 (theta=0).
           `obj4_xmin = -0.13483`, `obj4_ymin = -0.13483`, `obj4_xmax = -0.04317`, `obj4_ymax = -0.04317`
           
           Against object 5:
           X-check: `obj4_xmax <= obj5_xmin` (-0.04317 <= -0.04312) -> True! (This means it is to the left of object 5).
           So, no X-overlap, thus no AABB overlap with object 5. My previous intuition was correct, but definition check was slightly off.
           
           Against object 7:
           X-check: `obj4_xmax <= obj7_xmin` (-0.04317 <= 0.04466) -> True! (It is to the left of object 7).
           So, no X-overlap, thus no AABB overlap with object 7.
           So `(-0.089, -0.089)` for object 4 with theta=0 is VALID.
           
           Okay, let's find other valid placements.
           If `x = -0.089`, then `obj4_x_range` `[-0.13483, -0.04317]` clears both obj5 and obj7 in x.
           So, if `x = -0.089`, I need to find `y` that also clears both.
           - If `y = -0.089`: (`obj4_y_range` `[-0.13483, -0.04317]`)
             - Clears obj5 in y because `obj4_ymax (-0.04317) <= obj5_ymin (-0.04312)`.
             - Clears obj7 in y because `obj4_ymax (-0.04317) <= obj7_ymin (0.04466)`.
             So `(-0.089, -0.089)` is valid.
           
           - What about `y = 0.0`?
             `obj4_y_range` `[-0.04583, 0.04583]`
             - Collides with obj5 in y because `obj4_ymin (-0.04583) < obj5_ymax (0.04312)` AND `obj4_ymax (0.04583) > obj5_ymin (-0.04312)`.
             So `(-0.089, 0.0)` is NOT valid.
           
           This means for `theta = 0`, I basically only have the `(-0.089, -0.089)` corner.
           The valid region for obj4 is `[-0.08917, 0.08917]`.
           `x` must be such that its AABB doesn't overlap obj5 and obj7.
           `x+0.04583 <= -0.04312` => `x <= -0.08895`
           OR `x-0.04583 >= 0.04312` => `x >= 0.08895`
           Same for `y`.
           
           The allowed `x` values for object 4 center (theta=0) are: `[-0.08917, -0.08895]` and `[0.08895, 0.08917]`.
           This is a very small range (0.00022).
           Similarly for `y`.
           
           So for `theta = 0`, the only guaranteed safe regions are the four smallest corner squares:
           1. `x` in `[-0.08917, -0.08895]` AND `y` in `[-0.08917, -0.08895]` (bottom-left)
           2. `x` in `[0.08895, 0.08917]` AND `y` in `[-0.08917, -0.08895]` (bottom-right)
           3. `x` in `[-0.08917, -0.08895]` AND `y` in `[0.08895, 0.08917]` (top-left)
           4. `x` in `[0.08895, 0.08917]` AND `y` in `[0.08895, 0.08917]` (top-right)
           
           Let's try to populate these very small regions. I will pick the midpoint of these regions to guarantee a fit.
           Midpoint for `x` range `[-0.08917, -0.08895]` is `(-0.08917 + -0.08895) / 2 = -0.08906`.
           Midpoint for `x` range `[0.08895, 0.08917]` is `(0.08895 + 0.08917) / 2 = 0.08906`.
           
           So, for `theta = 0`:
           `(-0.08906, -0.08906)`
           `(0.08906, -0.08906)`
           `(-0.08906, 0.08906)`
           `(0.08906, 0.08906)` - This one will likely collide with obj7 since 0.08906 is very close to 0.088 for obj7. Let's recheck.
           
           Object 4 at `(0.08906, 0.08906)`, theta = 0.
           `obj4_xmin = 0.08906 - 0.04583 = 0.04323`
           `obj4_xmax = 0.08906 + 0.04583 = 0.13489`
           `obj4_ymin = 0.04323`
           `obj4_ymax = 0.13489`
           
           Against Object 7: `((0.04466, 0.04466), (0.13134, 0.13134))`
           X-overlap: `obj4_xmin (0.04323) < obj7_xmax (0.13134)` AND `obj4_xmax (0.13489) > obj7_xmin (0.04466)`.
           This condition is True. So, they overlap in X.
           Y-overlap: `obj4_ymin (0.04323) < obj7_ymax (0.13134)` AND `obj4_ymax (0.13489) > obj7_ymin (0.04466)`.
           This condition is True. So, they overlap in Y.
           So, `(0.08906, 0.08906)` *COLLIDES* with object 7!
           
           The issue is that the logic for "clearing object 5" (which is centered) means `abs(x)` must be large.
           And the logic for "clearing object 7" (which is in the top-right corner) means `x` must be small or `y` must be small.
           So placing in the top-right corner for object 4 is bad, because it will be near object 7.
           
           Valid regions for object 4 (center (x,y), theta=0) to avoid object 5:
           `x <= -0.08895` OR `x >= 0.08895` (X-clearance)
           `y <= -0.08895` OR `y >= 0.08895` (Y-clearance)
           
           Valid regions for object 4 (center (x,y), theta=0) to avoid object 7:
           `x + 0.04583 <= 0.04466` => `x <= -0.00117` (left of obj7)
           OR `x - 0.04583 >= 0.13134` => `x >= 0.17717` (right of obj7, outside surface)
           OR `y + 0.04583 <= 0.04466` => `y <= -0.00117` (below obj7)
           OR `y - 0.04583 >= 0.13134` => `y >= 0.17717` (above obj7, outside surface)
           
           So, for object 4 to be non-colliding, its placement `(x,y)` must satisfy:
           (`(x <= -0.08895` OR `x >= 0.08895)`) AND (`(y <= -0.08895` OR `y >= 0.08895)`)
           AND
           (`(x <= -0.00117)` OR `(y <= -0.00117)`)
           
           Let's test the bottom-left corner again: `(-0.08906, -0.08906)`
           - `x = -0.08906` satisfies `x <= -0.08895`.
           - `y = -0.08906` satisfies `y <= -0.08895`.
             So it clears object 5.
           - `x = -0.08906` satisfies `x <= -0.00117`. (True).
             So it clears object 7.
           This is a valid placement.
           
           Let's test the bottom-right corner: `(0.08906, -0.08906)`
           - `x = 0.08906` satisfies `x >= 0.08895`.
           - `y = -0.08906` satisfies `y <= -0.08895`.
             So it clears object 5.
           - `y = -0.08906` satisfies `y <= -0.00117`. (True).
             So it clears object 7.
           This is also a valid placement.
           
           Let's test the top-left corner: `(-0.08906, 0.08906)`
           - `x = -0.08906` satisfies `x <= -0.08895`.
           - `y = 0.08906` satisfies `y >= 0.08895`.
             So it clears object 5.
           - `x = -0.08906` satisfies `x <= -0.00117`. (True).
             So it clears object 7.
           This is also a valid placement.
           
           So, the three corners NOT occupied by Object 7 are still valid.
           `(-0.08906, -0.08906)`
           `(0.08906, -0.08906)`
           `(-0.08906, 0.08906)`
           
           Now consider rotations. With an object this large, rotation makes the effective AABB larger, reducing placement options.
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           Effective size for object 4: `0.09166 * sqrt(2) = 0.12963`
           Half-effective size: `0.064815`.
           Valid x/y range on surface 0: `[-0.135 + 0.064815, 0.135 - 0.064815]` = `[-0.070185, 0.070185]`.
           
           To avoid object 5 (center (0,0)):
           `x + 0.064815 < -0.04312` => `x < -0.107935` (outside surface range)
           `x - 0.064815 > 0.04312` => `x > 0.107935` (outside surface range)
           Similar for y.
           This implies any rotated placement of object 4 (AABB) will overlap with object 5 (AABB).
           If the collision detection considers the actual geometry (not just the bounding box for all objects), then it might be possible. But the prompt states "object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" and "you must avoid collision between objects i and j". This suggests AABB vs AABB collision detection.
           
           Given the difficulty with AABB collisions when rotating, I will primarily generate placements at `theta=0` for the three identified safe corners. I will try to fill the 50 placements with slight variations around these points, or try different angles to see if they pass. Maybe the actual collision geometry is less strict than the worst-case AABB overlap calculation.
           
           Let's try some `theta = pi/2` (1.570796 radians) which has the same AABB as `theta = 0`. This will just generate more positions within the existing non-colliding regions.

Model:     I have three objects successfully placed:
           - Object 5 (ID: 5): `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
             - Size: `(0.08624, 0.08624)`
             - AABB: `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`

           - Object 4 (ID: 4): `(0, 0.0, -0.089, -0.089)`
             - Size: `(0.09166, 0.09166)`
             - AABB: `((-0.089 - 0.04583, -0.089 - 0.04583), (-0.089 + 0.04583, -0.089 + 0.04583))`
                     `((-0.13483, -0.13483), (-0.04317, -0.04317))`
           
           The new object (ID: 6) has dimensions `(0.09677, 0.09677)`. It's a square.
           Half-extents for object 6: `0.09677 / 2 = 0.048385`.
           
           Surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           For object 6 with `theta = 0`:
           Valid x/y range for center on surface 0:
           `[-0.135 + 0.048385, 0.135 - 0.048385]` = `[-0.086615, 0.086615]`.
           
           Let object 6 be placed at `(x, y)` with `theta = 0`.
           Its AABB will be `((x - 0.048385, y - 0.048385), (x + 0.048385, y + 0.048385))`.
           
           I need to find a position `(x, y)` within `[-0.086615, 0.086615]` that does not collide with Object 4, 5, or 7.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center (0,0)): `AABB: ((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`
           To avoid x-overlap with obj5: `x + 0.048385 < -0.04312` => `x < -0.091505` (outside surface range)
                                      OR `x - 0.048385 > 0.04312` => `x > 0.091505` (outside surface range)
           This implies object 6 (at theta=0, AABB) will always overlap with object 5 (AABB) in x if placed on the surface.
           This is a problem. Let's recheck the surface range. `[-0.086615, 0.086615]`.
           Indeed, `0.091505` is outside `[-0.086615, 0.086615]`.
           This means that for `theta = 0`, Object 6's AABB will *always* overlap with Object 5's AABB.
           
           This suggests that for `theta = 0`, it's impossible to place object 6 without AABB collision with object 5.
           If the collision detection is based strictly on AABB overlap, then I cannot place object 6 with `theta = 0`.
           I need to try a rotation.
           
           Let's try `theta = pi/4` (0.785398 radians).
           Effective size for object 6: `0.09677 * sqrt(2) = 0.13687`
           Half-effective size: `0.068435`.
           Valid x/y range on surface 0: `[-0.135 + 0.068435, 0.135 - 0.068435]` = `[-0.066565, 0.066565]`.
           
           Now, let object 6 be placed at `(x, y)` with `theta = pi/4`.
           Its AABB will be `((x - 0.068435, y - 0.068435), (x + 0.068435, y + 0.068435))`.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center (0,0)): `AABB: ((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`
           To avoid x-overlap with obj5: `x + 0.068435 < -0.04312` => `x < -0.111555` (outside surface range)
                                      OR `x - 0.068435 > 0.04312` => `x > 0.111555` (outside surface range)
           This means that for `theta = pi/4` as well, Object 6's AABB will *always* overlap with Object 5's AABB.
           
           This is a critical problem. If AABB overlap implies collision, and the object 6's AABB always overlaps object 5's AABB regardless of rotation or position within the surface, then no placement of object 6 is possible.
           
           However, the problem statement says "you will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene." and "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." This implies that my AABB collision model might be too conservative, and the actual collision detection might consider the geometry. But it also says "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This is confusing.
           
           Let me assume the "avoid collision between objects i and j" means AABB vs AABB if no other information is given.
           If that's the case, then this object cannot be placed. But I never give up.
           
           I will interpret "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" as giving me *the dimensions of the object itself*, such that when it's oriented with theta=0 or theta=PI/2, its AABB matches these dimensions. When rotated, its effective AABB changes. The collision detection might be more nuanced and allow for interpenetration of AABBs if the actual geometries don't collide.
           
           I will try to place object 6 as far as possible from the already placed objects (Object 5 at (0,0), Object 7 at (0.088, 0.088), Object 4 at (-0.089, -0.089)).
           This means I should aim for the remaining "empty" corner: (0.089, -0.089) or (-0.089, 0.089), or generally the parts of the surface that are far from all three.
           
           Let's target the region of `x > 0` and `y < 0`. This is the bottom-right quadrant.
           - Object 5 is at (0,0).
           - Object 7 is at (0.088, 0.088) (top-right).
           - Object 4 is at (-0.089, -0.089) (bottom-left).
           
           So, the bottom-right corner of the surface is the least occupied. Let's try to place object 6 there.
           Surface range for center of obj 6 (theta=0): `[-0.086615, 0.086615]`.
           Let's try `x = 0.08`, `y = -0.08`. This is near the edge, inside the valid range for its center.
           Object 6 AABB at `(0.08, -0.08)` (theta=0):
           `x_min = 0.08 - 0.048385 = 0.031615`
           `x_max = 0.08 + 0.048385 = 0.128385`
           `y_min = -0.08 - 0.048385 = -0.128385`
           `y_max = -0.08 + 0.048385 = -0.031615`
           AABB: `((0.031615, -0.128385), (0.128385, -0.031615))`
           
           Check against Object 5 `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`:
           X-overlap: `0.031615 < 0.04312` AND `0.128385 > -0.04312`. (True). Overlaps in X.
           Y-overlap: `-0.128385 < 0.04312` AND `-0.031615 > -0.04312`. (True). Overlaps in Y.
           AABB collision with Object 5.
           
           This means that my assumption about AABB collision is indeed too strict. There must be some cases where AABBs overlap but the true geometry does not collide. Or perhaps the collision detection system for fixed obstacles allows some leeway. Or, for placed objects, maybe there is no collision check if they are "fixed" in place. The prompt says "avoid collision between objects i and j" (for new placements), which I am trying to do, but my AABB calculation suggests it's impossible.
           
           I will try to place it in the center for now, with a small rotation, and then try the other regions, since the AABB calculation suggests all `theta=0` placements collide with obj5.
           The best strategy here is to assume the AABB collision is not the full story for inter-object collision, or at least that some overlap is tolerated for existing objects that are 'fixed'.
           
           I will try a wide variety of placements, prioritizing positions that are visually far from other objects based on their centers and general regions, hoping that the actual collision detection is more permissive than strict AABB overlap.
           
           I'll choose some locations in the bottom-right and top-left/bottom-left regions of the surface which are less dense.
           Let's re-try `theta=0` in the center of the available space in the bottom-right, e.g., `(0.05, -0.05)`
           Object 6 (size 0.09677), half-size 0.048385.
           AABB for (0.05, -0.05) is `((0.001615, -0.098385), (0.098385, -0.001615))`.
           Object 5: `((-0.04312, -0.04312), (0.04312, 0.04312))`. This overlaps.
           Object 7: `((0.04466, 0.04466), (0.13134, 0.13134))`. X overlaps, Y does not (`-0.001615 < 0.04466`). No total AABB collision with 7.
           Object 4: `((-0.13483, -0.13483), (-0.04317, -0.04317))`. No collision.
           
           If the collision detection is not strict AABB, I will proceed with locations that minimize AABB overlap with existing objects, especially Object 5. Given the central placement of Object 5, and that Object 6 is quite large, it will be hard to place it without some overlap of AABBs. I will rely on trying many different placements and angles.
           
           Let's target the largest available gaps:
           - The bottom-right quadrant: `x > 0`, `y < 0`. This is the emptiest area.
           - The top-left corner: `x < 0`, `y > 0`. This is where obj4 and obj5 are not.
             Obj4 `(-0.089, -0.089)`. Obj5 `(0,0)`. Obj7 `(0.088, 0.088)`.
           
           I'll focus on the bottom-right of the surface, trying out various positions and angles (0 and pi/4) in that region. I will also try some in the top-left area.
