           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Plan to an Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with this `new-axiom@0()` thing, and I need to figure out how to satisfy it. First thing's first, I break it down. I see it's basically a bunch of conditions that need to be true. Some are already true in the initial state. But, I've got to ensure the camera takes images, gets them to the lander, and rocks have been analyzed by the rovers.
           
           I've got this notion that "hey, it's just a matter of calibrating the camera, taking the picture, and sending it back to base" but it isn't so simple. The crux of it is that my "moves" are pointless: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`. Both seem to do nothing, which seems very strange. This setup is built with the continuous parameters. I can see the actions like `take_image` and `send_image`. But, I also can't do anything because of the parameters and configurations of the rovers. This suggests a disconnect between the initial state and the necessary actions to satisfy the goal. I try using `v12` or `v14` for imaging and sending. The problem here is that taking an image, you need to be at `#o3` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. But, given the actions I'm allowed to use, there's no way to *get* to `#o3`, or any other configuration, because rovers do not move! I'm constrained by this problem.
           
           I then check `sample_rock`. This can also not be completed because I do not have the ability to drop anything, or receive any information. I want to analyze these rocks, but the actions are not applicable. If this wasn't confusing enough, it's made all the worse by the fact that I'm only allowed to use the actions listed in this very restricted "valid action instances" list. That list *does not* include the actions needed to achieve the goal (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`).
           
           Basically, I'm stuck. It looks like the goal is simply unreachable. The initial state and the allowed actions don't line up. So, this boils down to a problem where the initial state doesn't provide enough information and the actions are limited. The goal isn't just difficult; it's impossible.
