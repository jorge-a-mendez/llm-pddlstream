User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three good spots for the robot to stand, all within two units of the target point (-1.0, 1.0).  The robot needs a clear view of the target, and I need to avoid running into walls.  I have a good understanding of the environment: the overall area is bounded by a big box from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), and there are some rectangular obstacles scattered around.  Crucially, there's a wall at x = 0, splitting the space. Since the target is to the left of this wall, any suitable robot base position needs to also be on the left side of this wall.
           
           First, I define the valid area by the big box, then I remember I can only use base positions to the left of the x=0 wall. The target's at (-1.0, 1.0), and it's surrounded by potential obstacle problems. I need to calculate some points on the circle of radius 2 centered at the target point and verify the location does not have any obstacles blocking the path.
           
           My goal is to find good perspectives. I've broken the target point into the region:  x between -2.5 and 1.0, and y between -1.0 and 2.5, keeping in mind that the x must be less than -0.05. I need to check the obstacles.
           
           After examining the location of the obstacles near the target, I picked these viewpoints:
           
           1. **(-2.5, 1.0):**  This spot is directly to the left, along the left wall. It is inside the allowed region, and it allows the robot to view the scene from a different angle. The biggest concern here is the obstacles above and to the right, which are not relevant. This spot is safe.
           2. **(-1.0, 2.5):** This spot is on the upper limit of the target's valid region, and it's directly above the target, so it gives a different top-down view. Obstacles that are lower aren't in the line of sight for the target, given the target is at y=1.0. This spot is safe too.
           3. **(-2.0, 0.0):** This spot is bottom-left of the target and near the -x direction. My calculations verify there's no obstacles blocking this path.
           
           These points are good:
           - All points are inside the valid rectangular area.
           - They are all within the max range of 2.
           - These points don't have obstacles blocking the direct path.
           
           So, this looks like a good set of viewpoints.
