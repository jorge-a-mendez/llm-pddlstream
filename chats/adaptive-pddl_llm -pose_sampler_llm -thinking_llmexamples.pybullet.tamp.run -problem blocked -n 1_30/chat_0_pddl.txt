           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to place this square-like object (ID 10) on a given surface (surface 0) so that it's *stable* – meaning it's fully contained within the surface's boundaries. I'm given the surface's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) coordinates and the object's dimensions. Since the object is essentially square (the width and height are nearly identical), its orientation (rotation angle, theta) won't impact its AABB extents. I can keep it simple and just set `theta = 0` for all the placements.
           
           First, I looked at the surface's AABB: `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. This gives me the minimum and maximum x and y values. I then calculated the surface's width and height. Next, I took the object's dimensions.
           
           Now, for a stable placement, the object's center point (x, y) needs to be within a specific range. I have to make sure that the object is fully inside, so I need to account for half the object's width and height, both in the x and y directions. I calculated the allowed ranges for x and y, which define the area where the object's center can be placed without it spilling over the surface edges. I noticed that the object is quite small compared to the surface, which is a good thing – that means I have plenty of space to find 50 distinct placements.
           
           I chose to generate 50 points by spacing them out to form a rough grid within these allowed ranges. To distribute them, I divided the ranges into smaller steps, generating 10 points along the x-axis and 5 points along the y-axis, resulting in 50 (10 x 5) distinct placements. This approach ensures a reasonably uniform coverage of the available space. Each placement is given by (surface index, rotation angle, x-center, y-center).
