           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, the goal is to establish `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` that is both `on v18` and `type ?green v17`.  My initial thought is to identify objects that already have the correct type.  I see `v12` and `v8` are both `type v17`. Now, I need to make one of them *on v18*.
           
           To be `on v18`, an object must be supported by `v18` at a certain pose. Examining the initial state, I see that neither `v12` nor `v8` is currently in the correct configuration. Therefore, I will need to use a robot to put one of them there. The *place* action would be useful for that purpose. Let's start by choosing v12 since it's the first option.
           
           I will need to `pick` it up from its current pose, which is `v13`. Looking at the initial state, I see a `kin` predicate involving `v4` (the arm), `v12`, `v13`, and some parameters. Thus, I will use arm `v4` to `pick v12` from pose `v13` and then `place` it onto the correct position, supported by `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the `pick` action's preconditions, all required components are available: the necessary `kin` relationship, the `atpose` condition, `handempty`, and `atbconf`. Importantly, no base movement is required (implied by `atbconf(v3)` in both initial state and action). The key is the availability of  `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           Now, the `place` action: This requires the object to be in the hand, correct base pose, and the relevant kinematics defined. Given I used the *pick* actions, `v12` should be in the correct pose `atpose(#o2)` as required.
           
           Based on initial state, I can `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)` and then `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.  
           
           This plan will indeed put `v12` on `v18`. After this,  I should check all the predicates again and verify that after running these actions, the `new-axiom@0()` can be validated. Then, the first object (`v12`) should become both `on v18` and of type `v17`. As there are more objects of that type, I conclude that there might be more actions. Nevertheless, the cost should be the lowest for now.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, so I completely missed a critical detail here. I was treating that list of valid actions, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, as a *subset* of possible actions. I thought it was just a curated selection, not the *exclusive* list. My mistake! I was operating under the assumption I could still use `pick` and `place` if their preconditions aligned.
           
           Now I see it: only `move_base` is allowed. That fundamentally changes everything. Given the goal, `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which essentially demands manipulation of an object – moving it to `v18` – it's impossible. The *only* tool I have is `move_base`. But `move_base` doesn't touch the `atpose`, `supported`, or `type` predicates. It just changes my position and tracks the movement cost. There's no way to reach that target state with this single, restrictive action. The plan is, in a word, unreachable. I've got to go back to the drawing board.
