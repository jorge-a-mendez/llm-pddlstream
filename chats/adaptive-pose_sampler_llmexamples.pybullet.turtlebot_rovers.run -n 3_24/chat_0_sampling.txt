User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a large square (AABB 0). There are two long, thin obstacles (AABBs 1, 2, 3, 4) forming a cross pattern, with obstacle 5 dividing the space horizontally. Several smaller obstacles are scattered around. Obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 19, 20, 21 are in the upper part of the environment, while 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 15, 16 are closer to the center or lower.
           
           The target point is (-1.0131435261541793, 0.44473373575971936).
           The maximum range is 2. This means the robot's base can be within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target point.
           
           I will try to place the robot in different directions around the target, keeping the max range and obstacles in mind.
           
           1.  **To the right of the target:** A point like (-0.0131435261541793, 0.44473373575971936) is within range 1 from the target. This seems like a reasonable spot as there are no obvious obstacles directly to the right, though obstacle 5 is nearby.
           2.  **Below the target:** A point like (-1.0131435261541793, -1.5552662642402807) is within range 2 from the target. This area seems generally clear, though obstacle 18 is above and 16 to the right.
           3.  **Above and slightly to the left of the target:** A point like (-2.0131435261541793, 1.4447337357597193) is within range sqrt(1^2+1^2) approx 1.41 from the target. This is close to obstacle 17 and 13.

           The target point has changed to (2.1985089778900146, 1.9489166736602783).
           The maximum range is 2. This means the robot's base can be within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target point.
           
           My previous attempts for the *previous* target failed.
           - (-0.0131435261541793, 0.44473373575971936) collided with obstacle 5, which is a vertical bar at x=0.
           - (-1.0131435261541793, -1.5552662642402807) had no line of sight.
           - (-2.0131435261541793, 1.4447337357597193) had no line of sight.
           
           The new target point (2.1985089778900146, 1.9489166736602783) is in the upper-right quadrant of the main area. This is a very constrained area due to the outer walls and several obstacles.
           Obstacle 7 is ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). The target point is inside this obstacle. This is an issue. I will assume the target point given is the *center* of the object to view, not necessarily a valid robot placement itself.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the target point (2.1985089778900146, 1.9489166736602783) and the surrounding obstacles.
           Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - the target is *inside* or very close to this.
           Obstacle 21: ((2.1517741286676246, 1.9021818244378883), (2.2452438271124047, 1.9956515228826683)) - the target is also very close to or within this. This small obstacle is essentially around the target point.
           
           This suggests that viewing the target from the immediate vicinity might be blocked by obstacle 7 and 21. I need to find positions further away, but within the max_range of 2.
           
           1.  **To the left of the target, avoiding obstacle 7:** A position at (0.5, 1.9489166736602783) would be about 1.7 units away in x. This is well within range and to the left of obstacle 7. It should also be clear of obstacle 5.
           2.  **Below the target, avoiding obstacle 7:** A position at (2.1985089778900146, 0.5) would be about 1.4 units away in y. This is below obstacle 7.
           3.  **To the upper-right, but outside the bounding box 0 (which defines the environment limits):** I must stay within [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
               Let's try a position to the right, but also slightly lower to try and clear potential occlusions from 7 and 21.
               A position like (2.0, 0.0) would be ~2.1 units away, too far.
               A position like (1.5, 1.5) is within range (sqrt((2.19-1.5)^2 + (1.94-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.69^2 + 0.44^2) = sqrt(0.4761 + 0.1936) = sqrt(0.6697) approx 0.8), but could be too close to other obstacles.
               Let's try positions close to the center to guarantee line of sight.
           
           Revised Strategy: The target is very close to obstacles 7 and 21. I need to get far enough from these obstacles to get a clear view, but stay within the 2-unit radius. I also need to consider the walls (AABB 0-4).
           
           1.  **To the left of the target**: (0.5, 1.9489166736602783) - This is within x range [-2.5, 2.5] and y range [-2.5, 2.5]. Distance is approx 2.198 - 0.5 = 1.698, which is < 2.
           2.  **Below the target**: (2.1985089778900146, 0.5) - Distance is approx 1.948 - 0.5 = 1.448, which is < 2. This position is also to the right of obstacle 5.
           3.  **Diagonally down-left from target**: A point at (0.8, 0.8). Distance from target: sqrt((2.198-0.8)^2 + (1.948-0.8)^2) = sqrt(1.398^2 + 1.148^2) = sqrt(1.954 + 1.317) = sqrt(3.271) approx 1.8. This is within range.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 1.9489166736602783)
           (2.1985089778900146 0.5)

           The target point has changed again, now it's (0.671923041343689, 1.805199146270752).
           The maximum range is 2. This means the robot's base can be within a circle of radius 2 centered at the target point.
           
           My previous attempts for the *previous* target (2.1985089778900146, 1.9489166736602783) failed:
           - (0.5, 1.9489166736602783) collided with obstacles 9 and 20. This indicates the area around (0.5, 1.9) is very congested.
           - (2.1985089778900146, 0.5) had no line of sight.
           
           The new target (0.671923041343689, 1.805199146270752) is very close to or within obstacles 9 and 20, as indicated by the collision feedback on my last attempt.
           Obstacle 9: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))
           Obstacle 20: ((0.6287566938653143, 1.7620327987923774), (0.7150893888220636, 1.8483654937491265))
           The target point (0.67, 1.80) is indeed inside both of these. This means I need to view the target from a position that clears these obstacles.
           
           Since the target is in the upper right quadrant of the main area, near a cluster of obstacles (9, 10, 19, 20), I should try to move the robot far away from these but within the 2m range.
           
           1.  **To the right and slightly down from the target:**
               A position like (1.8, 1.0) could work.
               Distance: sqrt((1.8 - 0.671)^2 + (1.0 - 1.805)^2) = sqrt(1.129^2 + (-0.805)^2) = sqrt(1.274 + 0.648) = sqrt(1.922) approx 1.38. This is within range. This position appears clear of the known obstacles around the target.
           2.  **Below the target, more towards the center:**
               A position like (0.0, 0.5) might work.
               Distance: sqrt((0.0 - 0.671)^2 + (0.5 - 1.805)^2) = sqrt((-0.671)^2 + (-1.305)^2) = sqrt(0.450 + 1.703) = sqrt(2.153) approx 1.46. This is within range. This position needs to avoid obstacle 5 (x=0.0), so I need to be careful with exact coordinates. I will try (0.1, 0.5) to avoid colliding with obstacle 5 if it is defined as a thin strip around x=0.
           3.  **Further to the left of the target, but not too far down to avoid being blocked by 5 or 6**:
               A position like (-1.0, 1.5).
               Distance: sqrt((-1.0 - 0.671)^2 + (1.5 - 1.805)^2) = sqrt((-1.671)^2 + (-0.305)^2) = sqrt(2.792 + 0.093) = sqrt(2.885) approx 1.7. This is within range.
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 1.0)

           - (0.1, 0.5) collided with obstacle 5 (the vertical bar at x=0). This confirms that placing the robot *on* x=0 or very close to it is likely to cause collisions with obstacle 5.
           - (-1.0, 1.5) was "not reachable for robot base". This likely means it was outside the overall environment limits [-2.5, 2.5] or a more complex geometric constraint. Looking at the coordinates, it is well within [-2.5, 2.5]. This might indicate an unlisted obstacle or a dynamic collision.
           
           The new target (-0.3846580684185028, 1.969980001449585) is in the upper-left quadrant. It's close to:
           - Obstacle 19: ((-0.4215649568039071, 1.9330731130641807), (-0.3477511800330985, 2.0068868898349894)) - The target is directly within this obstacle.
           - Obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - The target is also within this obstacle.
           
           This is a very constrained area. I need to find positions that are far enough from these obstacles to get a clear view, but within the 2m range.
           
           1.  **To the right of the target (across x=0):** I need to be careful with obstacle 5. A position like (0.5, 1.969980001449585) would be on the right side of obstacle 5, and the x-distance from the target is ~0.88, so it's within range.
               Distance: sqrt((0.5 - (-0.384))^2 + (1.969 - 1.969)^2) = sqrt(0.884^2) = 0.884, which is < 2.
           2.  **Below the target:** A position like (-0.3846580684185028, 0.5) would be directly below.
               Distance: sqrt((0.384 - 0.384)^2 + (0.5 - 1.969)^2) = sqrt((-1.469)^2) = 1.469, which is < 2. This position is far from obstacle 5 and the target-surrounding obstacles.
           3.  **Below and to the left of the target:** A position like (-1.5, 1.0).
               Distance: sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.384))^2 + (1.0 - 1.969)^2) = sqrt((-1.116)^2 + (-0.969)^2) = sqrt(1.245 + 0.939) = sqrt(2.184) approx 1.47. This is within range.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 1.969980001449585)
           (-0.3846580684185028 0.5)
           (-1.5 1.0)
