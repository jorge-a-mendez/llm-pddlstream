User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including some in the corners and some within the central corridors. The target point is (1.09 0.08). I need to find 3 base positions within a distance of 2 from this point. I will try to find positions that are not too close to the known obstacles and try to vary the angle of approach to the target.

Model:     The target point is (0.97 -0.49). I need to find 3 base positions within a distance of 2 from this point. I will try to find positions that are not too close to the known obstacles and try to vary the angle of approach to the target. The central wall at x=0 might be an issue. There are also smaller obstacles in the vicinity of the target. I will try to stay clear of these.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point is (0.57 1.82). All previous attempts failed, meaning I need to rethink my strategy. (0.97, 1.51) had no line of sight, likely due to obstacles 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) or 21 ((0.53, 1.77), (0.61, 1.85)), which are close to the target. (2.5, -0.49) collided with the right wall. (-1.03, -0.49) also had no line of sight. Given the target is in the upper right quadrant, I should focus on positions to the right and slightly below the target, but not so far right that I hit the wall. I also need to be careful of the central x=0 wall.

Model:     The target point is (-1.86 1.84). All previous attempts failed. The target is now in the upper-left quadrant. (1.5, 1.5) collided with obstacle 18 ((1.41, 1.53), (1.54, 1.67)). This suggests I need to be careful with the smaller obstacles when choosing positions. (2.0, 1.0) and (0.57, 0.0) both had no line of sight, likely due to the central x=0 wall or other obstacles. I need to be on the same side of the central wall as the target, or find a way around it. Given the target is at x=-1.86, I should focus on the left side of the x=0 wall. I also need to be careful of obstacles 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), 19 ((-1.90, 1.79), (-1.81, 1.88)), which are very close to the target.
