           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy a New Axiom**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom states that an object, let's call it `?green`, needs to be "on" another object, `v18`, and `?green` must also be of a specific type, `v17`. I see that I don't have a "green" object defined explicitly, so this looks like a general rule that I need to instantiate with a suitable object.
           
           Looking at my available objects and initial state, I see that object `v12` is of type `v17`. That makes it a good candidate for `?green`. I can check whether it's currently "on" `v18`. I see that it is currently "supported" by `#o2`, and there is an axiom which means that if something is supported by X and at the position X, it's considered to be "on" it.
           
           Currently, `v12` is "on" `v14`. To get it "on" `v18`, I need to move it. My available actions are to `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Since I'm just moving objects around, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. I need to pick up `v12` and place it on `v18`.
           
           Examining the action instances, I see that I can `pick` and `place` `v12` using arm `v4`. I need to be in the right base configuration to do that. I see from the initial state that my robot base is at `v3`. The pick instance `((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))` requires me to be in the `bconf`  #o3. The `place` action I need uses the same base configuration.
           
           Therefore, the first step must be `move_base` from `v3` to `#o3`. Then I can `pick` `v12` from its current pose `v13`, and finally, `place` it at the pose `#o2`. I know that because of how pose and supporting are related to the `on` relation. The initial state fact `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` means placing it there will give me the desired `on(v12, v18)`. With `type(v12, v17)` true, the axiom is finally satisfied.
           
           I will double check everything.
           The plan is:
           1. `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2. `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3. `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           This sequence of actions should satisfy the goal. I should probably ensure that I can make all of the necessary assumptions about unsafe approaches, but since there are no positive facts I should be able to make the assumptions. I should also verify that the axioms and the effects of each action are consistent.
