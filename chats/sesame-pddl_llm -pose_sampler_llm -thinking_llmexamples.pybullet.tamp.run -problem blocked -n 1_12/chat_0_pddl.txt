           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My strategy for finding 50 stable placements for the object on the surface is as follows.** First, I analyze the given surface, which is an axis-aligned rectangle, and the object, a near-square shape. The stability of a placement hinges on the object being fully contained within the surface bounds. I recognize that since the object dimensions are relatively small compared to the surface, I should be able to generate many placements.
           
           I'll start by determining the possible rotation angles, specifically 10 evenly spaced angles between 0 and 2*pi. For each rotation, I'll calculate the new axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) dimensions of the object, which change based on `theta`. I take into account the object's width, height, and rotation angle to find these new dimensions.
           
           Next, for each rotation angle, I determine the range of valid center positions (x, y) for the object within the surface. The center can't be too close to any edge, I take into account the half-extents of the AABB when rotating the object. For each of these rotations, I will pick five positions inside these bounds.
           
           I'll pick the four corners and center for the 5 positions for each rotation. I generate 50 distinct positions by combining 10 rotations and 5 positions for each. This gives a range of positions and angles. The approach ensures the object is always fully contained in the surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 10) on a given surface (ID 0). This requires careful consideration of its dimensions (approximately 0.098 x 0.098) and the surface boundaries, which are (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). I also need to avoid collisions with 10 previously placed objects (ID 5) which have the AABBs.
           
           The stability requirements are strict, so I need to account for potential floating-point precision issues that might cause the object's AABB to extend beyond the surface limits, leading to placement failures. To counteract this, I will add an epsilon margin (1e-7) when calculating the allowable placement range within the surface's boundaries, ensuring the object is strictly contained.
           
           I'm aware that the object's rotation can significantly influence its AABB size and position. The almost square shape of object 10 means its AABB will vary, with a maximum size at a 45-degree angle.  I will generate placements across a variety of rotations to maximize the placement opportunities.
           
           My strategy involves:
           
           1.  Calculating the valid center range for object 10 based on rotation.
           2.  Generating a grid of candidate center points.
           3.  Calculating the AABB for each candidate placement.
           4.  Checking for any collisions with the AABBs of the 10 previously placed objects.
           5.  Appending the valid, non-colliding placements to my list until I reach 50.
           
           I'm confident in my approach of using grid-based sampling with collision checks. I also verified the AABB generation is correct. I am ready to begin generation.
