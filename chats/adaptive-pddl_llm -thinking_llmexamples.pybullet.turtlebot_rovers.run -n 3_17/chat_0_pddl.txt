           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing images and analyses. The immediate hurdle I encounter is that the rovers, *v12* and *v14*, are firmly stuck in their initial configurations, *v13* and *v15*, respectively.  They require specific configurations to take images, communicate, and sample rocks; specifically, `#o3` for imaging, `#o0` for communication, and `#o5` for sampling.  However, the only actions available keep them locked in their current states, offering no method to move between these configurations.
           
           I have meticulously examined the preconditions of each relevant action, particularly those concerning image acquisition and analysis. Each demands that the rover be "atconf" – at a specific configuration – matching the one required by the action itself.  For example, to `calibrate`, the rover must be at a configuration that can see an object, and that image must be visible. To take an image, and to then send an image, and to sample a rock to get an analysis, all also share the precondition of being at the specific configuration.
           
           I have found that the current available action instances: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` are effectively *no-ops*.  They merely reaffirm the current configurations, providing no route to the configurations needed for the crucial actions. The available `move` actions appear to be meant to keep the rovers at the initial state and are not applicable to changing configurations. This is a critical roadblock.
           
           Given the initial state, available actions, and preconditions for those actions, the objective of gathering images and analyses is unattainable. The rovers are statically positioned, and there is no method to achieve the desired states.
