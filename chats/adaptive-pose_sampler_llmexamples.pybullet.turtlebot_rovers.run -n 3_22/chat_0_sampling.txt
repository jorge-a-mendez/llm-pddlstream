User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (2.3, 0.4).
           The scene has a large central empty space with some pillars. The outer boundaries are defined by boxes 1, 2, 3, 4, and the central vertical obstacle is box 5. There are also smaller obstacles scattered around. I should try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding obstacles. I will try to place the robot at a distance of about 1.5 to 2 from the target to maximize viewing angle, making sure to avoid the known obstacles.

           The previous positions were all valid, so I will try new ones, making sure to avoid known obstacles, specifically the large central obstacle (box 5) and the outer walls. I will try to place the robot at a distance of about 1.5 to 2 from the target.

           All previously provided positions were valid. I will generate three new positions. I need to ensure they are within the max_range of 2 from the target and avoid the known obstacles such as the central wall (box 5), and the various smaller boxes, especially those near the target like box 7, 12, 14, 21. I will aim for positions that offer a good view and are in open areas.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The target point is (-2.0159637928009033, 1.8582185506820679).
           The previous attempts failed due to no line of sight. This indicates that the region between my proposed positions (0.7, 1.5), (1.2, -1.0), (1.0, -0.5) and the target is likely obstructed. Looking at the AABB list, the target is very close to box 19 ((-2.0605, 1.8136), (-1.9714, 1.9027)). Also nearby are boxes 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), and 11 ((-1.182, 1.127), (-1.043, 1.266)). The central pillar (box 5) at x=0 is a major obstruction. The previous failed positions were all to the right of the central pillar, while the target is to the left. I need to find positions to the left of the central pillar, or very far around it, to get line of sight. Given the max range of 2, positions must be relatively close to the target.
