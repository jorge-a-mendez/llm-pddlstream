User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to generate 25 robot base positions for the given target point, avoiding collisions, and ensuring line-of-sight.**
           
           First, I need to understand the environment. I'm given the dimensions: a 5x5 square ([-2.5, 2.5] in x and y) with thin walls, essentially. There's a major vertical wall at x=0 (Obstacle 5) that effectively splits the space.  The target is at (0.18, 1.88), which is slightly to the right of that central wall.  The robot base must be within 4 units of the target. I'm given some other internal obstacles to avoid, which I'll need to check against.
           
           My initial strategy is to prioritize generating positions that are to the right of the central x=0 wall (to maintain line-of-sight), and then below and to the right of the target. I will use a multi-pronged approach to find valid and diverse positions.
           
           First, I'll generate a grid of candidate positions near the target. I will add some points directly to the right, below, to the top right and below. Then I will check these using a function that validates them against the 3 requirements: range, no collisions, and line-of-sight. After the grid, I will look to find points by taking a fixed distance from the target. Next I will explore points further down, keeping them away from a large rectangular obstacle. These positions will be within a circle of radius 4 centered at the target, but I'll make sure to avoid collisions with the other obstacles and keep the robot on the right side of the x=0 wall.
           
           I will then use polar coordinates, varying the distances and angles from the target. I'll focus on angles that keep the robot base to the right of the target and below, to avoid the x=0 wall.  I'll also be mindful of angles that might cause the robot to collide with fixed obstacles.
           
           Finally, I'll combine these strategies. And ensure I end up with the right set of valid base points.
