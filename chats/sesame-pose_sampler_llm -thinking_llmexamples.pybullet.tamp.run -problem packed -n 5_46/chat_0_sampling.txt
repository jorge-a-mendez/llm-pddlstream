(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Nearly Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a nearly square object (dimensions roughly 0.0958 x 0.0958) on a square surface (AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  My goal is a diverse set of valid placements.  For a placement to be valid, the object's AABB must be *fully* contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           I know how to approach this.  I've already figured out that the object's effective dimensions change with rotation, but since it's almost a square, these dimensions don't change drastically. I will iterate by changing my angle and find out the bounding boxes for the object. The `theta` rotation, the center (`x,y`) position of the object's AABB will define a placement.
           
           Let's dive in. The surface is centered at (0,0) with size 0.27 x 0.27. I determined that the safe region for the object's center is also a square centered at (0,0).  The precise size of the inner square depends on the rotation angle.  I've done the math: given a rotation `theta`, I calculate the object's effective width and height, then find the limits of the center position using the formulas of the contained AABB.
           
           To ensure diversity, I decided on a methodical approach. First, I selected 10 angles (`theta`) equally spaced between 0 and pi (0, pi/10, 2pi/10, ..., 9pi/10) - that is ten values. Because of the symmetry, this should cover a good range of orientations. Then, for each angle, I will position the center of the object AABB at 5 specific locations:
           
           1.  *Centered* at (0,0) (i.e., at the center of the square) for each angle
           2.  *Corner* : at the bottom-left corner of the feasible region defined for the angle.
           3.  *Corner* : at the top-right corner of the feasible region.
           4.  *Corner* : at the top-left corner.
           5.  *Corner* : at the bottom-right corner.
           
           This strategy should give me 50 placements.  I'm confident I can make this set for a diverse group of stable positions on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking process for placing a new object (ID 4) on a surface while avoiding collision with an existing object (ID 5):
           
           **Understanding the Problem:** I'm given the dimensions of both objects, the surface boundaries, and the placement of Object 5. My goal is to find 50 valid placements for Object 4.  A valid placement means the entire object is *within* the surface and doesn't overlap with Object 5.
           
           **Surface Knowledge:** I know the surface is a rectangle (0.27 x 0.27). Object 5 is positioned at (0, 0) and has a relatively small bounding box.
           
           **New Object Analysis:** Object 4 is almost square, with dimensions O4x and O4y. I'm going to approximate them as equal at a value `O4_size = 0.08295`. This means that its *effective* size changes depending on its rotation (theta).
           
           **Constraint 1: Surface Containment:** Object 4 must stay within the surface, meaning the center of the object (x, y) has limits:
           *   `x_min_valid = -0.135 + width_O4_rotated / 2`
           *   `x_max_valid = 0.135 - width_O4_rotated / 2`
           *   `y_min_valid = -0.135 + height_O4_rotated / 2`
           *   `y_max_valid = 0.135 - height_O4_rotated / 2`
           I calculated that, at `theta = 0`, valid placement region is a square with corners at `(-0.0935, -0.0935)` and `(0.0935, 0.0935)`.
           
           **Constraint 2: Collision Avoidance:** Object 4 and Object 5's bounding boxes *must not overlap*.  I define the "forbidden zone" around Object 5 where Object 4 *cannot* be placed.  Object 5's AABB is  `B5 = ((-0.047894, -0.047894), (0.047894, 0.047894))`.
           
           **Collision Detection Logic:** I will compare the position of the center of Object 4, which is currently `(surf_idx=0, theta, x, y)`, with B5.
           I calculated the forbidden region for Object 4 center:
           * x_O5_forbidden_min = B5_min_x - half_O4_w
           * x_O5_forbidden_max = B5_max_x + half_O4_w
           * y_O5_forbidden_min = B5_min_y - half_O4_h
           * y_O5_forbidden_max = B5_max_y + half_O4_h
           
           For a non-colliding placement, either `x <= x_O5_forbidden_min` or `x >= x_O5_forbidden_max` OR `y <= y_O5_forbidden_min` or `y >= y_O5_forbidden_max`
           In other words, a placement is valid if the center (x, y) is *not* in the intersection of `[x_O5_forbidden_min, x_O5_forbidden_max]` and `[y_O5_forbidden_min, y_O5_forbidden_max]`.
           This means any (x, y) that is on the boundary is safe.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I'll use 10 different angles for Object 4's rotation: `0`, `pi/10`, `pi/5`, `3*pi/10`, `2*pi/5`, `pi/2`, `3*pi/5`, `7*pi/10`, `4*pi/5`, `9*pi/10`. This allows a wide range of effective dimensions for Object 4.
           2.  **Safe Zone Definition:** For *each* angle, I determine the effective width/height of Object 4, surface boundaries, and the forbidden zone around Object 5.
           3.  **Position Selection:** For each angle I'll use 10 positions:
               *   (x_surf_min, y_surf_min)
               *   (x_surf_max, y_surf_max)
               *   (x

           My objective is to place a new object (ID 6) on a surface (ID 0) in 50 stable configurations, considering existing objects (IDs 5 and 4). The surface's geometry is defined, as are the dimensions and positions of the existing objects. Object 6 is essentially square, which simplifies the calculations somewhat. My primary focus is to ensure that each placement is fully contained within the surface boundaries and doesn't overlap with the existing objects.
           
           I begin by calculating the effective dimensions (AABB) of Object 6 for various rotation angles (`theta`). This involves determining the valid region on the surface, considering its size and shape, and ensuring Object 6 remains entirely within. I then assess the potential for collisions with Object 5 and Object 4 by calculating their forbidden zones.  These are defined as regions where the center of Object 6 cannot be located without causing overlap.
           
           For Object 5, located at the surface center, the collision-free space is limited. I determine, based on my calculations, that, given Object 6's size and the central placement of Object 5, collision is almost inevitable for certain orientations (like `theta=0`). I have rigorously re-calculated these, and despite extensive calculations, the physical overlap appears to persist.
           
           Given the instructions to "never give up," even in the face of inevitable collisions, I will proceed to generate placements, prioritizing positions that offer the greatest spatial separation from existing objects, such as the surface corners and edge midpoints. I will use 5 orientations: `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`. For each angle, I have the valid regions. I will pick 10 positions.
           Given my understanding, it's highly likely most, if not all, of these placements will be reported as collisions by the system. My reasoning will be based on maintaining object containment on the surface and separation from other objects to the degree possible.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Strategy for Placement of Object 8**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on Surface 0, ensuring they avoid collisions with objects ID 4, 5, and 6, and stay within the surface bounds. Based on my expertise, I'm approaching this systematically.
           
           First, I define the geometric constraints: Surface 0 is a 0.27x0.27 square, and the existing objects (4, 5, and 6) are positioned at known locations with known sizes. I note that object 8 is a perfect square.
           
           I've learned that object 8 is `0.07988` units in size, and that I need to calculate the AABB's of all objects to avoid collision, given that object placement success hinges on no collision occurring.
           I'm assuming `theta = 0` (zero rotation), which simplifies the math. Therefore, the effective size of the object is half the side.  I then determine the valid center region for object 8 within the surface by subtracting the object's half-extents from the surface boundaries.
           
           To avoid collisions, I calculate "forbidden regions" around each existing object by expanding their AABBs by the half-extents of object 8. A placement is valid if the object's center falls outside these forbidden regions *and* within the surface bounds.
           I've considered all corners of the rectangle formed by the surface, but given this size and the position of the existing objects, it turns out that there are no "clean" corners.
           
           The object I'm using is described as being "axis-aligned". The problem statement said this means that it is possible for a collision to be marked even if the AABBs touch a corner. This simplifies things.
           
           My strategy involves identifying areas within the surface that are free of collisions. This gives rise to two "L" shaped areas near each corner that avoids object 5 in the center (where the AABB is drawn as being at the edges of B5).
           I intend to generate a set of 50 evenly spaced coordinates within the valid regions. I will start with a grid arrangement. These will be in a set of coordinates where both the x and y AABBs are safe.
           
           **In summary, the key is defining and computing the valid and forbidden regions and systematically sampling the valid space.** I plan to use this methodology for a set of coordinates for an iterative placement process.

           I've learned that object 8 is `0.07988` units in size, and that I need to calculate the AABB's of all objects to avoid collision, given that object placement success hinges on no collision occurring.
           I'm assuming `theta = 0` (zero rotation), which simplifies the math. Therefore, the effective size of the object is half the side.  I then determine the valid center region for object 8 within the surface by subtracting the object's half-extents from the surface boundaries.
           
           To avoid collisions, I calculate "forbidden regions" around each existing object by expanding their AABBs by the half-extents of object 8. A placement is valid if the object's center falls outside these forbidden regions *and* within the surface bounds.
           I've considered all corners of the rectangle formed by the surface, but given this size and the position of the existing objects, it turns out that there are no "clean" corners.
           
           The object I'm using is described as being "axis-aligned". The problem statement said this means that it is possible for a collision to be marked even if the AABBs touch a corner. This simplifies things.
           
           My strategy involves identifying areas within the surface that are free of collisions. This gives rise to two "L" shaped areas near each corner that avoids object 5 in the center (where the AABB is drawn as being at the edges of B5).
           I intend to generate a set of 50 evenly spaced coordinates within the valid regions. I will start with a grid arrangement. These will be in a set of coordinates where both the x and y AABBs are safe.
           
           **In summary, the key is defining and computing the valid and forbidden regions and systematically sampling the valid space.** I plan to use this methodology for a set of coordinates for an iterative placement process.
