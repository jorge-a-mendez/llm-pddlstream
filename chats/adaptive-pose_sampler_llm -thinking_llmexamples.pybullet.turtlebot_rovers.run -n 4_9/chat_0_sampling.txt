User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Task and Target:**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to generate 25 possible positions for a robot's base. The catch? It needs to "see" a target point, which is currently at (0, 0). The robot's location is constrained in range (within 4 units), and a specific area (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]).  The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           I've got a list of fixed obstacles to avoid.  A key challenge is the target point (0,0) *itself*. This location sits within a central dividing wall. Any robot placement directly across from the target is blocked by the wall. I must assume I interpret a special line of sight rule since the goal is to generate positions. I'll need to figure out how to navigate these boundaries, particularly considering the obstacles.
           
           **Strategy for Position Generation:**
           
           My strategy is as follows:
           
           1.  **Analyze and filter collisions upfront:** I will examine the provided map and obstacles.  I'll start with a few initial tests to filter easy-to-avoid bad locations.
           2.  **Generate candidate positions:** I will generate a number of candidate points, perhaps using an evenly spaced grid. I will consider points at varying distances from the target (0,0), within the 4-unit range, and the x, y limits of the scene.
           3.  **Prioritize positions**: I will prioritize a diversity of position types.
           4.  **Consider LoS**: I can assume that there will be a line of sight check performed to determine feasibility.
           5.  **Produce Diverse Outputs**: Finally, I must ensure diversity to meet the 25 output requirement.
           
           I'll filter the points. If feedback on earlier position attempts exists (from previous requests for this target), I need to refine that output.
           
           **Tackling the Problem with (0,0) Target:**
           
           The tricky part is that the central partition (x=0) *contains* the target (0,0).  A robot sitting on either side of that partition won't be able to "see" the origin if that central wall is an occluder, given the basic definition of line of sight. Given the problem statement, I can assume that this *is* the case.
           
           *   **Assumption**:  I'll operate under the assumption that the target can be "seen" by the robot from either side of the wall, so long as the robot *isn't colliding* with the wall itself. This is an optimistic assumption, but given the problem's direction to not give up, it's necessary.
           *   **Collision Detection**: My current method of collision detection will suffice.
           *   **Grid Points**: By using the grid, I should be able to cover a diverse range of points around the origin (0,0).
           
           **Specifics on Generation**:
           
           I've crafted a plan for point generation. I'm going to set some boundaries on the range from which to select. 
           *   **Valid Range**: I will make an `epsilon` adjustment for safety, making sure x values are within limits such as [-2.45, -0.15] U [0.15, 2.45]. Y coordinates are free to be [-2.45, 2.45].
           *   **Coordinate Points**: I will select points using polar coordinates to capture points around the origin, which I'll combine with a grid.
           *   **Output**: From this combination, I will simply sort and select the 25.
           
           Finally, I'll filter the resulting list of points, performing the appropriate validations to ensure each position is collision-free and distance-compliant. This will produce the 25 requested locations.
