           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with a camera `v10` that supports the `v11` mode. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). A lander `v9` is present for communication. Both rovers have an empty store `v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved if:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` are true. This means the rovers need to take images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` in mode `v11` and send them to the lander.
           2. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true for some rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil). This means the rovers need to sample and analyze a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`, and send the analysis to the lander.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           **For images:**
           *   Rover `v14` can image `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           *   Rover `v12` can image `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           *   Both rovers can communicate with the lander `v9` at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           **For rock analysis:**
           *   Rocks of type `v2` (stone) are `v1`, `v4`, `v3`.
           *   Rocks of type `v6` (soil) are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           *   Rover `v14` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           *   Rover `v12` is above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           
           The `atconf` initial states are `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           No `blocked` predicates are true initially, so rays are clear.
           No cameras are `calibrated` initially.
           
           **Plan Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Calibrate:** One rover calibrates its camera for an objective.
           2.  **Take Images:** The calibrated rover takes images of all three objectives.
           3.  **Send Images:** The rover sends the taken images.
           4.  **Sample and Analyze Rocks:** One rover moves to a configuration where it can sample a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`. Then it samples these rocks.
           5.  **Send Analysis:** The rover sends the analysis of the sampled rocks.
           
           Let's use `v14` for imaging and `v12` for sampling. Or, since both are at their initial configurations and `v14` has more initial continuous parameters (imagevisible and comvisible), let's use `v14` for everything.
           
           **Step-by-step plan using rover `v14`:**
           
           *   Calibrate `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v17`.
           *   Take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           *   Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           *   Sample `v3` (type `v2`) at `#o5`.
           *   Sample `v8` (type `v6`) at `#o5`.
           *   Send analysis of `v3` and `v8`.
           
           The available actions list only contains `move` and `drop_rock`. This is problematic, as `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are all required to meet the goal. This means the problem cannot be solved with the provided `available action instances` list.
           
           However, the prompt also states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and then "If you do return a plan, it MUST be a sequence of actions that achieves the goal and satisfies all the preconditions of each action." This creates a contradiction. Given the goal expression and the initial state, the `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, which can only be achieved by `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `calibrate` actions. If these are truly disallowed, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Assuming the list of *available action instances* refers to *primitive actions with specified continuous values* and the higher-level actions `take_image`, `calibrate`, etc. are still available conceptually, I will generate a plan using all action types to achieve the goal. I will prioritize using the continuous parameters that are part of the initial state.
           
           Given the initial state:
           - Rover `v14` is at `v15`.
           - Rover `v12` is at `v13`.
           - `v14` has `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`.
           - `v12` has `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`.
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v3)` (rock type v2), `above(v14, #o5, v8)` (rock type v6)
           - `onboard(v10, v14)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           
           Plan:
           1.  Rover `v14` needs to be at a configuration for image tasks. The initial state already places `v14` at `v15` which is not `#o3` or `#o0` or `#o5`. But there is a `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`, implying no movement is explicitly planned to change the current `atconf`. The problem states if a configuration starts with '#', it means it hasn't been computed. But the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates use these '#' configurations, and `conf(v14, #o3)` or `conf(v14, #o0)` are stated in the initial state as existing configurations. The `atconf` is only `v15`.
               This implies we need to move `v14` to `#o3` for imaging, and then to `#o0` for communication, and `#o5` for sampling, or find a configuration that works for all. Given `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are distinct and defined in `conf(v14, ...)` as specific configurations for `v14`, and not necessarily the current `atconf`, we need to account for movement. However, the only `move` actions available are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions only move the rovers from their current configurations *back to the same configurations*, which is not useful for changing location. This is a critical limitation.
           
           Since the provided list of valid action *instances* only includes `move` actions that result in no change in configuration (`(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`) and `drop_rock` actions, it's impossible to execute any `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions because their preconditions (like `atconf(?v, ?q)` where `?q` would be `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`) cannot be met by moving the rover to those configurations if it's not already there. The problem states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and then lists only `move` and `drop_rock` for `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           I must strictly adhere to the provided list of allowed action instances. If the problem implies that actions like `take_image` are not *instances* in the allowed list, then no plan involving them can be generated. The goal explicitly requires conditions like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, which are effects of `send_image` and `send_analysis` respectively. These in turn depend on `haveimage` (from `take_image`) and `analyzed` (from `sample_rock`), which depend on `calibrated` (from `calibrate`) and correct `atconf` for the respective actions. None of these actions are in the provided `available action instances` list.
           
           Given the strict interpretation of "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," and the provided list is:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` (which requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) cannot be achieved with only these actions. The necessary actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are missing from the allowed instances.
           
           The goal is unreachable.
