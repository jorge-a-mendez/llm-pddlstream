           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by various conditions, as it is an axiom that checks for a combination of states, specifically:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` (This means some object of type 'stone' is present)
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (Analysis received for that stone)
           - `type(?soil, v6)` (This means some object of type 'soil' is present)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (Analysis received for that soil)
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is stone)
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is stone)
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is stone)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is soil)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is soil)
           
           So, we need to achieve `receivedimage` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with mode `v11`, and `receivedanalysis` for one rock of type 'stone' and one rock of type 'soil'.
           
           Let's break down the `receivedimage` requirement:
           To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate` the camera (`v10`) on one of the rovers (`v12` or `v14`) at a configuration where it can see the objective. We can use `#o3` for this.
           2. `take_image` of the objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) using the calibrated camera and mode `v11`.
           3. `send_image` of the objectives to the lander (`v9`). We can use `#o0` for this.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
           1. `sample_rock` of a stone (e.g., `v3`, `v1`, or `v4`) at a configuration where the rover is `above` it. We can use `#o5` for this.
           2. `send_analysis` of the rock to the lander (`v9`).
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           1. `sample_rock` of a soil (e.g., `v7`, `v8`, or `v5`) at a configuration where the rover is `above` it. We can use `#o5` for this.
           2. `send_analysis` of the rock to the lander (`v9`).
           
           Let's try to use rover `v12` for the image tasks and rover `v14` for the analysis tasks. Both rovers are at their home configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           For `receivedimage`:
           Rover `v12` can image `v17`, `v18`, `v19` from configuration `#o3` using ray `#o4`.
           It also has `comvisible` to `v9` from `#o0` using ray `#o1`.
           So the steps for `receivedimage` are:
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (This calibrates for v17, but once calibrated, it can take images of other objectives)
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           Repeat for v18 and v19.
           4. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` (Need to recalibrate after taking image)
           5. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           7. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`
           8. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           9. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           For `receivedanalysis`:
           Rover `v14` can be `above` rock `v4` (stone) and rock `v7` (soil) at configuration `#o5`.
           It also has `comvisible` to `v9` from `#o0` using ray `#o1`.
           So the steps for `receivedanalysis` are:
           1. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)` (v4 is a stone)
           2. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           3. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` (To make `v14` free again for the next sample)
           4. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)` (v7 is a soil)
           5. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           6. `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           The available actions list only contains `move` and `drop_rock`. This means I cannot use `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`.
           The goal states in the axiom are all about `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. Since the only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, and none of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given available actions.
           The problem explicitly states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable given the constrained set of available actions.
           
           The goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. The only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. These actions are insufficient to achieve any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. Thus, the goal is not achievable.
