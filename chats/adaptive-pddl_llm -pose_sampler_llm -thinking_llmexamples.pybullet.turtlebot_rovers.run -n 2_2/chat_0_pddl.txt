User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Robot Base Placement for Target Acquisition**
           
           My objective is to determine three viable (x, y) robot base positions, given a target location.  The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target. The crucial constraints are:  the robot must be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target; line-of-sight to the target must be maintained; and, collision with fixed obstacles must be avoided.  The robot's base is also confined to a workspace of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
           
           The approach involves a meticulous analysis of the environment's fixed obstacles and the target's location, which significantly influenced strategy.  A key challenge is the central wall, extending along the y-axis (x=0), effectively splitting the space.  The initial target location, (-0.957, 0.202), resides in the left half.  I must find positions where the robot will be able to see the target without colliding with any of the obstacles.
           
           Given the target's position and the configuration of obstacles, I've devised a multi-pronged strategy.  I will prioritize positions *on the same side* of the central wall as the target.  A second consideration is that the robot be oriented with line of sight to the target and not have any obstacles blocking the path.
           
           With this strategy in mind, I begin. I have mentally selected three possible positions.
           
           *   **P1: (-2.3, 0.202)**:  Located directly to the left of the target, this position is at a radius of 1.343 units away and provides a clear line of sight, safely avoiding the nearby left wall.
           
           *   **P2: (-2.017, 1.262)**:  Positioned to the top-left of the target, this placement is at a radius of 1.499 units away and is positioned to give a clear view.
           
           *   **P3: (-0.957, -1.298)**:  Directly below the target, at a distance of 1.5 units, this location gives a straight view of the target.
           
           Each of these candidate locations has been rigorously evaluated to ensure that they stay out of the way of the static obstacles. I have made sure to stay within the range limit of 2 units from the target and avoid collisions in the environment. All selected positions fall within the stipulated bounds.  These three locations, therefore, are suitable options for robot base placement.
