(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: find 50 stable placements for object 4 on surface 0.  I need to ensure the rotated object fits entirely within the surface's bounds, meaning no part of the object can extend beyond the edges. The object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is key here.
           
           First, I interpreted the problem statement carefully.  It defines the object's dimensions (`size_x`, `size_y`) as its AABB dimensions *before* rotation.  This is important because rotation changes the effective size of the object's AABB.  To calculate this, I need the object's original size and the rotation angle (theta). For a square object of side `s`, the effective AABB side length at angle theta, becomes `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I will use the `math` library for these calculations (`math.pi`, `math.cos`, `math.sin`, etc.).
           
           The surface is a square centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27. I have determined that it is large enough to accommodate this object in different rotated configurations.
           
           The AABB of the *rotated* object, then, is what determines if the placement is stable: I need to ensure the rotated object's AABB fits within the surface's AABB. I will calculate `x_limit` as the maximum x-coordinate (and similar for y) based on the current theta value to ensure this happens.
           
           Since the object is square, the effective AABB dimensions are the same for the original object and every multiple of `pi/2`. So, I will focus on the range from 0 to pi/2 (0 to 90 degrees) of theta. I can generate 10 unique positions and use that for each rotation angle.
           
           I will iterate with rotation angles of 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.  I then need to choose points (`x`, `y`) that lie within the limits defined for each `theta`.
           
           Finally, for each `theta`, I'll use these positions in my final placements:
           `(0, 0)` (center)
           `(x_limit, 0)` (right edge)
           `(-x_limit, 0)` (left edge)
           `(0, y_limit)` (top edge)
           `(0, -y_limit)` (bottom edge)
           `(x_limit, y_limit)` (top-right corner)
           `(-x_limit, -y_limit)` (bottom-left corner)
           `(x_limit/2, y_limit/2)` (mid-top-right)
           `(-x_limit/2, -y_limit/2)` (mid-bottom-left)
           This should give me the 50 placements. I will make sure the placements are on the surface, meaning the objects do not collide with the surface limits, and that all of the objects fit perfectly.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 4, which is a square. Now I need to figure out where to put object 5, another square, on the same surface without them colliding. Object 4 is centered at (0,0) and has a known size, as does object 5.  I've already calculated that object 4 occupies a region around the origin, so I need to make sure object 5 avoids this region.
           
           I know I need to find 50 stable placements. I calculated some important bounds: the allowed range for the center of object 5 on surface 0, and the collision bounds to make sure the object 5 is on the surface and not colliding with object 4, by considering the combined AABB.
           
           I started by looking at a simple solution and the possible rotation angle by calculating the value of `theta`. Then, for collision avoidance I considered the overlapping AABB, for each `theta`. The calculations showed that when `theta` is pi/4, there is no valid placements, as the collision is inevitable. Thus, I limited the rotation values to `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`.
           
           So, the valid center of object 5 depends on these values.
           The basic premise is that for stable placement there must be not overlapping.
           
           I realized that with these constraints, the only possible placements are very close to the edges of the surface.  This left me with a small band in which I could put object 5. So, I need to pick coordinates from within this narrow band.
           
           I chose some key locations, and generated a set of valid (x,y) coordinates within these edge regions. I also calculated intermediate `m` values.
           Then, I generated a series of 25 positions for object 5 when `theta = 0` and then I'll use those same positions for `theta = pi/2`. This will give me a total of 50 unique positions.
           
           This approach should give me 50 collision-free stable placements for object 5.

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Placement Conundrum**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while carefully considering and avoiding collisions with existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I have a clear understanding of the surface geometry and the dimensions and placements of the existing objects, which act as fixed obstacles.
           
           Initially, I devised a strategy focusing on surface containment and collision avoidance. To maintain surface containment, I needed to ensure that object 6's AABB, even when rotated, remained within the surface's boundaries. This involves considering the rotated dimensions of object 6, which vary depending on its rotation.
           
           Collision avoidance with object 4 presented the first major challenge. I meticulously calculated the minimum distance that object 6's center must be from the origin to avoid a collision, which is the sum of half the dimensions of object 4 and half of object 6, effectively preventing direct contact. This led to a significant discovery: any placement that fully clears Object 4's bounding box will *also* extend beyond the surface boundary. In simpler terms, object 6 is simply too large to fit in the available space. 
           
           Considering the rotation parameter, object 6's dimensions would be the most compact (i.e. axis-aligned) when rotated at 0 degrees, and the most extended for any other angles. Thus any other rotation would compound the issue. I made sure to recalculate collision criteria for different angles, but the core issue persisted.
           
           Then I considered object 5's position. Object 5 presents a slightly more complex situation since it is not centered. I ensured that there was no overlap in the space between object 4's bounding box and object 5, and in that I ensured there was enough room to place the object without overlap or beyond bounds. 
           
           Despite multiple attempts at various placements, I have consistently found it impossible to identify a location for object 6 that avoids collision with object 4 or object 5 while also remaining fully within the surface. The geometry suggests a fundamental incompatibility – object 6's size and shape, relative to the existing objects and surface bounds, preclude a stable, collision-free placement using my understood criteria.
           
           If there were to be any stable placement for object 6, the dimensions would need to be reevaluated and the algorithm used to place each element would need to be changed to take in the shape of each object that would be placed onto surface 0.
