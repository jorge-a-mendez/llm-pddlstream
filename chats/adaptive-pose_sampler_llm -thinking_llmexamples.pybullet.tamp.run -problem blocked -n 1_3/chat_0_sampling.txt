(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Object Placement on Surface**
           
           My task is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07m x 0.07m) on a rectangular surface defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), labeled as surface 0. Stability requires the object's bounding box to be fully contained within the surface's bounding box.  The placements must be defined by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where theta is the rotation, and (x, y) is the center of the object's AABB.
           
           Since the object is a square, the effective width and height after rotation are equal, given by `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The maximum occurs at 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians), approximately 0.099m, and the minimum at 0 degrees or 90 degrees, being 0.07m.  The surface is a 0.6m x 0.6m square, so there's ample room.
           
           My approach is to place the object's center at (x, y) within the valid range for the given rotation. The x and y ranges are: `surf_min_x + dim_rot/2 <= x <= surf_max_x - dim_rot/2` and `surf_min_y + dim_rot/2 <= y <= surf_max_y - dim_rot/2`. Since a square object has a symmetry every `pi/2`, I need to vary rotation `theta` and (x,y).  I'll focus on angle variation and place objects at representative (x, y) coordinates for the best distribution on the surface.
           
           I've divided the angular space into 10 equally spaced angles between 0 and pi (inclusive) representing `0`, `pi/10`, `2pi/10`, ..., `9pi/10` and used the 5 corner/center points for each rotation. This distributes placements at the appropriate coordinates, ensuring that the (x,y) locations do not collide. This setup results in 50 distinct placements without overlaps.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis and Placement Strategy for Object ID 10**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 10) on a given surface (Surface 0), avoiding collision with a previously placed object (ID 5).
           
           First, I've analyzed the surface's dimensions, object 5's position, rotation, and dimensions and calculated its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). The successful placement of ID 5, coordinates (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565), informs my strategy for collision avoidance. Object 10, also a square, has dimensions of approximately 0.0826 units. Its rotation (theta) will impact its effective bounding box, which I've calculated to range from 0.0826 (at 0, pi/2, etc.) to approximately 0.1168 (at pi/4, 3pi/4, etc.).
           
           I'll divide surface space into three regions: a right region, an upper region, and an upper right region for placement.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to prevent the AABB of object 10 from overlapping with object 5's AABB. I've formulated criteria that must be met in order to do so, based on a three-region division. To do this, I will need to consider the range of positions (x,y) for object 10 in the absence of object 5 and place positions considering all the rotations.
           
           For placement, I need to calculate the allowable center range for Object 10 based on the current theta rotation. I will use a simple grid within the surface boundaries. To ensure 50 distinct positions, I'll generate a denser grid (25 points) per each 10 angles, and then filter out colliding points. Finally, I will return the 50 valid placements as an output.
