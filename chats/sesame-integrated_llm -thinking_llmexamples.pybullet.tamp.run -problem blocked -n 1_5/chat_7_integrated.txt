           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.499, 0.526, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.54, 0.842).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.3, -1.351), (5.128, -0.196)).
           Object p123 is a pose with position (-4.5, 0.0, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object p124 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.545, 0.479), (-4.452, 0.572)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unachievable Due to Logical Constraint**
           
           My objective is to craft a plan to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to positioning an object `?green` atop object `v18` (`on(?green, v18)`) while ensuring its type is `v17` (`type(?green, v17)`).  Upon examination of the initial state, it's clear that `v12` is the suitable candidate for `?green` since `type(v12, v17)` is confirmed.  Therefore, I must reposition `v12` from its initial pose (`v13`) to a pose atop `v18`.
           
           My initial strategy was to:
           1.  **Pick:** Retrieve `v12` from its present location, represented as the state `atpose(v12, v13)`.
           2.  **Move Base:**  Move the robot arm base to position `#o3` (base configuration).
           3.  **Place:** Set `v12` on `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, upon evaluating the preconditions for the `pick` action, I encountered a significant obstacle: `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.  This condition mandates that I cannot pick an object if another graspable object exists that is not the target object being picked.  The definition of `new-axiom@0(?o)` is:  "There exists a `?culprit` such that `?culprit != ?o` and `graspable(?culprit)`". In the initial state,  `graspable(v15)` is true alongside `graspable(v12)`.  If  `?o`  equals `v12`, the condition becomes `NegatedAtom (new-axiom@0(v12))`.  Since `v15` satisfies the criteria of being graspable and *not* equal to `v12`, `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true. Consequently, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)` becomes false, and the `pick` action is rendered impossible.  I must make `v12` a *unique* graspable to achieve the pick and therefore the goal.
           
           Regrettably, without the capacity to modify the initial state in a way that *allows* for the `pick` action, the overall plan becomes unrealizable. The only way to achieve the goal requires `pick` and `place`, so the goal is unachievable given the current initial state and logical constraints.
