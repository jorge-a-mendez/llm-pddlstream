           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to generate 50 stable placements for a 0.07x0.07 square object (ID 5) on a 0.6x0.6 square surface (Surface 0).  A stable placement means the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface's boundaries. Since I'm starting with a clean slate (no known obstacles), I'll focus on a systematic approach to cover the space effectively.
           
           First, I need to consider the rotation. The object is a square, so its effective size changes with rotation.  I've calculated the effective size based on the rotation angle (theta). It’s always the same for the x and y axes because the object is a square: `effective_size = 0.07 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`.  The maximum effective size occurs at 45 degrees (pi/4 radians), where it's roughly 0.099, and the minimum at 0 degrees or 90 degrees (pi/2 radians), where it’s 0.07.
           
           The surface's dimensions are pretty straightforward: it's a 0.6 x 0.6 square. That gives me plenty of room to work with the smaller 0.07 object. I've broken the angle range into five different values for good coverage: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8 and pi/2. Each rotation has different limitations in valid placement coordinates based on the bounding box size. I've designed a systematic x,y grid for each angle to get 10 valid placements: 2 coordinates in y and 5 in x, spaced uniformly for each angle's valid range of x and y.
           
           So, I'm generating a total of 50 placements (10 per angle).  All calculations use the bounding box calculations for each theta to create each set of valid coordinates. It should be stable. Let's see how this performs.
