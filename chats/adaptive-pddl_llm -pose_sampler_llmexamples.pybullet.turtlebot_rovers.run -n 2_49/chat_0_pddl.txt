           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` which implies several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is true for `v3`, `v4`, `v1`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means for some rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v3`, `v4`, `v1`), `receivedanalysis` must be true.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is true for `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means for some rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`, `v7`, `v8`), `receivedanalysis` must be true.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, we need to:
           - Calibrate a camera (`calibrate` action).
           - Take an image (`take_image` action).
           - Send the image (`send_image` action).
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for type `v2` rocks) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for type `v6` rocks), we need to:
           - Sample a rock (`sample_rock` action).
           - Send the analysis (`send_analysis` action).
           
           Let's break down the image and analysis goals:
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           Both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, have camera `v10` onboard which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers can see `v17` and `v18` with camera `v10` at configuration `#o3` using ray `#o4`. They can also communicate with lander `v9` at configuration `#o0` using ray `#o1`. Since no `blocked` predicate is present for `#o4` or `#o1`, we can assume they are not blocked.
           
           Let's use rover `v12` for imaging.
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`: Calibrates camera `v10` on `v12` at conf `#o3`. Preconditions: `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, `~blocked`. All are met.
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`: Takes image of `v18`. Preconditions: `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, `~blocked`. `calibrated` will be true after step 1.
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`: Sends image of `v18`. Preconditions: `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, `~blocked`. `haveimage` will be true after step 2.
           4. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`: Calibrates camera `v10` again, as it gets uncalibrated after `take_image`.
           5. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`: Takes image of `v17`.
           6. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`: Sends image of `v17`.
           
           **For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           Both rovers `v12` and `v14` are at conf `v13` and `v15` respectively, and are `free(v, v16)`. They are both `above` many rocks at configuration `#o5`.
           Rocks of type `v2` (stone): `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           Rocks of type `v6` (soil): `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Let's use rover `v12` for stone analysis and rover `v14` for soil analysis to minimize movement.
           
           For stone analysis (e.g., `v3` of type `v2`):
           1. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)`: Samples rock `v3`. Preconditions: `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`. `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `atconf(v12, v13)` are given, but `atconf(v12, #o5)` is needed for `above` to be true in the current PDDL. We can see `conf(v12, #o5)` is present. However, the action `sample_rock` requires `atconf(?v, ?q)` which means the rover must be at the configuration `?q` where it is `above` the rock. If the initial `atconf(v12, v13)` is not `#o5`, a `move` might be needed. Looking at the action instances, no moves to `#o5` are available. This implies that `#o5` might be the same as `v13` or `v15` or we are expected to use the existing `atconf` combined with the given `above` predicates. Given `above(v12, #o5, v8)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`, and `atconf(v12, v13)`, if `v13` and `#o5` are not equivalent, this plan cannot proceed. Assuming `#o5` is reachable without an explicit move for the `sample_rock` action (or `v13` is equivalent to `#o5` from the perspective of being "above"), the plan continues. Let's assume `atconf(v12, #o5)` is true, or rather, the `above` predicate is met with the current `atconf`. The `sample_rock` action uses `atconf(?v, ?q)` where `?q` is the location it is `above` the rock. Since `above(v12, #o5, v3)` is given, we need `atconf(v12, #o5)`. But the initial state only gives `atconf(v12, v13)`. This means we cannot sample.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of `above`. The `above` predicate has `?q` as a configuration. So, to sample rock `v3` at configuration `#o5`, rover `v12` must be `atconf(v12, #o5)`. However, `v12` is `atconf(v12, v13)`. No `move` action for `v12` to `#o5` is available. This implies that the goal is unreachable with the given action instances for sampling.
           
           Let me verify if I missed any implicit connections or if the continuous parameters `#o0` through `#o5` are meant to be inferred. The available actions are only `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`. These do not allow for changing the configuration to `#o5` where the rocks are `above`.
           
           Therefore, the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions cannot be performed because the rovers cannot reach the required configuration `#o5` to be `above` the rocks for sampling. The current configuration `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14` does not support the `above` predicate for any rocks (it does not state, for example, `above(v12, v13, v3)`).
           
           Given the limitations of only the listed action instances, it appears the goal is unreachable.
           
           However, the question states that if any object starts with '?', it's a variable with an implicit existential quantifier. In the goal axiom:
           `new-axiom@0()`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom atconf(v12, v13)` - True
               `Atom atconf(v14, v15)` - True
               `Atom free(v12, v16)` - True
               `Atom free(v14, v16)` - True
               `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)` - Needs to be achieved
               `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)` - Needs to be achieved
               `Atom type(?stone, v2)` - True for v1, v3, v4
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)` - Needs to be achieved for one of v1, v3, v4
               `Atom type(?soil, v6)` - True for v5, v7, v8
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)` - Needs to be achieved for one of v5, v7, v8
           
           My previous conclusion was that sampling is not possible due to `atconf` mismatch. Let's reconsider the `above` predicate.
           `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`
           
           The action `sample_rock(?v: object, ?q: object, ?r: object, ?s: object)` requires `above(?v, ?q, ?r)` and `atconf(?v, ?q)`.
           Since `v12` is `atconf(v12, v13)` and not `atconf(v12, #o5)`, sampling cannot happen.
           The only allowed `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are self-moves and don't change the configuration. This means the rovers are stuck at `v13` and `v15` respectively. Therefore, no `sample_rock` actions can be performed, and consequently, no `send_analysis` actions can be performed.
           
           Thus, the goal is not achievable because the `receivedanalysis` predicates cannot be satisfied.
           
           The problem specifically mentioned, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are not available as instances, even though their definitions are provided. If only the explicitly listed `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, `((drop_rock v14 v16))` can be used, then it's impossible to achieve the goal as these actions do not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           This implies that my initial interpretation that "list of valid action instances (applications of actions to specific objects)" meant *example* valid instances, and I can create new valid instances if their preconditions are met, was incorrect. If it truly means *only* those specific instances, then the goal is impossible.
           
           Re-reading: "You are only allowed to use the provided actions. It's essential to stick to the format of these basic actions. When creating a plan, replace the arguments of each action with specific objects." This means I can use any of the defined actions, but I must instantiate them correctly. The "list of valid action instances" must be interpreted as *all possible* actions that can be taken *given the current continuous parameters*. So, for example, `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)` is a valid action if `#o3` and `#o4` correspond to valid continuous values. This is why continuous parameters start with `#`.
           
           Okay, my initial reasoning for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` being executable is correct. The "list of valid action instances" appears to just be the `move` and `drop_rock` actions. This is a bit ambiguous. However, if the intent was to *only* allow those 4 actions, the problem would be trivially impossible to solve since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. I will proceed assuming I can instantiate any action whose preconditions are met, and the provided `move` and `drop_rock` instances are just examples of what *can* be done.
           
           Let's re-address the `sample_rock` issue.
           Precondition: `above(?v, ?q, ?r)` AND `atconf(?v, ?q)`.
           For `v12` to sample `v3` (rock of type `v2`), we need `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `atconf(v12, #o5)`.
           Initial state has `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           It also has `conf(v12, #o5)`. This means `#o5` is a valid configuration for `v12`.
           But there is no `move` action that changes `v12`'s `atconf` from `v13` to `#o5`. The only `move` action for `v12` is `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, which keeps it at `v13`.
           This is the core problem. The goal is unreachable because `sample_rock` cannot be executed.
           
           If the continuous parameter `#o5` for the `above` predicate is meant to be the same as `v13` or `v15` for the respective rovers, then sampling would be possible. However, `v13` and `#o5` are distinct symbols, implying distinct configurations. The problem statement says "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is false." So `atconf(v12, #o5)` is false. And there is no action to make it true.
           
           Therefore, the goal is truly unreachable.
           
           The only way this would be reachable is if the "list of valid action instances" was not exhaustive and the continuous parameter `#o2` in the `move` action could be a trajectory to `#o5`, or if `#o5` could somehow be considered equivalent to `v13` or `v15` for the purpose of the `atconf` precondition. Given the explicit objects and predicates, I must conclude the goal is unreachable.
           
           Final check: Is there any way for `atconf(?v, ?q)` to be met for `sample_rock`?
           `sample_rock(?v: object, ?q: object, ?r: object, ?s: object)`
           Requires `atconf(?v, ?q)`.
           The rocks (`v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`) are all `above` at configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v12` is `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           Rover `v14` is `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           There are no `move` actions to change `atconf` to `#o5`. The only `move` actions are self-moves.
           Thus, `sample_rock` cannot be executed for any rock by any rover.
           This means `analyzed(?v, ?r)` cannot be achieved.
           This means `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)` cannot be achieved.
           This means `receivedanalysis(?r)` cannot be achieved for any rock.
           Since the goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the goal is unreachable.
