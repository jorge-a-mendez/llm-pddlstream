User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, 0.225), (-0.183, 0.315)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.228, 0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.826, 0.564).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.457), (-0.098, 0.552)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.541, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.331).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, -0.591), (-0.168, -0.492)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.145, 0.505, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.86, 0.511).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           My initial thought was to devise a plan to move the objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. I recognize that this involves grasping each object from its current location on `v11` and placing it onto `v16`. I have a clear understanding of the initial state, the goal state, and the relevant objects and their relationships. I noted the constraints: the robot's base configuration (`v3`) is fixed, and all grasping will utilize a single grasp configuration (`#o1`). However, there's a critical issue. The only action instance available is a "no-op" `move_base` action that keeps the base at `v3`. The instructions state that only the action instances provided are valid. Without permitted `pick` and `place` instances, I cannot achieve the goal. Therefore, given the imposed constraints, the goal is unachievable, and I must articulate this limitation. The lack of `pick` and `place` instances renders the planning problem unsolvable within the defined constraints.
