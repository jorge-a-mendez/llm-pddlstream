User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, 0.225), (-0.183, 0.315)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, -0.591), (-0.168, -0.492)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.228, 0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.826, 0.564).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.457), (-0.098, 0.552)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.541, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.331).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.145, 0.505, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.86, 0.511).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan to Achieve Goal**
           
           Okay, so here's the plan, broken down. My goal is to get v8, v12, and v14 all on top of v16.  No base movement allowed. No funny business.
           
           1.  **Pick v8 from its initial pose (v9) using arm v4.** The pick action uses the generic grasp #o1. The key here is the pre-computed kinematics *kin* fact that confirms I can actually do it (kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4\_pick\_v8)).  The base configuration v3 is fixed at the robot's starting location. This action is "doable", assuming the pre-calculated geometry is safe and the pick trajectory (#o4_pick_v8) is safe.
           
           2.  **Place v8 onto v16 at a specific spot. This is the tricky bit:  The  kin(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v8) verifies this place action.** Now,  #o2_v8 is not a fixed pre-defined position. I need to figure it out given "the geometry of the scene". Let's say v16 is centered at (0,0, z) and v8 will be centered at the position (0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0).  #o2_v8 is the *symbolic* pose I'm using to represent the position on v16, and I specify 0,08,  0.781 and 0.0 as the pose for this. v8 AABB extent will make sure this pose will not collide with other objects,  and it  remains within the v16 bounds ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  Collision checking is assumed true.
           
           3.  **Pick v12 from its initial pose (v13) using arm v4.**  Similar to step 1, using kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4\_pick\_v12).
           
           4.  **Place v12 onto v16 at a distinct, but also calculated spot. This is the *same* symbolic target but a unique instantiation (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0) where v12 will be centered at.  The kin(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v12) allows this.**  Make sure no collisions with v8. Again, ensure the position is within v16 bounds.
           
           5.  **Pick v14 from its initial pose (v15) using arm v4.** Similar to pick steps, verified by the kin fact: kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4\_pick\_v14).
           
           6.  **Place v14 onto v16 using a distinct, but also calculated pose (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0) which is still within the bounds of  v16** with kinematic fact: kin(v4, v14, #o2_v14, #o1, v3, #o4_place_v14). This position must not collide with the others, but I assume the pose #o2_v14 position is non-colliding.
           
           And that's it. It costs 6 units and should work!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 v3 #o4_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 v3 #o4_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 v3 #o4_place_v14)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unattainable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I see the problem. The user is right – my previous plan included actions that aren't permitted. I need to be much more careful about staying within the constraints. I've been given a very strict set of actions: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it.  Just a single `move_base` action that essentially keeps the robot stationary, moving *to* and *from* the same position, `v3`.
           
           The ultimate goal, however, requires manipulating objects: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  I need to get those objects *onto* `v16`.  This immediately screams "pick" and "place" actions.  But the provided actions list doesn't include `pick` or `place`.  They aren't there!
           
           Looking at the initial state, those three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are on `v11`.  The facts show they're *supported* by `v11`. So, the entire task hinges on getting them from `v11` to `v16`.  And I can't do that with just `move_base`.
           
           Therefore, with the limited action set I've been given, this goal is simply *unachievable*.  I'm effectively blocked.
