User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, 0.225), (-0.183, 0.315)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, -0.591), (-0.168, -0.492)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.228, 0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.826, 0.564).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.457), (-0.098, 0.552)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.218, -0.541, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.944, 0.331).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.145, 0.505, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.86, 0.511).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to arrange three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16. These objects are currently resting on v11, and my robot, with its arm v4, is the tool at hand. I can immediately see the need for a pick-and-place strategy, which necessitates understanding their present locations (`atpose` predicates) and ensuring the robot arm, `v4`, is unoccupied (`handempty(v4)`).
           
           My first task is to identify suitable placement poses on v16. Fortunately, the initial state provides clues—potential poses for each object on v16 are already noted. The challenge, as I see it, is to specify these poses for each object since the state only provides a generic reference. The given poses offer `#o2` as the position of the objects on `v16`, which will become crucial as I plan.
           
           To achieve my goal, a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions is the path. I need to move the robot base to the starting position `#o3` and plan the steps from picking the first object from v11, placing it on v16 at `#o2_v8`, repeating this for v12 at `#o2_v12`, and finishing with v14 at `#o2_v14`.
           
           The robot base is initially at `v3`, but the action definitions require a base configuration `#o3` for picking and placing. My thinking is to treat `#o3` as equal to `v3` to minimize movement costs, which is valid given the `kin` predicates. The provided `move_base` actions involve these configurations, and I must ensure `atbconf(#o3)` is fulfilled before picking.
           
           The initial `move_base v3 v3 #o0` step will ensure `atbconf(#o3)`. The rest of the actions are based on the initial conditions.
           
           Then, the final plan is as follows:
           1.  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v8 (-0.09 -0.09 0.781 0.0) #o1 v3 #o4)`
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           5.  `(place v4 v12 (0.0875 -0.0875 0.781 0.0) #o1 v3 #o4)`
           6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           7.  `(place v4 v14 (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0) #o1 v3 #o4)`
           
           I have carefully picked the positions on `v16`. I have accounted for their sizes so that all positions do not overlap and the area is stable and within the table's area.

(Thoughts: **Revising the Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to completely revise my approach based on the feedback. The key is to correctly use the *provided* action instances and not try to generate new ones with different continuous parameters. The continuous parameters are already implicitly defined within the available actions, specifically, `#o1` (grasp) and `#o4` (trajectory) are fully instantiated, and `#o3` (base configuration) needs to be consistent. My mistake was assuming I could define new `pick` and `place` instances with custom continuous parameters.
           
           The primary goal is to get `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` all true. In the initial state, the objects are at various poses, and the hand is empty. The relevant actions are `pick` and `place`, which involve objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`.  I have to work with the exact format of the actions I am given: `(pick v4 obj_name current_pose #o1 #o3 #o4)` and `(place v4 obj_name #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           The crucial detail is that even though the action instances use the *same* symbolic variable `#o2` for the target pose, I need to provide *different* continuous values for it for each object because they are being placed at the *same* surface `v16`. The prompt emphasizes this: I need a different continuous value for each object at that surface, a value which is not general, but tailored to each particular object.  I'm interpreting this as three distinct continuous values for `#o2`, all corresponding to positions on `v16`.
           
           To ensure the base is in the correct configuration, a simple `move_base v3 v3 #o0` will set `#o3` to `v3`, which is consistent with the initial `atbconf(v3)` and the preconditions of the `pick` and `place` actions that use `#o3`.
           
           So, the plan:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 v3 #o0`: Sets base at `v3`.
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Pick up v8 from v9.
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Place v8 at a collision-free pose, `#o2_v8`, on v16.
           4.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Pick up v12 from v13.
           5.  `place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Place v12 at a collision-free pose, `#o2_v12`, on v16.
           6.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Pick up v14 from v15.
           7.  `place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Place v14 at a collision-free pose, `#o2_v14`, on v16.
           
           For the `#o2` values, I need to ensure they are collision-free. I've already determined coordinates for placement on the v16.  I made a careful study of the object extents (bounding box) and calculated locations on the v16 surface that should avoid collision. My preferred positions for #o2 are:
             -   `#o2_v8: (-0.09 -0.09 0.781 0.0)`
             -   `#o2_v12: (0.0875 -0.0875 0.781 0.0)`
             -   `#o2_v14: (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)`
           
           I will list these continuous pose values in the `--Poses--` section.
           
           I've re-examined the initial facts and action preconditions, making sure that `kin` and `atbconf` are handled correctly by the base action. The plan *should* now work, assuming my continuous pose values don't conflict, and since `pose(obj, #o2)` is in the initial state, I need to define poses, and `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, and `#o0` are valid actions. The cost will be

           5.  `place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Place v12 at a collision-free pose, `#o2_v12`, on v16.
           6.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Pick up v14 from v15.
           7.  `place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Place v14 at a collision-free pose, `#o2_v14`, on v16.
           
           For the `#o2` values, I need to ensure they are collision-free. I've already determined coordinates for placement on the v16.  I made a careful study of the object extents (bounding box) and calculated locations on the v16 surface that should avoid collision. My preferred positions for #o2 are:
             -   `#o2_v8: (-0.09 -0.09 0.781 0.0)`
             -   `#o2_v12: (0.0875 -0.0875 0.781 0.0)`
             -   `#o2_v14: (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)`
           
           I will list these continuous pose values in the `--Poses--` section.
           
           I've re-examined the initial facts and action preconditions, making sure that `kin` and `atbconf` are handled correctly by the base action. The plan *should* now work, assuming my continuous pose values don't conflict, and since `pose(obj, #o2)` is in the initial state, I need to define poses, and `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, and `#o0` are valid actions. The cost will be 

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v30) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning Process for Addressing the Precondition Failure**
           
           The main issue I'm facing is a "precondition failure" related to `atbconf` and the interpretation of `#o3`.  Essentially, the system believes that `#o3`, the base configuration, isn't the same as `v3`, the initial configuration. This is key.
           
           My initial approach assumed that I could implicitly use `v3` where `#o3` was required, likely to minimize costs. This assumption was incorrect. The planner correctly interprets `#o3` as a distinct continuous value, possibly `v30` or another name.
           
           To fix this, I have to ensure that the robot's base configuration *is* `#o3` before any pick or place action. The only way to do this is to explicitly change it with a `move_base` action.
           
           Looking at the available `move_base` actions, it becomes clear that the plan must begin with `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This moves the base from `v3` to a *new*, different configuration `#o3`.  The error message gave me a valuable hint.
           
           The crucial constraint in the problem is the cost. I previously focused on minimizing the number of move actions, assuming I could avoid them.  The "least cost" criterion forces me to reconsider.
           
           The available actions dictate the structure:
           
           1.  **(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)**:  Change base to  #o3
           2.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Pick object
           3.  **(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Place object
           4.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Pick object
           5.  **(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Place object
           6.  **(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Pick object
           7.  **(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Place object
           
           This plan, satisfies the precondition. The `move_base` action changes the initial base configuration `v3` to the base configuration `#o3`. After the move action, all `pick` and `place` actions utilize `#o3` since `atbconf(#o3)` is a precondition of these actions. The goal's least cost will be reached because a non-zero distance cost is incurred to go from `v3` to `#o3`. The subsequent pick and place actions only incur a constant cost.
           
           I will double-check the constraints and available actions. The key is now to ensure that the poses are correctly defined and that my plan aligns precisely with the allowed action instances.
