           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex set of conditions including `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `type(?soil, v6)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Let's break down the goal conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v12 is free. This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v14 is free. This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: An image of objective v19 in mode v11 has been received.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` has been analyzed and its analysis received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` has been analyzed and its analysis received.
           
           From the initial state, we know the following:
           - `rover(v12)` and `rover(v14)`
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`
           - `store(v16)`
           - `objective(v17)`, `objective(v18)`, `objective(v19)`
           - `mode(v11)`
           - `camera(v10)` is onboard both `v12` and `v14` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           - Rocks with type `v2`: `v4`, `v1`, `v3`.
           - Rocks with type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - `lander(v9)`
           
           We need to achieve conditions 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need to `take_image` of `?o` and then `send_image`.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)`, we need to `sample_rock` `?r` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           Let's first focus on the `receivedimage` conditions. We need to take images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using camera `v10` in mode `v11` and then send them.
           Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `v10` onboard and `v10` supports `v11`.
           
           For `v17`, `v18`, `v19`:
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           
           We also need `comvisible` to send the images and analysis.
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           
           Since the current configurations `v13` and `v15` for rovers `v12` and `v14` respectively are not the same as `#o3` or `#o0`, the first step would be to move the rovers to these configurations to satisfy the `atconf` precondition for `take_image`, `calibrate` and `send_image/analysis`. However, the only `motion` actions available are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which keep the rovers at their current locations. This means we must rely on the provided `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates that use `#o3` and `#o0` as configurations, which implies the rovers must implicitly be at these configurations to perform those actions.
           
           Given the initial state, the rovers are at `v13` and `v15`. The available actions for `move` are loops, meaning the rovers can only stay at their current configurations. This suggests that the `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions must be executable from the current configurations of the rovers (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`), and the continuous parameters `#o3` and `#o0` must be interpreted as configurations `v13` or `v15`, or the problem implicitly allows us to take images/send data from the current position if `imagevisible` / `comvisible` at a different configuration is specified. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This means that `#o3` and `#o0` are indeed *configurations* that the rovers will need to be at, not just arbitrary values.
           
           Since the `move` actions only allow the rovers to stay at their current configurations (`v13` and `v15`), and there are no actions to change the rover's configuration to `#o3` or `#o0`, we cannot directly satisfy the `atconf(?v, ?q)` precondition for actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` if `?q` is `#o3` or `#o0`. This is a critical constraint.
           
           However, the `conf(v14, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o0)` are in the initial state. This implies that these configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *possible* configurations for the rovers. The problem states, "If the plan you select uses a configuration that does not begin with '#', then you need not provide a value for it, as one already exists." This means that we should try to use `v13` and `v15` if possible.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal and available actions. The available actions are limited: only `move` actions that keep the rovers in place, and `drop_rock` actions. None of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. This means we have to achieve these through the actions that *are not* explicitly listed in the available action instances, but are defined in the domain. This is a common pattern where the given "available action instances" are just a subset, and other actions can be formed using the initial state facts and the domain definition.
           
           The problem states, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This is a crucial clarification. The *only* actions allowed are the four `move` and `drop_rock` actions. None of these actions can achieve the goal predicates `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. This implies the goal is unreachable if these are the *only* actions we can use.
           
           However, if `new-axiom@0()` is a goal, and it contains predicates that cannot be achieved by the *given* available action instances, then either the problem statement implies something else (e.g., that these predicates are already true in the initial state implicitly or through axioms, which they are not, as only `atconf` and `free` are directly true), or the goal is indeed unreachable.
           
           Let's re-read the axiom carefully:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0() Conjunction Atom atconf(v12, v13) Atom atconf(v14, v15) Atom free(v12, v16) Atom free(v14, v16) Atom receivedimage(v17, v11) Atom receivedimage(v18, v11) Atom receivedimage(v19, v11) Atom type(?stone, v2) Atom receivedanalysis(?stone) Atom type(?soil, v6) Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The first four conditions (`atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`) are true in the initial state.
           This means we only need to achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2) Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v4)` or `receivedanalysis(v1)` or `receivedanalysis(v3)`)
           - `type(?soil, v6) Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v5)` or `receivedanalysis(v7)` or `receivedanalysis(v8)`)
           
           Given the constraint "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," and the given list is:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           None of these actions can produce the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           - `move` only changes `atconf`.
           - `drop_rock` changes `full` to `free` and `free` to `full` (implicitly, if the store was full, it becomes free).
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of allowed action instances. The `new-axiom@0()` cannot be satisfied.
           
           My previous interpretations might have been too broad. The problem states, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This is a very strict constraint. If the goal requires predicates to be true that can only be achieved by actions *not* in this list, then the goal is unreachable.
           
           The initial state does not contain any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts.
           The `drop_rock` action can only be applied if the store is `full`, which is not the case for either `v12` or `v14` in the initial state, as `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true. Even if they could be executed, they do not help in achieving the goal. The `move` actions are no-ops effectively since they move from a configuration to the same configuration.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, at configurations v13 and v15, respectively. Both rovers have a free store v16. Both rovers have camera v10 onboard, which supports mode v11. There are several objectives (v17, v18, v19) and various rocks of types v2 and v6. A lander v9 is also present. The initial state also provides various imagevisible, comvisible, and above predicates for the rovers at continuous configurations designated by '#o' objects. However, the crucial constraint is that only a very limited set of action instances is allowed in the plan. These actions are only `move` actions that keep the rovers in their current positions, and `drop_rock` actions which cannot be executed since the stores are initially free. None of these allowed actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the goal axiom `new-axiom@0()`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
