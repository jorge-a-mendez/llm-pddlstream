           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning on the Unreachability of new-axiom@0() in the rovers Domain:**
           
           Alright, here's my breakdown of why I believe `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable, as a seasoned planning expert.
           
           My initial approach was to decompose the goal, breaking it down into smaller, manageable subgoals, particularly focusing on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I quickly recognized that these predicates rely heavily on the rovers being at specific configurations to perform actions like taking images, sending data, and sampling rocks.
           
           I started by analyzing the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, which clearly outlines the conditions that need to be met. I checked the initial state and realized that some conditions were already satisfied. The problem lied in the *remaining* conditions, specifically those involving getting image data and analysis reports. The main difficulty hinges on the preconditions for actions required to fulfill the goal.
           
           I looked at the actions that *could* satisfy these conditions: `send_image`, `take_image`, `send_analysis`, and `sample_rock`. The issue boiled down to the crucial `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicate. It dictates that a rover must be *at* a particular configuration to perform certain actions.  For example, to `take_image`, the rover must be at a configuration where it has a view of the target.
           Here's where the problem really revealed itself. The rovers are *stuck*. The only "move" actions I'm allowed are essentially no-ops. They either leave the rovers in the same configuration. Or in a less likely way, the "move" action *removes* `atconf` completely, making it impossible to satisfy the `atconf` preconditions of any actions. This means neither rover can reach the configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`) that are preconditions for image taking, image sending, or rock sampling. Even if the 'move' actions were actual no-ops, it is still the same problem. The rovers have to be in the correct locations to view and communicate with. The actions `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are unavailable and therefore the goal cannot be satisfied.
           
           I've carefully examined all the available facts in the initial state. The visibility and communication preconditions use configurations that are *different* from the rovers' current positions and there's no way for the rovers to change these positions. No combinations will yield a result.
           
           Given the rigid "move" actions, the limited available facts and that the rovers are locked in their starting positions, and there are no other action instances that can be used, the goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be fulfilled within the confines of this rovers domain.
