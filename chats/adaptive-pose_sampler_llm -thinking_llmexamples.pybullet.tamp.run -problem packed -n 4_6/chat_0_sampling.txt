(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.0734) on a square surface (Surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). "Stable" means the object must fit entirely within the surface.
           
           First, I need to account for rotation. When the object is rotated, its effective size within the surface changes. I've calculated the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) size, which is important for determining valid placement ranges. For a square, the effective size will be a function of `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` times the side length. For theta=0 or pi/2, the AABB size is just the side length. For theta=pi/4, the AABB is sqrt(2) * side length. This means the allowed region for placing the object shrinks as the rotation increases.
           
           To get the valid x and y placement ranges, I need to center the object within the surface. The coordinates should be between `surf_min + effective_s / 2` and `surf_max - effective_s / 2` for both x and y.
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'll use a grid-based approach with two orientations. I'll define a 5x5 grid of x and y placements for `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`. I will have the x and y coordinates from `-0.09829233` to `0.09829233` for `theta=0`, which results in an effective object bounding box of size `0.0734`, and -0.0830855 to 0.0830855 for `theta=pi/4`, for the sqrt(2) times the object's side length `0.1038`.
           This approach will produce a diverse, well-distributed set of stable placements for this object, covering the surface efficiently. Since this is the first request to place object 5, there are no other existing placements to avoid.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0, Avoiding Collision with Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new request: find 50 stable locations for object 4 on surface 0.  But, there's a catch - object 5 is already placed, and I need to make sure the new placements don't collide with it. I've got all the details: object 5's dimensions and location (`s5 = 0.0734`, placed at (-0.098, -0.098)), and object 4's dimension (`s4 = 0.0748`).
           
           First, I need to figure out object 5's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which I've calculated and it is roughly `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.061, -0.061)]`. Then, since I'm placing a square and am using the rotation, I'll need to figure out its bounding box when rotated. I can use the formula to find the side length of object 4's bounding box: `effective_s_obj = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This side is for the rotated square object.
           
           I'm considering two rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians). I can use these two rotations to generate a diverse set of placements. I also know that if I don't intersect the Bounding box of the previous object, then I've avoided collision. I can create ranges that are stable on the surface by checking my AABB calculations. I'll need to use the size to make sure each placement stays within the surface.
           
           To avoid collision with object 5, I'm going to look at calculating the rotated AABB of object 4 to see if it would intersect the existing object's AABB.
           
           **For `theta = 0`:**
           I can use some basic bounds by finding the range for the x and y of object 4 so that it doesn't intersect with the existing object.
           The AABB that avoids collision has bounds `x >= -0.024` and `y >= -0.024`. This means I need to make sure I only choose positions greater than those bounds to avoid the collision region. I'll generate a grid of points on the surface and exclude those that are in the problem region. I will use the x range `[-0.098, 0.098]` for the object.
           
           I create a 6x6 grid of points, excluding the 4 points that overlap with object 5's AABB, for a total of 32 stable placements, avoiding object 5 at 0 degrees.
           
           **For `theta = pi/4`:**
           I'll do the same but use the AABB to determine which points can be used, and which ones will generate a collision. 
           The AABB that avoids collision has bounds `x >= -0.008` and `y >= -0.008`. I also use the x and y range `[-0.082, 0.082]` for the object.
           I create a 6x6 grid and then exclude those that are in the problem region, which is 9 points. So, this produces 27 stable placements avoiding the other object.
           
           Finally, I combine the points I've generated. I get a total of 59 points from the two rotations and then return the first 50 stable placements. I've checked and re-checked my logic to make sure I've avoided all the collisions and generated the right points.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to identify 50 stable placements for Object 7 on Surface 0, ensuring that Object 7 doesn't collide with existing objects, specifically Object 5 and Object 4.  Object 7 is a square with side length s7 = 0.09565877981686427. Surface 0's AABB is  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           I need to meticulously consider two primary orientations for Object 7: 0 radians (theta) and pi/4 radians.  For each, I determine the stable region within Surface 0.
           
           Object 5's placement (-0.09829, -0.09829) with dimensions s5 = 0.073415, and Object 4's placement (-0.09758, -0.019516) with dimensions s4 = 0.0748395, both at theta = 0, constrain the available space.  I've precisely calculated their AABB’s.
           
           I establish a grid of candidate (x, y) coordinates within the stable regions for each theta value.  For theta = 0, the stable region has x,y bounds [-0.08717, 0.08717]. For theta = pi/4, the x,y bounds are [-0.06735, 0.06735].
           
           A crucial collision check function will determine if a candidate placement collides with either Object 4 or Object 5. AABB's overlap if `min1 < max2` and `max1 > min2` in both dimensions. The code calculates and filters, ensuring a placement isn't occupied.
           
           I set up 10x10 grids for stable locations for each theta to give 100 potential candidate locations. The program finds 64 possible stable locations: 28 for theta = 0 and 36 for theta=pi/4, then I'll take the first 50 stable placements and output the coordinates.

The surface size is given by  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.

(Thoughts: **Navigating Placement Challenges and Ensuring Collision-Free Zones**
           
           I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID 5, size 0.07x0.07) while being mindful of two surfaces and pre-existing obstacles. The key challenge lies in the dual use of "ID 5": there's a new instance to place *and* potentially existing instances of the *same* ID. I've been given some pre-placed objects marked as "successful," and I must treat these as fixed obstacles. The current set-up seems ambiguous: how can an object with the same ID both be a new instance and a fixed obstacle? This is a bit of a logical paradox.
           
           My interpretation, given the instructions, is that I'm placing a *new* object of type "5" while *avoiding* the existing objects also labeled as ID 5 (and all other objects with IDs 4, 6, and 7). I see that these objects and their valid placement positions are represented by lists of coordinates. I am to place an *additional* object with ID 5 on the scene, avoiding collisions. The list of coordinates appears to describe "fixed obstacles".
           
           I'll be working with Surface 0: `((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))` and Surface 1: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and that the previous successfully placed objects have been placed on Surface 1, which now presents as a challenge to the new object placement. I'm focusing on the *fixed obstacle* approach to deal with the previous placements. Since these "successful" placements are *present* in the scene, I'm defining a set of bounding boxes (AABBs) for these obstacles. I'm calculating and listing those AABBs for each instance of the other IDs as well.
           
           I will prioritize using Surface 0 for placement since it's the largest and is, for the moment, empty. This gives me greater freedom from collision checks. Surface 1 is more limited, but it's where the existing obstacles are.
           
           To find safe placements, I'll generate a grid of potential object centers for the new object and check each placement against the pre-calculated AABBs. My placements will try to work around those existing placements. I will begin by generating candidate locations for the new object on Surface 0 using a systematic approach with `theta=0` and `theta = pi/4`. I will then generate additional placements on Surface 1. Given the limited space on Surface 1 with pre-existing AABBs, I will place the remainder of the instances there. I am calculating `half_s` based on the given dimensions. I will ensure that the new object does not collide with the AABBs by validating a check based on whether there's overlap in the x or y directions.
           
           I am generating these candidate placements carefully, keeping an eye on the existing obstacle locations. I will ensure that the current placement coordinates don't collide with the fixed obstacle AABBs on Surface 1.
