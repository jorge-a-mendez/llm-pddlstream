User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a perimeter of AABBs (0-4), with a central vertical wall (5) at x=0. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment (6-20). My strategy will be to consider positions around the target point at a distance within the maximum range of 2. I will prioritize positions that are further away from the obstacles and closer to the edges of the allowed region, as these are less likely to cause collisions. I will try to generate positions at different angles around the target point to provide a diverse set of options.
