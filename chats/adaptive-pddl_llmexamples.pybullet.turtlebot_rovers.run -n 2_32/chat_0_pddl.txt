           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that represents a complex state involving multiple conditions. Let's break down what `new-axiom@0()` implies:
           
           It requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are already at their respective initial configurations. These are true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers have free sample stores. These are true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Images of objectives `v17` and `v18` in mode `v11` must have been received.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (which could be `v1`, `v3`, or `v4` according to `type` predicates) must have been analyzed and the analysis received.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (which could be `v5`, `v7`, or `v8` according to `type` predicates) must have been analyzed and the analysis received.
           
           Let's examine the available actions:
           - `move`: Allows rovers to move. However, the only available move actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are self-loops and don't change the rover's configuration. So, the rovers essentially stay in their current positions `v13` and `v15`.
           - `take_image`: Requires a calibrated camera and image visibility. There are no `calibrate` actions available, so `take_image` cannot be used to achieve `haveimage`.
           - `send_image`: Requires `haveimage` to be true. Since `take_image` isn't available, `haveimage` cannot be achieved. Thus `send_image` cannot be used to achieve `receivedimage`.
           - `sample_rock`: Requires `above` and `free` store. Both rovers `v12` and `v14` are above various rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and have a free store `v16`. This action would make `analyzed` true for the sampled rock.
           - `send_analysis`: Requires `analyzed` to be true. If `sample_rock` is used, then `send_analysis` could be used to achieve `receivedanalysis`.
           - `drop_rock`: Requires `full` store. Initially, both stores are `free`, so `drop_rock` cannot be used.
           
           Based on this analysis:
           - The `receivedimage` part of the goal (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) cannot be achieved because there are no `calibrate` or `take_image` actions, and consequently, no `send_image` actions are possible.
           - The `receivedanalysis` part of the goal for both types (`v2` and `v6`) *might* be achievable if `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions were available.
           
           Let's re-examine the `new-axiom@0()` definition. It states:
           `Atom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The critical missing link is that there are *no* `take_image` or `calibrate` actions provided in the allowed action instances, which are necessary to get `haveimage`, and subsequently `send_image` to get `receivedimage`. Therefore, the conditions `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be satisfied.
           
           Thus, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The goal is unreachable because there are no available actions to take and send images, which are necessary to achieve the `receivedimage` predicates in the goal. Specifically, no `calibrate` or `take_image` actions are provided in the list of allowed action instances.
