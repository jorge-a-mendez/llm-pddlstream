           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.615, -0.063), (-4.532, 0.021)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.573, -0.021, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.109, 0.994).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal: `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My core task is to ensure the condition `on(v12, v18)` is true, as this directly satisfies the `new-axiom@0()` goal based on the given axioms.  I know that `on(v12, v18)` means I need to arrange `v12` to be supported by `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that I already have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that I need to ensure `v12` is *at* the pose `#o2` on `v18`. Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           Therefore, my high-level plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I need to move from my current base configuration (`v3`) to a suitable base configuration (`#o3`) so I can then pick up and place the object.
           2.  **Pick up `v12`:** I'll use the `pick` action to grasp `v12` from its current pose (`v13`).
           3.  **Place `v12`:** I'll use the `place` action to set `v12` down at the required pose (`#o2`) on top of `v18`.
           
           **Detailed Action Breakdown and Preconditions:**
           
           The action requires, and I have determined a continuous, collision-free pose for `#o2` as (4.5, -0.3, 0.85, 0.0).
           
           1.  **Move Base: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`**
               *   This is needed because the `pick` action requires the robot to be at base configuration `#o3`.
               *   I'll execute the `move_base` action to ensure this precondition is satisfied.
           
           2.  **Pick: `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`**
               *   Preconditions met:
                   *   The system has identified kinematics relationships.
                   *   `v12` is at `v13`.
                   *   The robot's hand is empty.
                   *   The base configuration is met.
                   *   I assume other negation preconditions are met.
               *   This will grasp `v12` and remove it from its pose.
           
           3.  **Place: `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`**
               *   Preconditions met:
                   *   Kinematics relationships are known.
                   *   The robot has `v12` in its grasp.
                   *   Base configuration `#o3` is required.
                   *   I assume other negation preconditions are met.
               *   This action will place `v12` at pose `#o2`.
           
           **Continuous Values and Final Goal:**
           
           The key to fulfilling the user prompt is the continuous value for `#o2`.
           
           I've determined that a collision-free placement for `#o2` on `v18` with coordinates (4.5, -0.3, 0.85, 0.0) seems appropriate because I do not see any other relevant obstacles nearby.
           
           By executing the `move_base` and then `pick` and then `place` actions with the continuous pose I've defined, I believe I can achieve the goal, satisfying the `on(v12, v18)` condition, and thus achieving the target `new-axiom@0()`. The final goal has been achieved.
