           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.615, -0.063), (-4.532, 0.021)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.573, -0.021, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.109, 0.994).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My initial goal is to get object `v12` "on" `v18` and ensure its type matches `v17`. Since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, the primary challenge is to make `v12` "on" `v18`.  
           
           **To achieve this, I need a specific pose for `v12` on `v18`, ensuring it's supported and that I can reach that pose.** I've identified that `v12` is currently at pose `v13`, supported by `v14`, which is also associated with `kinematics`. I need to *place* the object at the target location, which is a pose called `#p2`, situated on object `v18`. From the initial conditions, I have `supported(v12, #p2, v18)`. Now, I must work to achieve `atpose(v12, #p2)`.
           
           **The Robot and the Arms:** The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`.  Both arms are `handempty`. The robot base is at `v3`.
           
           **Here's the plan I've put together:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must move the base from its current location (`v3`) to `#q4` to position the robot's arm for the pick action.  The relevant action for this is `(move_base v3 #q4 #t11)`.  The plan will execute this command because I currently lack a supporting pose for the pickup location and I need to *pick* something from it.
           
           2.  **Pick Up Object:**  I'll then use arm `v4` to *pick* `v12`. I have identified action `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t9)` as the correct action to pick this `object` based on current state.
           
           3.  **Move Base to Placement:** The target `place` action has the arm located at `#q5`. So I need to move the robot base from `#q4` to `#q5`.
           
           4.  **Place Object:**  Finally, I will *place* object `v12` using arm `v4` at `#p2` on object `v18` with the action `(place v4 v12 #p2 #g2 #q5 #t10)`.
           
           **Key Considerations**
           
           *   `move_base` actions require `canmove()` to be true initially and will also alter this variable.
           *   I've made the key assumptions that there are no unsafe actions and that all approach trajectories are safe.
           * The plan must include *exact pose* coordinates.
           
           **Calculating a Suitable Target Pose (`#p2`)**
           
           I need to determine the precise location of `#p2` on `v18`.  I'll position it near the center of `v18`, with a reasonable offset.
           
           *   **Object Properties:** Object `v12` is relatively small, which informs the pose's position.
           *   **Bounding Boxes:**  `v18` has a bounding box, while `v12` also has bounding box relative to its origin `((-0.0415, -0.042), (0.0415, 0.042))`.
           *   **Surface Position:** Objects are currently at around a `z` of `0.8`, so the new `z` value will match.
           
           Based on this, I've selected the following coordinates for `#p2`: `x: 4.5`, `y: -0.3`, `z: 0.8`.
           
           **By following these steps and considering these constraints, I'm confident I can achieve the desired goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
