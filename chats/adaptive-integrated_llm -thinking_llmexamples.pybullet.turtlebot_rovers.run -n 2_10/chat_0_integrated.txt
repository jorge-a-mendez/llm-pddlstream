           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal that hinges on receiving images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`). My initial thought is to work backward, identifying how to achieve these sub-goals.  The initial state provides basic facts about robot configurations (`atconf`), storage availability (`free`), and object types. Key objects are the rovers (v12, v14), camera (v10), lander (v9), stores (v16), rocks (various v2 and v6 types).
           
           **Action Chains and Preconditions**
           
           To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, I need to utilize the `send_image` action. To invoke `send_image`, I need `haveimage`, and for that, I need to use the `take_image` action. The pre-conditions for these actions depend on *visible* and *communication* predicates ( `imagevisible` and `comvisible`). Similar logic applies to receiving analysis, needing the `send_analysis` action, which itself relies on the `sample_rock` action and `analyzed` predicates.
           
           **Configuration and Constraints**
           
           The critical obstacle is the interaction of "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" rule with the required action prerequisites. The list of allowed actions only includes self-loop `move` actions for rovers `v12` and `v14`.  This means I can't use `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, which are essential to reach `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           The problem also highlights the continuous parameters, especially the '#' ones in `imagevisible` and `comvisible`. These continuous parameters are the configurations. The continuous parameters for the configuration arguments for the rover cannot be changed from the initial `atconf` state. However, they are related. Also, since there are no `move` actions which are not self-loops, and all of these actions have the precondition that the rover is in a different configuration.
           
           **Unreachability and Conclusion**
           
           Given the provided constraints, it's impossible to reach the goal. The only actions available are self-loop `move` actions. There is no way to perform `take_image` or `sample_rock`, needed for the goal.
           
           Based on the explicit wording of the problem, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
