User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, 0.392), (0.169, 0.475)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.187, 0.399), (-0.089, 0.497)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.128, 0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.774, 0.634).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.043, 0.281), (0.055, 0.379)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.138, 0.448, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.461, 0.887).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.006, 0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.455, 0.89).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to craft a plan to position objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Given the starting conditions, where each object is supported by a base object (v9, v13, v15) respectively and positioned by the respective poses, and the objective to ensure all three are 'on' `v16`, I must design a strategy that adheres to the established rules of grasp and placement. According to the foundational axiom, `on(?o, ?r)` holds true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are valid.
           
           Initially, I'm analyzing the supporting configurations. The scene states that each object is supported at a pose labeled `#o2`. The prompt states that when placing objects at the same pose, each must be provided its own instance. I will use a different pose instance for each object, even if they share the name `#o2`.
           
           Since, in the initial state, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v8, #o2, v16)` are true. This means the objects must have a unique pose on `v16`. Since `v16` is not a dummy surface (its AABB is provided), I must ensure I am using its available space within the constraints for placing the objects.
           
           The basic approach is straightforward:
           1.  **Pick** an object from its current pose.
           2.  **Place** the object at a new pose located on surface `v16`.
           
           The robot has two arms: `v4` and `v6`. However, I am going to utilize the `v4` arm due to more specified `kin` predicates. The base of the robot remains stationary at `v3`, eliminating the need for base movements.
           
           Since `handempty(v4)` and `atbconf(v3)` are true, I can proceed with the pick and place steps. The required grasp and trajectories are considered given the problem statement.
           
           Given that my solution requires me to specify locations for the objects, and the requirement of distinct poses:
           *   I will select a suitable surface location on `v16` for each of the objects.
           *   I can calculate new poses on `v16` and ensure these placements meet the needs of the plan.
           
           Thus, based on the initial state of the problem, I will generate the following sequence of actions:
           
           ```
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Assessment of Plan Feasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a situation, and the user has pointed out a significant issue with the proposed plan. Essentially, the only valid action I have at my disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This boils down to moving the robot's base *to the same location* it's already at, using a trajectory.  Not exactly groundbreaking stuff, and frankly, a bit pointless. The state change is minimal and the robot can't move.
           
           The state of `atbconf(v3)` is unchanged because the robot is not moving. `canmove()` becomes false because there are no trajectories.
           
           The real problem lies in the goal and the initial state. I'm aiming to achieve `on(v8, v16) AND on(v12, v16) AND on(v14, v16)`.  Translated, this means I need to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`)  onto the surface `v16`, meaning they must be supported by that surface.  
           
           Right now, they're supported by `v11`. To get them onto `v16`, I'd need to use a `pick` action to remove them from `v11`, and then a `place` action to put them on `v16`.  Classic manipulation planning.
           
           However, the only action I *can* use is that useless base movement.  I have **no** `pick` actions, and I have **no** `place` actions.  This means I'm utterly incapable of modifying the initial state to reach the goal. I can't interact with any of the objects at all, let alone move them.  Therefore, with this action set, the goal is simply **unachievable**. This plan is fundamentally flawed.
