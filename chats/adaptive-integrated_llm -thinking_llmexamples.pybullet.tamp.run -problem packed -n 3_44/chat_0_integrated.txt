User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.138, 0.448, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.461, 0.887).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.187, 0.399), (-0.089, 0.497)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.006, 0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.455, 0.89).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.128, 0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.774, 0.634).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.043, 0.281), (0.055, 0.379)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, 0.392), (0.169, 0.475)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan to Achieve the Unreachable**
           
           My objective is to move objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16, as specified by the `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` goals.  Currently, these objects are at poses v9, v13, and v15, supported by surface v11. My strategy boils down to a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions, leveraging the two available robot arms, v4 and v6.
           
           To start, I analyze the individual goals:
           
           *   **For v8:** I need to `pick` it from pose v9 and `place` it onto v16 at a new pose (`#o2_v8`), satisfying `on(v8, v16)`.
           *   **For v12:** I have to `pick` it from pose v13 and `place` it onto v16 at a new pose (`#o2_v12`), to achieve `on(v12, v16)`.
           *   **For v14:**  I must `pick` it from pose v15 and `place` it on v16 at a new pose (`#o2_v14`), fulfilling `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           To ensure the objects fit on the surface, I need to find three distinct non-overlapping placement locations for each object in the provided bounding box, and for simplicity, I choose to align them and place them at x = -0.05, x = 0.0, and x = 0.05 along the surface. All the objects are placed at the surface height, z=0.781.
           
           My initial plan for this sequence of actions is:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:**  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #atraj_v8_pick)`
           2.  **Place v8:** `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #atraj_v8_place)`
           3.  **Pick v12:** `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #atraj_v12_pick)`
           4.  **Place v12:** `place(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #atraj_v12_place)`
           5.  **Pick v14:** `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #atraj_v14_pick)`
           6.  **Place v14:** `place(v4, v14, #o2_v14, #o1, v3, #atraj_v14_place)`
           
           However, the key problem: **I can only use the `move_base` action instance provided.** This severely restricts my actions. The rules state I can only use action instances *exactly* in the provided list. These actions are completely insufficient to move or place any objects and cannot even satisfy any of the preconditions needed to move objects to new poses.
           
           Because I can only use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I am unable to use `pick` or `place` and I must declare that the given goal is unreachable.
