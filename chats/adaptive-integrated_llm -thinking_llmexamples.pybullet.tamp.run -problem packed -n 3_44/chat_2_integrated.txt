User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.086, 0.392), (0.169, 0.475)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.187, 0.399), (-0.089, 0.497)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.128, 0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.774, 0.634).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.043, 0.281), (0.055, 0.379)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.138, 0.448, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.461, 0.887).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.006, 0.33, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.455, 0.89).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to arrange these three objects – v8, v12, and v14 – on v16.  This means getting each one *on* that surface, which boils down to finding a suitable spot and getting them there. I need to make sure I'm following the rules set by this system.
           
           Currently, v12 sits on v13 (supported by v11), v14's on v15 (also supported by v11), and v8's on v9 (supported by v11). The only viable placements are at a designated pose, `#o2`, which must be supported on v16. It looks like the system wants a move-place scheme with a base movement.
           
           Here’s the step-by-step:
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** I start by going to a base configuration `#o3` (which the system needs to determine). Then, I'll execute the following steps for each object:
               *   **Pick:** Use the robot arm (v4) to pick up the object from its current location.
               *   **Place:** Then, I’ll position the object at `#o2` on v16 using the robot arm.
           
           **Object-Specific Plans**
           
           *   **v12:**
               1.  Pick v12 from v13.
                   *   Action: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
                   *   Assumptions: Everything is safe and the base is at the appropriate configuration.
               2.  Place v12 at `#o2` on v16.
                   *   Action: `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
                   *   Assumption: The pose is a valid placement point with support.
           
           *   **v14:**
               1.  Pick v14 from v15.
                   *   Action: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
                   *   Assumptions: Everything is safe and base setup is the same.
               2.  Place v14 at `#o2` on v16.
                   *   Action: `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
                   *   Assumption: The pose is a valid placement point with support.
           
           *   **v8:**
               1.  Pick v8 from v9.
                   *   Action: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
                   *   Assumptions: Everything is safe and base setup is consistent.
               2.  Place v8 at `#o2` on v16.
                   *   Action: `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
                   *   Assumption: The pose is a valid placement point with support.
           
           **Addressing Parameters and Constraints**
           
           Now, about those parameters and constraints...
           
           *   `#o3`:  I need to get the base of the robot to a specific configuration which the planning system would compute and the robot will go to `bconf`.  I'll start with moving to a bconf with `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           *   `#o2`:  This is a *key pose* where objects need to be placed, so I need to provide continuous values for each object on `#o2`. I've chosen poses for each object to satisfy `supported(vX, #o2, v16)` by putting them on a spot on the v16 with a height of 0.781. The height will remain consistent across all three objects.
           
           **Placement Location Determination:**
           
           I have to carefully select distinct spots on surface v16 for placement and make sure no object collides with another or overlaps the borders of v16.  Based on my calculations, I've selected specific x-y coordinates for each object to make sure I'm good. Here’s how I'm spreading things out, assuming a height of 0.781 for each:
           
           *   v12: `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   v14: `(0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   v8:   `(0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
