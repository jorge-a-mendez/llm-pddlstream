           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.098 x 0.098. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's a large area where it can be placed stably. I will try to place the object in various positions and orientations on the surface. Since the object is square, its orientation doesn't change its bounding box, but I will still vary the `theta` for completeness and to cover the solution space. I'll focus on placing the object within the bounds of the surface, which are from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. Given the object's half-size of about 0.049, the center of the object must be between -0.135 + 0.049 = -0.086 and 0.135 - 0.049 = 0.086.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           I now need to place a new object, `ID: 5`, which is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0988 x 0.0988. This object is very similar in size to the previous object (`ID: 4`).
           I have one successful placement for `ID: 4` at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means `ID: 4` is currently located at the center of surface 0.
           Therefore, when placing `ID: 5`, I must ensure it does not collide with `ID: 4`. The half-size of `ID: 4` is approximately 0.0491 and the half-size of `ID: 5` is approximately 0.0494. If `ID: 4` is at (0,0), its AABB is approximately `[(-0.0491, -0.0491), (0.0491, 0.0491)]`.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of `ID: 5` must be far enough from (0,0). The minimum distance between centers to avoid collision if axes are aligned is sum of half-extents. For x and y, this would be 0.0491 + 0.0494 = 0.0985. So the center of `ID: 5` needs to be outside the square `[-0.0985, 0.0985]` in both x and y from the origin.
           
           I will try to place `ID: 5` in the corners or edges of the surface, far from the origin. The valid range for the center of `ID: 5` is approximately `[-0.135 + 0.0494, 0.135 - 0.0494]`, which is `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`. This means the previous calculation (0.0985) for collision avoidance is greater than the allowed range for placing the new object. This means it is impossible to place object 5 without colliding with object 4, if object 4 is at (0,0).
           
           However, the problem statement says "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j". It does not say that the current placement of ID 4 is fixed. It just says it's a "success". The wording "The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles." implies this is just a record of valid options, not necessarily the current state of the world.
           
           Given this, I should try to place `ID: 5` in the center of the surface, as it is a stable placement, assuming `ID: 4` is not there. If `ID: 4` *is* there, the placement might fail, which would give me more information about the scene. But based on the current instructions, I have no information that `ID: 4` is actually on the surface right now and thus blocking the center. I should proceed as if the successful placement means *a* valid placement, not *the* current placement. If I receive a failure, then I'll know `ID: 4` is indeed occupying that space. For now, I'll aim for diverse, stable placements without considering the previous object as a permanent obstacle.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains a single square surface (0.27 x 0.27) at the origin.
           Now, I need to place `ID: 6`, which is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0895 x 0.0895.
           I have two successful placements:
           - `ID: 4` at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (half-size ~0.0491)
           - `ID: 5` at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (half-size ~0.0494)
           
           The problem states "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           The feedback indicates that both `ID: 4` and `ID: 5` were successfully placed at (0,0) *in the previous step*. This is contradictory, as two objects cannot occupy the exact same space. This implies that the 'successes' listed are potential valid placements, not necessarily the current state of the world with all objects simultaneously placed.
           
           However, the phrasing "if you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." suggests that if I propose a placement for object J that collides with object I, it will fail, and I will then know object I is there.
           
           Given that *both* `ID: 4` and `ID: 5` are "successful" at (0,0), and they are of similar size, it's impossible for both to be there simultaneously. This implies that the list of 'successes' is a list of *possible* stable placements, not necessarily the current state of the world after all previous requests. If I propose a placement for `ID: 6` at (0,0) and it fails, then I'll learn that the center is indeed occupied.
           
           For now, I will proceed with placing `ID: 6` as if the center is available, trying diverse placements, similar to how I approached `ID: 5`. The half-size of `ID: 6` is approximately 0.0447. The allowed center range for `ID: 6` is `[-0.135 + 0.0447, 0.135 - 0.0447]`, which is `[-0.0903, 0.0903]`.
