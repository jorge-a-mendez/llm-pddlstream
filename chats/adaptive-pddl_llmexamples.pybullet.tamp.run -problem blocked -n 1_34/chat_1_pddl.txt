           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, some of which are graspable and stackable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are handempty. The robot is currently at base configuration `v3` and arm configurations `v5` (for `v4`) and `v7` (for `v6`). There are three objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` with known poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v16` respectively. These objects are supported by `v11` and `v14`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that evaluates to true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. The object `v8` is of type `v17`. If `v8` can be considered `?green` then the goal needs `on(v8, v18)`. `on(v8, v18)` expands to `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. It is also stated that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This implies that if `v8` were at `#o2`, it would be on `v18`.
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the pose of any object or the 'on' predicate. It only changes the base configuration from `v3` to `v3` which effectively means it moves the base to the same location. This action does not contribute to achieving the goal of placing `v8` on `v18`.
           Since the current state does not satisfy `on(v8, v18)` and the only allowed action cannot change the object's location, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The object `v8` is currently on `v11` at pose `v9`. The goal requires `v8` to be on `v18`. The action `pick` and `place` are needed to move `v8` from `v11` to `v18`. However, no such action instances are provided. The only provided action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` does not allow for moving objects.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.
