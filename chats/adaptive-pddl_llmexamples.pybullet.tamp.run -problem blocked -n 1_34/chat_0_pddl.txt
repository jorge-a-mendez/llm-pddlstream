           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable and stackable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at pose `v9` on `v11`, `v12` is at pose `v13` on `v14`, and `v15` is at pose `v16` on `v11`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So, `?green` could be either `v8` or `v12`.
           We also have `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`.
           The goal requires an object of type `v17` to be `on` `v18`.
           `on(?o, ?r)` is true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true.
           Currently, `v8` is on `v11` (supported by `v11` at `v9` and at `v9`).
           `v12` is on `v14` (supported by `v14` at `v13` and at `v13`).
           `v15` is on `v11` (supported by `v11` at `v16` and at `v16`).
           
           Looking at the available actions, only `move_base v3 v3 #o0` is present. This action moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of objects on surfaces, nor does it allow the robot to pick or place objects.
           Since the `pick` and `place` actions are not available (i.e., no valid instances are given), and no actions that directly change the `on` predicate are available, it is impossible to move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
