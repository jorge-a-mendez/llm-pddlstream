(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, with dimensions about 0.08 x 0.08) on a rectangular surface (AABB, dimensions -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y).  A placement is stable if the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's bounding box. Given that the object is nearly square, its orientation (theta) technically doesn't impact stability because the bounding box dimensions remain constant regardless of rotation.  However, to add some diversity to our placements (as requested), I'm still going to vary `theta`.
           
           First, I figured out the valid region for the object's center `(x, y)` to ensure containment. The object's half-extents are about 0.04 (calculated from the object's dimensions). The surface's inner boundaries become `-0.135 + 0.04 = -0.095` and `0.135 - 0.04 = 0.095`. So, `x` and `y` must fall within `[-0.095, 0.095]` to guarantee the object stays within the surface.
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll use a 7x7 grid for my `x` and `y` coordinates.  I did the math to find the even spacing for the grid.  I then varied `theta` for each grid point, cycling through the most common angles:  0, pi/4, pi/2, etc. (eight angles in total).  This generates 49 points (7x7).
           
           To get to 50, I added one final placement at the center of the valid area `(0, 0)` with a final theta.  This ensures I get the correct count and some variation within the placements.  The surface index will, of course, be zero for all placements since there's only one surface.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object ID 5**
           
           I've successfully received feedback indicating that placing object ID 4 at `(0, 0.0, -0.09482614127258315, -0.09482614127258314)` was collision-free. This information is primarily for my internal model and future object placements, particularly given that no other fixed obstacles were specified.
           
           Now, my task is to place object ID 5.  I observe that the surface it will occupy is an AABB defined by  `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`, matching the surface for the previously placed object. Object 5 has nearly square extents of `0.08638482193169` x `0.08638482193169006`.  This means rotations will only minimally affect the required containment checks. I'll still incorporate diverse rotation angles to improve the placement diversity.
           
           **Key Considerations and Constraints:**
           
           1.  **Containment within Surface 0**: Object 5 must remain within the AABB of the surface.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance with Object 4**:  Object 4 is now a fixed obstacle that object 5 needs to avoid. Object 4 resides in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           **Determining the Valid Region for Object 5's Center:**
           
           *   **Surface Bounds:** The x-coordinate of the center of object 5 must lie in the range `[-0.091807589034155, 0.091807589034155]`. The y-coordinate must lie within `[-0.09180758903415497, 0.09180758903415497]`.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** Calculating the collision region with object 4, which has been successfully placed with the center at `(-0.09482614127258315, -0.09482614127258314)`.  The forbidden zone (where the centers of the two objects cannot be) is computed as follows: a circular area around object 4 with a radius equal to the sum of the radius of the two object. Then, compute the area from the valid range (where the coordinates are allowed) which does not include the forbidden zone.
           *   The forbidden rectangular region is determined and has its top left at `(-0.091807589034155, -0.01145987157932126)` and its bottom right at `(-0.0114598715793213, -0.09180758903415497)`.
           *   We can say that we need the entire area except for the collision rectangular region. The x-axis does not contain a collision and the Y is forbidden.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           To generate 50 distinct placements, I'll divide the available area into two sub-regions:
           
           1.  Region 1: The rectangle above the collision region, which has bounds:
               *   `x in [-0.091807589034155, 0.091807589034155]`
               *   `y in [-0.01145987157932126, 0.09180758903415497]`
           2.  Region 2: The rectangle right of the collision region, which has bounds:
               *   `x in [-0.0114598715793213, 0.091807589034155]`
               *   `y in [-0.09180758903415497, -0.01145987157932126]`
           
           I'll create a 6x5 grid of points (30 placements) in Region 1 and a 4x5 grid of points (20 placements) in Region

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while keeping in mind two existing obstacles (objects 4 and 5). Surface 0 is basically a square, and I know the locations and sizes of the obstacles. First, I’ll calculate the valid placement area for object 6, which is basically the surface area. I determine that I need to avoid collisions by defining forbidden zones based on the obstacle AABBs.
           
           After detailed calculations, I realize the "forbidden" region makes an "L" shape on the left side of the surface.  I'll define some effective forbidden regions and calculate the valid placements for Object 6 to avoid overlaps with the already placed obstacles.
           
           I'll divide the placement strategy into regions: A big rectangle on the right and another small top-left section.
           I decide to generate a 7x7 grid (49 placements) for the right rectangular region to provide good coverage of placements where object 6 can be.  And one point (1 placement) in the top-left area. I get a total of 50 points by this calculation.
           Then for diversity, I cycle through the rotations `[0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2]` for each of the placements.
           
           This strategy should yield stable and collision-free placements.
