User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding box 0, with a narrow central corridor (bounding box 5). There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including two larger ones (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). I will try to place the robot in open areas, avoiding the boundaries and the central corridor. I will also make sure the proposed positions are within the max_range of 4 from the target point. Since the room is relatively small, I will sample a grid of points within the room and filter them based on the maximum range from the target.
