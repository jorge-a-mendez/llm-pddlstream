           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. After analyzing the goal's structure, it requires achieving several conditions: receiving images for four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), analyzing and receiving analyses for one rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`. I've determined I can use the existing states.
           
           I've examined the available actions (`send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, along with supporting actions such as `calibrate` and `take_image`) and their preconditions to formulate a plan. I determined a sequence that would work, using rover `v14` for image and most analysis tasks, and `v12` to handle the one needed analysis to avoid the need to `drop_rock`. I have determined each needed action, its required configuration, and how it satisfied the given constraints.
           
           However, a critical constraint arises. I was informed that only a specific list of *valid action instances* could be used. Any action not explicitly listed is forbidden. After analyzing the available action instances — which include only `move` and `drop_rock` — I've concluded that the goal cannot be achieved. The available actions do not include instances of `send_image` or `send_analysis`, which are necessary to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the specified constraints and valid action instances.
