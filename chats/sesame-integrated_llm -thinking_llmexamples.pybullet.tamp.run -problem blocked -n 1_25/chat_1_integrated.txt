           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of Reasoning and Plan**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to achieve this `new-axiom@0()` goal. The crux of the matter is getting an object onto a specific surface, and I'm treating this as a straightforward pick-and-place problem, where the key is ensuring that the final placement satisfies the 'on' predicate.  I am an expert, so I know how to break down complex goals into smaller steps.
           
           First, I examined the `new-axiom@0()` definition.  It boils down to having an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`.  Since I have a starting state where *both* `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`, I can focus on moving either one. I chose `v8`. The initial setup shows `v8` is on a pose, `supported` by the surface and that the pose is already defined. All I have to do is make that pose an *actual* pose.
           
           I've identified the necessary preconditions, focusing on the actions that will be required to achieve them.  I will use 'pick' and 'place' actions. I need to move the object, `v8`, from its current pose (`v9`) to the target pose (`#p0`) supported by the table.  The initial state provides necessary information for the placement, so I just need to figure out the right way to pick.
           
           The first step is moving the robot base to the right spot, so I will define steps like, first move the base, pick the object, move the base again, and then place it on the surface.
           
           To satisfy preconditions I've created a plan: move the base to the pick configuration, pick the object, move the base, and place.
           
           Then, the final piece is computing the continuous parameters for `#p0`, which is a continuous parameter that represents the final placement location and configuration. The object `v8` at the goal configuration must also satisfy preconditions.  Because the `supported` predicate is already in place. The continuous value I assigned to `#p0` will ensure the object is *fully* within the bounds of `v18`, its correct height, and the correct orientation - all essential for a stable placement and to meet requirements.
           
           Here's the planned action sequence and the continuous parameter I'll be specifying:
           
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#q0` (the pick configuration).
           2.  Pick `v8` from `v9` at `#q0`.
           3.  Move base from `#q0` to `#q1` (the place configuration).
           4.  Place `v8` at `#p0` at `#q1`.
           
           --Poses--:
           
           `#p0`:  (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)
           
           And because I have placed `v8` at `#p0`, and I know that `v8` has a pose value in the initial setup, I know it works. The whole plan, therefore, satisfies all the initial conditions. Therefore I can be confident it will reach the final goal, and this placement will meet all the preconditions.
