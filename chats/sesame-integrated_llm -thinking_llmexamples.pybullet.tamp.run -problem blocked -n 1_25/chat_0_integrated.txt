           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.485, -0.425), (-4.387, -0.327)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.436, -0.376, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.899, 0.439).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axioms, it's clear we need to make sure an object, let's call it `?green`, is both "on" another object, `v18`, and has a certain "type."  The initial state tells us that `type(?green, v17)` is already satisfied for objects `v8` and `v12`. I'll pick `v8` for now. Therefore, my immediate goal is to get `v8` *on* `v18`.
           
           To be "on," according to the axiom, `v8` needs to be supported by, and be at a valid pose (#o2), that includes on the correct area of `v18`. A quick look at the initial state shows that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` already holds. So the challenge is to get `v8` to that `#o2` pose where it is correctly supported. Right now, `v8` is at another pose, `v9`, as shown by `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           
           To move `v8`, I've got a couple of actions available: `(pick ...)` and `(place ...)`. I can't directly *place* `v8` because it's not currently held. Therefore, a `pick` action must come first.  The preconditions for `pick` include the arm being at the base configuration (#o3) that lets it execute the `pick` action.  This means I need to move the robot base from its current configuration, `v3`, to that suitable base configuration (#o3) using `move_base`.
           
           Let's break it down:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I need to use the `move_base` action to get the robot base to the correct position for picking up `v8`. The initial base configuration is `v3` and `#o3` is the target base config.  This move requires the robot base to be free to move and at `v3` to begin with which are all true. So this makes it straightforward. The initial setup ensures `move_base` action goes from `v3` to `#o3`.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Then, the `pick` action will grasp `v8`. I must ensure that `#o3` is reachable by the arm (base configuration reachable by the arm). The preconditions for `pick` are kinematically suitable, and that the arm is hand-empty, and base is at configuration `#o3`. These are also straightforward. Assuming the collision conditions are acceptable, I can now execute `pick v4 v8 v9 ...`.
           
           3.  **Place:** Finally, with `v8` held, the plan calls for the `place` action. I must ensure the arm can get to the pose `#o2` on `v18`. I need to guarantee that there will be no collisions (safe pose and approach and trajectory). The relevant initial information gives me `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. With the safe configurations, this places `v8` in the desired location.
               I assume all safety conditions are met. I need to get the coordinates of the pose `#o2` on `v18`, so I must determine a suitable coordinate value to place `v8`.
               I analyzed the bounding box sizes and determined a valid placement for `v8`.
           
           The plan satisfies the goal, and is therefore optimal.
           I have arrived at:
           ```
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           ```
           
           --Poses--:
           
           ```
           #o2 (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)
           ```
