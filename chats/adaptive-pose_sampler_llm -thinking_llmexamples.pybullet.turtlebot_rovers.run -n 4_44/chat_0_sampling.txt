User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           My primary goal is to determine three suitable base positions for a robot, adhering to several constraints: the robot's base must be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target point; the robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target; the robot must avoid collisions with fixed obstacles; and the base must have a clear line of sight (LOS) to the target. Additionally, the robot's (x, y) coordinates are confined to the range of [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           The initial strategy involves a thorough scene understanding. I’ll begin by meticulously analyzing the provided Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to build a mental representation of the environment. This analysis will highlight the essential structural elements, including:
           
           *   **Outer Room Boundaries:** Defined by AABBs 0-4, these boundaries limit the robot's movement within the space described by x and y coordinates within [-2.5, 2.5].
           *   **Central Vertical Divider:**  A critical element represented by AABB 5, it forms a barrier at approximately x=0.  This divider becomes the most significant obstacle when considering the target's position. Any potential robot base positions need to be strategically chosen in relation to this divider.
           *   **Other Obstacles:** The remaining AABBs (6-22) represent scattered obstacles of various sizes.
           
           Once I have a complete environmental view, I will generate candidate positions for the robot, using the following methodology:
           
           *   **Distance Constraint:** Select candidate positions within a radius of 2 units from the target point.
           *   **Boundary Compliance:** Ensure the robot positions remain within the allowed (x, y) coordinate range of [-2.5, 2.5].
           *   **Collision Detection:** Validate candidate positions by checking for collisions with known AABBs using the standard range test.
           *   **Line-of-Sight Verification:**  Confirm the absence of obstructing obstacles between a candidate position and the target point. Initially, I will achieve this by visual inspection to avoid more advanced raycasting methods.
           
           For diversity, the candidate positions will be spread around the target point, using simple geometric directions.
           
           With this plan, I should be able to create good positions.
           
           **Analysis and Position Selection for Target (1.5, -1.0)**
           
           For the target point (1.5, -1.0), which is in the right half of the room, my strategy focuses on the following:
           
           The key structural element is the central vertical divider at x=0. Given the target's location, the robot's position *must* be on the right side of this divider as well. This will prevent line-of-sight occlusion.
           
           The three proposed positions are:
           
           1.  **(2.4, -1.0)**.  Situated to the right of the target and near the right boundary. This position satisfies the required distance and coordinate constraints. It also has a clear line of sight to the target and is in the right half of the room.
           2.  **(1.5, -2.3)**.  Located below the target, close to the bottom wall. Again, it adheres to all constraints: distance, boundary limits, and line of sight. Also it is right of the central divider.
           3.  **(0.1, -1.0)**.  Positioned to the left of the target point but crucially to the *right* of the central divider (x=0). By selecting a small margin past the divider, I guarantee line of sight.
           
           Each position was subjected to a thorough validation process to ensure:
           
           *   That the positions are within the bounds of the coordinate limits.
           *   That each distance between the candidate and target point is within the max range.
           *   No obstacles are in the line of sight.
           
           This methodical and careful approach resulted in the selection of three diverse, valid and safe positions for the robot base.
