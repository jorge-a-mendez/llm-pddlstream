           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.032, -0.242, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.378, 0.926).

           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.094, 0.482), (-0.001, 0.576)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to successfully place three objects, v8, v12, and v14, onto surface v16. These objects are initially located on surface v11. To achieve this, I need to generate a plan that leverages the available actions and preconditions within the given environment.
           
           Based on the problem definition, I understand that the primary action I must take is to move these objects from v11 to v16. This necessitates a strategic sequence of actions involving the robot's base movement and arm manipulations.
           
           First, I recognize that the robot, currently at base configuration v3, must move to base configuration #o3. This is a critical step because the `kin` predicates indicate that #o3 is a reachable configuration for the robot's arm to manipulate the desired objects. I can accomplish this initial move using `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           
           Once the base is appropriately positioned, I will implement a series of `pick` and `place` actions. To ensure that the robot's arm is unobstructed, each pick and place action will involve the same configurations. The key to this is understanding that #o3 is set for the configurations. I will proceed with the following sequence:
           
           1.  Pick v8 from its current pose at v9.
           2.  Place v8 onto v16 at a new, distinct pose, which I will denote as p_v8.
           3.  Pick v12 from its current pose at v13.
           4.  Place v12 onto v16 at a new, distinct pose, which I will denote as p_v12.
           5.  Pick v14 from its current pose at v15.
           6.  Place v14 onto v16 at a new, distinct pose, which I will denote as p_v14.
           
           During the placement phase, I am aware that placing all three objects at the *same* symbolic pose will cause an issue. I need to handle this because I will have 3 distinct continuous poses for v8, v12, and v14.
           
           Based on this logic, I derive the following final plan and poses:
           
           --Plan--:
           ((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))
           ((pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v8 p_v8 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v12 p_v12 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v14 p_v14 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v16): (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v12 v16): (0.05 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v14 v16): (-0.05 0.0 0.781 0.0)
