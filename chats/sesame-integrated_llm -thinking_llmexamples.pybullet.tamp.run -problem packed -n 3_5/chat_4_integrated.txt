           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q4', '#t10'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q4', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q2', '#t12'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g2', '#q2', '#t2'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q3', '#t16'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g1', '#q3', '#t3'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q1', '#t15'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g1', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q5', '#t14'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g0', '#q5', '#t5'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q0', '#t13'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v14', 'p5', 'v8', 'p3')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           The objective is to achieve the goal `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The challenge lies in avoiding a previously encountered collision when placing objects on the surface `v16`. Specifically, placing `v8` at `p3` and `v14` at `p5` was problematic. Initial state shows the objects starting at `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, each supported by `v11`.  The key poses available for placement are `p3`, `p4`, and `p5` which are for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` respectively, and the flexible pose `#o2`. The issue is which specific locations within those poses are safe.
           
           **Collision Analysis and AABB Reasoning**
           
           Based on prior failure, I recognize that the fixed poses, `p3`, `p4` and `p5`, were potentially conflicting for some object pairings, so that poses configuration needs adjustment. I thoroughly examined the object's AABBs relative to their pose centers, using object extents for x-ranges, which would let me decide placement feasibility.  I performed an AABB collision check, but I struggled to reconcile the reported collision with the calculated non-overlapping ranges. This made me suspect the collision detection might be more nuanced, involving actual geometry and orientation or that I am not understanding the coordinate reference properly.
           
           **Proposed Plan**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  Begin by setting the robot's base configuration to `#o3` (which requires a single `move_base` action if the initial base is at a different location).
           2.  **Object Pickup and Placement**
               *   Pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `p3` on `v16`.
               *   Pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `p4` on `v16`.
               *   Pick `v14` from `v15` and place it at `#o2` on `v16`. A continuous value is defined for #o2 as `(-0.1, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           
           **Justification for Choices and Implementation Notes**
           
           The plan specifically addresses the collision issue by placing `v8` and `v12` at `p3` and `p4` respectively, assuming the previous failure was specifically due to using `p5` for `v14` placement. By locating `v14` using the `(-0.1, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` coordinate relative to the table surface `v16`, the placement will be collision-free. I analyzed each of these steps and their preconditions to make sure they are achievable in the initial state and are not blocked by the use of the previous actions. The plan will also need to move the robot's base once to `#o3` before the pick and place cycles. The costs for `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` must be accounted for by the planner.
