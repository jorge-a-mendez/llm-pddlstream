           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q6', '#t23'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g3', '#q6', '#t19'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q6', '#q11', '#t35'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g3', '#q11', '#t28'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q11', '#q7', '#t32'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g4', '#q7', '#t20'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q7', '#q12', '#t34'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p6', '#g4', '#q12', '#t29'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q12', '#q8', '#t33'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g5', '#q8', '#t21'))

           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p7', '#g5', '#q13', '#t30'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v12', 'p6', '#g4', 'v8', 'p3')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g4', '#q7', '#t20').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **The Challenge: Orchestrating the Objects**
           
           My current task is to devise a plan to place three objects—`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`—onto a designated surface, `v16`. The initial state reveals the robot arm (`v4`) is ready and empty-handed, situated at `aconf v5`. The robot base is currently positioned at `bconf v3`. These objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, are currently resting on surface `v11` (likely the tabletop) at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15`, respectively. My ultimate objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           Previously, a plan failed during a `pick` action. The specific error message indicated a collision during the approach phase of `v12` to a target pose (`p6`), with `v8` at pose `p3`. This suggests that the placement of objects on `v16` needs careful consideration to avoid future collisions.
           
           I need to develop a strategy that bypasses the collision issue by finding more appropriate positions on `v16` for these objects. I must use available poses on v16: p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, and the variable pose #o2, with the crucial consideration that the poses I choose allow for unobstructed manipulation. The previous plan tried to place `v8` on pose `p3` and subsequently `v12` on `p6`, leading to a conflict. This error suggests that objects cannot be placed too closely or that the pick approach paths for the robot were intersecting with already placed items.
           
           My solution: I will pick each object from the table and place them onto the designated surface `v16` at new poses I will assign. I will use unique `#o2` poses with specific continuous values for each object on the surface. These poses will need to be spread out sufficiently to allow for collision-free picking and placing. Specifically, I decided that the objects need to be sufficiently separated to prevent contact by positioning them along the x-axis with appropriate spacing. I will assign an x position of `-0.08` for `v8` (`#o2_v8_on_v16`), `0` for `v12` (`#o2_v12_on_v16`), and `0.08` for `v14` (`#o2_v14_on_v16`).
           
           The plan will comprise a sequence of 'pick' and 'place' actions: First, the robot moves to base configuration `#o3`. Then, the robot picks `v8` from pose `v9`, placing it at the assigned position. The same process is repeated for `v12` and `v14`. This ensures each object is placed independently, minimizing potential for collision during the placement phase. The robot is now ready to pick and place at the required configuration. The entire strategy assumes that the initial base config `v3` can transition to `#o3`, or that the robot is currently placed correctly.
           
           Plan Steps:
           1.  Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` from `v9`, and place it at `#o2_v8_on_v16`
           3.  Pick `v12` from `v13`, and place it at `#o2_v12_on_v16`
           4.  Pick `v14` from `v15`, and place it at `#o2_v14_on_v16`
           
           This plan addresses the collision issue and provides a feasible and safe solution for object placement.
