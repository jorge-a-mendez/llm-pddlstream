(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for generating 50 stable placements for the specified object (ID 4) on surface 0. My goal is to ensure each placement is physically valid and generates a diverse set of positions and rotations. The object is a square (0.07069 x 0.07069), and the surface is a 2D AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A placement is defined as (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate of object center, y-coordinate of object center).
           
           First, I need to define the valid region where the object's center can be located on the surface while ensuring full containment. Since the object has dimensions of 0.07069, its half-width and half-height are both 0.035345.  The surface's usable area is therefore restricted to -0.135 + 0.035345 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.035345 and -0.135 + 0.035345 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.035345.  This simplifies to -0.099655 <= x <= 0.099655 and -0.099655 <= y <= 0.099655.
           
           Because the object is square, any rotation angle (theta) will not change its AABB; I can vary the rotation for more diversity.  Now, to generate 50 unique placements:
           
           1.  **Generate a Grid:** I will use a 7x7 grid of x and y coordinates within the calculated valid ranges. I will use the x values from -0.09 to 0.09 with an interval of 0.03. I will do the same for the y coordinates. This grid will provide a good distribution of the positions.
           2.  **Angle Diversity:** I will set the rotation angle (theta) to one of the following angles for the grid placement. I will repeat this cycle for every 10 values. Theta values will be `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi`
           3. **Add the Last Placement:** The 50th placement is placed at the center of the surface `(0, 0)` with a final distinct rotation of `math.pi/8` to achieve a unique and diverse set.
           
           Each of these coordinates satisfy the containment criteria. Since the object is square, this ensures the stability of each placement, providing a comprehensive and diverse array of object poses.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing object ID 5, ensuring 50 stable and collision-free configurations on Surface 0.  I'll leverage the knowledge from successfully placing object 4, but I need to make some key adjustments due to its presence.
           
           First, I've calculated the valid (x, y) center range for object 5 based on its dimensions (0.076, 0.076) and surface dimensions (0.27, 0.27).  The calculations tell me I have approximately `[-0.096, 0.096]` as a valid range.
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid of potential center points and varying the rotation angle (theta).  I'll start with a 7x7 grid in the valid range, which will give me 49 points. I selected `x_coords = [-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` and `y_coords = [-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]`.
           
           However, the tricky part is avoiding collisions with object 4, which is currently at (-0.09, -0.09) with dimensions (0.070, 0.070). I calculate the colliding region. The AABB of obj 4's location overlaps with any points that have a y or x coordinate value of `[-0.09, -0.06, -0.03]`. I'll carefully check that. I must avoid placing object 5 too close.
           
           To ensure non-collision, I'll restrict myself to points outside this colliding range:
           `x_coords = [0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` and `y_coords = [0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` or combine x with the y range that is non-colliding (i.e., `x = [-0.09, -0.06, -0.03]` with the y values `[0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` to generate additional locations). This yields 40 non-colliding placements.
           To create a grid of (x,y) that avoids collision with object 4, I will use:
           
           `valid_centers = []`
           `for y in y_coords:`
             `for x in x_coords:`
               `# Check if (x,y) causes collision with object 4 at (-0.09, -0.09)`
               `if abs(x + 0.09) < 0.073513 and abs(y + 0.09) < 0.073513:`
                 `# Collision, skip this point (x,y)`
                 `continue`
               `valid_centers.append((x, y))`
           
           I'll generate 40 (x, y) points in this way.
           
           I'll assign each center point a different angle from the set `[0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi, 5*pi/4, 3*pi/2, 7*pi/4, pi/8, 3*pi/8]` (8 + 2 angles), giving me a diverse set of orientations.  This approach will create 50 unique placements: The first 40 using 8 different angles, and the final 10 with the remaining 10 distinct angles from a subset of the 40 original points. This ensures both diversity in position and prevents collisions.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for object ID 6, which is roughly a 0.098x0.098 square. Surface 0 is a 0.27x0.27 area centered at the origin. I've got to ensure the object fits entirely within the surface boundaries, considering its half-extents, which I've calculated. The valid region for the object's center is fairly straightforward, given the surface dimensions and object size: it must be within the range [-0.0858075, 0.0858075] for both x and y. Since it's a square, rotation doesn't change things.
           
           Now, the main challenge is collision avoidance with objects 4 and 5 already on the surface. Object 4's center is at (-0.09, -0.09), and object 5 is centered at (0, -0.09). I've got the collision conditions figured out: the absolute distance between object 6's center (x, y) and each of the other objects' centers must exceed the sum of their half-extents.
           
           To generate a starting set of candidates, I'm going to create a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the valid surface range. After running some thorough checks using a grid from -0.08, -0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08 and -0.08, -0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08 (15 grid points), I have determined 15 non-colliding (x, y) coordinates.
           
           Given that I need 50 placements, I'll assign different rotations (theta) to each of these 15 positions in an incremental way with `pi/16`. This way, I'm guaranteed to fulfill the 50 placement requirement with diverse positions and orientations. This seems like a solid, methodical approach.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get 50 stable placements of Object 7 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with the three other placed objects (IDs 4, 5, and 6).  I've got the dimensions and bounds: Object 7 is roughly square with half-extents of about 0.042, and the surface spans from -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y.  This means Object 7's center needs to be within a roughly centered square of side 0.185 (0.135 - 0.042 - (-0.135 + 0.042) = 0.185).
           
           First, I established the stability constraint using the surface bounds. Then, I tackled the collision detection, using the known centers and dimensions of the other objects. I used a simple AABB check (axis-aligned bounding box) to test for potential collisions. Based on the known dimensions, if the absolute difference in the x coordinate, and y coordinate, of a potential location for Object 7's center and another object's center is less than the sum of the half-extents, there's an overlap.
           
           I devised a grid-based approach. Initially, I created a coarse grid of candidate locations within the valid range and checked each grid point for collisions with the three existing objects. I determined points to be in one of four regions using the bounding box collision test. However, this produced only 8 valid placements.
           
           So, I refined the grid to capture more valid points, making its resolution higher. I then performed collision tests. I observed that the objects overlap on the corners.
           
           After that, I discovered 28 suitable locations. I now need 50. I can achieve the desired number using a combination of the given locations, and using angles. I can assign 28 to `theta = 0`. Then, for the first 22, I will use `theta = pi/4`.
