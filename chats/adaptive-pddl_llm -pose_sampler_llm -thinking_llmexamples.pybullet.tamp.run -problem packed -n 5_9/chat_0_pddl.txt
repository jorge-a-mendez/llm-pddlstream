(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (Surface 0). This surface is an AABB, which is easy to handle. I've got the object's dimensions:  `obj_sx` and `obj_sy`, roughly 0.1 meters each. Surface 0 is a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at (0,0). Stability means the object is *fully* contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           I need to account for rotation (`theta`). The object's effective dimensions will change based on its rotation, influencing the placement ranges for x and y. I'll need `W_eff` (effective width) and `H_eff` (effective height), which depend on `theta`, `obj_sx`, and `obj_sy`. The general formulas for those are stored, ready to be used.
           
           Since the object is almost square, I'll expect that the maximum effective bounding box will have dimensions roughly 0.14 x 0.14. My approach to placement is as follows:
           
           1.  **Generate a diverse set of angles**: I'll pick a range of `theta` values (from 0 to 7π/4, in π/8 increments) to ensure coverage of rotations.
           
           2.  **Calculate allowable regions**: For each `theta`, I'll determine the valid range for x and y, ensuring the rotated object stays within the surface boundaries. These calculations are straightforward: `x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max` based on `W_eff` and `H_eff`.
           
           3.  **Strategic Sampling within regions**: For each `theta`, I'll add the center placement as a default, because it's always valid. I will also sample x and y along the valid regions, placing points at the bounds and midpoint/center of the valid regions. I know that since the surface is quite large relative to the object, there will be room to add more and more points as needed, such as in this approach.
           
           4.  **Enforce Stability**:  I will ensure that all placements satisfy the containment condition with a bounding box check: the effective width/height divided by 2 must fit within the boundary of the surface.
           
           5.  **Stop at 50**: I'll keep generating placements until I have 50. I won't worry too much about duplicates because it's highly unlikely I'll have more than 50. Since I'm taking multiple angles for rotation, I will easily reach 50 valid placements.
           
           In conclusion, I'm aiming for a good spread of rotations and placements within those rotations to ensure coverage of the surface and get those 50 stable placements. I will generate a few candidates for each angle, and the code should be able to produce 50 (or more) placements based on this strategy.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new, nearly square object (ID 5) on the same surface I've used before. This surface is defined by the corners `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  Object 5 has dimensions of approximately `0.0808` by `0.0808`. I also know there's another object (ID 4) already placed at the center,  (0.0, 0.0), with no rotation; I need to avoid any collisions. Object 4's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) extends from approximately `-0.049` to `0.049` in both x and y.
           
           My strategy involves generating potential placement positions for object 5 and then checking for two conditions:
           1.  Is the rotated AABB of object 5 completely *within* the surface bounds?
           2.  Does the rotated AABB *overlap* the AABB of object 4?
           
           I'm starting by understanding how object 5's dimensions change based on rotation, and I'll focus on the extreme angles for potential rotations and sampling locations along the surface edges to ensure the necessary 50 stable positions. Since the object is almost square, I'll need to consider this in how I choose the best angles and sampling locations. At *theta = 0*, I'll figure out where the center of object 5 can safely sit. I also have to consider the rotation, the key challenge is figuring the `W_eff` and `H_eff` from different angles.
           
           For collision detection I first determine the AABB for object 5 after each rotation.
           I'll begin by calculating the effective width and height of object 5's AABB after accounting for a series of rotations. I know that since object 4 is centered, the region where I can safely place object 5 at *theta = 0* is limited to very thin strips near the edges. I calculate the possible range for the coordinates of object 5.
           
           To improve the chances of avoiding collisions, I will calculate possible candidate points. I'm taking the regions of the top, bottom, left and right sides of the surface. To sample possible placements I'll combine x and y with high-density samplings, I can consider a few points and corners for better placement selections.
           Since the object is close to square, the valid ranges for x and y are thin bands around object 4.
           For `theta = 0`, I'll compute those edge bands. Then I compute the center location for the valid region for `x` and `y`.
           
           I will iterate with a grid of test placements on the border regions, which is an ideal strategy that helps me find 50 safe placements quickly. I will calculate `W_eff` and `H_eff` for object 5 at different *theta* angles.
           I will determine the collision region for each orientation. To do that I will generate potential positions and checking `is_valid_placement` to make the filter correct.
           I'm ensuring that a few specific angles are considered.
           I will generate those positions using a grid approach and then filter out colliding positions. By varying my sampling of points on the x and y axes, and at angles of 0 through 3 * pi / 2, I can find placements that provide enough separation from object 4 to yield stable placements.
