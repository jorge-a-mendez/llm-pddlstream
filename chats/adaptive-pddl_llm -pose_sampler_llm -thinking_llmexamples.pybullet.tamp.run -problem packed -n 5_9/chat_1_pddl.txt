(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Stacking in `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get those five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) all stacked on v20. It's a straightforward pick-and-place strategy, keeping in mind the robot's capabilities and current setup. The ultimate goal is to satisfy the `on` predicate for each object concerning v20.  Based on the given axioms and the initial state, I know that if `supported(?o, ?p, v20)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true, then `on(?o, v20)` is true. So, I need to figure out where each object is and where it needs to go, according to their `supported` fact, and then, using available actions, bring them there.
           
           Currently, all five objects are perched on v11. However, each object is associated with a target `pose` parameter `#o2` where `supported` is true with v20. The `kin` facts indicate v4 is the available arm, v6 is also available, but the `kin` facts do not support the operation of arm v6. So, the core of my plan is this: use arm v4 to pick each object from its current location and place it at its designated target pose on v20.
           
           The robot's base is static at `v3`, which is great, since the `move_base` action is essentially a no-op, meaning there's no need to move the robot base. The key is in the sequential execution of pick-and-place for each object. The `handempty` precondition and the fact that I only have one usable arm, v4, drive that sequential nature. I can't be holding multiple objects at once, which makes it easier to track the arm state.
           
           So, the plan unfolds like this:
           
           1. **Pick v8** from its pose at `v9`.
           2. **Place v8** at its target pose `(#o2)`, which is supported by v20.
           3. **Pick v12** from its pose at `v13`.
           4. **Place v12** at `(#o2)`.
           5. **Pick v14** from its pose at `v15`.
           6. **Place v14** at `(#o2)`.
           7. **Pick v16** from its pose at `v17`.
           8. **Place v16** at `(#o2)`.
           9. **Pick v18** from its pose at `v19`.
           10. **Place v18** at `(#o2)`.
           
           Each "pick" and "place" will need to meet the necessary preconditions (kinematic facts, the correct pose, hand being empty, robot at the right base configuration, etc.). I need to make sure those preconditions hold before each action. Since the `kin` facts are provided, base movement is not an obstacle, `unsafe` conditions are not explicitly present, and the grasp parameters will be resolved, it is very straightforward. Once all ten actions are complete, I should see the desired goal state!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Straightforward Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and the user has rightly pointed out a crucial flaw in the initial approach. It seems the provided plan was trying to use "pick" and "place" actions, which are simply not permitted in the list of valid action instances. The only tool in my toolbox, according to these constraints, is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, I can *only* "move" to my current location. Not exactly a dynamic range of motion!
           
           The goal is quite clear: I need to get all five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – onto v20.  Examining the initial state, it's immediately obvious that none of them *start* on v20. They're scattered around, supported by various configurations like v9 and v11. 
           
           The problem is, I can't *do* anything about it. I can't manipulate objects. I can't "pick" them up, I can't "place" them. My sole function is a stationary move. There's simply no action I can take with the limited resources I have that will alter the `on` predicate for these objects. 
           
           Therefore, it's painfully clear that the goal is currently unachievable with the given valid action instances. It's a logistical impossibility. We need to revise the plan, or the action set, to be able to achieve this goal.
