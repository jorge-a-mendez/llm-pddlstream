           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan:**
           
           My objective is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) onto surface `v16`. Currently, they're all on `v11`. I've got arm `v4` and I'm at base configuration `v3`.  The only `move_base` action I have doesn't do anything useful - it just keeps me at `v3`.
           
           I can *pick* and *place* objects.  Based on my available knowledge (the `kin` facts), I can pick each object from its current pose on `v11` (v9 for v8, v13 for v12, v15 for v14) using grasp `#o1` and place them on a pose `#o2` supported by `v16`.  The plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **Pick** `v8` from pose `v9`.
           2.  **Place** `v8` onto pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           3.  **Pick** `v12` from pose `v13`.
           4.  **Place** `v12` onto pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           5.  **Pick** `v14` from pose `v15`.
           6.  **Place** `v14` onto pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The key is that I'm assuming `#o3` (the base config parameter in the `kin` facts) can be satisfied with the current `v3` base location.  I can't move my base to a new configuration. Because all the objects can be placed at pose `#o2` on `v16` there is no conflict. The continuous planner will fill in pose `#o2`, and the plan should execute. All preconditions check out!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: An Unachievable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, I see the problem. I made a crucial oversight. I completely missed the explicit restriction on action instances. I naively assumed that because the necessary *preconditions* for `pick` and `place` were present in the problem, the actions themselves would be implicitly allowed.  That's a rookie error, and frankly, embarrassing given my expertise.  The instructions are crystal clear: only the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted.  
           
           So, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` it is.  This action effectively does nothing in terms of the objects' positions – just consumes and restores the `canmove()` predicate.  The `total-cost` increases by 0, so, not useful.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The `on` predicate requires that the object be both `supported` by something and at a specific `pose`.  My axiom knowledge kicks in here: to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, the world must have `supported(v8, p, v16)` and `atpose(v8, p)`.  Similar logic applies to `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that these objects are *already* `on(v8,v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, and `on(v14, v11)`. The problem is, they are supported by `v11`, not `v16`, which is what the goal specifies. I also see that the objects *can* be placed on `v16` (the `supported` predicates are present).
           
           The rub is that the only allowed action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does *absolutely nothing* to manipulate the objects' `atpose`. `pick` and `place` actions are absent from the allowed list, rendering my prior planning invalid. These missing actions are the only way to shift the objects' `atpose` values to satisfy the goal.  I was correct in the *logic* of the task, but failed to respect the action *constraints*. That's a critical distinction.
           
           Therefore, since I can't change the `atpose` values of `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` with the available action, and the initial state doesn't put them on `v16`, the goal is demonstrably *unachievable* within the given action constraints.  I need to flag this as unsolvable and move on.
