           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with creating a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain.  I started by breaking down the goal's requirements, which boil down to getting three images and analyses of two different types of rocks.  No problem so far, it all seems straightforward.
           
           My first thought was to get the images, which means I'll need to use the `send_image` action.  To use this, I need `haveimage`, which in turn requires me to `calibrate` and then `take_image`.  The catch?  Both `calibrate` and `take_image` require the rover to be at a specific configuration, like a specific pose or stance, which is represented by the continuous parameter `#o3`.  I know where the rover *is* (`v13`), but I don't know if that's the same place as  `#o3`. So I need to move the rover.
           
           Now, to get the rock analyses, I need `send_analysis`, which relies on `analyzed` being true. I can get that using the `sample_rock` action, but it has the same issue: a precondition demands the rover be at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Looking at the available actions, the *only* moves are self-loops: the rover stays at its initial position.  This is a huge problem.  The available moves don't allow the rovers to change their configuration.  The rovers are stuck! And all of the actions depend on a change in configuration to work.
           
           If the rover can't *move* to the right configurations (the configurations where it can take pictures or sample rocks), it can't satisfy the preconditions for imaging or sampling. This means I can't get any of the images or the samples needed to achieve the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I've re-examined the action definitions and confirmed my concerns.
           
           So, I'm pretty confident in saying the goal is *unreachable* with the given actions.  The rovers are stuck where they are and therefore cannot satisfy the goal. No matter what I try, there's no way to reach the configuration prerequisites that allow me to gather images and samples. It just can't be done!
