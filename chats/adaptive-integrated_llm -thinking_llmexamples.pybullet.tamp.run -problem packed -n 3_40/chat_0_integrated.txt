User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.113, -0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.898, -0.441).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.064, -0.495), (0.162, -0.397)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.123, -0.529, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.893, -0.451).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.141, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.721, 0.693).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.171, -0.577), (-0.074, -0.48)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.177, -0.272), (-0.104, -0.199)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Goal of Placing Objects on a Surface**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to position three objects, specifically v8, v12, and v14, onto surface v16. Currently, these objects are situated on surface v11. The available actions at my disposal are move_base, pick, place, clean, and cook. However, the task at hand doesn't involve cleaning or cooking, so I'll disregard those actions.
           
           The robot's base configuration is fixed at v3, as per the move_base action's only permitted instance, (move_base v3 v3 #o0). This means the robot itself will not be moving. I will be utilizing the robot arm v4 (or, possibly, v6 - but choosing v4 for now). Both arms are initially handempty.
           
           The solution involves picking each object from v11 and placing it on v16. I'll consider v8 as an example:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:**  
               I'll pick v8 from v9 (its pose on v11). The relevant preconditions are met as the object is at the correct pose, my arm is empty, the base configuration is appropriate, and I assume there are no unsafe approach or trajectory conditions.
           2.  **Place v8:**  
               I will place v8 onto a specific pose on v16. I'll designate this pose as `#o2` for now. Again, the preconditions for this action should be met, as the grasp is available, the robot base is at the correct position, and I assume there are no unsafe pose or approach conditions, nor are there unsafe trajectories. The kin predicate and the trajectory are implied and will be generated if valid configurations are available.
           
           Now for placing *all three* objects on v16. I need to make sure the target poses on v16 are valid and do not cause any collisions. The predicate *supported* is already given to ensure validity and stability of the placement on the given surface. Because the prompt specifies "The robot is atbconf v3" and "Both arms are handempty", and the only move_base configuration allowed is v3 to v3, this tells me that I *must* use this state/base to complete the given action.
           
           To ensure safe placement of all three items on the target surface, I will position the objects such that they don't collide with each other. The coordinates of the target surface v16 are from (-0.135,-0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Based on this I will be putting v8 centered at (-0.08, 0, 0.781) and v12 centered at (0, 0, 0.781) and finally v14 at (0.08, 0, 0.781). This ensures all the objects are on top of each other and on the surface with enough space to be placed correctly.
           
           The proposed plan is:
           
           1.  Pick v8 from v9 and move it to pose (#o2, v8, v16), where I will now provide the associated coordinate values, (x=-0.08, y=0, z=0.781)
           2.  Pick v12 from v13 and move it to pose (#o2, v12, v16), where I will now provide the associated coordinate values, (x=0, y=0, z=0.781)
           3.  Pick v14 from v15 and move it to pose (#o2, v14, v16), where I will now provide the associated coordinate values, (x=0.08, y=0, z=0.781)
           
           The overall cost of this plan is 6 because each pick and place has a cost of 1 (and the base isn't moved). The total plan's cost will be 6.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t1) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t2) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t3) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t5) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t6)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback makes perfect sense. The previous plan was flawed because it included illegal actions. Now, the *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which translates to no actual movement. It just sits there! Clearly, this severely limits what I can accomplish.
           
           The goal, as I understand it, is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`. Currently, they're sitting on `v11`.  My expertise tells me this requires a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions – standard stuff for this kind of planning.  I need to pick each object from `v11` and place them on `v16`.
           
           The problem is the allowed actions. I only have that `move_base` command, and it doesn't *do* anything useful in this scenario.  I can't manipulate objects without `pick` and `place`, which are not included. Consequently, I can't possibly move `v8`, `v12`, or `v14` to `v16` with the given constraints. The goal is, quite frankly, unreachable. I need more tools to get this done.
