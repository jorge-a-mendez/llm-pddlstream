User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.171, -0.577), (-0.074, -0.48)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.064, -0.495), (0.162, -0.397)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.123, -0.529, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.893, -0.451).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.177, -0.272), (-0.104, -0.199)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.113, -0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.898, -0.441).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.141, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.721, 0.693).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: Object Placement on v16**
           
           My analysis indicates that the provided goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16 is **unachievable** given the allowed action instances.
           
           Here's my reasoning:
           
           1.  **Understanding the Problem:** The task requires relocating three objects from their initial positions on table v11 to a specific placement on v16. To satisfy the `on` predicate, I need to find poses that work with the target location.
           
           2.  **Required Actions:** To move these objects, I would typically use a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. The plan would involve picking up an object, moving it to v16, and placing it down.
           
           3.  **The Constraint:** The critical constraint is the restriction on allowed action instances. The only action instance allowed by the problem is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a no-op base motion which does nothing.
           
           4.  **Incompatibility:** Crucially, the allowed actions *do not* include any `pick` or `place` instances.
           
           5.  **Conclusion:** Because `pick` and `place` are the only actions capable of changing the objects' positions and satisfying the goal `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, and these actions are prohibited, the goal is simply **unreachable** within the defined constraints. The robot is fundamentally unable to manipulate the objects.
