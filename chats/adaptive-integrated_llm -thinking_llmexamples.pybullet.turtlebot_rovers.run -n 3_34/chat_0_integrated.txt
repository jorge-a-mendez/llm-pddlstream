           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` objective. After carefully examining the axiom's structure and the initial state, it's immediately apparent that the goal is unattainable given the provided constraints. The primary obstacle revolves around the inability of the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to achieve the necessary configurations for crucial actions.
           
           **Analysis of the Objective and Available Actions**
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` requires us to achieve several `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, as well as `receivedanalysis` predicates for several rocks and soil samples. The solution involves taking images using `take_image` and sending them via `send_image`, and sampling rocks via `sample_rock` followed by analysis with `send_analysis`. Crucially, both `take_image` and `send_image` require the rovers to be at specific configurations denoted by the `#` symbols (like `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`), while `sample_rock` uses the same `#` configurations.
           
           **The Limiting Factor: Restricted Movement**
           
           However, the provided move action instances for the rovers only allow them to stay at their initial configurations, `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`).  The initial state fact `atconf(v14, v15)` tells us that `v14` is initially at `v15` and it cannot move because there is no appropriate move action to `atconf(v14, #o3)` or `atconf(v14, #o0)`. The actions required for imaging and analysis all have preconditions specifying configuration such as `atconf(v14, #o3)` or `atconf(v12, #o0)`, which will never be achieved with the only `move` instances available.
           
           **Conclusion: Infeasibility**
           
           Given the provided move actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` which allow no configuration change for the rovers, coupled with the rule "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan.", the rovers will always remain in their initial configurations, meaning all preconditions requiring a particular configuration can never be met. Consequently, this leads to an unsolvable situation; achieving `new-axiom@0()` is impossible within these constraints.
