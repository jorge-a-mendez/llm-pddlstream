           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single surface, surface 0, defined by the bounding box from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). The object (ID 5) has dimensions of approximately 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0. Since the object is quite small relative to the surface, there's a lot of room for placement. I will try to distribute the placements across the surface, varying both position and orientation. I will ensure the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned that when rotating an object, its effective bounding box changes. The previous failures for ID 5 occurred because when rotated by pi/2 (1.5708 radians), the object's AABB expanded beyond the surface boundaries, specifically in the x-direction near the edges and the y-direction near the edges. For a square object rotated by 90 degrees, the overall bounding box does not change relative to the original unrotated bounding box; its width and height simply swap. However, the `x` and `y` coordinates provided are the center of the object, and the AABB calculations seem to use the rotated dimensions with respect to this center. This implies that for a square object, when rotated by 90 degrees, to stay within bounds, the center needs to be further from the edges of the surface.
           
           For this new request, I have a new object (ID 10) that is also square with dimensions approximately 0.098 x 0.098. This object is slightly larger than the previous one. I will use the lessons learned about rotated placements to ensure that the object remains within the surface boundaries. Specifically, if rotating, I will adjust the center coordinates to account for the larger effective bounding box that needs to be accommodated for the *new* orientation. Since the object is square, rotating by 90 degrees means its width and height effectively swap, but since they are equal, the bounding box extents stay the same. However, the previous error messages suggest that the calculation of the bounding box was using the *original* object dimensions relative to the center and then rotating them, causing an issue near the edges. I will simply be more conservative with placements near the edges, especially when rotating.
           
           Let `s = 0.09765122529791803` be the side length of the square object.
           When `theta = 0` (or `pi`), the half-extents are `s/2` in x and `s/2` in y.
           When `theta = pi/2` (or `3pi/2`), the half-extents are `s/2` in x and `s/2` in y (since it's a square).
           
           Let's re-evaluate the previous failures:
           For object ID 5 (size ~0.07 x 0.07):
           `x_min_surface = 4.2`, `x_max_surface = 4.8`
           `y_min_surface = -0.6`, `y_max_surface = 0.0`
           Half-size `s/2 = 0.035`.
           For `(0, 1.5708, 4.235, -0.565)`:
           If the object is centered at (4.235, -0.565) and rotated, its bounding box should be `(4.235 - 0.035, -0.565 - 0.035)` to `(4.235 + 0.035, -0.565 + 0.035)`. This is `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`.
           The error states: `AABB ((4.200000006652613, -0.6000001244776059), (4.270000260376196, -0.5299998707540226))` is not contained. This means the object is exceeding the boundary, even though my manual calculation suggests it should be `(4.2, -0.6)`. The very slight precision issues caused it to be considered outside.
           This implies I need to ensure the object's actual AABB, considering its center, has a margin from the surface edges.
           For a non-rotated object, the center `x` must be in `(x_min_surface + s/2, x_max_surface - s/2)`.
           For a non-rotated object, the center `y` must be in `(y_min_surface + s/2, y_max_surface - s/2)`.
           For object ID 10, `s/2 = 0.048825612648959`.
           
           For a rotated object (square, 90 degrees), the effective `s/2` for checking against the original surface bounds should still be `s/2`. The issue is most likely floating point precision. So I need to add a small epsilon when calculating the valid range for the center.
           Let's use `epsilon = 1e-6` for a buffer.
           Valid x range for center: `(4.2 + 0.048825612648959 + epsilon, 4.8 - 0.048825612648959 - epsilon)`
           `x_center_min = 4.2 + 0.048825612648959 + 0.000001 = 4.248826612648959`
           `x_center_max = 4.8 - 0.048825612648959 - 0.000001 = 4.751173387351041`
           Valid y range for center: `(-0.6 + 0.048825612648959 + epsilon, 0.0 - 0.048825612648959 - epsilon)`
           `y_center_min = -0.6 + 0.048825612648959 + 0.000001 = -0.551173387351041`
           `y_center_max = 0.0 - 0.048825612648959 - 0.000001 = -0.048826612648959`
           
           I will generate placements ensuring these stricter bounds are met for the center, regardless of rotation (since the object is square).
