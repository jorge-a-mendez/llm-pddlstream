(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, which is a square.  My approach here is straightforward and leverages my understanding of AABBs and rotations.  Since the object is defined by its AABB dimensions,  I'm interpreting that rotation changes the effective AABB (which is a common convention).
           
           First, I need to account for rotation.  I'll define the dimensions of the unrotated AABB.  Given that the object is almost a square, I know that even with rotation, the size will not change *that* drastically. I then calculate the *maximum* possible AABB size after rotation, using the Pythagorean theorem, which will occur at a 45-degree angle. Then, I calculate the allowed center placement range to ensure it fully fits within surface 0's bounds.
           
           I've determined I can pick 10 equally spaced theta values from 0 to pi (radians), which covers the space for this object due to its geometry.  For each theta value, I then calculate the effective AABB dimensions and then the allowed range for the center (x, y) placement, ensuring the object doesn't extend beyond the surface boundary.  I use 5 points within this range for each rotation:  the center, and then the four corner placements.  This ensures an even distribution of rotations and placement, giving me the 50 total placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           I've been tasked with placing object ID 5 on surface 0, avoiding collision with object ID 4, which is already placed. Object 5 is almost a square with dimensions approximately (0.091, 0.091). Surface 0 spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), and I need to find 50 stable placements.
           
           First, I calculated key dimensions: object 4 is a square with side length ~0.0795, and its center is at (0,0) (with no rotation, (0,0,0,0)). I've created bounds based on object 4's dimensions (obj4\_half\_x/obj4\_half\_y = 0.0398) to identify the forbidden collision zone.  I've done this through the calculation of the surface boundaries where object 5's placement is possible, then through the collision check with object 4, which is in the region `(-0.03977, -0.03977)` to `(0.03977, 0.03977)`.
           
           The available surface area on surface 0 is about 0.27 x 0.27. I determined that the most helpful placements needed to be within the boundaries that fit in the surface area of object 0.  Then I set out to figure out the angles that were safe, which I found to be very close to 0 and pi/2.
           
           I need to strategically test various rotation angles for object 5. Because the area needed is a square, I decided to focus on angles where they don't impact object 5. So I determined a set of angles to use: 0, 0.03, pi/2, pi/2 + 0.03, pi, pi + 0.03, 3*pi/2, 3*pi/2 + 0.03. I realized that placing 5 will be difficult because of the dimensions and the collision boundary, and for rotations outside of those ranges, I won't have the space needed.
           
           I'll generate several candidate placements for each angle, checking each one for collision using an AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) overlap check. To do this, I will use: `(x <= x_coll_min OR x >= x_coll_max OR y <= y_coll_min OR y >= y_coll_max)` where X and Y are in the ranges for the object, and where collision with object 4 isn't possible.
           
           Ultimately, I'll return a list of 50 stable, collision-free placements, each defined by an object ID, rotation angle, and (x, y) coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to get 50 stable placements of object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure I don't collide with objects 4 and 5. This is the breakdown:
           
           1.  **Understand the Constraints:** I've got object 6, which is basically a square, to place. I have to stay within surface 0's bounds of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Also, I must avoid crashing into object 4 (a small square at (0, 0)) and object 5, which is already taking up a big chunk of the bottom-left corner.
           2.  **Define the Problem:** I need a strategy to find valid placements. I want to try a few angles (`theta`), and for each rotation, I'll calculate the bounds of the object to avoid collisions. I will then pick several (x,y) coordinates within this bounded box to place the object.
           3.  **Calculate the Collision Zones:** I've worked out the bounding box for object 6, which changes based on the rotation (`theta`). It boils down to figuring out the minimum and maximum x and y for object 6's center, given that I must avoid hitting object 4 and object 5. The basic condition is "no overlap," meaning object 6 cannot overlap the AABB of object 4 or object 5.
           4.  **Find the Regions:** I see a few key areas to place the object: the top-left, top-right, and bottom-right corners, relative to the small object 4. Then, I need to make sure I'm also clear of object 5.
           5.  **Generate Candidate Points:** I'll start with 0 and pi/2. I'll take a few sample points within the available regions with 3 points in each dimension, to generate several placements per angle.
           
           The basic idea is to rotate object 6 by different `theta` values and look for valid locations.  I'll ensure the object's AABB doesn't collide with the existing objects or go outside the surface, then pick several (x,y) locations within these valid ranges.  With this, I'll hopefully find 50 stable placements.
