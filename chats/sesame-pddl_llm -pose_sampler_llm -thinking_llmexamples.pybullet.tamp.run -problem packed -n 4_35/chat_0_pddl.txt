(Thoughts: **Placement Plan for Square Object**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for this square object (ID 5) on a square surface (Surface 0).  The object is 0.08699847534347044 units on a side. Surface 0 is a square, centered at (0,0) with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Stable means the object is fully *inside* the surface.
           
           Since it's a square, its bounding box (AABB) has fixed dimensions, regardless of rotation, which simplifies things.  I call the object's side length `obj_x`. To be inside, the object's center must be within a smaller square defined by:
           `surf_0_min_x + obj_x/2 <= x <= surf_0_max_x - obj_x/2`
           `surf_0_min_y + obj_y/2 <= y <= surf_0_max_y - obj_y/2`
           
           The surface limits mean:
           *   x can be between -0.0915 and 0.0915
           *   y can be between -0.0915 and 0.0915
           
           I need 50 distinct positions.  I will be varying x, y, and theta (rotation). But, what about theta? Should I use it?
           
           Normally, I would think about AABB change with rotation, but in this description, the dimensions of the bounding box were mentioned. This sounds like those dimensions stay the same.
           
           Let's assume the bounding box given *does* always stay the same with any rotation: the `size_x` and `size_y` stay the same. In that case, rotation doesn't change the size, and the x and y ranges are unchanged, I can vary `theta`.
           
           Here's my approach:
           I'll try 5 different angles:  `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`.
           
           For each angle, I will select several (x,y) to get diverse placement. I want to have positions on the axis, in the center, and in between.
           
           The final arrangement should meet these requirements.
           *   50 positions must be selected
           *   The position has to be inside the surface
           *   Diverse angles and x-y coordinates need to be considered.
           
           Let's start!

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Object Placement (ID 6)**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, side `S = 0.09475`) on a given surface (surface 0, bounded by `(-0.135, -0.135)` and `(0.135, 0.135)`) while avoiding collision with another, pre-placed object (ID 5, at `(0, 0, 0, 0)` with a known AABB size `S5 = 0.08699`).
           
           My analysis reveals a critical constraint:  Due to the size of object 6 relative to the available space around object 5, and the fixed position of object 5 at (0,0), *it's geometrically impossible to place object 6 anywhere on surface 0 without some degree of overlap*. This conclusion holds true for *any* rotation angle of object 6.
           
           *   **Surface Limits:** The boundaries of surface 0 restrict the center of object 6's AABB.  With `theta=0`, the center must lie within `[-0.08762, 0.08762]` for both x and y. If we rotate, this bound gets slightly tighter.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** Object 5's AABB occupies an area that extends past the limits set by our surface bounds. So the allowed surface bounds are no longer the same as no-collision bounds.
           
           Object 5's AABB extends from  `[-0.043499, 0.043499]` on both x and y.  Object 6's smallest AABB dimension (when `theta=0`) is `0.094754 / 2 = 0.047377`. No matter where I try to place object 6, it will collide because the maximum non-collision bound for the x position on object 6 has an upper limit of `(0.04349923767173522 + 0.04737726577554305) = 0.09087650344727827`. When rotating, this becomes slightly wider.
           
           Given this impossibility, the prompt's instruction to "never give up" leads me to proceed with a set of placements despite the known collisions. It could be that the "stability constraint" is more important. The simulation will likely fail these generated placements.
           
           **Placement Generation:**
           
           I've generated a grid of 50 placements for object 6, each with `theta=0` (or another, slightly rotated, if desired).  These placements ensure that object 6's AABB remains *within* the surface bounds.  *However*, because the object is too large relative to the allowable space around object 5, *every* placement *will* inevitably collide with it. The points are generated in a grid and the details are as follows.
           
           *   `X_LIM = 0.08762273422445695`

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy with Guaranteed Collisions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 4 on surface 0, and I need to consider the constraints imposed by objects 5 and 6, which are already present. I'm essentially being asked to force collisions, given the limitations of the space.
           
           First, I established the surface limits: a rectangular area from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I identified that object 6, with its bounding box, completely encapsulates object 5. So, any collision with object 6 implies a collision with object 5, which simplifies the collision detection.
           
           Now, for object 4 (a square, roughly 0.093 units on each side), I calculate how its bounding box changes with rotation, a crucial aspect for collision avoidance. I defined the `A4_half_dim(theta)` function to represent the half-width/height of the bounding box at any given angle. With this, I derived the `x_surf_limit(theta)` and `y_surf_limit(theta)` to constrain the placement within the surface bounds.
           
           The challenge is clear: given the size of object 4 and the existing objects, *it's mathematically impossible* to place object 4 on surface 0 without some collision. I rigorously proved this by checking the maximum extent the object could have while *avoiding* collision.  The calculations confirmed that the space is too constrained.
           
           So, since I need to provide 50 placements, I'll generate a variety of configurations within the surface limits, acknowledging that these placements will inevitably result in collisions with objects 5 and 6.  I'll explore rotations and positions, prioritizing the center and corners of the surface to create a diverse and 'stable' set of placements within the given constraints.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Object Placement (ID 7) on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The goal is to find 50 stable positions for this new object (ID 7) on surface 0, and I need to avoid collisions with the "fixed" obstacles.  The surface area is pretty small, only `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I looked at the successful placements from the last request because those are now considered "fixed" obstacles.  I have to treat those as immovable objects and keep ID 7 away from all of them. Here's what I've got: a bunch of ID 4s, one ID 5 and one ID 6 all centered around (0,0). I then meticulously calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for each of these placements. These were all previously deemed "successful", so those are now where they "belong".
           
           The problem is that the previously "successful" placements *overlap*.  The center of the surface is effectively occupied by ID 6, but then it's surrounded by shifted and slightly rotated instances of ID 4. This means I'm supposed to avoid these, even though they overlap *each other*? The system logic is not adding up to me.
           
           I also noticed that the successful placements are not really about placement, and more about generating more and more 'fixed' objects.
           
           So, I'm going to take a conservative approach.  I'm going to treat *all* the previous "successful" placements as if they *are* solid, existing obstacles, and try to find positions for ID 7 that *don't* intersect their AABBs.
           
           After carefully mapping out the occupied space, I'm realizing something: the surface is *completely* covered by these obstacles.  The "effective occupied area" is the same as the entire surface. There's literally no space left!
           
           Since I have been told to not give up, and that i need to provide a solution, I'll provide a set of placements for the new object and just expect the check to fail due to collisions with the objects, in the worst case scenario. I will then give 50 potential positions for ID 7, spread across the surface, knowing that they will all overlap with the existing obstacles.

Model:     **My Reasoning for Object Placement (ID 7) on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The goal is to find 50 stable positions for this new object (ID 7) on surface 0, and I need to avoid collisions with the "fixed" obstacles.  The surface area is pretty small, only `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I looked at the successful placements from the last request because those are now considered "fixed" obstacles.  I have to treat those as immovable objects and keep ID 7 away from all of them. Here's what I've got: a bunch of ID 4s, one ID 5 and one ID 6 all centered around (0,0). I then meticulously calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for each of these placements. These were all previously deemed "successful", so those are now where they "belong".
           
           The problem is that the previously "successful" placements *overlap*.
