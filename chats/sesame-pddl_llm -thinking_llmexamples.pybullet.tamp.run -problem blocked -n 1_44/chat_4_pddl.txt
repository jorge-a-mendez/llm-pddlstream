(Thoughts: **The Strategic Breakdown for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  It's immediately obvious that `?green` must be `v12` since the initial state has `type(v12, v17)`. That's easy enough.  So the real challenge is to get `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Now, according to the definitions, `on(v12, v18)` requires that `v12` is at a pose where it is supported by `v18`.  Luckily, the initial state gives us `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, and that will work.  So now the question is how to get `v12` to `atpose(#o2)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v12` is currently at `atpose(v12, v13)`. I know I have to pick up the object and place it. It's time to find the actions. I know I have a graspable object `v12` and a hand `v4` with `handempty(v4)`. So the task at hand is to move the robot base from `v3` to a different configuration. Then pick `v12` using `v4` and put it at pose `#o2`.
           
           I see that `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. which means my move plan will be (move base, pick and place).
           The problem is `atbconf(#o3)` is not in the initial state. Fortunately, `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` is in the initial state and can perform a `move_base`.
           
           My plan is now well-defined:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** Execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This will change the base configuration to support the pick and place operation.
           2.  **Pick:** Execute `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. This picks `v12` from its current pose.
           3.  **Place:** Execute `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. This will place the object to the target pose.
           
           This plan gives us `atpose(v12, #o2)` which satisfies the `on` predicate when combined with `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` (from the initial state). This, along with the pre-existing `type(v12, v17)` , satisfies the initial goal `new-axiom@0()`. Done.
