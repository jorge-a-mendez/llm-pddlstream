(Thoughts: **My thought process for generating 50 stable placements for an object on a surface:**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions: x = 0.09769, y = 0.09769) on a given surface (surface 0, defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). My goal is to determine the `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` values for each placement.
           
           Since the object is effectively a square, I know that orientations of 0 and π/2 (or multiples thereof) are generally sufficient.  I'll define w = size_x and h = size_y and start by using 0 and pi/2.  I then need to calculate a bounding box for each rotation.  I also know that for AABB objects, calculating the bounding box and confirming it is within the valid region is necessary.
           
           I calculated the ranges for x and y when theta = 0, which results in the object's AABB extending from `(x - w/2, y - h/2)` to `(x + w/2, y + h/2)`.  I did the same for the x and y ranges when theta = pi/2, and observed that the ranges for x and y are almost identical.  Due to this near symmetry, I know I can easily rotate to any of the 4 quadrants.
           
           I decided that, to provide the most useful output, I should generate placements at theta = 0, pi/2, pi/4, and 3*pi/4, but note that pi and 3*pi/2 would not add any additional information. I have chosen to generate 15 placements for 0 and pi/2, and 10 for pi/4 and 3*pi/4, for a total of 50.
           
           I meticulously calculated the valid x and y ranges for each orientation.  For theta=pi/4 and 3*pi/4, I had to account for the object's diagonal dimensions, which reduced the valid area.
           
           Finally, I devised a distribution strategy for the placements.  I'll generate an x/y grid of 5x5 points for the theta = 0 and pi/2 placements. For each grid, I will exclude 10 randomly, resulting in 15. For theta = pi/4 and 3*pi/4, I will use a smaller 4x4 grid of points. I then ensured that the coordinates in the grids were not identical.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've got this object, ID 6, that I need to place 50 times without bumping into object ID 5, which is already set in the scene. I know ID 5's position, rotation, and dimensions, and I've calculated its bounding box.  It's sitting snugly in the bottom-left corner.  Object 6 is a square, so its effective dimensions change depending on its rotation. My goal is to find stable placements for object 6, specifically *not* overlapping the AABB of object 5.
           
           First, I figured out the bounding box for object 5. Now, I need to understand where object 6 can be safely placed. Since object 5 is in the bottom-left, the area to avoid is that bottom left corner, roughly around a rectangle. I need to take the effective width and height and rotate the object and place it.
           
           Since object 5 occupies the bottom-left, I realized it's easiest to define *safe* zones. Any placement for object 6 must satisfy the non-colliding criterion. I calculated the collision ranges based on rotations (0, 90, 45, 135 degrees), and decided to use a grid and then pick from it.
           
           I've generated a bunch of potential coordinates, ensuring they all meet those "no collision" requirements. So, I took the values and split them to generate a number of placements:
           *   For theta = 0, I generated 20, by splitting a grid of coordinates and selecting those that do not overlap with object 5.
           *   For theta = pi/2, I selected some from previous set (15), so there were no overlaps,
           *   For theta = pi/4, there are 8, and
           *   For theta = 3*pi/4, there are 7.
           
           This totals 50 positions, all of which are designed to avoid object 5. I've chosen points that are guaranteed safe based on the calculations, because they are to the right or on top of object 5. I need to make sure this is accurate, and then I'm finished.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Object Placement**
           
           I'm faced with a new task: placing Object 4 on Surface 0, taking into account the existing, fixed obstacles – Object 5 and Object 6. My goal is to find valid placements that avoid collisions.
           
           Here's my thought process:
           
           *   **Understanding the Scene:** I start by examining the surface dimensions and the precise locations and extents of Object 5 and Object 6. This is crucial for defining the available space.
           *   **Analyzing Constraints:** I'm aware that Object 4 is a square, and its effective size varies with its rotation (theta). I must consider the different scenarios where theta is 0, pi/2, pi/4, and 3*pi/4, leading to the calculations of the new object's half extents for collision detection.
           *   **Bounding Volume Analysis:** I convert Object 5 and Object 6 into their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). This is essential for quickly determining if Object 4's bounding volume overlaps with them. The bounding volume calculations will also inform which areas can and can't be used for placing the new object.
           *   **Free Space Identification:**
               1.  I identify potential regions on the surface where Object 4 can be safely placed.
               2.  I visualize these free regions as spaces above, below, or to the sides of the existing objects.
               3.  This means calculating safe zones with enough distance from those obstacles.
           *   **Generating Placement Candidates:** I develop a structured approach for generating candidate placements:
               1.  I'll generate a grid of points within the feasible regions based on the dimensions calculated earlier.
               2.  This gives me the center coordinates for all potential placements of Object 4.
               3.  I verify the placement of the new object using its AABB, ensuring no collisions with Object 5 and Object 6 by checking for overlaps in the bounding volumes.
           *   **Prioritizing Safe Regions:** I know the areas at the bottom of the surface are highly occupied, so I will select the placement locations that can be most easily placed.
           *   **Angle Diversity:** I aim to distribute the object's orientations across the surface.
               1.  I'll set coordinates for the primary and secondary placement regions.
               2.  I'll generate candidate placements and ensure the candidates are collision-free.
               3.  This strategic approach should guarantee diverse and collision-free locations.
           
           In summary, my approach is a blend of geometric reasoning, bounding volume analysis, and strategic point generation. I plan to iteratively refine these calculations to identify optimal placement candidates for Object 4.

(Thoughts: **My Current Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           I've been tasked with placing Object 7 on Surface 0, taking Objects 5, 6, and 4 into account as obstacles. My goal is to find valid placements for Object 7, considering both its size and the existing constraints on the surface. Here's my detailed approach:
           
           1.  **Obstacle Analysis & Surface Boundaries**: First, I meticulously calculated the bounding boxes (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes, or AABBs) of each obstacle (Objects 5, 6, and 4). I needed to precisely define the occupied space.  I know the surface's boundaries are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           2.  **Object 7 Properties**: Object 7 has dimensions of `(0.07853255831462091, 0.07853255831462086)`, which I'm treating as a square. This means `h7_straight = 0.039266` for straight rotations (0 or 90 degrees) and `h7_diag = 0.055530` for diagonal rotations (45 or 135 degrees). I need to determine the allowed region for placing Object 7, which will depend on its orientation.
           
           3.  **Rotation-Specific Placement Strategy**:  I've broken down my approach into distinct strategies for straight and diagonal rotations:
               *   **Straight Rotations (0 and 90 degrees):** My primary goal is to prioritize the right edge of the surface (out of the way from prior objects and boundaries), I've determined valid placements will require a minimum x value of `0.07256` (to avoid overlap with the other objects) with a range of `[0.07256, 0.09573]` and y can be any value in range.
               *   **Diagonal Rotations (45 and 135 degrees):** Placing diagonal objects is more complicated due to the increased effective size. I've narrowed it down to placements where the center is in the area between `[0.02875, 0.07947]` in `x` and `[-0.00886, 0.07947]` in `y`.
           
           4.  **Placement Generation and Overlap Checks**: Based on these valid placement regions, I will proceed to generate x and y coordinates, in the form of a grid and will apply appropriate rotations to test their validity. I will generate 30 possible placements:
               *   15 straight rotations (10 at right edge, 5 at top edge).
               *   15 diagonal rotations (based on the previous region).
           
           5.  **Final Checks for Valid Placements**: After I have these proposed placements, I'll calculate the AABB's and check for overlaps with each obstacle to ensure the placement is valid. The condition for validation of placements is:
               *   Not Colliding with Object 5: `(cx + h_diag <= x_min_5 OR cx - h_diag >= x_max_5 OR cy + h_diag <= y_min_5 OR cy - h_diag >= y_max_5)`
               *   Not Colliding with Object 6: `(cx + h_diag <= x_min_6 OR cx - h_diag >= x_max_6 OR cy + h_diag <= y_min_6 OR cy - h_diag >= y_max_6)`
               *   Not Colliding with Object 4: `(cx + h_diag <= x_min_4 OR cx - h_diag >= x_max_4 OR cy + h_diag <= y_min_4 OR cy - h_diag >= y_max_4)`
               After running this analysis, I should have a solid set of valid placements.

           4.  **Placement Generation and Overlap Checks**: Based on these valid placement regions, I will proceed to generate x and y coordinates, in the form of a grid and will apply appropriate rotations to test their validity. I will generate 30 possible placements:
               *   15 straight rotations (10 at right edge, 5 at top edge).
               *   15 diagonal rotations (based on the previous region).
           
           5.  **Final Checks for Valid Placements**: After I have these proposed placements, I'll calculate the AABB's and check for overlaps with each obstacle to ensure the placement is valid. The condition for validation of placements is:
               *   Not Colliding with Object 5: `(cx + h_diag <= x_min_5 OR cx - h_diag >= x_max_5 OR cy + h_diag <= y_min_5 OR cy - h_diag >= y_max_5)`
               *   Not Colliding with Object 6: `(cx + h_diag <= x_min_6 OR cx - h_diag >= x_max_6 OR cy + h_diag <= y_min_6 OR cy - h_diag >= y_max_6)`
               *   Not Colliding with Object 4: `(cx + h_diag <= x_min_4 OR cx - h_diag >= x_max_4 OR cy + h_diag <= y_min_4 OR cy - h_diag >= y_max_4)`
               After running this analysis, I should have a solid set of valid placements.
