           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the provided axioms, is equivalent to the conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions for `new-axiom@0()`:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: Store `v16` is free on rover `v12`. This is true in the initial state.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: Store `v16` is free on rover `v14`. This is true in the initial state.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Objective `v17` has received an image in mode `v11`.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Objective `v18` has received an image in mode `v11`.
           7.  `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Objective `v19` has received an image in mode `v11`.
           8.  `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Objective `v20` has received an image in mode `v11`.
           9.  `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type declaration, which we can assume is satisfied if we analyze rocks of type `v2`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` has been analyzed and the analysis received. The problem statement refers to `?stone` and `?soil` as generic objects for which analysis is required. Looking at the `type` predicates, `v1` and `v4` are of type `v2` (stone). `v3`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6` (soil). So we need to analyze a `v2` rock.
           11. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type declaration.
           12. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` has been analyzed and the analysis received.
           
           From the initial state, the first four conditions are already met. We need to satisfy `receivedimage` for four objectives and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.
           
           Let's focus on `receivedimage`. To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)`, which in turn requires `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)` and `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`. To get `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, we need `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)`, which requires `calibrated(?c, ?v)` and `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`. Finally, to get `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, we need `calibrate(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c)`.
           
           Let's look at the available actions and predicates to find an efficient path:
           
           *   **Objectives for `receivedimage`**: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`.
           *   **Rover and Camera**: `v12` and `v14` are rovers. `v10` is a camera. Both rovers have `v10` onboard and `v10` supports mode `v11`.
           *   **Lander for `send_image`**: `v9` is a lander.
           *   **Image Visibility**: We have `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)` for rover `v12` at configuration `#o3`. The same also applies for rover `v14`.
           *   **Communication Visibility**: We have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` for rover `v12` at configuration `#o0` and similarly for `v14`.
           *   **Rocks for `receivedanalysis`**:
               *   Type `v2` (stone): `v1`, `v4`.
               *   Type `v6` (soil): `v3`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           *   **Above predicates for `sample_rock`**:
               *   For `v12` at `#o5`: `v3`, `v1`, `v7`, `v8`, `v5`, `v4`.
               *   For `v14` at `#o5`: `v1`, `v3`, `v7`, `v8`, `v5`, `v4`.
           *   **Store**: `v16` is a store, and it's free for both `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Since `receivedimage` is required for multiple objectives, and both rovers `v12` and `v14` can see all four objectives from configuration `#o3` and communicate from `#o0`, we can use one rover to take and send all the images. Let's choose `v12`.
           
           Similarly, for `receivedanalysis`, both rovers can access all rocks from configuration `#o5`. We need to analyze one `v2` rock (e.g., `v1`) and one `v6` rock (e.g., `v3`).
           
           Plan outline:
           1.  **Image acquisition and transmission (using `v12`)**:
               *   `v12` moves to `#o3` (if not already there). However, there is no move action to #o3 in the valid actions. We must use existing `atconf` or `conf` facts. The `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are the current locations. The `imagevisible` predicates use `#o3`, and `comvisible` predicates use `#o0`. The `above` predicates use `#o5`. These are all different. This means we must move the rover to the correct configuration for each set of actions. The only move actions available are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are essentially no-op moves. This implies that the rovers are already in the correct configuration to perform the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` actions if those configurations are `v13` or `v15`. However, the initial state defines `imagevisible` using `#o3`, `comvisible` using `#o0`, and `above` using `#o5`. This indicates that the goal can only be achieved if these continuous configurations can be assumed to be equivalent to `v13` or `v15` for the purpose of action execution, or if we can define these continuous configurations for the given rover and target. The problem statement clarifies: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..." This means we **must** provide values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for the specified rovers and targets.
           
           Let's refine the plan, assuming we need to perform actions from the configurations described by `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`.
           
           To make the plan executable, `v12` needs to be at `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, then potentially move to `#o0` to `send_image`. Similarly for `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`, it needs to be at `#o5` and then `#o0`.
           
           Given the restricted `move` actions, it seems the intention is that the rover is effectively "at" the required `#` configurations without explicit moves between them being modeled as separate actions. The problem says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means we cannot use `move` actions that are not explicitly provided. The only `move` actions provided are no-ops. This implies that we must use the configurations defined by `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as if the rover can be at these locations to perform the actions, and we don't need to explicitly move between them. The initial state already provides `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, and similarly for `v14`. We will just assume the rover is at the correct continuous configuration when the action is called.
           
           Let's use rover `v12` for all tasks to simplify.
           
           **1. Image acquisition and transmission (Rover `v12`)**
           We need to capture images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` and send them to `v9`.
           *   Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for any objective (e.g., `v17`). This will be done at configuration `#o3`.
           *   Take image of `v17` using `v10` on `v12`.
           *   Send image of `v17` to `v9`. This will be done at configuration `#o0`.
           *   Repeat for `v18`, `v19`, `v20`.
               *   Note: `calibrated` becomes false after `take_image`, so we need to recalibrate for each image. However, the goal is to get `receivedimage`, not `haveimage`. If we calibrate and take all images, and *then* send them, we only need to calibrate once for the first image, and then for each subsequent image after `take_image`. The phrasing "calibrated(?c, ?v)" in `take_image` precondition and "NegatedAtom calibrated(?c, ?v)" in effects means it needs to be calibrated before *each* `take_image` and becomes uncalibrated after. So, calibrate-take-calibrate-take-... or just calibrate before each `take_image`.
           
           Let's list the actions for images:
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10) ; Re-calibrate for next image
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11)
           
           Now send them, assuming we are still effectively at `#o0` for communication.
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11)
           
           **2. Rock analysis and transmission (Rover `v12`)**
           We need `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.
           *   Rocks of type `v2`: `v1`, `v4`.
           *   Rocks of type `v6`: `v3`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           Let's choose `v1` (type `v2`) and `v3` (type `v6`).
           *   Sample `v1` at `#o5` using `v12` into `v16`.
           *   Send analysis of `v1` to `v9` at `#o0`.
           *   Sample `v3` at `#o5` using `v12` into `v16`.
           *   Send analysis of `v3` to `v9` at `#o0`.
           
           The `sample_rock` action makes the store `full` and `analyzed`. To sample another rock, the store must be `free`. So we need to `drop_rock` after each sample if we want to sample multiple. The problem states `free(v12, v16)` in the initial state.
           
           Actions for rock analysis:
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16) ; v1 is type v2
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)
           (drop_rock v12 v16) ; To free up the store for the next sample
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16) ; v3 is type v6
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3)
           
           All conditions for `new-axiom@0()` appear to be met by this sequence of actions.
           
           The geometry of the objects:

           v12: rover
           v14: rover
           
           The rovers `v12` and `v14` are at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) respectively. The `move` actions are no-ops. This means that if we need to use `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, the rover `v12` must be positioned at these locations. We'll provide continuous values for them based on the given target object bounding boxes.
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, the target `v17` is at `((-1.858, 1.775), (-1.769, 1.865))`. Let's pick a point in front of it, within a range of 2.0.
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, the target `v9` (lander) is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Let's pick a point for `v12` within 4.0 range.
           For `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `v1` is at `((-1.495, -0.849), (-1.403, -0.757))`. Let's pick a point directly above it.
           
           Let's estimate the configuration points.
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`): These objectives are spread out.
           `v17`: (-1.8, 1.8)
           `v18`: (0.6, 1.9)
           `v19`: (-0.55, 1.9)
           `v20`: (2.17, 1.85)
           To see all of them, a good central point might be around (0.0, 0.0) or (0.0, 1.0). But the rover's initial position for `v12` is `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration for `#o3` should be reachable and allow viewing the targets. Let's pick one that is somewhat central to the cluster of targets `v17, v18, v19, v20` while being reachable from `v13`. Let's assume a configuration around (0.0, 0.0) for #o3. However, since the problem states that `#o3` is specific to `v12` and the specific target `v17` (and others), we need a single `#o3` that can see all four. For example, if `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), it's far from the targets.
           The problem statement says: "you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that... has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`." This implies that the configuration is *specific* to a rover-target pair, even if the same `#o3` is used for multiple targets in the predicates. Since the given predicates are `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, etc., `#o3` must be a single configuration that allows `v12` to see *all* these targets. This is challenging given their spread.
           However, if we provide a configuration for `v12` and `#o3` such that `v12` can see `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` from that single point, that would fulfill the requirement. This is an assumption that the geometry allows for such a configuration. Given the spread, this is quite unlikely for a range of 2. If it's not possible to see all from one spot, then the plan is not executable as written, since `#o3` is used for all.
           
           Let's assume there's a valid `#o3` where `v12` can see all `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           `v17`: (-1.8, 1.8), `v18`: (0.6, 1.9), `v19`: (-0.55, 1.9), `v20`: (2.17, 1.85).
           Average x: (-1.8 + 0.6 - 0.55 + 2.17) / 4 = 0.105. Average y: (1.8 + 1.9 + 1.9 + 1.85) / 4 = 1.8625.
           Let's choose `(0.1, 0.5)` for `#o3` for `v12`. From here, `v17` is at distance sqrt((-1.8-0.1)^2 + (1.8-0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.9^2 + 1.3^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 1.69) = sqrt(5.3) ~ 2.3. This is outside max distance 2.
           This implies my interpretation of a single `#o3` for all targets might be wrong, or the problem is ill-posed with `imagerange` being violated for these targets from a single `#o3`.
           The problem states: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           But the initial state uses `#o3` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` with `v12`. This implies `#o3` must be *one* configuration. If that single `#o3` cannot see all of them, the plan based on `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, ...)` for all objectives is invalid.
           Let me double check the available actions again. The `take_image` and `calibrate` actions specify `(?v: object, ?q: object, ?y: object, ?o: object, ?c: object, ?m: object)`. The `?q` is the configuration. If the problem states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, it implies that `v12` can see both `v17` and `v18` from the *same* configuration `#o3` with the *same* ray `#o4` (which seems odd, ray should be target specific). However, the predicate definition is `imagevisible(?v: object, ?q: object, ?y: object, ?o: object)`, where `?y` is the ray. So `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` means ray `#o4` is from `v12` at `#o3` to `v17`. `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` would imply ray `#o4` is also from `v12` at `#o3` to `v18`. This is geometrically impossible for two different objects `v17` and `v18` unless they are collinear with the rover at `#o3`.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values will be computed correctly, and for the sake of the plan, we assume that the provided `imagevisible` predicates with `#o3` are valid. And `comvisible` with `#o0` and `above` with `#o5` are valid.
           For the configuration output, I will provide a unique continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair as the instructions state. However, the action instances will use the `conf` names given in the initial state (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`).
           
           Let's determine the configurations for `v12`.
           *   `#o3` (imagevisible): for `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
               *   To `v17` ((-1.8, 1.8)): Let `v12` be at `(-1.0, 1.0)`. Dist: sqrt((-1.8 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.8 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.8)^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.28) ~ 1.13. This is within 2.
               *   To `v18` ((0.6, 1.9)): Let `v12` be at `(0.0, 1.0)`. Dist: sqrt((0.6 - 0.0)^2 + (1.9 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.6^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.81) = sqrt(1.17) ~ 1.08. Within 2.
               *   To `v19` ((-0.55, 1.9)): Let `v12` be at `(-0.5, 1.0)`. Dist: sqrt((-0.55 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.9 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.05)^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 0.81) = sqrt(0.8125) ~ 0.9. Within 2.
               *   To `v20` ((2.17, 1.85)): Let `v12` be at `(1.0, 1.0)`. Dist: sqrt((2.17 - 1.0)^2 + (1.85 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.17^2 + 0.85^2) = sqrt(1.3689 + 0.7225) = sqrt(2.0914) ~ 1.44. Within 2.
               Since `#o3` is used for all these, I must find a single configuration for `v12` that can see all four targets within distance 2. This is geometrically impossible for these spread-out targets.
           
           I will interpret the instructions as: if `#o3` is used for multiple targets (v17, v18, v19, v20), I provide a single value for `#o3` for `v12` to a representative target, or a general location, and trust that the underlying continuous planner will make it work. Or, alternatively, the PDDL is written in a way that implies `imagevisible` with same `#o3` does not necessarily mean the *same* configuration, but rather a *type* of configuration or that the continuous planner can find a suitable configuration matching the `#o3` name for *each* call, even if the PDDL does not reflect distinct configurations per target.
           The phrasing "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" suggests that *my output* should specify unique values. So, if I use `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, I must specify `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17)` and `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18)` with potentially different (x,y) values. This is contradictory with `#o3` being a single configuration name in the PDDL.
           
           Let's assume the PDDL states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` where `#o3` is a specific configuration for `v12` looking at `v17`. And then `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` means `v12` is at a *different* configuration, also named `#o3`, but specific to `v18`. This is an unusual interpretation for a planning domain, but it's the only way to reconcile the "different continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair" instruction with the PDDL's use of a single `#o3` for multiple targets. I will provide unique (rover, configuration name, ray name, target name) tuples in the configurations section.
           
           For `#o3` with `v12`:
           *   `v17` ((-1.858, 1.775), (-1.769, 1.865)): Center is approx `(-1.8, 1.82)`. Rover `v12` at `(-1.0, 1.0)`. Ray from `(-1.0, 1.0)` to `(-1.8, 1.82)`.
           *   `v18` ((0.553, 1.857), (0.65, 1.954)): Center is approx `(0.6, 1.9)`. Rover `v12` at `(0.0, 1.0)`. Ray from `(0.0, 1.0)` to `(0.6, 1.9)`.
           *   `v19` ((-0.6, 1.887), (-0.508, 1.978)): Center is approx `(-0.55, 1.93)`. Rover `v12` at `(-0.5, 1.0)`. Ray from `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(-0.55, 1.93)`.
           *   `v20` ((2.136, 1.816), (2.221, 1.901)): Center is approx `(2.18, 1.85)`. Rover `v12` at `(1.5, 1.0)`. Ray from `(1.5, 1.0)` to `(2.18, 1.85)`.
           
           For `#o0` with `v12` (comvisible to `v9`):
           *   `v9` ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)): Center is approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Rover `v12` at `(-0.5, -0.5)`. Dist: sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-0.5))^2) = sqrt((-1.4)^2 + (-1.5)^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 2.25) = sqrt(4.21) ~ 2.05. This is within 4.
           
           For `#o5` with `v12` (above for `v1` and `v3`):
           *   `v1` ((-1.495, -0.849), (-1.403, -0.757)): Center is approx `(-1.45, -0.8)`. Rover `v12` directly above it, e.g., `(-1.45, -0.8)`. For sampling, the robot must be "above" the rock. We can set the x, y coordinates to be near the center of the rock. Let's make it `(-1.45, -0.8)` for `v12`.
           *   `v3` ((-1.703, 0.83), (-1.606, 0.927)): Center is approx `(-1.65, 0.88)`. Rover `v12` directly above it, e.g., `(-1.65, 0.88)`.
           
           It's important that the `ray` parameter (`#o4` and `#o1`) is specific to each (rover, configuration, target) triplet. The initial state gives `ray(#o4)` and `ray(#o1)`. I will use these specific ray names in the plan, but in the Configurations section, the ray name will be tied to the specific configuration and target. This is a bit of a tricky point given the PDDL formulation vs. the instructions. I'll stick to the PDDL for actions and the instructions for the output format. So, `#o4` will be provided for each (rover, #o3, target) and `#o1` for each (rover, #o0, target).
           
           One final check on the goal: `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` must hold at the end. My plan does not change `atconf` states for these rovers, as the `move` actions are no-ops. So, this condition is maintained. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` also need to hold. My plan ends with `drop_rock v12 v16`, which will ensure `free(v12, v16)` is true. `v14` never uses its store, so `free(v14, v16)` remains true.
           
           This plan seems internally consistent, given the interpretations made for the continuous configurations.

           Since the necessary actions to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not allowed to be used, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable from the initial state using only the permitted actions.
