           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem and Identifying Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. This axiom has a conjunction of several atoms I need to make true. After examining the initial state, I see that I need to achieve:
           
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for at least one stone.
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for at least one soil.
           
           To achieve these, I've figured out I'll need to use `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions. I meticulously went through the preconditions for each action to understand the dependencies and how to construct a valid plan. For the images, I would use `rover v14` for image objective `v17, v18, v19`, and for analysis, I planned to use `v14` for stone and `v12` for soil.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint and the Unreachable Goal**
           
           However, here's where the problem arises: I'm only allowed to use `move` and `drop_rock` actions. The actions needed to fulfill the required goal conditions (`send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`) are *not* permitted.
           
           I've carefully considered the initial state, axioms, and available action instances.  I've double-checked my understanding of the problem and the constraints. The goal is simply unreachable with the given set of available actions. I cannot devise a valid plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` because the necessary actions for image and analysis transmission are explicitly forbidden.
