(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation: A Detailed Breakdown**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a given surface (surface 0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))).  A stable placement is defined by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where `surf_idx` is the surface index, `theta` is the rotation angle, and (x, y) are the center coordinates of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB).
           
           Key constraints are full containment within the surface boundaries and avoidance of collisions.  Given the object's square shape (0.07 x 0.07), I initially assumed `theta` wouldn't impact the AABB. However, considering the problem's emphasis on geometry, and to ensure robust solutions I decided to consider it.  I'm interpreting the "AABB dimensions" as being the maximum bounding box, including the effects of rotation.
           
           With that in mind, my strategy is as follows:
           
           1.  **Define valid bounds**:  Given the surface's dimensions, the object's center (x, y) must reside within a specific range.  Since the object is a square, I will use a conservative approach, generating placement using two rotations: 0 and pi/4 (45 degrees).
           2.  **Calculate Effective Bounding Box:** For `theta = 0`, the effective width and height are 0.07. For `theta = pi/4`, it is 0.07 * sqrt(2).
           3.  **Generate a Grid of Points**:  I calculated an appropriate range for x,y for each theta, and generated a 5x5 grid of points within the valid bounds for *each* `theta`.
           4.  **Create placements**: Then the grid for `theta=0` is 0 to 24, and grid for `theta = pi/4` is 25-49, totalling 50.
           
           The grid of points has been chosen such that x and y positions for the object are in valid bounds.
           
           This process ensures that I create diverse and stable placements for the given object and surface.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           My objective is to identify 50 stable, collision-free placements for object ID 10, a square with side length 0.08453012, on surface 0, which spans from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  A previous successful placement for object ID 5 at (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565) needs to be taken into account to avoid collisions.  I will be generating candidate placements by checking if their axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) overlap the known AABB of object 5.
           
           First, I define the AABB dimensions of object 10 for any given rotation angle, *theta*. Because it's a square, its width and height are equal, calculated as side\_length \* (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))).  For theta = 0, this simplifies to side\_length, or 0.08453012.  For theta = pi/4, the width/height becomes side\_length \* sqrt(2), or approximately 0.119543087.
           
           I then calculate the valid center ranges for the candidate placements on the surface, making sure they stay within the surface bounds.  For theta = 0, the valid x center range is roughly [4.24226506, 4.75773494] and the y center range is approximately [-0.55773494, -0.04226506].
           
           To avoid object 5, which is located with a center at `(4.235, -0.565)` and dimension of 0.07 * 0.07, I must consider its AABB. This AABB is defined by the corners (4.2, -0.6) and (4.27, -0.53). I need to determine regions where an object 10 placement would collide.
           
           For *theta* = 0, I divided the valid ranges into a 5x5 grid, yielding candidate center points for object 10. These were checked against the known AABB of object 5 for possible overlaps. AABB overlaps are calculated by checking if the x-range and y-range overlap. Using `theta=0`, there are 24 valid candidate locations.
           
           I repeated the process for *theta* = pi/4, calculating the new valid ranges, then creating and checking the grid of candidate locations against the AABB of object 5. Again, there were 24 valid candidates.
           
           At this point, I needed to make up the missing placements to bring the total to 50. I re-used the process for *theta* = pi/2, but using distinct, previously valid (non-colliding) placements. These two were added in, bringing the total number of non-colliding object 10 placements to 50.
