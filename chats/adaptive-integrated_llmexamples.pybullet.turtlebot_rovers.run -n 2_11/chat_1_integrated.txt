           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires achieving the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which involves several conditions related to rover states, image reception, and rock analysis. Specifically, the goal requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v12 is free. This is true initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Store v16 on rover v14 is free. This is true initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: A rock of type stone (v2) has been analyzed and received.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a stone has been received. In this scenario, v1, v4, v3 are of type v2 (stone). We need to analyze and send at least one of them.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: A rock of type soil (v6) has been analyzed and received.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of soil has been received. In this scenario, v7, v8, v5 are of type v6 (soil). We need to analyze and send at least one of them.
           
           From the initial state, we already satisfy `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. The remaining tasks are:
           - Take and send images of objectives v17 and v18.
           - Sample and send analysis for a rock of type v2 (stone).
           - Sample and send analysis for a rock of type v6 (soil).
           
           The `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` predicates indicate that the camera `v10` is on both rovers. This means we can use either rover to take images and analyze rocks, as long as the camera is calibrated.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           1.  **Image acquisition and transmission for v17 and v18:**
               *   Both rovers `v12` and `v14` are capable of imaging `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` using ray `#o4` and camera `v10` in mode `v11`.
               *   Since `v12` is initially at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`, we need to move one of them to `#o3` to take images. It seems more efficient to use rover `v12` for this, as it is closer to the image targets.
               *   We need to calibrate `v10` with respect to the rover before taking images.
               *   After taking images, we need to move to a configuration that has `comvisible` to the lander `v9`, which is `#o0`. Then we send the images.
           
           2.  **Rock sampling and analysis transmission for v2 (stone) and v6 (soil):**
               *   Rocks of type v2 (stone) are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
               *   Rocks of type v6 (soil) are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
               *   Both rovers `v12` and `v14` are `above` all these rocks at configuration `#o5`.
               *   We can use one rover to sample a stone and another to sample soil, or the same rover for both. Since we have two rovers and each has a free store, we can use both.
               *   After sampling, we need to move to a configuration that has `comvisible` to the lander `v9`, which is `#o0`. Then we send the analysis.
           
           Let's prioritize rover `v12` for imaging and `v14` for sampling, then share communication for sending results.
           
           **Rover v12 plan:**
           *   Move to `#o3` to image `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Calibrate camera `v10`.
           *   Take image of `v17`.
           *   Take image of `v18`.
           *   Move to `#o0` to send images.
           *   Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           
           **Rover v14 plan:**
           *   Move to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           *   Sample `v1` (stone, type v2).
           *   Sample `v7` (soil, type v6).
           *   Move to `#o0` to send analyses. (Note: `v14` is initially at `v15`. There's a motion from `v15` to `#o0` and from `#o5` to `#o0` for `v14`.)
           *   Send analysis for `v1`.
           *   Send analysis for `v7`.
           
           Let's ensure the movements are valid based on the provided `motion` predicates.
           
           For `v12`:
           * `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)` is available.
           * `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)` and `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)` are available. We only need to calibrate once for the camera.
           * `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)` and `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)` are available.
           * `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)` is available.
           * `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)` and `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)` are available.

           * `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16)` is available for soil.

           * `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)` and `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)` are available.
           
           The coordinates for the continuous parameters need to be selected carefully.
           * `#o3` is a configuration for imaging. `v12` and `v14` can image `v17` and `v18` from `#o3`. `v17` (0.593, 1.888) and `v18` (-2.148, 1.799). Let's pick a configuration that allows visibility for both `v17` and `v18` if possible, but the problem states `imagevisible` is given for specific pairs so we need to ensure the ray is clear. A configuration for `v12` near `v17` and `v18` would be suitable. For `v12` to image `v17`, a pose like `(0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3` seems reasonable to allow a clear line of sight, as `v17` is at `(0.6, 1.9)`. For `v18`, the rover would need to move to a different #o3. However, since the problem states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, it implies `#o3` is a common imaging configuration. Let's assume a single #o3 allows both as indicated by the problem.
           * `#o5` is a configuration for sampling. `v12` and `v14` are above various rocks at `#o5`. `v7` is at `(0.3, -1.9)`, `v8` at `(0.3, -0.4)`, `v1` at `(-1.5, 0.3)`, `v3` at `(1.6, -0.3)`, `v5` at `(0.5, 1.2)`. Rover `v14` is initially at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, so moving to `#o5` for sampling seems okay. A configuration like `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o5` should be acceptable for sampling.
           * `#o0` is a configuration for communicating with lander `v9`. Lander `v9` is at `(-2.4, -2.3)` to `(-1.3, -1.6)`. Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. For `v14`, a configuration like `(-1.5, -1.0)` could work for `#o0`. For `v12`, `(-1.5, -1.0)` would be too far. However, since `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` are present, a single `#o0` can be used for communication for both rovers. Let's pick a configuration for `#o0` that provides line of sight to `v9` for both rovers, maybe `(-1.0, -1.0)`. Given `v9` is around `(-2.0, -2.0)`, a rover at `(-1.0, -1.0)` could have a clear path.
           
           Considering the geometry:
           * `v12` (rover) at `(1.0, -1.75)` initially.
           * `v14` (rover) at `(-1.0, -1.75)` initially.
           * `v17` (objective) at `(0.6, 1.9)`.
           * `v18` (objective) at `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
           * `v9` (lander) at `(-1.9, -2.0)` (center of AABB).
           * `v1` (rock) at `(-1.4, 0.3)`
           * `v7` (rock) at `(0.4, -1.9)`
           
           To make `#o3` effective for both `v17` and `v18` for rover `v12`, it would need to be able to see both. This might be challenging if they are in opposite directions. However, the problem statement provides `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` suggesting `#o3` is common. Let's assume there's such a configuration. A good central point might be `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           For `#o4`, a ray from `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(0.6, 1.9)` for `v17` and `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(-2.1, 1.8)` for `v18`.
           For `#o5` (above rocks): A location like `(0.0, 0.0)` should be above all rocks. The specific `above` predicates already confirm this for `#o5`.
           For `#o0` (comms): Both rovers `v12` (at `1.0, -1.75`) and `v14` (at `-1.0, -1.75`) need to communicate with `v9` (around `(-1.9, -2.0)`). A central configuration `(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o0` might work for `v14` easily but for `v12` it would require a longer path. Given `v14` is closer to `v9` for `comvisible`, it is more likely for `v14` to reach a suitable `#o0`. Let's set `#o0` to `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This is closer to `v9` and feasible for `v14`.
           
           Let's refine the plan:
           **Rover v12 (Image tasks):**
           1.  Move `v12` from `v13` to `#o3`. (e.g., `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, 1.0)`)
           2.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v12`.
           3.  Take image of `v17`.
           4.  Take image of `v18`.
           5.  Move `v12` from `#o3` to `#o0`. (e.g., `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(-1.5, -1.5)`)
           6.  Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           
           **Rover v14 (Sample tasks):**
           1.  Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o5`. (e.g., `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.0, 0.0)`)
           2.  Sample rock `v1` (type v2, stone).
           3.  Sample rock `v7` (type v6, soil).
           4.  Move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0`. (e.g., `(0.0, 0.0)` to `(-1.5, -1.5)`)
           5.  Send analysis for `v1`.
           6.  Send analysis for `v7`.
           
           The problem implies that a single `#o3` works for both `v17` and `v18` for a given rover. Similarly for `#o0` and `v9`.
           
           Final check of conditions for `new-axiom@0()`:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`: No, this will be `atconf(v12, #o0)` after the plan. This is a problem if the final state needs to be `v13`. However, the axiom itself is just a conjunction, not an end state for the rover. The `atconf` predicates in the axiom are probably just illustrating conditions, not necessarily strict final states. The phrasing "new-axiom@0()" suggests a set of facts that need to be true. Let's assume that if the goal includes an `atconf` predicate, it refers to the state at the end of the plan. If so, then both rovers need to return to their initial configurations `v13` and `v15`. This would mean more moves. However, the typical interpretation of such an axiom goal is that these conditions are met at some point, not necessarily the final one. Let's re-read the problem: "achieves the goal". It means the goal expression must be true at the end. Thus, the rovers need to return to their original `atconf`. This makes the problem significantly harder.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the assumption that `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` must be true at the *end* of the plan.
           
           **Revised plan:**
           **Rover v12 (Image tasks + return to v13):**
           1.  `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2.  `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3.  `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4.  `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           5.  `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           6.  `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           7.  `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           8.  `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)` (Return to initial conf)
           
           **Rover v14 (Sample tasks + return to v15):**
           1.  `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o5)`
           2.  `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)` (Stone)
           3.  `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16)` (Soil)
           4.  `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           5.  `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`
           6.  `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`
           7.  `(move v14 #o0 #o2 v15)` (Return to initial conf)
           
           This plan seems to satisfy all conditions of the goal axiom, including the final configurations of the rovers. The initial `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` will become `full(v12, v16)` and `full(v14, v16)` after sampling, but the goal only requires `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. This means we need to `drop_rock` after sending analysis.
           
           Okay, let's incorporate `drop_rock`. This means rover `v14` needs to `drop_rock` after sending its analysis for both `v1` and `v7`. Since it samples both, its store will be full. It can drop the rock to make the store free again.
           
           **Revised plan incorporating `drop_rock`:**
           **Rover v12 (Image tasks + return to v13):**
           1.  `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2.  `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3.  `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4.  `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           5.  `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           6.  `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           7.  `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           8.  `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`
           
           **Rover v14 (Sample tasks + return to v15):**
           1.  `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o5)`
           2.  `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)` (Store `v16` becomes full with `v1`)
           3.  `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           4.  `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`
           5.  `(drop_rock v14 v16)` (Store `v16` becomes free)
           6.  `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)` (Move back to sampling config to pick another rock. Note: if this requires another #o2 for this move, it's not listed, but it seems there is a valid motion for this pair of configurations, e.g. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`)
           7.  `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v7 v16)` (Store `v16` becomes full with `v7`)
           8.  `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9.  `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`
           10. `(drop_rock v14 v16)` (Store `v16` becomes free)
           11. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 v15)`
           
           This seems logically sound and covers all goal conditions.
           
           Let's check the availability of motion actions for v14 to sample two rocks, given that it only has one store `v16`.
           `free(v14, v16)` is an initial condition.
           `sample_rock` has precondition `free(?v, ?s)` and effect `full(?v, ?s)`.
           `drop_rock` has precondition `full(?v, ?s)` and effect `free(?v, ?s)`.
           So, the sequence of `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, `drop_rock`, then `sample_rock` again is correct to satisfy the `free(v14, v16)` in the goal.
           
           Continuous parameter values:
           * `#o3` (config for imaging `v17` and `v18` by `v12`): `v17` is at `(0.6, 1.9)`, `v18` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`. A good compromise for `v12` to view both would be `(-0.5, 1.0)`. This point is about 1.2 units from `v17` and 1.6 units from `v18`, within range (2 units max).
           * `#o4` (ray from `#o3` to `v17` and `v18` for `v12`): Needs to be collision-free.
               * For `v17`: From `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(0.6, 1.9)`.
               * For `v18`: From `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
           * `#o5` (config for sampling rocks by `v14`): `v1` at `(-1.4, 0.3)`, `v7` at `(0.4, -1.9)`. A central point like `(0.0, 0.0)` is reasonable. This is confirmed by `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)`.
           * `#o0` (config for communicating with `v9` by both `v12` and `v14`): `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. A location like `(-1.5, -1.5)` is closer to `v9` and allows communication for `v14`. For `v12` it's further, but `comvisible` is given. So `(-1.5, -1.5)` should work.
           * `#o1` (ray from `#o0` to `v9` for `v12` and `v14`): Needs to be collision-free.
               * From `(-1.5, -1.5)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           * `#o2` (a specific time parameter): This is a dummy object and not a continuous parameter itself.
           
           All the continuous values must be collision-free and within range. Assuming such values exist for the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, the plan should work.
           
           Double-check for `blocked(?y)`: The initial state does not contain any `blocked` predicates. The problem statement says `blocked(?y)` axiom derivation needs `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`. We are assuming that for the chosen continuous values for `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, these conditions are met, so `blocked` will remain false, allowing `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis`.
           
           ```
           The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` which implies several conditions:
           1. Both rovers `v12` and `v14` must be at their initial configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively at the end of the plan.
           2. The store `v16` on both rovers must be free at the end of the plan.
           3. Images of objectives `v17` and `v18` (in mode `v11`) must have been received.
           4. Analysis of a rock of type `v2` (stone, e.g., `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) must have been received.
           5. Analysis of a rock of type `v6` (soil, e.g., `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) must have been received.
           
           The plan will utilize both rovers. Rover `v12` will handle the imaging tasks, and Rover `v14` will handle the rock sampling and analysis tasks. Each rover will then return to its initial configuration. The store `v16` for `v14` will be emptied after each rock analysis transmission by using `drop_rock` to ensure the final `free(v14, v16)` condition is met and to allow sampling of multiple rocks.
           
           For Rover v12:
           - Move from its initial configuration `v13` to `#o3`, a configuration suitable for imaging.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10`.
           - Take images of objective `v17` and `v18`.
           - Move from `#o3` to `#o0`, a configuration suitable for communication with the lander `v9`.
           - Send the acquired images of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Move back from `#o0` to its initial configuration `v13`.
           
           For Rover v14:
           - Move from its initial configuration `v15` to `#o5`, a configuration where it is above several rocks.
           - Sample rock `v1` (a stone, type `v2`). Its store `v16` will become full.
           - Move from `#o5` to `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the analysis of `v1`.
           - Drop the sampled rock `v1` to free up the store `v16` again.
           - Move back from `#o0` to `#o5` to sample another rock.
           - Sample rock `v7` (soil, type `v6`). Its store `v16` will become full again.
           - Move from `#o5` to `#o0` for communication.
           - Send the analysis of `v7`.
           - Drop the sampled rock `v7` to free up the store `v16` again.
           - Move back from `#o0` to its initial configuration `v15`.
           
           The continuous parameters `#o3` (imaging configuration), `#o5` (sampling configuration), and `#o0` (communication configuration) are selected to be collision-free and allow line-of-sight/reachability for their respective tasks. `#o4` and `#o1` represent the rays, which are implicitly collision-free given the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are active and `blocked` is not true.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan had issues with continuous configurations:
           1.  **#o3 for v12 (imaging v17 and v18):** `(-0.5, 1.0)` was not reachable for `v12`. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` is at `(0.6, 1.9)`, `v18` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`. We need a new `#o3` that is reachable and allows imaging. Since `v17` and `v18` are quite far apart, it's unlikely a single `#o3` can image both while being collision-free and reachable. However, the problem statement provides `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, implying that there exists a *single* configuration `#o3` from which `v12` can image both `v17` and `v18`. Let's assume this is true and try to find a reachable point. A configuration like `(0.0, 1.0)` could be a candidate for `v12` to view `v17` and `v18`. It's roughly centered and closer to `v12`'s initial position than `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
           2.  **#o5 for v14 (sampling v1 and v7):** `(0.0, 0.0)` was in collision with `v19` (an AABB from `(-0.05, -2.5)` to `(0.05, 2.5)`). This means `v19` is a thin wall along the y-axis at x=0. Therefore, `(0.0, 0.0)` is indeed in collision. We need a new `#o5`. Since `v1` is at `(-1.4, 0.3)` and `v7` is at `(0.4, -1.9)`, a configuration for `v14` on either side of the `v19` wall, perhaps `(-0.5, -0.5)` or `(0.5, -0.5)` would be better. Let's try `(-0.5, -0.5)` for `#o5` as it is closer to `v1` and away from `v19`.
           3.  **#o0 for v12 and v14 (communicating with v9):** `(-1.5, -1.5)` was in collision with `v9` itself. This means the rover's base was trying to occupy the same space as the lander `v9`. `v9` is at `(-2.4, -2.3)` to `(-1.3, -1.6)`. We need a new `#o0` that provides line-of-sight to `v9` without collision. A location slightly outside `v9`'s bounding box, but close, would be ideal. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This position is close to `v9` but not within its AABB, and allows line-of-sight.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the plan with these new continuous values.
           
           **New proposed continuous values:**
           *   `#o3` (imaging for `v12`): Let's try `(0.0, 1.0)`. This is reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)` for `v12`, and could potentially provide line of sight to both `v17` (0.6, 1.9) and `v18` (-2.1, 1.8).
           *   `#o5` (sampling for `v14`): Let's try `(-0.5, -0.5)`. This is reachable from `v14`'s initial `(-1.0, -1.75)`, is clear of `v19` (wall at `x=0`), and should allow `v14` to be above `v1` and `v7`.
           *   `#o0` (communication for `v12` and `v14`): Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This is outside `v9`'s AABB `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`, and potentially allows line-of-sight. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` so it's very close. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` so it's a longer path, but `comvisible` is given for this setup.
           
           The rest of the plan structure remains the same as it correctly addresses all goal conditions, including returning rovers to their initial `atconf` and ensuring `free` stores.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous attempt at selecting continuous parameters encountered several issues:
           1.  **#o3 for v12 (imaging v17 and v18):** `(0.0, 1.0)` was in collision with `v19` (the wall at `x=0`). We need a configuration for `v12` to image `v17` (0.6, 1.9) and `v18` (-2.1, 1.8). `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. To avoid `v19`, we must be either `x < -0.05` or `x > 0.05`. Let's try `(0.5, 1.0)`. This is on the positive x-side of `v19`. It's reachable for `v12` and should have line-of-sight to `v17` (close to it) and `v18` (further, but still potentially visible given `imagevisible` is provided for `#o3` for both targets).
           2.  **#o5 for v14 (sampling v1 and v7):** `(-0.5, -0.5)` was not reachable for `v14`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v1` is at `(-1.4, 0.3)` and `v7` is at `(0.4, -1.9)`. We need a reachable `#o5` that avoids `v19` and is `above` `v1` and `v7`. Given `v14` starts on the negative x-side, and `v1` is also negative x, let's try `(-0.8, -0.5)`. This is away from `v19` (wall at `x=0`) and close to `v14`'s start, making it more likely to be reachable.
           3.  **#o0 for v12 and v14 (communicating with v9):** `(-1.0, -2.0)` was not reachable for either `v12` or `v14`. `v9` is at `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`. We need a reachable `#o0` that avoids `v9` and has line-of-sight. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. For `v14`, being close to its start, but outside `v9`, would be good. Let's try `(-0.9, -1.9)`. This is just outside the positive x-bound of `v9` and within its y-range, potentially offering good line-of-sight. For `v12`, this is a longer travel, but the motion predicate exists.
           
           Let's re-try the plan with these new continuous values, making sure they are outside the `v19` collision zone `x=0` and are within reasonable reach of the rovers from their starting or previous positions.
           
           **New proposed continuous values:**
           *   `#o3` (imaging for `v12`): `(0.5, 1.0)`
           *   `#o5` (sampling for `v14`): `(-0.8, -0.5)`
           *   `#o0` (communication for `v12` and `v14`): `(-0.9, -1.9)`

Model:     My apologies for the continued issues with configuration reachability. Let's analyze the geometry and initial rover positions more carefully to select better continuous values.
           
           **Rover `v12` initial position:** `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`
           **Rover `v14` initial position:** `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           **Obstacle `v19`:** AABB `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (a vertical strip around `x=0`)
           
           **Target objectives:**
           *   `v17`: `(0.6, 1.9)`
           *   `v18`: `(-2.1, 1.8)`
           *   `v9` (lander): `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`
           *   Rocks: `v1` at `(-1.4, 0.3)`, `v7` at `(0.4, -1.9)`
           
           **Issue with #o3 (imaging for `v12`):** `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The previous `(0.5, 1.0)` was still problematic.
           *   To image `v17` `(0.6, 1.9)`, `v12` needs to move north-east. A point like `(0.7, 0.0)` might be a good intermediate.
           *   To image `v18` `(-2.1, 1.8)`, `v12` would need to move significantly west.
           *   The problem states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` AND `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This strongly suggests one `#o3` can see both. Given `v12` starts on the positive X side, and `v17` is on positive X, `v18` is on negative X, the ideal `#o3` might be near `x=0` but avoiding `v19`. Let's try `(0.1, 1.0)`. This point is reachable for `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` (since `y` increases and `x` decreases) and keeps it on the right side of `v19`. The range requirement for `imagevisible` is 2.0. From `(0.1, 1.0)` to `v17(0.6, 1.9)` is `sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.9)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.81) = sqrt(1.06) ~= 1.03` (within range). From `(0.1, 1.0)` to `v18(-2.1, 1.8)` is `sqrt((-2.2)^2 + (0.8)^2) = sqrt(4.84 + 0.64) = sqrt(5.48) ~= 2.34` (THIS IS OUT OF RANGE).
               This means the assumption that a single `#o3` can see both targets for `v12` is likely false due to range constraints. The problem statement gives the predicates as such, so I have to assume that the `imagevisible` predicates are valid. If I cannot find a point that works for both within range, it means I have to re-evaluate the problem. However, the task is to provide *a* plan. The `imagevisible` predicates state `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)` and `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)`. This implies that, for `v12` from `#o3`, both `v17` and `v18` are within range. The problem specifies max distance for `imagevisible` as 2.0. Let's assume the continuous planner will find such a point.
           
               Let's try to place `#o3` for `v12` to be reachable and avoid obstacles.
               `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` is at `(0.6, 1.9)`. `v18` is at `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
               If `#o3` is `(0.5, 0.0)` for `v12`,
               Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((0.6-0.5)^2 + (1.9-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 3.61) = sqrt(3.62) ~= 1.9` (within range).
               Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-2.1-0.5)^2 + (1.8-0.0)^2) = sqrt((-2.6)^2 + (1.8)^2) = sqrt(6.76 + 3.24) = sqrt(10) ~= 3.16` (OUT OF RANGE).
               This is extremely problematic. Given `imagevisible` is true for both `v17` and `v18` from the *same* `#o3`, there must be such a location. The fact that the search is failing implies that such a location is hard to find or doesn't exist under my geometric assumptions. However, I must rely on the given predicates `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` being possible. Let's try `(0.2, 0.5)` for `#o3` (to avoid `v19`). This is reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((0.6-0.2)^2 + (1.9-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 1.96) = sqrt(2.12) ~= 1.45` (within range).
               Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-2.1-0.2)^2 + (1.8-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-2.3)^2 + (1.3)^2) = sqrt(5.29 + 1.69) = sqrt(6.98) ~= 2.64` (OUT OF RANGE).
               It seems `v12` cannot image both `v17` and `v18` from the same point within 2.0 distance. This implies either `imagevisible` is not just about Euclidean distance (e.g. projection, or a different interpretation of range in the PDDL domain vs. what I'm calculating), or my assumption about a single `#o3` is wrong and `imagevisible` could implicitly define distinct configurations. But the `imagevisible` predicates are listed with the *same* `#o3` and `#o4`. If the problem implicitly allows different actual configurations to be used for the same `#o3` *label* when combined with different targets, that's not standard PDDL. Given the strict format, I have to assume `#o3` is a single configuration. If `v12` cannot achieve both `imagevisible` predicates from a single `#o3` due to range, then the goal might be unachievable with `v12` for *both* images.
           
               Let's consider Rover `v14` for imaging `v18`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v18` is at `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
               If we designate a new config `#o3_v14` for `v14` to image `v18`.
               E.g. for `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, to image `v18` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`:
               Let's try `#o3_v14 = (-1.5, 0.0)`.
               Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-2.1 - (-1.5))^2 + (1.8 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.6)^2 + (1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.6) ~= 1.89` (within range).
               This seems viable for `v14` to image `v18`. This implies that `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is also available.
           
               So, we could split the imaging tasks:
               *   `v12` images `v17`.
               *   `v14` images `v18`.
               This would require new `#o3` and `#o4` for `v14` if not already implied by the current `#o3`. However, the available actions list `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)` and `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`. So, `v14` can also use the same `#o3` to image `v18`.
           
               Let's re-strategize:
               *   **Rover `v12` (Initial `(1.0, -1.75)`)** for `v17` imaging.
                   *   `v17` is at `(0.6, 1.9)`. A reachable `#o3` for `v12` to image `v17` (within 2m) that avoids `v19` (wall at `x=0`). Try `(0.7, 0.5)`. This is on the right of `v19`.
                   *   Distance from `(0.7, 0.5)` to `(0.6, 1.9)` is `sqrt((0.1)^2 + (1.4)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 1.96) = sqrt(1.97) ~= 1.4` (within range).
               *   **Rover `v14` (Initial `(-1.0, -1.75)`)** for `v18` imaging AND rock sampling.
                   *   `v18` is at `(-2.1, 1.8)`. A reachable `#o3` for `v14` to image `v18` (within 2m) that avoids `v19`. Try `(-1.5, 0.0)`. This is on the left of `v19`.
                   *   Distance from `(-1.5, 0.0)` to `(-2.1, 1.8)` is `sqrt((-0.6)^2 + (1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 3.24) = sqrt(3.6) ~= 1.89` (within range).
                   *   For sampling `v1` `(-1.4, 0.3)` and `v7` `(0.4, -1.9)`. From `v14`'s start at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, a reachable `#o5` for sampling `v1` (stone) that avoids `v19`. Try `(-0.5, -0.5)`. Wait, this failed before as not reachable. Let's try `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This is even closer to `v14`'s start.
                   *   After sampling `v1` from `(-1.0, -0.5)`, `v14` needs to send analysis.
                   *   Then `v14` needs to sample `v7` (soil). `v7` is at `(0.4, -1.9)`. This is on the positive X side of `v19`. So, `v14` might need to cross `v19` or go around it. A configuration for `#o5` at `(0.5, -0.5)` would work for `v7`. This means `v14` would need to sample `v1` at one `#o5_v1` and then `v7` at another `#o5_v7`. This also complicates the plan.
                   *   Given the original `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)` predicates, it means a single `#o5` works for both. This again implies I should not try to split them.
           
           Let's assume the problem statement about a common `#o3` for both targets and a common `#o5` for both rocks means such points *do* exist and are reachable/collision-free. My geometric calculations might be too strict or missing some flexibility in the underlying continuous planner. I'll pick new points that are "logically" better and avoid `v19` for sure, hoping the `reachable` condition will pass for these:
           
           **For #o3 (imaging):**
           *   `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` at `(0.6, 1.9)`, `v18` at `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
           *   Let's pick `#o3 = (0.2, 1.0)`. This is just outside the `v19` wall (`x=0`). It's reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's trust `imagerange` predicate.
           
           **For #o5 (sampling):**
           *   `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v1` at `(-1.4, 0.3)`, `v7` at `(0.4, -1.9)`.
           *   Let's pick `#o5 = (-0.5, -0.5)`. This was rejected as not reachable, but it's on the left side of the `v19` wall. Let's try `(-0.7, -0.5)`. This seems slightly more reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **For #o0 (communication):**
           *   `v9` (lander) `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`.
           *   Let's pick `#o0 = (-1.2, -1.0)`. This is outside the `v9` AABB `x` range (`-2.4` to `-1.3`), and `y` range (`-2.3` to `-1.6`). This should avoid collision with `v9` and be reachable. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)` initially, so moving to `(-1.2, -1.0)` is a short move. `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` so it's a longer move but `comvisible` implies it's possible.
           
           Let's retry with these, carefully considering the collision with `v19` (x=0 wall).

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The iterative process of finding valid configurations is proving challenging. Let's re-examine the constraints and geometry with a fresh perspective.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12` (Rover 1): `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `v14` (Rover 2): `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`
           
           **Obstacle:**
           *   `v19`: AABB `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` - This is a thin wall along the y-axis at x=0. Any configuration with an x-coordinate between -0.05 and 0.05 (inclusive) will be in collision.
           
           **Targets:**
           *   `v17` (Objective 1): `(0.593, 1.888)` (approx `(0.6, 1.9)`) - Positive x, positive y
           *   `v18` (Objective 2): `(-2.148, 1.799)` (approx `(-2.1, 1.8)`) - Negative x, positive y
           *   `v9` (Lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))` - Negative x, negative y. Center approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           *   `v1` (Rock - type v2/stone): `(-1.506, 0.327)` (approx `(-1.5, 0.3)`) - Negative x, positive y
           *   `v7` (Rock - type v6/soil): `(0.343, -1.983)` (approx `(0.3, -2.0)`) - Positive x, negative y
           
           **Understanding the `reachable` error:** If a configuration is repeatedly marked as "not reachable for robot base", it implies that there might not be a valid `motion` primitive available in the list to get to that configuration, or the path planning is failing due to other hidden obstacles or complex geometry not fully described in the AABB. Given the sparse AABB descriptions, it's more likely a path planning issue or I'm trying to jump too far.
           
           Let's stick to the available `motion` predicates. For example, `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)` exists, as well as `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)` and `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`. This means there *are* paths between these symbolic configurations. I need to pick values for `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0` that the continuous planner can fill.
           
           **Refined Strategy for Configuration Selection:**
           
           1.  **#o3 (Imaging):** Both `v17` and `v18` need to be imaged by `v12` from this single `#o3`.
               *   `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   `v17` is `(0.6, 1.9)`. `v18` is `(-2.1, 1.8)`.
               *   The `v19` wall is at `x=0`. So, `#o3` must have `x < -0.05` or `x > 0.05`.
               *   Range limit for imaging is 2.0. As established, it's very hard for one point to be within 2m of both `v17` and `v18` due to their separation. This means I MUST trust the problem statement that such an `#o3` exists and the `imagerange` predicates are valid for whatever my chosen value is.
               *   Let's try an `x` value far from the wall. `v12` is at `x=1.0`. `v17` is at `x=0.6`. `v18` is at `x=-2.1`.
               *   Let's pick `#o3 = (0.5, 0.5)`. This is on the positive side of `v19`. Reachable for `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
                   *   Dist to `v17`: `sqrt((0.6-0.5)^2 + (1.9-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 1.96) = sqrt(1.97) ~= 1.4` (GOOD).
                   *   Dist to `v18`: `sqrt((-2.1-0.5)^2 + (1.8-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-2.6)^2 + (1.3)^2) = sqrt(6.76 + 1.69) = sqrt(8.45) ~= 2.9` (STILL OUT OF RANGE).
           
               This suggests that either the 2.0m range is not strictly Euclidean distance in the provided `imagerange` predicate, or `imagevisible` is true for *some* `#o3` but my chosen ones are not working.
               Given `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` are *given* as true in the initial state, *for the same #o3*, it means such a configuration *must* exist. The continuous values I am providing for `#o3` are likely incorrect.
               I'm going to pick a point that is 'central' in the known map space, and away from the wall, hoping the underlying planner can bridge the gap for reachability and range. Let's try a point in the `y` positive range to see `v17` and `v18`, but more central in `x`. How about `(-0.5, 1.0)`. This point is reachable from `v12`'s initial position and avoids `v19`.
           
           2.  **#o5 (Sampling):** `v14` needs to sample `v1` and `v7` from this single `#o5`.
               *   `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   `v1` is at `(-1.5, 0.3)`. `v7` is at `(0.3, -2.0)`.
               *   Again, the `v19` wall is at `x=0`. So `#o5` must avoid `x` between -0.05 and 0.05.
               *   `v1` is on the negative `x` side, `v7` is on the positive `x` side. This makes a common `#o5` tricky. However, the initial predicates `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v7)` assert that such a `#o5` exists.
               *   Let's try a point that is more central, but avoids `x=0`. Maybe `(-0.5, -0.5)`. It was deemed "not reachable" before, but it is plausible for `v14` to move there from `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's assume the continuous planner has issues with my *specific* value rather than the general possibility of reaching it. How about `(-0.8, -0.8)`? This is closer to `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)` and to `v1` `(-1.5, 0.3)`. It avoids `v19`.
           
           3.  **#o0 (Communication):** Both `v12` and `v14` need to communicate with `v9` from this single `#o0`.
               *   `v9` (lander) is `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`.
               *   `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   `#o0` must avoid `v19` and not collide with `v9`.
               *   `v9` is entirely on the negative x-side. So, for communication, we should be on the negative x-side, but not inside `v9`.
               *   Let's try `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is outside the `v9` AABB by its `y` extent (`-2.3` to `-1.6`). This is close to `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)` so it should be reachable. It also avoids `v19`.
           
           This is the best I can do given the repeated failures and the contradictory information (a single #o3 for two far-apart targets, same for #o5 for rocks). I have to trust the given PDDL setup that these symbolic configurations are possible to reach and satisfy the conditions, and my values are just providing a hint.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     Given the persistent "not reachable for robot base" errors, it's highly likely that my assumed continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are consistently failing the underlying reachability checks. This could be due to:
           1.  **Implicit obstacles:** There might be more obstacles in the environment than just `v19` that restrict movement.
           2.  **Rover kinematics/dynamics:** The 'base' of the robot might have size constraints or turning radius limitations that make certain paths impossible, even if the straight-line distance seems fine.
           3.  **Ambiguity of `motion` predicate:** The `motion(?v, ?q1, ?t, ?q2)` predicate might imply a path exists for *some* `t`, but not necessarily a direct path for the chosen `q1` and `q2`. However, this is standard PDDL; `?t` is typically a continuous parameter for trajectory.
           
           Let's assume the issue is primarily with reachability to the chosen *numerical coordinates* for the configurations, not the existence of a valid configuration in principle, given the initial state provides `motion` predicates for these symbolic configurations. I will try to pick configurations that are very close to the rovers' initial positions, or very close to one another, to minimize "travel distance" as a source of "not reachable".
           
           **Re-evaluating Continuous Parameters:**
           
           *   **#o3 (Imaging for `v12`):** `v12` starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` is `(0.6, 1.9)`, `v18` is `(-2.1, 1.8)`. The previous attempts for `#o3` were generally "up and to the left" from `v12`'s start. Let's try something closer in `y`, but still avoiding `v19` (the wall at `x=0`).
               *   Let's try `#o3 = (0.7, 0.0)`. This is clearly on the positive `x` side of `v19`. It's a plausible move from `v13`.
                   *   Dist to `v17 (0.6, 1.9)`: `sqrt((0.6-0.7)^2 + (1.9-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 3.61) = sqrt(3.62) ~= 1.9` (Within 2m).
                   *   Dist to `v18 (-2.1, 1.8)`: `sqrt((-2.1-0.7)^2 + (1.8-0.0)^2) = sqrt((-2.8)^2 + (1.8)^2) = sqrt(7.84 + 3.24) = sqrt(11.08) ~= 3.33` (Still out of range for v18).
               This confirms the range issue for a single `#o3` to image both `v17` and `v18` with `v12`. However, the problem states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` as facts in the initial state, implying such a configuration *exists and is valid*. I must assume the planner will find *some* interpretation of `#o3` that satisfies this. Given this, I will select an arbitrary point that avoids `v19` and is somewhat central for the rover to navigate to. Let's choose `(0.5, 0.5)`. This has been attempted and failed before, but I must try again with a different perspective or trust in the system that such a location exists.
           
           *   **#o5 (Sampling for `v14`):** `v14` starts at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. `v1` is `(-1.5, 0.3)`, `v7` is `(0.3, -2.0)`. The `v19` wall is at `x=0`.
               *   Previous attempts like `(-0.8, -0.8)` failed. `v14` is on the negative `x` side. `v1` is also negative `x`. `v7` is positive `x`. This implies that `v14` will need to cross the `x=0` barrier to get to `v7` if a single `#o5` is used.
               *   Let's try `#o5 = (-0.5, -1.0)`. This is close to `v14`'s start, avoiding `v19`. It's still on the negative side. `above(v14, #o5, v7)` and `above(v14, #o5, v1)` implies that this single config is above both.
           
           *   **#o0 (Communication for `v12` and `v14`):** `v9` (lander) `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`.
               *   `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   Previous attempts failed for reachability. Let's pick a point extremely close to `v14`'s starting position that avoids `v9` and `v19`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` occupies `x` from `-2.4` to `-1.3`. So `x=-1.0` is good. `y` from `-2.3` to `-1.6`. So `y=-1.5` is outside `v9`'s y range on the high side. But `(-1.0, -1.5)` failed.
               *   Let's try `(-0.9, -1.0)`. This is outside the `y` range of `v9` and to the right of `v9`'s x-range. This is also away from `v19`. This should be very easy to reach for `v14`. For `v12`, it's a long travel.
           
           I must assume the environment is set up such that the given `motion`, `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates are satisfiable for *some* continuous values, even if my attempts at picking them fail. I will choose points that are "logically" sound in terms of avoiding the known obstacle `v19`, avoiding collision with `v9`, and being somewhat central/reachable from the rovers' initial states.
           
           Final attempt at configuration values based on reasoning:
           *   `#o3` (for `v12` to image `v17`, `v18`): `(0.5, 0.5)` - This is on the right side of `v19` and roughly central, hoping for reachability.
           *   `#o5` (for `v14` to sample `v1`, `v7`): `(-0.5, -1.0)` - This is on the left side of `v19`, closer to `v14`'s initial `y`, and attempting to balance being above both `v1` and `v7`.
           *   `#o0` (for `v12`, `v14` to communicate with `v9`): `(-0.9, -1.0)` - This is away from `v9` and `v19`, and relatively close to `v14`.
           
           It's crucial that the plan itself is correct, and I've verified the sequence of actions and their preconditions/effects. The continuous parameters are the only unknown.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     It appears there's a new obstacle `v20` that was not explicitly mentioned in the initial problem description (only `v19` was used in a collision check). This is a critical piece of information. `v20` is an AABB at `((0.26, 0.37), (0.39, 0.50))`. My last choice for `#o3` was `(0.5, 0.5)`, which is clearly *outside* `v20`'s x-range. So the collision with `v20` is unexpected given my calculations. It implies either the collision check accounts for rover size, or my coordinate interpretation differs. However, the problem states `v20` is an obstacle for `(0.5, 0.5)`.
           
           This makes it even harder to choose collision-free points. I must be more careful about the obstacles.
           
           **Obstacles to consider:**
           *   `v19`: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` (wall at `x=0`)
           *   `v20`: `((0.26, 0.37), (0.39, 0.50))` (small obstacle near `(0.3, 0.4)` approx)
           *   `v9`: `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))` (lander itself)
           
           Let's re-strategize with the new `v20` obstacle:
           
           **1. `#o3` (Imaging for `v12`):**
           *   `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   Targets: `v17 (0.6, 1.9)`, `v18 (-2.1, 1.8)`.
           *   `v19` wall: avoid `x` between `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
           *   `v20` obstacle: avoid `x` between `(0.26, 0.39)` and `y` between `(0.37, 0.50)`.
           *   Previous `#o3=(0.5, 0.5)` collided with `v20`. This indicates `v20` is larger than just its bounding box or the rover has a significant footprint. `(0.5, 0.5)` is outside the given `v20` AABB, so this is strange. It suggests my point selection logic may be flawed with respect to hidden rover/obstacle geometry.
           *   Given `v12` is on the positive x-side (`1.0`), and `v17` is also positive x (`0.6`), let's try to keep `#o3` on the positive x-side, above `v20`.
           *   Let's try `#o3 = (0.5, 1.0)`. This point is on the right of `v19`. It's well above `v20`'s y-range. This should avoid `v20`. It's also reachable from `v12`'s start. This point has been rejected previously as "not reachable for robot base", but given the new obstacle `v20` context, perhaps it was not collision-free before. Now that I know to avoid `v20`, maybe this spot will be okay.
           
           **2. `#o5` (Sampling for `v14`):**
           *   `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   Rocks: `v1 (-1.5, 0.3)`, `v7 (0.3, -2.0)`.
           *   `v19` wall: avoid `x` between `(-0.05, 0.05)`.
           *   `v20` obstacle: avoid `x` between `(0.26, 0.39)` and `y` between `(0.37, 0.50)`.
           *   Previous `(-0.5, -1.0)` was rejected as not reachable. `v14` is on the negative x-side. `v1` is negative x. `v7` is positive x. The constraint that one `#o5` can be `above` both is challenging.
           *   Let's try `#o5 = (-0.8, -1.5)`. This is very close to `v14`'s start `(-1.0, -1.75)`, on the negative `x` side (avoiding `v19` and `v20`). It should be reachable.
           
           **3. `#o0` (Communication for `v12`, `v14`):**
           *   Lander `v9`: `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.3, -1.6))`.
           *   `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   Avoid `v19` and `v20`. Avoid `v9` collision.
           *   Previous `(-0.9, -1.0)` failed. This point was on the right of `v9`'s x-range.
           *   Let's try a point that is on the positive `x` side of `v9` but still allows communication.
           *   Let's choose `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.7)`. This is on the right of `v9` (`x=-1.3`). It's near `v14`'s initial `y` (`-1.75`). It avoids `v19` and `v20`. It should be reachable for `v14`. For `v12`, it's a longer path, but `comvisible` is given.
           
           This is the most careful selection so far. I have to trust that the given `motion` predicates mean these points are indeed reachable and collision-free *if I pick the correct coordinates*.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The consistent "not reachable for robot base" errors for *all* the continuous configurations, despite repeated attempts to adjust them, strongly suggests a fundamental issue with finding any valid configuration for these operations under the given constraints. This is particularly puzzling because the PDDL initial state explicitly lists predicates like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, implying that such configurations *must* exist.
           
           The problem implies that if I provide specific (x,y) coordinates for these #objects, the underlying motion and visibility planner should be able to validate them. The repeated failures across various chosen coordinates, even those seemingly logical or near the start points, point to:
           
           1.  **Undisclosed complex geometry/obstacles:** Beyond `v19` and `v20`, there might be other features severely limiting free space, or the rover's shape itself creates large no-go zones around these AABBs.
           2.  **Strict Reachability/Kinematics:** The robot's movement capabilities (e.g., turning radius, minimum/maximum step size, non-holonomic constraints) are extremely restrictive, making most "logically" accessible points unreachable by the base.
           3.  **PDDL Setup Misinterpretation:** While the PDDL predicates like `imagevisible` *imply* existence of valid #o3, the specific values I choose are not being accepted by the continuous planner.
           
           Given that *all* continuous parameters I've provided so far (for `v12`'s imaging, `v14`'s sampling, and both rovers' communication) have been rejected for reachability, and that the range constraints for imaging targets like `v17` and `v18` by `v12` from a single `#o3` are physically difficult to satisfy within 2m, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find valid coordinates that meet all criteria.
           
           At this point, it is highly probable that, under the assumed interpretation of the continuous parameters and the hidden continuous planner's constraints, the goal as stated is **unachievable** from the initial state by providing *any* numerical coordinates for the required `#` objects, as they are all failing reachability checks. The problem requires collision-free, occlusion-free, and *reachable* configurations. If no reachable configurations exist, then no plan can be formed.
           
           I will state that the goal is unachievable, as I cannot find a set of reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free continuous configurations that satisfy the predicates required by the plan.
