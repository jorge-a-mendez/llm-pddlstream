User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.046, 0.332), (0.046, 0.424)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.11, -0.375), (-0.026, -0.291)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, -0.326), (-0.156, -0.229)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.207, 0.134), (0.288, 0.215)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.0, 0.378, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.557).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.068, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.624).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.205, -0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.958, -0.287).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, 0.175, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.765, 0.644).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Objective: Placing Objects on a Surface**
           
           My task is to create a plan to arrange several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) onto a designated surface (`v18`). The core requirement is that each object must be "on" `v18`. From my understanding of the problem space, this requires that the objects must be supported at a certain pose. To achieve this, I need to pick up each object, and then place it on `v18` at a specified pose.
           
           **Analyzing the Initial State and Goals**
           
           Currently, the objects are resting on another surface (`v11`). To successfully satisfy the goal state I will focus on finding the poses to place the objects on `v18`. Importantly, I also need to ensure these poses do not cause any collision. The initial configuration provides "kin" facts that seem to facilitate this task because I have already observed from the given facts that all the objects are already supported at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           **Actions and Constraints**
           
           The robot has two arms (`v4` and `v6`), though only one (`v4`) is relevant based on the given facts. The arm `v4` and its related grasping, base configuration, and trajectory parameters (`#o1`, `v3`, `#o4`) are set to be consistently used across all pick and place actions. The robot base won't move.
           
           **Plan Construction**
           
           Given the restrictions, the plan will comprise of a series of pick and place actions for each object. I will construct a plan where I assign unique poses to each object, and avoid potential conflicts, by ensuring the objects don't intersect. I can determine each objects pose as follows:
           
           1.  Pick `v8` from `v9`. Place `v8` on `v18` at (#o2 v8 v18): (-0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0)
           2.  Pick `v12` from `v13`. Place `v12` on `v18` at (#o2 v12 v18): (0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0)
           3.  Pick `v14` from `v15`. Place `v14` on `v18` at (#o2 v14 v18): (-0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0)
           4.  Pick `v16` from `v17`. Place `v16` on `v18` at (#o2 v16 v18): (0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossible Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a task with a clear goal: get four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) onto `v18`.  The current situation is that they're all "on" `v11`, meaning they are supported by `v11`. The initial state also specifies that these objects are at specific poses, i.e., `atpose(v8,v9)` etc.
           
           I immediately see the problem: the only action I'm *allowed* to perform is a simple move. It's `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This boils down to: "Do nothing." The robot can only move its base *from* v3 *to* v3.  The cost is zero, because it's not actually moving.
           
           Crucially, there are *no* `pick` or `place` actions available. And to achieve the goal state of getting those objects onto `v18`, I need to change their positions.  I need to manipulate the `atpose` and `supported` predicates, which then, in turn, will change the `on` predicate to achieve the goal state.
           
           The core issue is that I'm essentially handcuffed.  I can't interact with any of the objects. Since the permitted `move_base` action doesn't change anything related to the objects' positions or support, there is no way for me to change the `on` predicate from `v11` to `v18` for any of the objects. It's a complete mismatch between the goal and the available tools. This means the goal state is unreachable with the given constraints. It's an unsolvable problem with the provided action set.
