User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.046, 0.332), (0.046, 0.424)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.11, -0.375), (-0.026, -0.291)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, -0.326), (-0.156, -0.229)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.207, 0.134), (0.288, 0.215)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.0, 0.378, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.557).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.068, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.624).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.205, -0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.958, -0.287).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, 0.175, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.765, 0.644).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of Planning Process**
           
           Okay, here's the plan I've put together. The goal is to get four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. I've got two robot arms, v4 and v6, but for this, I'll only be using v4. My plan is based on the following:
           
           *   **Problem Setup:** The robot, currently at bconf v3 with arms at aconf v5 and v7, needs to move these objects from their current poses (v9, v13, v15, and v17) to v18. All these objects are initially supported by v11.
           *   **Key Considerations:**
               *   Since all objects will share the same *symbolic* pose `#o2` on v18, I'll have to provide *four distinct* continuous poses, one for each object.
               *   The robot must move to a base configuration `#o3` before any pick or place operation.
               *   I need to ensure no collisions occur during approach, picking, placement, and that the final poses are stable and collision-free.
           *   **The Plan:**
               1.  **Move Base:**  The robot's base will move from v3 to #o3.
               2.  **Pick v8:**  Use arm v4 to pick v8 from pose v9.
               3.  **Place v8:** Place v8 onto surface v18 at the calculated pose associated with #o2.
               4.  **Pick v12:** Use arm v4 to pick v12 from pose v13.
               5.  **Place v12:** Place v12 onto surface v18 at a different calculated pose associated with #o2.
               6.  **Pick v14:** Use arm v4 to pick v14 from pose v15.
               7.  **Place v14:** Place v14 onto surface v18 at a different calculated pose associated with #o2.
               8.  **Pick v16:** Use arm v4 to pick v16 from pose v17.
               9.  **Place v16:** Place v16 onto surface v18 at a different calculated pose associated with #o2.
           *   **Pose Details:** The key is to calculate four distinct poses for placing the objects on v18.  I've estimated object sizes and chosen poses to avoid any overlaps, taking into account the AABB of surface v18 which is centered at (0,0). Each object's calculated position on v18 is:
               *   v8: (0.056, -0.056, 0.781, 0.0)
               *   v12: (0.0505, 0.0845, 0.781, 0.0)
               *   v14: (-0.0765, 0.0765, 0.781, 0.0)
               *   v16: (-0.083, -0.052, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   **Action Properties:** The plan relies on `kin` facts for the robot arm `v4` and base movements.  I'm confident I can make the plan collision free. The object coordinates will be adjusted so there are no collisions.
           
           I've ensured I follow the correct structure and axioms of the `pick` and `place` actions, and that all needed preconditions are satisfied.
