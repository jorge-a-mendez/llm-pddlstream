User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.046, 0.332), (0.046, 0.424)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.11, -0.375), (-0.026, -0.291)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.253, -0.326), (-0.156, -0.229)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.207, 0.134), (0.288, 0.215)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.0, 0.378, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.83, 0.557).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.068, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.624).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.205, -0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.958, -0.287).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, 0.175, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.765, 0.644).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Task and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to get all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto v18.  The key here is understanding the "on" predicate - it's satisfied when an object is both supported by a surface AND at a specific pose.  In this case, the objects are currently at poses on the table (v11), but the goal demands they be on the dummy object v18.
           
           Initially, v18 is a dummy, but it's implied that these dummies are common in planning and are meant to be replaced by real surfaces in action execution.  The problem structure indicates that v11 will play that role for our goal, and v11 is already a real, available surface.  The problem implicitly indicates that the  `#o2` poses on `v18` are now targets on `v11`.
           
           The immediate challenge arises from the *strict* constraint on available actions. We're only allowed to use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That's it. No picking, no placing, nothing else.
           
           Now, let's look at what that means. The goal is to alter the *atpose* predicates of each of the four objects. Currently, they're at poses on v11:  `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `atpose(v16, v17)`, and `atpose(v14, v15)`.  To move them to v18 (or more precisely, to target locations that represent v18's intended support position), we would need a plan involving actions that change atpose's state via pick and place. Those are missing from the action list.  `move_base` changes nothing of that sort.
           
           Since the *only* action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, and this doesn't interact with any of the object positions or states we need to change, it's immediately clear that the goal is *unachievable*. We cannot manipulate the objects in any way using only `move_base`, and thus cannot make any changes.
           
           Let's spell it out: the "on" relation is fundamentally linked to *atpose*.  To move something *on* something else requires a change in its atpose, which necessitates the use of *pick* and *place* actions.  Since these actions are expressly forbidden by the problem's action constraint, we're stuck. We cannot alter the object poses, therefore it's impossible to reach the goal. The robot's base can move but there is nothing to do. The plan is not achievable under the given constraint.
