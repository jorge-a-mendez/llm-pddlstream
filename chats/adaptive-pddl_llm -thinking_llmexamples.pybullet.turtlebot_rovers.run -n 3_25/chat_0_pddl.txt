           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           My task is to reach the goal `new-axiom@0()` from the given starting conditions. To do so, I need a plan, and I've broken down the goal into its core parts: ensuring certain predicates are true. These are things like `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`. I've analyzed each of these to see what initial state they're in and what actions will be needed to fulfill those that are not true at the beginning.
           
           I noted several key initial conditions: certain rovers are at specific configurations, and a store is free. The problem provides restricted move actions, meaning most actions have no effect on configurations, and drop actions have a specific precondition that isn't true initially.
           
           Based on the predicates I needed to satisfy, the plan will revolve around `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. I've determined that all images can be taken by a single rover, and therefore, I can reuse actions. To get the `receivedimage` conditions true, I'll need to calibrate a camera, take an image, and then send it. I'll need to repeat this set of actions for each image. To achieve the `receivedanalysis` conditions, I'll sample a rock, send its analysis, and clear the store to avoid any conflicts with `free` status on stores.
           
           For each `take_image`, the camera must be re-calibrated.
           
           I need to satisfy these predicates:
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a rock of type `v2` (e.g., v1)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a rock of type `v6` (e.g., v5)
           
           Here is the strategy:
           1.  **Imaging** - I can complete the imaging requirements: calibrate, take, then send images for objects 17, 18, and 19.
           
           2.  **Analysis** - I will then sample and send the analysis of type-specific rocks. I will ensure that stores are cleared after each sample as well.
           
           The final plan is:
           1.  Calibrate, take image, send image for object 17.
           2.  Calibrate, take image, send image for object 18.
           3.  Calibrate, take image, send image for object 19.
           4.  Sample and send analysis for a rock of type v2, and then clear the store.
           5.  Sample and send analysis for a rock of type v6, and then clear the store.
           
           This plan should fully meet all the conditions for `new-axiom@0()`, including the initial conditions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating the Problem: The Impossible Mission**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. My initial plan was using actions outside the permitted list. After re-reading the instructions, the limitation on available actions is painfully clear. Only a handful of actions are allowed: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           The `move` actions are essentially meaningless, as they involve moving rovers *to their current location* – a location that doesn't change.  The `drop_rock` actions have a critical precondition: `full(?v, ?s)`.  My initial state shows that the stores for these rocks are *free*, not full. Meaning `full(v12, v16)` and `full(v14, v16)` are *false*. This is a critical point.
           
           Now, let's look at the goals. The goal `new-axiom@0()` expands into a series of true statements, and the crucial parts involve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. To achieve these, I would need actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, *none* of these actions are permitted.
           
           Considering the restricted actions I *am* allowed to perform, the situation is dire. I can only perform no-op moves or useless drop actions, as I can't meet the preconditions to perform drop. None of the actions available to me alter the state in any way that brings me closer to achieving the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals.
           
           Essentially, I am given a set of completely ineffective tools to accomplish the task at hand. The goals are unreachable given the constraints.  The problem description is subtly, or not so subtly, a failure! The only possible plan is to do nothing, which is valid, and valid for all possible states (except ones with full storage) of the problem. This problem is not solvable.
