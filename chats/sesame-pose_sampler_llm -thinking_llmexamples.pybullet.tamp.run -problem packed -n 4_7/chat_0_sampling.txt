(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0, a task that I can approach systematically. Object 7 is a square with dimensions (0.08528699136713325, 0.08528699136713325), and I've noted that its square shape eliminates rotational considerations from AABB calculations.
           
           Surface 0 is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. For a stable placement, the object's AABB must fit entirely within the surface's boundaries. Since the object's square shape means `theta` won't affect the AABB dimensions, it simplifies calculations.
           
           I calculated the valid x and y range for the center of the object to be approximately `[-0.0923565, 0.0923565]`. To find 50 placements, I will create a 7x7 grid, which gives 49 points with x and y coordinates that fall between these boundaries, adding a single placement to get 50. I'll pick these center coordinates using x = -0.0923565 + i * 0.0307855, where i is from 0 to 6. For the remaining placement, I'll place the object at the center with `theta` set to pi/4.
           
           This approach will ensure a varied set of stable and well-distributed placements. All `theta` values are 0 apart from the 50th placement.

(Thoughts: **Placing a New Object on Surface 0: A Collision-Free Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, I've got a new object (ID 5) with dimensions that are pretty much square:  `0.09714710426244011 x 0.09714710426244011`. I need to place this on Surface 0, which already has a smaller object (ID 7) placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.0923565, -0.0923565)`. My goal is to find 50 stable, non-colliding placements for object 5. Surface 0's bounds are `x_min = -0.135` to `x_max = 0.135` and the same for y.
           
           First, I calculate the half-side length (`h5`) of object 5, which is `0.048573552131220055`. This tells me the valid center range for object 5: `x` and `y` must be within `[-0.086426447868779945, 0.086426447868779945]`.
           
           Object 7's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) is `[-0.135, -0.049713] x [-0.135, -0.049713]`.  Since it's in the bottom-left of the surface, I figure I'll place the new object around the right or top, out of the way.
           
           To guarantee no overlap, the center of object 5, which I'll call `(x5, y5)`, needs to satisfy these conditions: either `x5` has to be greater than  `-0.001139447868779945`, or `y5` has to be greater than  `-0.001139447868779945`. In other words,  the region to the left and below the already placed object are forbidden zones.
           
           To solve this, I'll generate a grid over the valid region. It has to avoid the small "forbidden" region within the bounding box of object 7. I found that I need to filter a  `9x9` grid of coordinates where 16 points out of 81 would collide, making 65 available. The first 50 stable places can be taken from this. Each placement uses a rotation of `theta = 0.0` as the object is symmetric.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object ID 4**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 7 and 5). Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Define the Scene:** Surface 0 is a square, and I know its dimensions. I also have the dimensions of object ID 4, which lets me calculate the maximum valid range for the object's center `(x4, y4)` to keep it entirely within the surface.
           
           2.  **Calculate the Collision-Free Regions:** I've determined the minimum bounding boxes (AABBs) of the two existing objects, IDs 7 and 5. By expanding these AABBs by half the object's size (h4) in all directions, I've defined "forbidden regions" (FR1 and FR2) within which the center of object ID 4 cannot be placed to prevent collisions.
           
           3.  **Create a Grid and Check:** I've created a grid of potential `(x4, y4)` center coordinates within the valid surface area. I will generate a 12x12 grid. I used the step size, computed to find the best-spaced points for the object.
           
           4.  **Enforce Collision Avoidance:** I will iterate through all points in my grid and check each potential placement against both forbidden regions (FR1 and FR2). If a potential placement lies within either forbidden region, then I will discard that placement.
           
           5.  **Identify Valid Placements and Choose 50:** Any placement that is NOT within FR1 or FR2 is considered valid. I identified that the valid coordinates will be columns 7 to 11 (where x will be greater than 0.01052069). Since I have 12 rows of valid y coordinates, I have 5 \* 12 valid combinations. I will filter the first 50 valid coordinates and use them for the placement of Object ID 4. The initial angle, theta, for each will be 0.0.
           
           This strategy should efficiently find 50 stable and collision-free placements for object ID 4.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with placing object 6, a nearly square object with dimensions roughly 0.0986, on surface 0 within the bounds of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), and I need to avoid collisions with objects 7, 5, and 4.  My first step is to calculate the valid placement area for object 6, then I need to figure out which parts of that area are off-limits because of the other objects. I will use AABB collision checks, and I know that I must exclude an area around existing objects from any placement region.
           
           I start by calculating the stability constraints for Object ID 6. The object has to fit within the boundaries of the surface, giving me a valid range of `[-0.0856936, 0.0856936]` for both its x and y coordinates.
           
           Next, the collision checks with the other objects. Object 7 is located and oriented in a way to make part of my valid region invalid, as does object 5 and 4.
           I compute the *forbidden regions* for object 6 based on these. For each object I figure out the AABB and by how much it extends to the collision buffer around the existing objects.
           
           After computing these regions, I'll intersect them with the valid surface area, which provides a description of the forbidden placement coordinates due to collision restrictions.
           
           *   **Object ID 7** creates a forbidden region that is `[-0.0856936, -0.0004066]` for both x and y.
           *   **Object ID 5** is much larger and restricts object 6's area, with a collision area of `[-0.0856936, 0.0114535]` for `x` and `[-0.0856936, 0.0856936]` for `y`. This excludes a vertical strip on the left-hand side of the surface for x-values less than 0.0114535 and all y-values.
           *   **Object ID 4** creates a forbidden area `[-0.0740546, 0.0856936]` for `x` and `[-0.0856936, 0.01105358]` for `y`.
           
           To finalize the allowed placement area, I need to combine all forbidden regions, since these can potentially overlap.
           The forbidden area due to object 5's x and y region is larger than object 7's. I also notice that object 4 has y values from -0.0856936 to 0.01105358.
           
           The forbidden x values are, so any point with an `x` value less than `0.0114535` is forbidden regardless of `y` value, due to the overlap between the forbidden regions.
           Therefore, the valid x values must be in the range `(0.0114535, 0.0856936]` and the valid y-values must be greater than `0.01105358`.
           
           Now I need to check for available coordinates. With the knowledge of the valid ranges, I must compute a sufficiently dense grid to provide a final list of potential placements.
           I calculate a grid with a 20x20 density. I use coordinates, using the formula I computed with the previously defined constraints, and calculate the forbidden areas to place my object.
           For the finely defined grid, the valid values for `x` are from `0.01353037935748232` to `0.0856935973852456`, and the valid values for `y` are from `0.01353037935748232` to `0.0856935973852456`.
           
           In the end, I'll have a set of valid coordinates that meet these criteria, and use these to compute the final 50 placement points.
