User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.027, -0.37), (0.062, -0.28)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.241, 0.437), (-0.147, 0.531)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.174, -0.458), (-0.091, -0.376)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.108, 0.519), (0.184, 0.595)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.018, -0.325, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.985, 0.173).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.194, 0.484, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.525, 0.851).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.133, -0.417, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.099, 0.995).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.146, 0.557, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.041, 0.999).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've developed to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto surface v18.** I started by understanding that the robot, with its arm v4, needs to pick each object from its initial pose on surface v11 and then place it onto a new pose on v18. The challenge lies in defining suitable, collision-free placements on v18, which has a square AABB of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135) and all objects have to be placed at z=0.781. The continuous parameter '#o2' in the predicates like `pose(v16, #o2)` requires that I must give a continuous value for these poses. It means that there is a distinct value of `#o2` for each object/surface combination, and that is what I am doing by assigning individual (#o2, object, v18) poses.
           
           To ensure stability and avoid collisions, I've decided to arrange the objects in a 2x2 grid-like pattern on v18. Based on the objects' footprints, I've calculated a center placement for each object such that they are within the bounds of v18. I'll maintain the z-coordinate from the initial poses, 0.781, and set theta to 0. The plan consists of a sequence of eight actions: pick v16, place v16, pick v14, place v14, pick v8, place v8, pick v12, place v12, ensuring that all actions are kinematically feasible. No robot base movement is needed as the base configuration `v3` is valid for the whole plan and is already the current configuration.
           
           I have verified all the preconditions, especially the `kin` constraints, that need to be met. I have explicitly chosen distinct and valid poses for the new locations for each object, making sure there are no overlaps. The new poses for placing the objects onto v18 are:
           - `(-0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` for v16
           - `(0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` for v14
           - `(-0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` for v8
           - `(0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` for v12.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Progress**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very restricted set of actions, and it's immediately clear that I'm completely hamstrung here. The user correctly pointed out that every single `pick` and `place` action I considered is invalid. In fact, the *only* thing I'm allowed to do is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This effectively means I can *only* sit still. I can't move anything, I can't interact with any objects.
           
           My goal is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  I know that to get an object *on* something, I need to *place* it there.  But...I have no `place` actions available!  And crucially, I can't *pick* things up either! 
           
           So, I'm stuck. Given these constraints, there's absolutely no way I can rearrange the objects to satisfy the goal predicates. This problem, as presented, is fundamentally unsolvable. It's a classic case of an incomplete action set rendering the goal unreachable.
