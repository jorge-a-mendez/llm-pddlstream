           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that becomes true when a combination of conditions are met. Looking at the definition, the goal requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           9. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state for these conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True
           
           So, the first four conditions are already met. We only need to achieve conditions 5-10.
           
           For conditions 5-8 (`receivedimage`): We need to `take_image` and then `send_image` for each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) using mode `v11`. To `take_image`, the camera needs to be `calibrated`.
           The camera `v10` is `onboard` both `v12` and `v14` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           Let's consider rover `v14`:
           - It is at `v15`.
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v20)` are all true, meaning `v14` can see all required objectives from `conf #o3`.
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true, meaning `v14` can communicate with lander `v9` from `conf #o0`.
           - We need to first `calibrate` `v10` using `v14` at `conf #o3`. Then, we can `take_image` for each objective. After taking images, we can `send_image` for each. Note that the calibration is only needed once.
           Since `atconf(v14, v15)` is true, but image capture and communication occur at different configurations (`#o3` and `#o0`), the rover would need to move if those configurations were different from `v15`. However, the problem statement says `#o0` and `#o3` are continuous parameters, so we can assume they correspond to `v15` if no moves are available that would change the `atconf` to them. Given that no move actions are available to move `v14` to a new configuration other than `v15`, we must assume that `#o0` and `#o3` are equivalent to `v15` for the purpose of action pre-conditions, if they are valid. Also, since there are no `blocked` rays, we can proceed.
           
           For conditions 9-10 (`receivedanalysis` for stone and soil types):
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` are all of type `v2` (stone).
           - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` are all of type `v6` (soil).
           - We need to `sample_rock` for at least one rock of type `v2` and one rock of type `v6`. Then, we need to `send_analysis`.
           - Rover `v14` is `above` multiple rocks of both types from `conf #o5`. For example, `above(v14, #o5, v3)` (type v2 stone) and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` (type v6 soil).
           - `store(v16)` is available, and `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           - Similar to images, we assume `#o5` is `v15` for sampling as no moves are available.
           
           Let's use rover `v14` for all operations.
           
           Plan steps:
           1. Calibrate camera `v10` on `v14` to take images of `v18` (this calibration will apply to all objectives).
           2. Take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` with `v14`.
           3. Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` with `v14`.
           4. Sample rock `v3` (type `v2` - stone) with `v14`.
           5. Send analysis of `v3` with `v14`.
           6. Sample rock `v5` (type `v6` - soil) with `v14`. (Note: Rover needs a free store for this. Since `sample_rock` fills `v16` and we only have one store, we might need to `drop_rock` first. However, the goal only requires one of each type to be analyzed. If we analyze `v3` and `v5`, it fulfills the goal.)
           The initial state has `free(v14, v16)`. After `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v3, v16)`, `full(v14, v16)` becomes true and `free(v14, v16)` becomes false. To sample `v5`, we need to `drop_rock(v14, v16)` first.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the analysis part: The axiom needs `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for `type(?soil, v6)`. This means we only need to sample and send analysis for one rock of type `v2` and one rock of type `v6`. We have `free(v14, v16)` initially.
           
           Revised analysis plan:
           1. Sample `v3` (type `v2`) with `v14` into `v16`. `full(v14, v16)` becomes true. `analyzed(v14, v3)` becomes true.
           2. Send analysis of `v3` with `v14`. `receivedanalysis(v3)` becomes true.
           3. `drop_rock(v14, v16)` to free up the store.
           4. Sample `v5` (type `v6`) with `v14` into `v16`. `full(v14, v16)` becomes true. `analyzed(v14, v5)` becomes true.
           5. Send analysis of `v5` with `v14`. `receivedanalysis(v5)` becomes true.
           
           The available actions only include `move` and `drop_rock`. This means no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions are available in the provided list. This makes the goal unreachable.
           
           The provided action instances are:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, and no actions related to imaging, sampling, or sending analysis are present in the *allowed action instances*, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is not achievable because the necessary actions for taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis are not provided in the list of valid action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available, which are insufficient to meet the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` requirements of the goal axiom `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is not achievable because the necessary actions for taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis are not provided in the list of valid action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are available, which are insufficient to meet the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` requirements of the goal axiom `new-axiom@0()`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires several conditions to be met, specifically `receivedimage` for multiple objectives and `receivedanalysis` for different rock types.
           
           Upon reviewing the initial state, we have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           
           These four conditions, which are part of the `new-axiom@0()` conjunction, are already true in the initial state.
           
           However, the remaining conditions for `new-axiom@0()` are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, actions like `take_image` and `send_image` are required. To achieve `receivedanalysis`, actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are required.
           
           The list of *valid action instances* provided for this task is extremely limited:
           - `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           - `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           - `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           - `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           None of the actions required to `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` are present in this list of valid actions. Since these actions are essential to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, and they cannot be performed using only the allowed `move` and `drop_rock` actions, the goal is unachievable with the given constraints.
           
           Therefore, no plan can be constructed to reach the goal.
