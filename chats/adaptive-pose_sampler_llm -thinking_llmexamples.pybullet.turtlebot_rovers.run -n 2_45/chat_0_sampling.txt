User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.** The task is to find three possible locations (x, y) for a robot base to "see" a target point at (0.0, -0.8).  I need to keep the robot within a distance of 2 from the target and avoid collisions with walls and other obstacles. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.
           
           **My immediate concern is that the target point is *inside* a vertical obstacle at x = 0 (a thin wall).**  This creates a line-of-sight challenge, and it's practically impossible to be in the *same* x-range as the target and have a line of sight. It means the robot must be on *either* side of the vertical wall if the target is considered "on" the face of that wall.
           
           I've got the boundaries of the workspace: x and y both go from -2.5 to 2.5, but, the walls themselves reduce that valid range down to a little less. I'll use -2.45 to 2.45 to be safe.  I’ve mapped out a circle around the target to see where I can place the robot.
           
           **Key Obstacle: The Vertical Wall.** The real problem is this thin vertical wall at x = 0. My initial thought is that the robot has to be placed slightly to the left or right of it to get a clear line of sight, otherwise, it *is* an occlusion. This implies the target is *on the face* of the vertical wall, rather than inside.
           
           **Finding the Positions.**  I've come up with three potential positions.  I want diversity in my placements because the user wants "3 different positions." I want them *close* enough to the target, so I'll position one robot on the *right* side just beyond the wall. The first location is (0.1, -0.8). The second location is (-0.1, -0.8). The third location is (0.5, 0.0).
           
           I’ve verified that each position is within the distance limit of 2, and should have a clear line of sight to the target assuming that a point on the wall *is* visible. I also double-checked for collisions with other obstacles.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Target Visibility and Obstacle Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new request, and the target is at `(0.0, -0.8)`. This looks familiar – I *think* I saw this target in a previous request, and that one was a bit of a puzzle.  I need to make sure I'm using the *current* target now.
           
           Last time, I tried `(0.1, -0.8)`, `(-0.1, -0.8)`, and `(0.5, 0.0)`. Those failed, and the feedback mentioned collisions, which I had to re-evaluate.  A key piece of this puzzle is that central vertical obstacle, AABB 5: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. The target, `(0.0, -0.8)`, puts it directly inside that obstacle, which is impossible to see, from any location. My thought is that it must be on the surface of the obstacle, so line-of-sight is possible by being on either side.
           
           To recap, if the robot's x coordinate is within `-0.05` to `0.05`, then it's *inside* the wall, so it must be outside this range.  I've got a distance limit of 2, so I must stay within that radius, and not inside the wall.
           
           So let's consider the robot position with respect to AABB 5:
           *   I want robot positions to the right and left.
           *   The previous failures are interesting: I have a radius around the base. I'll need to stay far from it.
           
           Let's test these three robot positions:
           1.  `(0.11, -0.8)`: Just outside the AABB 5 on the right side. Close to the target. Line-of-sight should be clear.
           2.  `(-0.11, -0.8)`: Just outside AABB 5 on the left side. Again, close to the target. Line-of-sight should be clear.
           3.  `(0.5, 1.136)`: Still within max range=2, a further-out position. This gives another angle for viewability.
           
           My analysis also considers the past failures. The previous error message for the other target `(-1.9599, 2.1219)` was confusing, because it said I was colliding with an obstacle, but the coordinates didn't match. It seems like the collision detection system might be a bit tricky. Now, I have these positions, the robot should be on either side to be able to see the target.
           
           I will also make sure the target is viewed. I need to make sure I am not colliding with any of the obstacles in the scene. I have 11 other obstacles to consider for collisions with the proposed robot positions. I then make sure the robots, can see the target position by drawing a line, which is line-of-sight. The target at `(0.0, -0.8)` means I need to view either `(-0.05, -0.8)` or `(0.05, -0.8)`, so line-of-sight must be clear.
           
           My reasoning will focus on how each selected robot position, can view the target point, and how obstacles might affect the line of sight.
