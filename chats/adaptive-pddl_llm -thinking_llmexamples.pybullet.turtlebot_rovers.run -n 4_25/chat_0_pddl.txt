           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out a plan to achieve this `new-axiom@0()` thing.  It seems pretty straightforward at first - get images and analyses. But when I dove into the details, I hit a snag. The problem is with these configurations. I can see what needs to be done: get images of objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`, analyze some rocks of types `v2` and `v6`. That's the easy part. The real challenge is *how* to do it given the constraints.
           
           My initial assumption was, use rovers, take pictures with cameras, send the images and the rock samples. Seems pretty basic. But the preconditions are very specific, especially the `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicates. I've got a rover at configuration `v15` (for rover `v14`) and another at `v13` (for rover `v12`).  But the image and communication actions all require the rovers to be at some `#o` configuration, which is different from the given ones.
           
           Here's the problem: I can't move the rovers.  The only move actions provided don't actually change the configuration. They just reinforce the current one! So, I'm stuck with `v15` for rover `v14` and `v13` for rover `v12`. I need to be at `#o3` to take an image, `#o0` to communicate, and `#o5` for the analysis.  But there's no way to *get* to those configurations. It's a complete dead end.
           
           I considered whether these `#o` variables might be implicitly related to the *current* configuration, but that's a misinterpretation. These are just parameters to be determined. The PDDL syntax is clear: the `atconf` *has* to match the `q` argument to the action.
           
           The lack of movement options makes the plan impossible. The domain explicitly states only the given actions are allowed. No movement to get to the required configs means all the actions needed to fulfill the goal, `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are unachievable.
           
           Even if I try a sequence of `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `sample_rock` actions, I always hit the same `atconf` block. I need a movement action to achieve the configurations, and none are provided.
           
           Therefore, despite the potential simplicity of the overall task, given the initial state and provided actions, this goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is simply unreachable.
