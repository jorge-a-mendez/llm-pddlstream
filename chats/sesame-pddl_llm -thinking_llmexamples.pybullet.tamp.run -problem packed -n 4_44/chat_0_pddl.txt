(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my approach to this. We're looking at getting a few objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, all onto a specific surface, `v18`. Right now, they're each sitting somewhere else, specifically at poses `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17`, respectively, all supported by `v11`.  We need them on `v18`, and we know the key to this is the `on` axiom: something is "on" another thing if it's supported by it *and* at the correct pose.
           
           Breaking it down, we know these objects are currently on `v11`, but we need to move them. We have facts like `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` to clarify the initial conditions.
           
           Looking at `v18`, we know there's support available for all these objects at a new, as-yet-unnamed pose, denoted as `#o2`.  We can assume from facts such as `supported(v16, #o2, v18)` that this specific pose `#o2` is "on" `v18`.  Given this, it's a straightforward sequence:
           
           1.  **Preparation**: First, we need to prepare the robot by moving the base to a config, `#o3`,  using a `move_base` step to be positioned for the task.
           2.  **Object-by-Object Transfer**: The plan will be to individually *pick* each object from its initial pose and *place* it at our target pose, `#o2`, which will be a pose "on" `v18`.
           
           So, for each object, the plan is:
           
           *   **Move Base to Config `#o3` (first step)**
           *   **(PICK and PLACE) for object `v8` from `v9`**
           *   **(PICK and PLACE) for object `v12` from `v13`**
           *   **(PICK and PLACE) for object `v14` from `v15`**
           *   **(PICK and PLACE) for object `v16` from `v17`**
           
           The steps involving `pick` require the arm to be empty (`handempty(v4)`) and `place` moves to the new pose.  These actions assume that we have the proper robot kinematic parameters and collision checks handled in the pre-defined actions. We will also include movement of base.
           
           The preconditions of `atbconf(#o3)` after moving base must be ensured, so a `move_base` action must precede any `pick` if the state is not already at `#o3`. However, the state updates from action `pick` to `place` maintain `atbconf(#o3)` and also `canmove()`, which means that it can move to base config to pick objects and place them.
           
           Assuming the proper kinematics, we'll execute the plan. The whole thing hinges on a good `kin` relationship being present and no "unsafe" situations to be found.
