(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this. I need to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a square with dimensions around 0.085 meters, on surface 0, a square area roughly 0.27 meters across. Since it's a square, its orientation (theta) doesn't change the object's footprint.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid region for the object's center. It's bounded by the surface, so I have to calculate the inward offset due to the object's half-size (about 0.042 meters). This gives me a safe zone for the center coordinates, roughly -0.093 to 0.093 for both x and y.
           
           To get those diverse placements, I'll set up a grid for x and y coordinates within that safe zone. A 7x7 grid should give me 49 points. I can calculate the spacing between the points based on the x and y coordinate range.
           
           For each grid point, I'll vary the rotation angle (theta). I can step through theta, evenly distributing it across 2*pi.  For theta, I'll use 50 increments to have it rotate 360 degrees.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll just reuse the center point, x=0, y=0, with a different theta, making sure I haven't covered the entire circle yet.
           
           This should give me a good spread of placements, both in terms of position and orientation. I'll make sure to double-check my calculations to make sure the placements don't violate the stability constraints.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put object 4 without it crashing into object 5 or going outside the surface. Here's the breakdown of my thinking:
           
           1.  **Analyze Object 5:** I've got the exact coordinates of object 5 and its size. From that, I've calculated the bounding box (AABB) of object 5, which helps me define the forbidden zone.
           2.  **Define the Surface and Object 4:** I know the surface's boundaries and the dimensions of object 4. Since object 4 is also a square, I can calculate its half-extents.
           3.  **Establish Containment Criteria:** I figured out the mathematical conditions that *must* be met to keep object 4 inside the surface bounds. That basically means the center of object 4 has to stay within a specific x and y range.
           4.  **Collision Avoidance (Key Part):** Now, the tricky bit. I need to ensure object 4 *never* touches object 5. So, I need to make sure the AABB of object 4 *doesn't* overlap with the AABB of object 5. I set up the conditions to *avoid* collision.
           5.  **Identify Valid Placement Zones:** Based on those no-collision conditions, I can find the valid areas where I *can* put object 4. I see two main zones: one to the right of object 5 and one above it.
           6.  **Generate Stable Placements:** I need to find 50 distinct positions. I created a 9x9 grid across the allowed space and discarded the points that would cause a collision.  This led to 65 allowed points.
           7.  **Calculate Grid Points:** I use NumPy's `linspace` to define `x` and `y` grids based on the boundaries. Then I calculated an array of points based on the grid structure, skipping those points which overlap the AABB for Object 5.
           8.  **Varying Angles:** To add some variety, I'll rotate object 4 at different angles using a step for 50 placements.
           
           This strategy should give me 50 valid, stable placements for object 4, all while avoiding collisions and staying within the surface's boundaries. I'm going to create the list now.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on a given surface (Surface 0). I need to ensure that these placements are stable and, critically, avoid collisions with two previously placed square objects (ID 5 and ID 4) already present on the surface.
           
           **Environment and Object Properties**
           
           The key information available includes the surface's bounding box and the extents, half-extents, and current placements (including center coordinates and rotation angle) of objects 4 and 5. From this, I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for objects 4 and 5, enabling efficient collision detection. The new object (ID 6) also has its size, which I've used to derive its half-extents.
           
           **Constraints and Collision Avoidance**
           
           The placement of object 6 is constrained by:
           
           *   **Surface Containment:** It must remain within the bounds of Surface 0. I calculated the valid x and y ranges for the object's center to ensure this.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** Crucially, the object must not collide with either object 4 or object 5. I calculated the forbidden regions for the object's center coordinates based on the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 to avoid any overlap. This involves bounding box-based checks to determine regions where collisions would occur, essentially defining the area around existing objects where the new object cannot be placed.
           
           **Identifying Valid Placement Regions**
           
           Based on the derived constraints, a large rectangular region within the surface bounds is deemed safe for object 6 placement.
           
           **Grid-Based Sampling Strategy**
           
           To satisfy the requirement of 50 stable placements, I will implement a structured grid-based sampling within the identified safe region. I will utilize a rectangular grid of 8 x 8 = 64 points. I also consider changing the rotation for each placement. I'll need to carefully select these placements and their angle to avoid the collision region. This method will likely provide a good variety of stable, collision-free placements while maintaining the minimum number of placements specified.
