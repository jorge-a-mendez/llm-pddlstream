           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Knowledge**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions. The initial state gives me a head start: some preconditions are already met, like the starting positions of the rovers (`v12` and `v14`) and that their stores are free. The rest is about acquiring and communicating data.
           
           My strategy involves two rovers: `v12` for imaging and sending images, and `v14` for sampling rocks, analyzing them, and then transmitting the results.
           
           For `v12`: It needs to:
           
           1.  Move to a good spot (`#o3`) to get visual on the objects (`v17` and `v18`).
           2.  Calibrate its camera and snap a picture of `v17`.
           3.  Do it all again for `v18`.
           4.  Then move to the comms hub (`#o0`) to relay those images.
           5.  After the image transfer is completed it should return to its starting position, which is essential to the successful completion of the requirements.
           
           `v14` has a similar list:
           
           1.  Move to sampling area (`#o5`).
           2.  Take a sample of a rock and move the sample to the analysis area.
           3.  Move back to `v0` which is the comms hub.
           4.  Send the analysis.
           5.  After doing the sampling, it will move to it's starting point to satisfy the rules.
           
           The key to this plan lies in the constraints. Both rovers must end up back where they started. This makes the return movements a must-have.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising the Plan for Communication and Sampling**
           
           Alright, after the previous communication configurations failed due to collision, I need to revisit the plan, ensuring both rovers can communicate and sample without issue. The lander (`v9`) is at a fixed position, and the obstacle (`v19`) is a vertical plane that caused problems before.
           
           For Rover `v12`, the primary concern is establishing a clear line of sight to `v9` for image transmission. The previous attempt at `(#o0 v12)` collided with obstacle `v19`. I'm now proposing a new configuration at (0.5, -2.0), situated on the positive x-axis, well away from the problematic obstacle. This configuration appears reachable from `v12`'s starting position (1.0, -1.75), and, importantly, it avoids collision with `v19`. The calculated distance to `v9` from this position is within the communication range, so the signal should be strong.
           
           For Rover `v14`, the original communication configuration also collided. I'm opting for a position near `v9` but outside of its bounding box, specifically (-1.0, -2.0).  This choice avoids collision with `v9` itself. It also avoids obstacle `v19`. The calculated distance to the lander at this new communication configuration is also within the communication range.
           
           The imaging and sampling configurations, `#o3` and `#o5`, remain unchanged, as they weren't flagged for collision.
           
           Reconfirming the plan to meet the goal condition, which boils down to:
           
           1.  Both rovers are in their initial positions,
           2.  Both rovers' cargo bays are free,
           3.  The lander received the images of objects v17 and v18,
           4.  The lander received analysis of two rock samples.
           
           The current state already fulfills the free store conditions. Now, the planned sequence of actions are:
           
           **For Rover `v12`:**
           
           1.  Move to the imaging configuration (#o3),
           2.  Calibrate and take images of two objects, v17 and v18,
           3.  Move to the new communication configuration (#o0),
           4.  Send the images to the lander, and
           5.  Return to its starting position.
           
           **For Rover `v14`:**
           
           1.  Move to the sampling configuration (#o5),
           2.  Sample two rock types,
           3.  Move to the new communication configuration (#o0),
           4.  Send analysis of each sample to the lander,
           5.  Drop both samples, and
           6.  Return to its starting position.
           
           I've verified that all the necessary `motion` predicates are in the initial state, ensuring the rover movements are feasible. I'm also confirming the plan satisfies all goal conditions.
           
           Therefore, the plan should work, and will satisfy the mission requirements for image transfer and sample analysis.

Model:     **Revising the Plan for Communication and Sampling**
           
           Alright, after the previous communication configurations failed due to collision, I need to revisit the plan, ensuring both rovers can communicate and sample without issue. The lander (`v9`) is at a fixed position, and the obstacle (`v19`) is a vertical plane that caused problems before.
           
           For Rover `v12`, the primary concern is establishing a clear line of sight to `v9` for image transmission. The previous attempt at `(#o0 v12)` collided with obstacle `v19`. I'm now proposing a new configuration at (0.5, -2.0), situated on the positive x-axis, well away from the problematic obstacle. This configuration appears reachable from `v12`'s starting position (1.0, -1.75), and, importantly, it avoids collision with `v19`. The calculated distance to `v9` from this position is within the communication range, so the signal should be strong.
           
           For Rover `v14`, the original communication configuration also collided. I'm opting for a position near `v9` but outside of its bounding box, specifically (-1.0, -2.0).  This choice avoids collision with `v9` itself. It also avoids obstacle `v19`. The calculated distance to the lander at this new communication configuration is also within the communication range.
           
           The imaging and sampling configurations, `#o3` and `#o5`, remain unchanged, as they weren't flagged for collision.
           
           Reconfirming the plan to meet the goal condition, which boils down to:
           
           1.  Both rovers are in their initial positions,
           2.  Both rovers' cargo bays are free,
           3.  The lander received the images of objects v17 and v18,
           4.  The lander received analysis of two rock samples.
           
           The current state already fulfills the free store conditions. Now, the planned sequence of actions are:
           
           **For Rover `v12`:**
           
           1.  Move to the imaging configuration (#o3),
           2.  Calibrate and take images of two objects, v17 and v18,
           3.  Move to the new communication configuration (#o0),
           4.  Send the images to the lander, and
           5.  Return to its starting position.
           
           **For Rover `v14`:**
           
           1.  Move to the sampling configuration (#o5),
           2.  Sample two rock types,
           3.  Move to the new communication configuration (#o0),
           4.  Send analysis of each sample to the lander,
           5.  Drop both samples, and
           6.  Return to its starting position.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Continuous Parameters for Rover Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that my previous configurations were either unreachable or colliding. Time to dive back in and refine those continuous parameters, focusing on the rover configurations. The goal remains clear: achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to specific tasks for each rover, imaging and sending data, or sampling and sending analyses.
           
           Here's the breakdown of what I need to address:
           
           **Configuration Goals:**
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:** Capture images of objectives `v17` and `v18` with its camera `v10`, and then send those images to lander `v9`. Additionally, `free` its store.
           *   **Rover `v14`:** Sample rocks `v1` and `v5`, send the analysis to lander `v9`, and then also free its store.
           *   Key requirement: ensure there is a clear "above" condition between `v14` and its sample. The problem states `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are in the initial state, implying that there should be some suitable config for it.
           
           **Obstacles and Considerations:**
           
           *   A vertical wall obstacle `v19` exists along x=0. This is the main collision concern.
           *   The communication range for the camera and the com radio is defined by the predicates: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, obj)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           *   The "previous configurations" are: `(#o3 v12)` at (1.0, 0.5), `(#o0 v12)` at (0.5, -2.0) for `v12`, and  `(#o5 v14)` at (0.0, 0.8), `(#o0 v14)` at (-1.0, -2.0) for `v14`. These failed previously.
           
           **Revised Configuration Strategy:**
           
           My revised approach centers on ensuring each rover has clear line-of-sight (LOS) to its targets, avoids collision, and is reachable.
           
           **Rover `v12` Imaging & Communication:**
           
           1.  **Image Points:** Previously, `(#o3 v12)` at (1.0, 0.5) was "not reachable". To get clear images, I need `v12` to see `v17` and `v18` within range (max 2 units). Given the constraint of x=0 obstacle, I need to pick a point such that the distance is less than 2, and the path from the initial state does not cross x=0.
               I am proposing the new image configuration `(#o3 v12)` at (1.5, 1.0) and confirmed the LOS and collision. The distance to `v17` is around 1.24, and to `v18` is around 1.49, both within range. The x=1.5 and initial x=1.0 mean that the rover never crossed x=0.
           2.  **Communication Point:** Previous communication points were also "not reachable". I want `v12` to be able to comm with the lander `v9` which is around (-1.8, -2.0). I will put the new communication config to the left of the obstacle, at (-0.75, -2.0), this implies the rover will have to go through the x=0 line. The distance to `v9` is ~ 1.05 units which is within the 4-unit range, and avoids collision.
           
           **Rover `v14` Sampling & Communication:**
           
           1.  **Sampling Point:** The previously colliding configuration for sampling, `(#o5 v14)`, (0.0, 0.8), was on the obstacle's x=0 line. For `v14` to successfully sample `v1` and `v5` (which are around (1.913, 0.186), and (0.964, 1.129) respectively), I'll make the sampling point (#o5 v14) to the right of the obstacle. The proposal is (1.0, 0.5). That position seems appropriate for the sample action. I confirmed it is above the rocks. That position implies crossing x=0 to get there, but it is clear the rover is able to get there.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. This boils down to: getting two rovers (v12 and v14) into specific configurations, capturing images of two objectives (v17, v18), receiving analyses of two types of rock/soil, and then communication (which requires the communication and image to lander) all while taking into account the motion constraints. I’ve got all the coordinates laid out and object information at hand.
           
           The really tricky part is figuring out where the rovers can *actually* move. Previous attempts failed due to the rovers being “not reachable” or in "collision", which is pretty cryptic. I have to interpret this carefully!
           
           **Geometry of The Environment and Rover Dynamics**
           
           The scene layout is important. There's a "wall" obstacle (`v19`) located at x=0, which will significantly impact the plan. `v12` starts right of the wall and `v14` starts left. The key for a solution is understanding how to leverage the scene's geometry in planning and how that conflicts with what’s "reachable".
           
           **v12 Imaging and Communication Plan**
           
           I want v12 to handle imaging. This rover needs to image objectives `v17` and `v18`. This is going to be my focal point. I’ve to find a good spot (#o3) to get a clear line of sight, with a maximum image distance of 2.0. That needs to work well. I’ve looked at the distances to both of those. Then `v12` needs to communicate with `v9` (the lander).
           
           **v14 Sampling and Communication Plan**
           
           v14’s role is to sample and send information. So, v14 has to be able to sample rocks of type v2 and v6. That's `#o5`. This configuration must be "above" these rocks. `v1` and `v5` are the obvious choices for this task. It must also communicate to `v9`.
           
           **Constraints and Hypotheses**
           
           Here's my hypotheses about these so-called constraints:
           *  **Reachable?** It may mean there are strict rules about how far a rover can move. Maybe, max one move at a time? Maybe this can't happen for larger X-Y changes.
           *  **The key barrier?** It's likely that the obstacle (`v19`) is crucial. This could be blocking views and limiting rover access to specific rocks.
           *  **Theta and Orientation:** I have to be careful with the orientation (theta) in each configuration.
           *  **Initial State Paradox:** It says `imagevisible`, `comvisible` exist, so it should be possible.
           
           **Detailed Planning and Rationale**
           
           I began by considering a few locations:
           *   I attempted to image from (0.8, 0.8), (1.2, 0.5), and other positions and have to say, it wasn't successful.
           *   I considered a communication location for v12 at (-0.5, -1.5). But I quickly came to a fundamental barrier.
           *   For v14, I attempted sampling at (-0.5, 0.0), a likely position for being `above` the rocks.
           
           After some trial and error, I believe `v19` is the main obstacle. I tried a few locations, like (2.0, -2.0) and (-1.3, -2.0).
           
           **Rethinking the Approach**
           
           A crucial insight: if a configuration (0.5, -2.0) is "unreachable" from (1.0, -1.75) (a move of 0.56 units), then there are *hidden constraints*.
           
           Maybe the key to reachability is being *in contact*, instead of simple Euclidean distance. Maybe that implies the ability to get within a smaller, restricted range, and I need to select coordinates that satisfy. Then the issue becomes line-of-sight. If that's the case, then this plan may have to be much more granular. I'll need some new angles.
           
           I checked for the initial state again, and my plan will now consider both imaging from the perspective of both `v12` and `v14`. I checked for angles, and I will be more deliberate.
           
           **Final Attempt and Conclusion**
           
           The key to a solution is probably not using "new" locations, but existing places.
           
           *   `v12`: (1.2, 0.5, 0.0)

           After some trial and error, I believe `v19` is the main obstacle. I tried a few locations, like (2.0, -2.0) and (-1.3, -2.0).
           
           **Rethinking the Approach**
           
           A crucial insight: if a configuration (0.5, -2.0) is "unreachable" from (1.0, -1.75) (a move of 0.56 units), then there are *hidden constraints*.
           
           Maybe the key to reachability is being *in contact*, instead of simple Euclidean distance. Maybe that implies the ability to get within a smaller, restricted range, and I need to select coordinates that satisfy. Then the issue becomes line-of-sight. If that's the case, then this plan may have to be much more granular. I'll need some new angles.
           
           I checked for the initial state again, and my plan will now consider both imaging from the perspective of both `v12` and `v14`. I checked for angles, and I will be more deliberate.
           
           **Final Attempt and Conclusion**
           
           The key to a solution is probably not using "new" locations, but existing places.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain. This boils down to ensuring the rovers are at specific configurations, imaging and analyzing particular objectives, and then communicating this data to the lander. The challenge lies in finding safe and reachable paths while adhering to a tight set of constraints, particularly the "not reachable" errors encountered in previous plans. Here's what I've come up with:
           
           First, let's establish our current scenario: Rover `v12` is at `v13`, and `v14` is at `v15`, both are initially free to receive material. We have two rovers with cameras capable of using mode `v11`, a lander `v9`, and the objectives: analyzing two types of rocks `v2` and `v6` and communicating the analysis to the lander. We also have to watch out for obstacles `v19` and `v20`.
           
           The key to this problem is configuring the rovers.
           
           I've divided the plan into two sub-plans, one for each rover, considering the available configurations. I've broken down each step to achieve the goal:
           
           **Rover `v12` Plan:**
           
           1.  **Motion (Imaging Configuration `#o3`)**: Rover `v12` moves from its starting position `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) to `#o3` (1.0, 1.0, 1.57), a position roughly centered to capture both objectives `v17` and `v18`. This point is reachable with a direct move along the y-axis, and the `theta` is set to generally face upwards (towards the objectives) to make sure v10 calibrates correctly.
           2.  **Imaging Objective 1 (v17)**: Calibrate the `v10` camera and take an image.
           3.  **Imaging Objective 2 (v18)**: Calibrate again for the second objective and image it.
           4.  **Motion (Communication Configuration `#o0`)**: Rover `v12` moves to `#o0` (0.5, -2.0, 3.142), positioned near the lander `v9`. Its `theta` faces the lander and allows for reliable communication.
           5.  **Send Images**: Images of both objectives are sent to `v9`.
           6.  **Motion (Return to Start):** It returns to `v13`
           
           **Rover `v14` Plan:**
           
           1.  **Motion (Sampling Configuration `#o5`)**: Rover `v14` moves from its start position `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0) to `#o5` (1.0, 0.5, 0.0) where it can sample both target rocks. Although the plan indicates `v14` must cross `v19` the initial state's `above` predicates (e.g. `above(v14, #o5, v5)`) strongly implies that this path is safe.
           2.  **Sample Type v2**: `v14` samples a rock of `type v2`, and adds the sample to its on-board storage.
           3.  **Motion (Communication Configuration #o0)**: `v14` moves to `#o0` (-0.5, -2.0, 3.142), which is relatively close to the lander and the point where communication can be established.
           4.  **Send Analysis:** `v14` sends the sample analysis to the lander.
           5.  **Motion (Return to sampling point)** It returns to `#o5` for the next sample.
           6.  **Sample Type v6**: `v14` samples a rock of `type v6`, and adds the sample to its on-board storage.
           7.  **Motion (Communication Configuration #o0)**: `v14` moves to the communication point again.
           8.  **Send Analysis:** `v14` sends the sample analysis to the lander.
           9.  **Return**: `v14` returns to `v15`.
           
           **Addressing Previous Failures and Obstacles**
           
           I've carefully considered the previous failure points and obstacles, namely the vertical wall `v19` at x=0 and the small obstacle `v20` near (1.88, -2.03), and I made sure the selected configurations are
