           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's tackle this. I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`.  This boils down to achieving several atomic facts. Primarily, this means having both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, receive an image (`receivedimage`) and receive an analysis (`receivedanalysis`) for a type of stone and soil. I'm also starting with these facts: The rovers are already in specific configurations, have free storage, and are potentially in the right positions to accomplish my goals.
           
           **Constraints: The Allowed Action Instances**
           
           Here's the rub: I'm incredibly limited in my actions. I'm given a very specific list of "valid action instances."  Essentially, I can only use these four actions:
           1.  `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Rover `v12` moving from location `v13` back to `v13`.
           2.  `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Rover `v14` doing the same, moving from `v15` back to `v15`.
           3.  `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Rover `v12` dropping a rock, but only if its storage `v16` is *full*.
           4.  `(drop_rock v14 v16)`:  Same, for rover `v14`.
           
           **Analysis of the Goal and Actions**
           
           The initial state includes facts such as the rovers' locations and their storage being free.  The goal, again, requires me to get both the images and the analyses. My immediate problem is that the image and analysis actions are nowhere in that short action list. The `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock` actions (which I'd need to actually *do* something) are NOT specified. And the given `move` instances are also no-ops; the rovers start and stay where they are, so the move action does not change anything. Dropping a rock isn't even possible because the rover's storage is initially *free*, not *full*!
           
           **Unachievable Goal**
           
           Here's the key takeaway: I *can't* change the state to meet the goals.  I can only `move` (in a redundant manner) or attempt to `drop_rock`, which is impossible given the *free* storage conditions.  Therefore, and it pains me to say it, achieving those final image and analysis goals is flat-out impossible with the given set of moves. I have to say, the goal is unreachable.
