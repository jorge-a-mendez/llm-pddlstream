(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Alright, here's how I'm going to figure out these stable placements.  The goal is 50 stable positions for object ID 5, a square with dimensions 0.0767 x 0.0767, on surface 0, which is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A "stable" placement means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is *fully* inside the surface's AABB.  I'm interpreting the provided dimensions as the object's unrotated AABB.  
           
           First, I need to account for rotation (theta). A square's AABB grows with rotation, reaching its maximum size at 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). The effective AABB's dimensions are calculated using the formula I'm going to use `half_effective_dim = S * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|) / 2`, where S is the square's side length (0.0767).
           
           I'm generating a diverse set of placements by varying both the rotation angle and the center position (x, y) of the object's AABB. I've chosen five representative rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. Since the AABB is symmetric every 90 degrees, this covers the full range of variation in the object's orientation.
           
           For each rotation angle, I'll calculate the valid range for the object's center (x, y) based on the effective AABB size. I'm taking the surface bounds, `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`, and use the calculation for each rotation's value. I then place 10 distinct (x, y) coordinates within each set of range; taking into account the edges and central point to spread the placements. This gives me a nice, even spread of positions for each rotation.  Since I have 5 rotations and 10 coordinates per rotation. I'll get exactly the 50 placements requested.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Addressing the Placement Challenge**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object 5, a rectangle of size approximately `0.077`, is successfully placed at `(0, 0)` on surface 0. Now, I need to place a new, larger rectangle, object 6 (size approximately `0.099`), on the same surface, while strictly *avoiding* any collisions with object 5.
           
           I know the surface extends from `-0.135` to `0.135` in both the x and y directions. My first thought is to calculate the valid placement space for object 6, which is heavily influenced by its potential rotation (theta).  The formula for this is `effective_size_x = size_x * |cos(theta)| + size_y * |sin(theta)|` and the same for y. For a square, I can further simplify this.
           
           I'm starting by calculating object 5's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which is centered at (0, 0). Its extent is  `[-0.03835, 0.03835]` in both x and y.  Then I set up valid placements for object 6.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to figure out where object 6 *can't* be. I can do this by adding object 5's half-size to object 6's effective half-size at a given rotation. For example, the `x` range of Object 6 is `[x - eff_half_size, x + eff_half_size]`, and if any part overlaps object 5 then there is a collision.
           
           Since there's a requirement to provide many placements, I am generating placements *even though* the math shows it's impossible. If I can't find a placement, I'll return a placement "close" to being valid. If I get the same object and set of surfaces again, that may be to understand why previous placement failed.
           
           I begin the process. My analysis shows that no placement is possible *under* the current conditions, and that I'm generating placements that are effectively collisions. If I can't find a solution, the system says I should assume a margin of error for collisions. Since I must, I'll attempt placements for `theta = 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`. My current conclusion is there will be *no* stable placements.
           
           For theta = 0, to avoid overlapping Object 5, I calculate that Object 6 has the center at the minimum boundary of `[-0.08781, 0.08781]`. But the surface boundary is `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`. Because the boundary is inside the no-collision region, it's impossible to place object 6. The same is true for all angles of rotation I have calculated.
           
           Since I am told "you never give up," I am now attempting to generate 50 placements as close to a valid placement as possible. I am aware, and I will be sure to note it in my summary, that these are geometrically impossible placements that will result in a collision.

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Placement Conundrum of Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break down this latest placement request for Object 4. We're dealing with Surface 0, which has two objects already placed: Object 5, smack-dab in the center, and Object 6, tucked into the top-right corner. The challenge? Object 4 is a square, and it's simply too big to fit without overlapping either Object 5 or Object 6, or ideally both.
           
           My initial analysis focused on calculating the available space. I used the surface boundaries and the dimensions of Object 5 and Object 6 to define the no-go zones. However, regardless of the angle I choose to place Object 4 (even at angle zero), it won't work. The size of Object 5 dictates that Object 4 simply can't exist on the surface without collision. The formula for the required minimum safe distance for a non-collision with the center object is greater than the available surface space.
           
           Realizing this, I switched gears. Since I'm not allowed to "give up," I decided to generate 50 placements, acknowledging that they will, by necessity, have collisions. My strategy became minimizing the overlap. I identified "least colliding" regions: the bottom-left, bottom-center, and left-center areas. These locations are the farthest from Object 6. For the "least overlapping" placement, I'll favor being as far from Object 5 as possible.
           
           I calculated the coordinates of these "least colliding" positions using the appropriate rotation for the object. I chose several angles, and for each, I will be placing the object in a corner, edge, and other locations on the surface. These placements will be the closest I can manage given the constraints.
