           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down into a comprehensive plan to achieve the goal: `new-axiom@0()`!**  This whole thing hinges on getting the rovers to the right places, taking some photos and samples, and then reporting back.  It's a multi-step process, so let's walk through it.
           
           First, I need to make sure I've got everything I need.  It looks like I start with two rovers, v12 and v14, both in their starting positions.  I have cameras and a storage unit (v16) that's initially free.  My main objective is to gather some images and analyses. Specifically, I'm after images of four distinct "targets" (v17, v18, v19, v20) in a specific mode (v11), and analyses of two different rock types (a stone and a soil).  I already have a rock of each type (`v4` for stone and `v5` for soil), so that's a good start.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           **Phase 1: Image Acquisition:** I'll use rover `v12` to do most of the work here.  First, it's a matter of getting rover `v12` into position. I need to move it from its initial position (`v13`) to a configuration (`#o3`) where it can clearly see all four target objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`).  After I'm in position, I'll take each image by using the `calibrate` and `take_image` actions.
           
           Once I have the images, I will move to configuration `#o0`, where I can communicate with the lander. Next, the goal is to send those images to lander `v9` using the `send_image` action.
           
           **Phase 2: Rock Sampling and Analysis:** Then it's on to sampling.  I need to move rover `v12` from the comms position at `#o0` to a specific location (`#o5`). This is the place where my rover can access both the stone (`v4`) and the soil (`v5`). Now, I will `sample_rock` by placing rover `v12` above the `v4` rock with the store. And I will place the rover above the `v5` with the store. The `drop_rock` action makes `v16` (the storage) free again for the second sample. Rover `v12` has now analyzed both required rock types.
           
           **Phase 3: Comms and Final Position:** Then, it's time to communicate those analyses back to the lander and return the rovers to their initial positions.  I'll send the analyses to `v9` using `send_analysis`. To finish off, I'll move `v12` back to its starting configuration (`v13`).
           
           **Let's define the specific actions now:**
           
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o3` (for imaging):**  `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`.  I'll need to define a location for `#o3` that lets me see all targets, likely near those objects.
           
           *   **Take Images (using the camera v10):**
               *   `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
               *   `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
               *   (Repeat for v18, v19, v20, re-calibrating as needed)
               *   Move v12 from `#o3` to `#o0` for communication.
           
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks:**  `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5`

Model:     **Alright, let's break this down into a comprehensive plan to achieve the goal: `new-axiom@0()`!**  This whole thing hinges on getting the rovers to the right places, taking some photos and samples, and then reporting back.  It's a multi-step process, so let's walk through it.
           
           First, I need to make sure I've got everything I need.  It looks like I start with two rovers, v12 and v14, both in their starting positions.  I have cameras and a storage unit (v16) that's initially free.  My main objective is to gather some images and analyses. Specifically, I'm after images of four distinct "targets" (v17, v18, v19, v20) in a specific mode (v11), and analyses of two different rock types (a stone and a soil).  I already have a rock of each type (`v4` for stone and `v5` for soil), so that's a good start.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           **Phase 1: Image Acquisition:** I'll use rover `v12` to do most of the work here.  First, it's a matter of getting rover `v12` into position. I need to move it from its initial position (`v13`) to a configuration (`#o3`) where it can clearly see all four target objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`).  After I'm in position, I'll take each image by using the `calibrate` and `take_image` actions.
           
           Once I have the images, I will move to configuration `#o0`, where I can communicate with the lander. Next, the goal is to send those images to lander `v9` using the `send_image` action.
           
           **Phase 2: Rock Sampling and Analysis:** Then it's on to sampling.  I need to move rover `v12` from the comms position at `#o0` to a specific location (`#o5`). This is the place where my rover can access both the stone (`v4`) and the soil (`v5`). Now, I will `sample_rock` by placing rover `v12` above the `v4` rock with the store. And I will place the rover above the `v5` with the store. The `drop_rock` action makes `v16` (the storage) free again for the second sample. Rover `v12` has now analyzed both required rock types.
           
           **Phase 3: Comms and Final Position:** Then, it's time to communicate those analyses back to the lander and return the rovers to their initial positions.  I'll send the analyses to `v9` using `send_analysis`. To finish off, I'll move `v12` back to its starting configuration (`v13`).
           
           **Let's define the specific actions now:**
           
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o3` (for imaging):**  `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`.  I'll need to define a location for `#o3` that lets me see all targets, likely near those objects.
           
           *   **Take Images (using the camera v10):**
               *   `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
               *   `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
               *   (Repeat for v18, v19, v20, re-calibrating as needed)
               *   Move v12 from `#o3` to `#o0` for communication.
           
           *   **Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks:**  `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5`
           
           *   **Sample Rocks:**
               *   `sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16` (For the stone)
               *   `drop_rock v12 v16`  (Clear the store)
               *   `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16` (For the soil)
               *   Move v12 from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           
           *   **Communicate analysis data with the lander:** `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`
               *   `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4`
               *   `send_analysis v12 #o0 #

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Continuous Parameters for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, the previous plan failed, primarily due to collisions with `v21`, a thin wall located at x=0, and reachability issues. My primary focus now is to re-evaluate the continuous parameters for configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. I need to ensure they are collision-free with `v21` and reachable from the previous rover position while adhering to the task requirements.
           
           First, let's address the collision with `v21`. Its AABB indicates it's a thin wall or line segment along the y-axis (x=0). Any configuration with an x-coordinate too close to 0 is at risk. Therefore, I'll prioritize configurations with x-coordinates away from zero.
           
           *   **`#o0` (Send Data):** This involves establishing communication with the lander `v9`, located in the lower-left quadrant. To avoid collision, the previous attempt, at `(0.0, -1.8)`, was on the x=0 line. A viable alternative would be `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This point is within a reasonable distance of `v9` for communication and avoids `v21`.
           
           *   **`#o3` (Image Capture):** The objective, `v17`, is in the upper-left quadrant. The previous configuration, `(0.0, 1.0)`, caused a collision. To fix that, a better option is `(-0.4, 0.5)`. This positions the rover within range of `v17` and maintains a safe distance from `v21`.
           
           *   **`#o5` (Sample Rock):** The rock, `v4`, resides in the positive x-region. Previous attempts to sample failed due to reachability and a potentially invalid orientation. A point directly above `v4` that's not too far is preferred to sample. Using `(0.7, -0.8)` gives us enough space to maneuver while remaining reachable.
           
           The planned sequence of actions remains sound, as the objective of the plan is valid given the goal state. I need to make sure I am finding continuous values for those configurations. The rover starts at `v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. I am starting with:
           
           1.  **`#o3`:** Target `v17`'s center is at `(-0.45, 1.89)`. I propose the rover go to `(-0.4, 0.5)`. This is around 1.39 units of distance and is a reasonable position to get closer, and the line-of-sight from the rover's position to the target's center does not intersect `v21`.
           
           2.  **`#o5`:** Rover is at `(-0.4, 0.5)`. Target is `v4` with a good candidate position being `(0.7, -0.8)`: The distance is around 1.7 units. This would place the rover directly above the rock sample at `v4` for closer approach, while still maintaining distance from `v21`.
           
           3.  **`#o0`:** Rover is at `(0.7, -0.8)` from the last step. The center of the target, `v9`, is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`. I propose we communicate from `(-1.5, -2.0)`. Distance is around 2.5 units. This would be a great candidate to send data to the rover for communication and ensures the line-of-sight from the rover's position to the target's center does not intersect `v21`.
           
           Finally, I'll need to check the line-of-sight against `v21`. If the target is at the same sign as x=0, a ray collision is not possible. With those considerations, I believe these new configurations are collision-free and address the reachability concerns, giving us a good chance of success this time.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Problem Definition**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous attempts to configure `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` failed, primarily due to collisions or reachability problems.  I need to revisit those configurations, keeping in mind the specific goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to acquiring and analyzing images and samples of specific rock types, and communicating this information to the lander.
           
           **The Lay of the Land (literally!)**
           
           I'm working with two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, a lander `v9`, several objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), and rocks to analyze (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).  Rover `v12` starts on the right side of the map at `(1.0, -1.75)`, while `v14` starts on the left at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  The kicker? There's a wall, `v21`, positioned at `x=0`. This wall is going to be a major obstacle.  The lander, `v9`, is located on the negative X side.
           
           **The Wall's Impact: A Spatial Divide**
           
           The wall at `x=0` severely limits the rovers' movements and, crucially, their ability to communicate with the lander.  `v12` is stuck on the positive X side, and `v14` on the negative.  To successfully achieve the goal, both rovers need to image certain objectives and analyze and send rock analysis information to the lander.
           
           `v12` can image objectives `v19` and `v20`, and analyze samples `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, and `v8`.
           
           `v14` can image objectives `v17` and `v18`, and analyze samples `v1` and `v7`.
           
           **The Communication Breakdown: The Unreachable Lander**
           
           Here's the critical snag: the lander, `v9`, is on the *negative* side of the wall. Rover `v12` is unable to send any images or analysis data to the lander to fulfill the goal requirements. `v12` cannot communicate. Since communication to the lander is necessary, this is where it falls apart.
           
           **The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Because the objective requires that all image and analysis information be sent *to* the lander, and the lander is behind the wall from `v12`, it is impossible to satisfy all goals, given the current geometry. The tasks as stated, are unreachable.
