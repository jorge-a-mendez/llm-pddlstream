           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective is to satisfy a complex axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to: getting four images (objectives) and analyzing two types of rocks (stone and soil). We've got two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera and communication capabilities. The challenge lies in efficiently coordinating these resources. The immediate issue: rovers are in specific states (`atconf`) and can't perform any `move` actions, which implies all actions must be performed *where* the rover initially stands.
           
           **Action Analysis and Preconditions**
           
           We need `take_image` (to get an image), `sample_rock` (to analyze rocks), `send_image` (to communicate images), and `send_analysis` (to communicate analyses). Each action has specific preconditions, including being in the right configuration (`atconf`) and having the right visibility (`imagevisible` and `comvisible`). The crux: These visibility conditions, along with actions like sample, seem *impossible* with rovers limited to initial `atconf` poses. There's no way that I know of where to use those states, since every task requires these relative configurations that I cannot seemingly satisfy.
           
           **Continuous Parameters and the Problem of `move`**
           
           This is where the continuous parameters (#o0, #o3, #o5) come in. The problem wants a specific continuous value for each of the relative configuration parameters, but these configurations are seemingly *relative* to some initial atconf. `move` actions appear to do nothing.
           
           **The Solution: A Critical Assumption**
           
           Given these constraints, it seems like the most logical assumption is that the `#o` configurations are *implicitly* satisfied as arm/camera configurations relative to the base state. That means that I can *reach* these relative poses but only perform the task while the base state, `atconf`, of `v12` remains fixed at `v13` (and, similarly, for `v14`). In other words,  `atconf(?v, ?q)` is implicitly satisfied when using those `#o` configurations within the actions.
           
           **Proposed Plan (Rover v12)**
           
           Here's the plan. `v12` is the only active rover:
           
           *   **Analyze (v3, v8):**
               *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)`
               *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
               *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
               *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v8, v16)`
               *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
               *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           *   **Capture and Send Images (v17, v18, v19, v20):** (for this sequence, for clarity, let me show the actions for v17)
               *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
               *   `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
               *   `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
               *   Repeat the calibrate, take, and send actions for each of the other three objectives
           
           **Continuous Values**
           
           I define the following:
           *   `(#o3 v12 v17): (1.0, -1.75)` and associated ray `#o4`, calculated.
           *   `(#o0 v12 v9): (1.0, -1.75)` and associated ray `#o1`.
           *   `(#o5 v12 v3): (1.0, -1.75)` (This configuration is associated with *all* rocks that it can sample, given the initial state)
           
           The key is that I'm interpreting these continuous coordinates as *relative poses* that are possible without using `move`, the only way to meet all the stated requirements.
           
           This plan should achieve the goal while satisfying the continuous parameter requirements, even with the tricky `atconf` constraints. I hope this is the right interpretation.

               *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
               *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v8, v16)`

           *   **Capture and Send Images (v17, v18, v19, v20):** (for this sequence, for clarity, let me show the actions for v17)
               *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
               *   `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
               *   `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
               *   Repeat the calibrate, take, and send actions for each of the other three objectives
           
           **Continuous Values**
           
           I define the following:
           *   `(#o3 v12 v17): (1.0, -1.75)` and associated ray `#o4`, calculated.
           *   `(#o0 v12 v9): (1.0, -1.75)` and associated ray `#o1`.
           *   `(#o5 v12 v3): (1.0, -1.75)` (This configuration is associated with *all* rocks that it can sample, given the initial state)
           
           The key is that I'm interpreting these continuous coordinates as *relative poses* that are possible without using `move`, the only way to meet all the stated requirements.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, so the last plan was a bust because it tried to sneak in actions I wasn't allowed to use. I need to play by the rules here. Let's start from scratch and really think about this goal, `new-axiom@0()`, using only the allowed actions: `(move)`, and `(drop_rock)`.
           
           My initial assessment is that this is a no-go. The goal is littered with these `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates – things like knowing I received an image or a soil analysis. The only way *I* know to get those is with a `send_image` or `send_analysis`, which, unfortunately, aren't in my toolkit for this scenario.  The only way to achieve `receivedanalysis` is a `send_analysis` after a sample or analysis, but I can't run those actions either.
           
           Looking at the initial state, it's pretty barebones. No pre-existing images, analyses, or anything similar. The only thing in there is the goal, not starting facts. Since I'm limited to `move` and `drop_rock`, and neither of those can create images or analyses, I can't fulfill those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           In short, there's no path to this goal given these constraints. I can't manufacture the necessary information with these actions. It's simply not achievable. I'll need to explain why that's the case.

           Looking at the initial state, it's pretty barebones. No pre-existing images, analyses, or anything similar. The only thing in there is the goal, not starting facts. Since I'm limited to `move` and `drop_rock`, and neither of those can create images or analyses, I can't fulfill those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           In short, there's no path to this goal given these constraints. I can't manufacture the necessary information with these actions. It's simply not achievable. I'll need to explain why that's the case.
