           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing the conjunction `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)`, so `?green` must be `v8`. Therefore, the goal simplifies to `on(v8, v18)`.
           The axiom `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` is defined as `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So, the goal is to have `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, we have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This means that if we can move `v8` to pose `#o2`, the goal will be achieved.
           
           However, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base but does not interact with objects or change their poses. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, which are necessary to change the pose of `v8`. Therefore, the robot cannot achieve the goal of `atpose(v8, #o2)` and thus cannot achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     I apologize for the previous incorrect response. I made a mistake in my analysis and also included an invalid character in my "plan".
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)`, so we need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.
           The `on` predicate is satisfied if `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           In the initial state, we have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This means that if we could move `v8` to `#o2`, the goal would be met.
           
           However, the only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only changes the robot's base configuration and cannot directly manipulate objects or change their poses. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available to move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`. Therefore, the robot cannot change the pose of `v8` to satisfy the `on(v8, v18)` condition. The goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
