           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain, but I've hit a major roadblock. My analysis of the goal's requirements reveals that I need to: receive images of four objectives, receive an analysis of a rock of type `v2`, and receive an analysis of a rock of type `v6`. However, the available action instances are drastically limited and prevent me from executing the necessary sub-goals.
           
           The actions I'm restricted to are merely self-loops: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, along with `((drop_rock v12 v16))` and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`. While the initial state provides the necessary starting facts for the first two predicates in the goal (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`), the remaining ones cannot be attained.
           
           To achieve image receipt, I need to perform a sequence of actions including `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `send_image`. This requires the rovers to be in a configuration that corresponds to the `imagevisible` preconditions, which is `#o3`. However, the only "move" actions I have move the rovers from `v13` or `v15` to the same positions. I cannot maneuver the rovers to the necessary configurations using these actions.
           
           Similarly, I would like to achieve rock analysis by performing `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`, but this, too, has the same configuration problem. To sample rocks I need the rovers to be at `#o5`, but my `move` actions cannot move the rovers to that configuration.
           
           In short, the provided move actions are useless, and since I am restricted from using other actions, I am absolutely stuck. I am forced to conclude that, with the given action set, there is no possible plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`.
