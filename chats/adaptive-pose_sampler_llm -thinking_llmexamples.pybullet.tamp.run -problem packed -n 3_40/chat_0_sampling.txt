(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on a surface (Surface 0). This object is a square with dimensions of roughly 0.078 units on a side. Surface 0 is also a square, centered at the origin, with dimensions of 0.27 units on a side, extending from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           For a placement to be stable, the object's bounding box needs to fit entirely within Surface 0's bounding box. Given the square shape of the object, its bounding box's dimensions will change depending on its rotation.  To handle this, I'll first consider the simplest scenario: no rotation (theta = 0). Here, the object's bounding box extends half the side length in each direction, which is about 0.039. So, the object's center's x and y coordinates need to be between -0.096 and 0.096 to ensure containment.
           
           Now, rotation adds a layer of complexity.  At a 45-degree angle (pi/4), the bounding box expands due to the square's diagonal. I've calculated that at this angle, the effective side length of the bounding box is about 0.11, so half the side is 0.055.  This means the range for the object's center narrows to between -0.08 and 0.08.  Any position valid for the most restrictive angle (pi/4) is valid for all rotations.  Therefore, I'll restrict myself to this more restrictive region to ensure all generated locations are valid regardless of rotation.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll use a mix of different rotations and positions. For the thetas, I’ll use 0.0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2.  I'll position points using a 3x3 grid centered in these ranges. The ranges depend on the rotation.
           
           For `theta = 0`:  generate x,y pairs. [-0.096, 0, 0.096].
           
           For `theta = pi/8`: generate x,y pairs. [-0.084, 0, 0.084]
           
           For `theta = pi/4`: generate x,y pairs. [-0.080, 0, 0.080]
           
           For `theta = 3*pi/8`: generate x,y pairs. [-0.084, 0, 0.084]
           
           For `theta = pi/2`: generate x,y pairs. [-0.096, 0, 0.096]
           
           In addition, since each region is 9 points, I'll add one additional coordinate per region using slight offsets from the center to provide a diverse set of coordinates, giving me the final 10 points.  The result should be 50 uniformly spaced placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placement Points**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a successful placement for object ID 5. Now, I need to find 50 safe placement locations for a new square object, ID 4, on the same surface. The main constraint is that object 4 must *not* collide with object 5, which is already in place.
           
           I know the surface size and the size of both objects. Object 5 is a square with side *s5*, placed at a specific location and with a rotation of 0 degrees. I can calculate the bounding box (AABB) of object 5, which occupies a rectangular area on the surface.
           
           Object 4 is also a square with side *s4*. To find safe placements, I need to account for its AABB at different rotations. The AABB size changes with rotation. I can calculate that.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to make sure the AABB of object 4 doesn't overlap with the AABB of object 5. So, I need to figure out the "forbidden" region for object 4's center, which corresponds to the area of object 5’s AABB.
           
           I will test several rotation angles for object 4: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. For each angle, I’ll calculate the AABB size and the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates of object 4, keeping in mind the object 5 AABB. This generates placement positions (x,y) for each angle. The process will generate 10 valid placements for each of the 5 angles. I will need to take the first 10 placements that meet the criteria.
           
           For each angle, I calculate the `x_forbidden_upper_bound` and `y_forbidden_upper_bound` for the object 4’s center, based on the rotation and object 5 position. Essentially, these values define the boundary of the region object 4 can *not* be in, because it would collide with object 5.
           I generate a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates within the valid surface area, but I carefully filter them. The grid iterates through possible coordinates. If the generated candidate values of `x` are greater than or equal to `x_forbidden_upper_bound` OR if the generated values of `y` are greater than or equal to `y_forbidden_upper_bound`, the coordinate is valid. This process guarantees I'm generating coordinates that are *not* inside the collision region with object 5.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement of a New Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on a surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4) already placed. The surface itself is a rectangle of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to precisely calculate the bounding boxes (AABBs) for these existing objects, taking into account their sizes and orientations (fixed at 0 degrees).
           
           Object ID 5 has an AABB defined by `[-0.135, -0.057] x [-0.135, -0.057]`. Object ID 4's AABB is  `[-0.135, -0.036] x [-0.049, 0.049]`.
           
           For ID 6, I calculate a bounding box based on its size and any rotation angle (theta).  The formula `bbox_side6(theta) = s6 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` will be used. From the size of the box I can compute the center coordinates that can be placed on the surface: `x` and `y` must fall within the bounds of the surface, factoring in the rotation and half the side length of object 6.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to prevent overlap between the new object's AABB (`R6`) and the AABBs of objects 4 and 5. This involves calculating "forbidden" regions for the center point of the new object, derived from the AABBs of the existing objects.
           
           I will iterate through a set of test rotations.  For each rotation, I will generate a grid of potential (x, y) center points, ensuring each point is within the surface boundaries. Then, I will assess whether each (x, y) candidate lies within any of the forbidden regions for `ID:5` or `ID:4`, which would imply collision. If a point is collision-free, it is a valid placement, and I will accumulate these until reaching 50 placements. I have to be careful with the generation logic to ensure that 50 placements are obtained.
