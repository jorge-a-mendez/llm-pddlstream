           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  This goal is a conjunction of several conditions. My initial approach involves breaking down each of these conditions and seeing what needs to be achieved.
           
           The goal consists of facts about the current configuration, like being at certain locations (`atconf`) and having space (`free`). However, more importantly, it requires that I have received images and analyses of rocks and soil. Specifically, I need `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)` and then `receivedanalysis` for some rock and some soil.
           
           Now, I analyze the initial state. The configuration preconditions are met. But crucially, the image and analysis conditions are *not* met.  I quickly realize that I need to use `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions to get those images and analyses.
           
           My focus shifts to identifying actions that can *achieve* these goals. `send_image` needs `haveimage` as a precondition and `send_analysis` needs `analyzed`. So I have to consider actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock`. But, there's a serious problem.
           
           I then check the list of available actions. I see I am *only* allowed `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.  The move actions are no-ops. And the `drop_rock` actions seem irrelevant.
           
           Then it hits me: *None of the allowed actions can achieve the core requirements.* I can't find a way to get the `send_image` or `send_analysis` actions, as the available actions are insufficient to satisfy all the conditions. The given available actions are insufficient to achieve the goal. Therefore the goal is *unreachable* given these strict constraints. I've re-read the problem statement carefully and the conclusion holds:  I can't reach the goal.
