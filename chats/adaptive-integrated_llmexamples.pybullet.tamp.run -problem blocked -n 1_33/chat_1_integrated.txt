User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.541, -0.309), (-4.446, -0.214)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.494, -0.261, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.86, 0.511).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two arms, `v4` and `v6`, two objects `v8` and `v15` on `v11` (a surface) and another object `v12` on `v14` (another surface). The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom stating that `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know that `v8` and `v12` are of `type v17`. Also `v18` is a surface with AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. So the goal is to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.
           `v8` is currently at `v9` which is on `v11`. `v15` is at `v16` which is also on `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` which is on `v14`.
           There are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the action instances, only `move_base`. This means that the goal cannot be achieved with the available actions.
           
           Since `new-axiom@0()` is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`, we need to place an object of type `v17` on `v18`. From the initial state, we know that `v8` and `v12` are of `type v17`. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the provided action instances, only a `move_base` action. Without `pick` and `place` actions, the robot cannot manipulate objects to achieve the `on` predicate. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
