User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.029, 0.274), (0.047, 0.35)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.194, 0.415), (-0.113, 0.496)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.009, 0.312, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.041).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.16, -0.592), (0.259, -0.493)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.153, 0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.764, 0.645).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.21, -0.542, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.406, 0.914).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Object Placement Goal**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) onto surface `v16`. They're currently all stacked on `v11`.  The plan is to pick each object from `v11` using one of the robot's arms (`v4` or `v6`), then place it on `v16`. Since all the objects have to go on the same surface, I'll need to calculate *distinct* positions on `v16` for each one. The objects are fairly small squares/circles with dimensions on the order of 0.08-0.1 meters. `v16` is a surface of 0.27m width/length.
           
           First, I examined object `v8`. The initial setup is it’s on the table (`v11`).  To place it I'll need to: 1) Pick `v8` using arm `v4`, assuming all preconditions for `pick` are true; this includes an empty hand and base configuration being `v3`. I assume the robot can move.  2) Now `v8` needs to be placed on `v16`. To do this, I need to find the specific pose `(#o2_v8)` for placing on `v16` which also needs an open kinematic (`kin`) setup. Then I’ll need to execute `place`.
           
           The critical part is the placement. The preconditions for `place` include that the pose for placement `unsafepose` and approach `unsafeapproach` are safe. However, the initial facts state `atpose` with the same name which means if multiple objects are at that pose then `unsafepose` is violated. So, I will instantiate new poses. The same would apply for other objects, I need unique poses. So for this one the process will go:  `pick` then `place` in location `(#o2_v8)`.
           
           For object `v12`, the process will be the same `pick` from the current surface and `place` at position `(#o2_v12)` on `v16`. Note I'll use the same `v4` arm to `pick` and `place` this object as the preconditions for placement in `#o2_v12` requires it to not be in the same location as `v8`, so I need to pick and place it in the unique calculated location to satisfy `unsafepose` from before.
           
           Finally, do the same for `v14` with a position `(#o2_v14)`. I'll pick then place using `v4`.  The plan order is v8, v12, then v14.
           
           Now, I will calculate positions on surface `v16`.  I have object AABB dimensions. Let’s create distinct points, centered with equal separation in the x dimension. The objects, and their AABBs are given. The approach is to calculate the dimensions to create a line up on the surface where each has equal spacing. I want the objects in a row. Surface is from -0.135 to 0.135. First object will be near the left, -0.097, followed by v14 at -0.0115 and then finally v12 at 0.0855.  I have 0.007 separating all of them. Each have their z set to 0.781. The continuous values for the poses are:
           
           *   `(#o2 v8 v16)`: (-0.097, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `(#o2 v14 v16)`: (-0.0115, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `(#o2 v12 v16)`: (0.0855, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           So the plan is:
           1.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           2.  `(place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  `(place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Limitations**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out a critical flaw in the previous plan: the actions it proposed weren't even in the allowed list.  That's a pretty fundamental problem! The system specified that the *only* action I could use was `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a really restrictive environment.
           
           Looking at the goal - `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` - I immediately recognize the challenge. The initial state tells me these objects are *already* `on` something else, `v11`, due to their `atpose` and `supported` facts.  To get them to `v16`, I'd normally use the standard `pick` and `place` actions. I'd *have* to manipulate the objects' locations. But there's the rub - *I don't have those actions*!
           
           With only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` in my toolbox, there's absolutely no way to alter the `atpose` facts of `v8`, `v12`, or `v14`. I can't even touch them. Since I can't change their positions, I can't possibly change the `on` facts. It's a dead end. Therefore, given the limited action set, I have to conclude that the goal state is unachievable with the current constraints. I need to explain this to the user, clearly articulating why this is a fundamentally impossible task with the actions I'm permitted to use.
