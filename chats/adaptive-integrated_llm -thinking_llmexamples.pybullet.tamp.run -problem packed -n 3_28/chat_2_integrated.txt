User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.029, 0.274), (0.047, 0.35)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.194, 0.415), (-0.113, 0.496)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.009, 0.312, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.041).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.16, -0.592), (0.259, -0.493)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.153, 0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.764, 0.645).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.21, -0.542, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.406, 0.914).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this plan:**
           
           The core of this problem is figuring out how to get three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) from a table (`v11`) onto a specific surface (`v16`). My plan is to use the robot's arm (`v4`) to pick and place each object. Since there's a goal for each object to be *on* `v16`, I need to carefully choose where to put them on that surface.
           
           **Breaking Down the Problem:**
           
           *   **Initial State:** The objects are currently on `v11` at various poses, like `atpose(v8, v9)` and supported by `v11`. `v16` is a designated surface, and I have kinesthetic facts (`kin`) indicating arm reachability for each. The robot arm is empty initially, and the robot's base is at a starting configuration (`v3`).
           *   **Goal:**  Get all three objects to the state `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
           *   **Actions:**  I've got three actions to work with: `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. The key is that `pick` and `place` require an arm and all `pick` and `place` actions involve the same arm (`v4`).
           *   **Challenges:** The problem introduces a tricky concept with the poses. While `pose(obj, #o2)` is in the initial state, the continuous value for `#o2` for each `obj` must be provided in the plan. This is because the goal requires me to place each object at a stable, collision-free pose on `v16`. In other words, even though the parameter in the PDDL plan will be `#o2`, I need to determine three *specific* (distinct) `#o2` poses on `v16`. The plan does not use poses that *aren't* defined with `#`. Therefore, no pose values are needed for poses like `v9`.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** The robot's base needs to be in a position (`#o3`) to pick up the objects. I will use the `move_base` action to reposition to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and Place (Repeat 3x):**  For each object:
               *   `pick`: Pick the object (`v8`, `v12`, or `v14`) from its current pose on `v11`.
               *   `place`: Place the object onto a specific, safe pose on `v16`. This means I need to calculate a *unique* continuous value for `#o2` for each object.
           
           **Continuous Values for `#o2`:**
           
           *   **Surface Geometry:** The placement poses need to fit onto `v16`. I have AABB dimensions for `v8, v12, v14` and for `v16`. Given the dimensions of `v16`, I can find valid placement locations. Since all three objects need to go *on* `v16`, and the problem states to give individual values for the poses, I plan to arrange the objects next to each other on `v16`, leaving some space between the objects to keep things collision-free.
           *   **My logic:** To be collision-free, each object needs a distinct pose on `v16`. I found 3 x, y coordinates to place the objects to prevent collisions. I calculated that by using the object width, `v16` width, and the need to allow room between the objects.
           
           **Final Plan Structure (PDDL):**
           
           The plan will include:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (where I specify a specific pose for `v8` relative to `v16`)
           4.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           5.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (where I specify a distinct pose for `v12` relative to `v16`)
           6.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           7.  `place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (where I
