           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v14) currently supported by v11. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. We are given an initial state where v8 is at pose v9, v12 is at pose v13, and v14 is at pose v15. All three objects are currently supported by v11. The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), both empty. The robot's base is at configuration v3.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from v3 to v3 (effectively staying in the same place) and consumes the `canmove()` predicate. This action does not directly interact with any of the objects, and thus cannot be used to achieve the `on` predicates, which require picking and placing the objects. Since there are no available `pick` or `place` actions, and no `clean` or `cook` actions are relevant to the goal, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving the objects onto v16.
           
           The `on` predicate is an axiom derived from `supported` and `atpose`. While the `supported` facts for v16 exist for all three objects at a continuous parameter `#o2`, there are no `atpose` facts for `#o2` for any of the objects. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to pick up each object and place it onto v16 at a specific pose. Since no `pick` or `place` actions are available, the goal is unachievable.
