           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to establishing several facts about image reception, rock analysis, and current rover configurations. However, the constraints are tight, and as a seasoned planner, I see a significant hurdle.
           
           First, I need to understand what needs to be true. I have `atconf`, `free` predicates which are true initially, and a set of predicates I need to make true: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where `type(?stone, v2)`), and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where `type(?soil, v6)`).
           
           To get `receivedimage`, I'd need to go through a sequence of actions including `send_image`, `take_image`, and `calibrate`. For `receivedanalysis`, I need `send_analysis`, which relies on `analyzed` and ultimately `sample_rock`.
           
           The crux of the matter lies in the *available* actions: `move` and `drop_rock`.  I need to check the precondition of these actions and then create a plan using those.
           
           Now the issue is that both actions only change positions of Rovers and storage. There are no available actions to make me "analyze", "sample", "take image", or send it to base.
           
           Therefore, since none of these subgoals are achievable with the provided actions (`move` and `drop_rock`), I conclude that **the current goal is unachievable with the given constraints.** There is no combination of moves and drops that will lead to the facts `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` being true. The system is designed such that without the actions to analyze, calibrate, take images, and send images I cannot achieve the goal.
