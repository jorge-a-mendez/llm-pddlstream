(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing an object (ID 5, square with side 0.098) on surface 0, a square area from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), and I need 50 stable configurations. My plan is to vary both the object's rotation (theta) and its (x, y) position on the surface.
           
           First, I need to consider the constraints. The object must be entirely within the surface's boundaries. Since it's a square, I need to account for how rotation changes its effective bounding box.  I'll define `hx` and `hy` as half the object's size.  Then I'll calculate `R_half_extent`, which is the half-width and half-height of the rotated object's AABB.
           
           Since `hx = hy`, the largest `R_half_extent_max` (which dictates the least space for placement) occurs at 45 degrees (`pi/4` or its multiples), with the value `hx * sqrt(2)`. The smallest, least-constrained `R_half_extent_min` occurs at 0 or 90 degrees, being just `hx`.
           
           The formula for `R_half_extent = hx * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` will guide me. The valid range for the center of the object on x/y will be `[-0.135 + R_half_extent, 0.135 - R_half_extent]`.
           
           For diversity, I'll sample at some relevant angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. And then, for each angle, I will populate with 10 positions via a 3x3 grid that includes positions at each side and one in the middle, and then one additional point to ensure I get to the total of 10 positions. This should guarantee diverse enough coverage across the valid surface placement area.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a clear task: figure out 50 stable, non-colliding positions for Object 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't overlap with the already-placed Object 5. I know Object 5 is a square sitting at (-0.08, -0.08) and takes up the region [(-0.129, -0.129), (-0.031, -0.031)]. Object 4 is also a square, but smaller. My strategy? Generate a grid of potential placements, checking each one for collision with Object 5.
           
           First, I need to account for rotation. I'm going to look at Object 4's possible positions at angles of 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2 radians. At each angle, I need to calculate the bounding box (AABB) of Object 4. I know the general equation for this: `R_half_extent_obj4 = hx_obj4 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This defines the half-extents of the rotated object for a given angle. I will use the function `generate_candidates_for_angle` to help me.
           
           I've got the ranges where Object 4 can go: (-0.135, 0.135) for both x and y. But I have to avoid the region where Object 5 is. The most efficient way is to generate a uniform grid (15x15) for each angle, and use a function to filter all the colliding placements, and pick the first 50 non-colliding locations.
           
           The collision check is critical. I'm using an AABB intersection test. I've designed the `is_colliding` function to do just that, ensuring that any generated placement doesn't overlap with Object 5's bounding box. The `is_colliding` checks overlap in x- and y- axes separately.
           
           So, the plan is to create many more than 50 placements with a variety of rotations and filter them using this check. After generating the candidate locations, I will sort them in a list and choose the first 50 non-colliding options to return the placements. I will generate a number that will allow me to have a certain amount of combinations, which is more than sufficient.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           The task at hand is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6) on a surface, ensuring that it doesn't collide with two other fixed objects (IDs 4 and 5).  I'm dealing with a square surface of size `0.27` units.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 5 is located in the bottom-left, approximately at the corner and Object 4 is located at the top-right.  Object 6, with its square dimensions, needs to be placed without any overlap.  The placement must also ensure stability.
           
           To achieve this, my strategy involves the following steps:
           
           1.  **Rotation:** I'll consider several rotation angles: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3pi/8`, `pi/2`, `pi/6`, and `pi/3`.  These represent different orientations of the square relative to the surface and other objects.
           2.  **AABB and valid ranges:** I will need to calculate the *Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)* of the object, which is useful for collision detection. The rotated half-extent needs to be calculated for each angle. The maximum extent defines the region which is physically accessible.
           3.  **Point Generation:** A grid of candidate (x, y) locations will be generated within the valid ranges for each rotation angle. The density of points is critical. If the valid region is small, the density of the points should be larger to account for the sparsity in available regions.
           4.  **Collision Check:** For each candidate position and rotation, I will check for collision with the existing fixed objects (5 and 4). This check relies on the AABB calculations and ensures no overlaps.
           5.  **Filtering:** Candidates that cause a collision are removed, and only safe placements are preserved.
           
           The core calculations involve determining the rotated AABB for each possible position (center + angle) and determining non-collision.  The ranges depend on the surface size, object size, and angle. If there isn't enough space for the object I might be looking at a problem for which no placement solution exists.
           
           Key variables include `hx6` which is the half-extent of Object 6, `R_half_extent_obj6` which is the rotated half-extent of Object 6, as well as bounds.  The current coordinates I'm given are: Object 5's position at (-0.08, -0.08), and Object 4's position at (0.098, 0.098).
           
           The crucial aspect of the algorithm lies in the careful collision checks and the density of points generated. I have increased the density of the grid for a greater chance of finding non-colliding locations. The grid's spacing will be relative to the rotated half-extent of the object, as the goal is to cover the entire space.
           
           After applying the filtering, and ensuring sufficient valid regions I will provide the 50 best placement configurations.
