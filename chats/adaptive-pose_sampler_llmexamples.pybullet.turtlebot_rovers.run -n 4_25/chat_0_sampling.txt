User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at the origin. There are four walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (5) in the middle at x=0. There are several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including clusters in the top-right, top-left, and bottom-right corners. There are also several smaller obstacles in the center.
           
           For the target point (1.78 0.19), I will try positions that are at a distance of 1.5 from the target, as this leaves some room for the robot to maneuver. I will try to find positions to the left, right, top, and bottom of the target. I will also try to avoid placing the robot too close to the obstacles, especially the central column (5) and the wall.
           
           Positions:
           (0.28 0.19)
           (1.78 1.69)
           (1.78 -1.31)
