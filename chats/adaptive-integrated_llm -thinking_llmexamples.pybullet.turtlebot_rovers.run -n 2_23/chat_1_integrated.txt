           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning for Axiom Achievement**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  This axiom has a conjunction of several conditions. The first four conditions,  `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`, are already true in the initial state. Great!
           
           Now, the trickier parts involve getting `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`,  and also ensuring I get  `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a stone of a specific type and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a soil of another type.
           
           To get the images, I need to get `haveimage(rover, obj, mode)`, which itself requires `imagevisible(rover, #o, #y, obj)`.  I have `imagevisible` predicates in the initial state with rovers `v12` and `v14` for `v17` and `v18`. I also have `comvisible` predicates for communication.
           
           **Image Acquisition Strategy**
           
           My plan is:
           1.  **Calibration:**  Calibrate a rover at an object location (`#o3`).
           2.  **Image Capture:**  Take images of the targets (`v17`, `v18`) from that location.
           3.  **Communication:**  Move the rover to a location with a good communication signal (`#o0`) and send the images.
           
           I will use rover `v12`. I need to move it, calibrate, take images, move it to communicate, and then return the rover to its initial config, and do the same for `v14` (soil and stone samples and their analysis).
           
           **Detailed Plan with Actions**
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           *   **v12 (for images and analysis of stone v1)**
               1.  **Move:**  Move from initial configuration (`v13`) to the imaging location (`#o3`). I'll need coordinates for this `#o3`.
               2.  **Calibrate:** Calibrate the camera to object `v17`
               3.  **Image:** Take an image of the object `v17`.
               4.  **Calibrate:** Calibrate the camera to object `v18`
               5.  **Image:** Take an image of the object `v18`.
               6.  **Move:**  Move to the communication location (`#o0`). I need to give the coordinates of this location for communication to happen.
               7.  **Send Images:** Send images for both `v17` and `v18`.
               8.  **Move:** Move to `#o5` for rock sampling.
               9.  **Sample Rock:** Sample rock `v1`.
               10. **Move:** Move back to `#o0`
               11. **Send Analysis:** Send analysis for the rock that was sampled.
               12. **Drop Rock:** Free store of rover by dropping the rock.
               13. **Return:** Move back to its initial config (`v13`)
           
           *   **v14 (analysis of soil v5)**
               1.  **Move:** Move to the sampling location (`#o5`).
               2.  **Sample Rock:** Sample soil `v5`.
               3.  **Move:**  Move to the communication location (`#o0`).
               4.  **Send Analysis:** Send analysis of soil.
               5.  **Drop Rock:** Free store of rover by dropping the rock.
               6.  **Return:** Move back to its initial config (`v15`).
           
           **Continuous Parameter Values**
           
           I must supply specific coordinates for my configurations.  I need coordinates for:
           
           *   **`#o3` (Image Locations):** I *must* interpret that the same `#o3` must be interpreted separately to be two configurations and, because each (rover, target) pair is independent, and the instructions are very strict, I'll calculate two separate locations.
               *   For `(v12, v17)` I am using `(1.0, 0.5)`
               *   For `(v12, v18)` I am using `(-0.5, 1.0)`
           *   **`#o0` (Communication Locations):**  I need separate values here too as my instructions state:
               *   For `(v12,v9)` I am using `(0.
)

           1.  **Calibration:**  Calibrate a rover at an object location (`#o3`).
           2.  **Image Capture:**  Take images of the targets (`v17`, `v18`) from that location.
           3.  **Communication:**  Move the rover to a location with a good communication signal (`#o0`) and send the images.
           
           I will use rover `v12`. I need to move it, calibrate, take images, move it to communicate, and then return the rover to its initial config, and do the same for `v14` (soil and stone samples and their analysis).
           
           **Detailed Plan with Actions**
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           *   **v12 (for images and analysis of stone v1)**
               1.  **Move:**  Move from initial configuration (`v13`) to the imaging location (`#o3`). I'll need coordinates for this `#o3`.
               2.  **Calibrate:** Calibrate the camera to object `v17`
               3.  **Image:** Take an image of the object `v17`.
               4.  **Calibrate:** Calibrate the camera to object `v18`
               5.  **Image:** Take an image of the object `v18`.
               6.  **Move:**  Move to the communication location (`#o0`). I need to give the coordinates of this location for communication to happen.
               7.  **Send Images:** Send images for both `v17` and `v18`.
               8.  **Move:** Move to `#o5` for rock sampling.
               9.  **Sample Rock:** Sample rock `v1`.
               10. **Move:** Move back to `#o0`
               11. **Send Analysis:** Send analysis for the rock that was sampled.
               12. **Drop Rock:** Free store of rover by dropping the rock.
               13. **Return:** Move back to its initial config (`v13`)
           
           *   **v14 (analysis of soil v5)**
               1.  **Move:** Move to the sampling location (`#o5`).
               2.  **Sample Rock:** Sample soil `v5`.
               3.  **Move:**  Move to the communication location (`#o0`).
               4.  **Send Analysis:** Send analysis of soil.
               5.  **Drop Rock:** Free store of rover by dropping the rock.
               6.  **Return:** Move back to its initial config (`v15`).
           
           **Continuous Parameter Values**
           
           I must supply specific coordinates for my configurations.  I need coordinates for:
           
           *   **`#o3` (Image Locations):** I *must* interpret that the same `#o3` must be interpreted separately to be two configurations and, because each (rover, target) pair is independent, and the instructions are very strict, I'll calculate two separate locations.
               *   For `(v12, v17)` I am using `(1.0, 0.5)`
               *   For `(v12, v18)` I am using `(-0.5, 1.0)`
           *   **`#o0` (Communication Locations):**  I need separate values here too as my instructions state:
               *   For `(v12,v9)` I am using `(0.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v12 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (0.0 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v19: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Addressing Invalid Configurations and Refining the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating some issues with the previous plan, specifically around configurations for rovers and their interactions with targets and obstacles. Let's break down the problems and devise a revised strategy, making sure to meet the project's requirements for precision and collision avoidance.
           
           The main issue is with the initial configurations for communication and imaging, `#o0` and `#o3` respectively, and the locations those configurations correspond to in relation to the obstacle `v19`. I need to generate updated configurations for these that are valid according to the stated problem constraints.
           
           Here's my thought process to determine a new plan:
           
           First, I need to get the geometry of the situation straight: `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75), and I know the locations of target `v9`, target `v18` and obstacle `v19`.
           
           **Revising Configurations for Rover v12**
           
           The feedback says that `(0.0 -2.0)` is colliding with the obstacle for v12. So, for `#o0`, I need a communication position for v12 that's outside of the obstacle `v19` (x = 0).
           
           The previous plan used `(-0.5, 1.0)` for `#o3` imaging `v18`. Let's assume the previous plan had a collision with `v19`, which requires the new `#o3` to be on the opposite side of `v19`. So, this will need a new approach.
           
           **Revised Configuration: Communication**
           For `v12` to communicate with the lander `v9`, the distance constraint is a maximum of 4 units, so the new point should satisfy this. The center of `v9` is approximately at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. It is logical to have `(0.5, -2.0)` as the new configuration because this places `v12` at a distance of 2.4 from the center of `v9`, which means v12 is in communication range.
           
           **Revised Configuration: Imaging**
           `v18` is at coordinates approximately at `(-1.94, 2.14)`. To provide an updated value for `#o3`, I need to select a value for the configuration that avoids the obstacle and stays within the imaging range of `v18` of 2 units. A position `(-1.0, 1.0)` looks like a good configuration and its distance to `v18` is around 1.47, which is within the 2 unit range.
           
           I am re-evaluating the sampling targets as well, given the new coordinates for #o3. Sampling is done with the value `#o5`, so I need to choose configurations for this value for rock sampling. I will choose a `#o5` value for rock `v1` (with center coordinate approximately `(0.4, 0.7)`) and for rock `v5` (center coordinate approximately `(-1.3, -0.7)`) with the understanding that I can use different configurations based on collision and distance issues. The previous configuration was colliding with `v19`, so I must be careful about these two points.
           
           The revised point is `(0.4, 0.0)` for the sampling of rock `v1`. This is for a rover `v12`. I need a similar approach for `v14`. I can choose `(-1.3, -1.0)` for sampling `v5`. It can be shown that both have a collision with the obstacle `v19`. The configuration for `v12` over `v1` will be named as `#o5_v12_v1_pose` and the one for the target, `#o5_v14_v5_pose`.
           
           The general plan logic remains the same. I just need to be careful with the configurations. I am redefining and assigning coordinates according to the feedback, and collision checks. Also, I will name the corresponding rock sampling poses with distinct names as instructed by the project.
           
           With the new configurations for `o0` and `o3`, I am now in a position to build the new plan:
           
           Here are my revised configurations:
           -   `#o0 v12 #o1 v9`: (0.5, -2.0)
           -   `#o0 v14 #o1 v9`: (-1.0, -2.0)
           -   `#o3 v12 #o4 v17`: (1.0, 0.5) (unchanged)
           -   `#o3 v1
)

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Impassable Wall**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We're facing a scenario where the proposed configurations for our rovers aren't working because of that pesky wall, *v19*. It's a vertical barrier right down the middle, separating the map into left and right regions. The problem is, our plan requires *both* rovers to interact with things on *both* sides of this wall.
           
           Here's the rub: I've tried to position the rovers to get images and sample rocks, but every attempt to position them to communicate across the wall has failed. The feedback keeps coming back: "not reachable for robot base."  This means the path between those locations is, for all intents and purposes, blocked. We're interpreting this as a limitation of the motion available to our robots -- the "motion" commands aren't designed to maneuver *through* solid objects, only *around* them.
           
           The goal involves having both rovers fulfill certain tasks. One rover, *v12*, starts on the right side and needs to image an objective and sample a stone *also* on the right side, but then needs to send that to a lander *on the left side.* The other rover, *v14*, is on the left, and is able to image a left side objective and send its data. I've tried multiple configurations, each time ensuring the rovers are far enough from the wall that their bodies won't collide. Each attempt, it seems, the motion planner fails.
           
           Because the problem requires that rovers be capable of completing tasks on either side of the wall, if the motion cannot cross this impassable object, and there is no obvious way around it, we're stuck.
           **The full set of goals is therefore *unachievable* in the current geometry.**
