           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: Analysis of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to hold true concurrently.  After analyzing the initial state, I've identified that the primary obstacles preventing achievement are the predicates: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis` of rocks of type `v2`, and `receivedanalysis` of rocks of type `v6`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to use the `send_image` action, which necessitates `take_image` and `calibrate`. Similarly, `receivedanalysis` demands the use of `send_analysis` after `sample_rock`. However, a crucial constraint arises: the task explicitly states that only the provided "list of available action instances" is allowed. This list includes only `move` and `drop_rock` actions. Neither `send_image`, `send_analysis`, nor any of their requisite actions are present in the allowed actions.
           
           Therefore, since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, and these can *only* be achieved through actions *not* in the permitted list, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is demonstrably **unachievable** with the provided constraints. The restricted action set fundamentally blocks any path towards a successful completion of the axiom.
