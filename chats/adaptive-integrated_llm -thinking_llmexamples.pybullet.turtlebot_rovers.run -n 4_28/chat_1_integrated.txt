           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Strategic Planning**
           
           My primary objective is to successfully achieve the state defined by `new-axiom@0()`. This involves receiving images of four specific objects (v17, v18, v19, v20), acquiring and analyzing a stone of type v2 and a soil of type v6. I've identified the necessary actions: imaging, communication with the lander, and sampling and analysis of the required rock types. I'll need to utilize rover v12 and v14, which both start at their respective base configurations. Both can see the objectives from one configuration.
           
           **Image Acquisition and Communication**
           
           *   First, I'll move rover v12 to the ideal imaging location, designated as configuration `#o3`.
           *   Then, I'll use rover's onboard camera (v10, which supports mode v11) to capture images of each of the four objectives.
           *   Once images are acquired, I'll shift v12 to the designated communication point `#o0` to upload them to the lander (v9).
           
           **Rock Sampling and Analysis**
           
           *   Simultaneously, I'll need to sample and analyze a rock of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           *   For the stones, I will move v12 to the sampling location `#o5` and sample rock v1.
           *   Once the store is full, I will move v12 to #o0 and send that to the lander. I will repeat this process for soil.
           
           **Finalization and Returning to Base**
           
           *   At this stage, all the imaging and analysis goals should be met.
           *   The final step is to make sure the rover is at its initial location and the store is free, fulfilling the remaining criteria for the axiom.
           
           **Implementation Details and Continuous Parameter Selection**
           
           *   To ensure this plan functions correctly, the configuration objects must meet the requirements of the initial conditions defined in the imagevisible, comvisible, and above predicates and is collision-free. I've selected the following approximate values based on geometric considerations:
               *   **#o3 (imaging):** Position (0.0, 0.5) with facing 90 degrees/North
               *   **#o0 (communication):** Position (-0.5, -1.8) facing West
               *   **#o5 (sampling):** Position (0.0, 0.0) facing East
           *   The rays (`#o4`, `#o1`, etc.) will provide directionality for camera and communication, but their specific values are not explicitly used in the plan steps.
           * The rover has to return to the initial location, making sure that its store is free after analysis is sent to the lander.

           *   Once images are acquired, I'll shift v12 to the designated communication point `#o0` to upload them to the lander (v9).
           
           **Rock Sampling and Analysis**
           
           *   Simultaneously, I'll need to sample and analyze a rock of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil).
           *   For the stones, I will move v12 to the sampling location `#o5` and sample rock v1.
           *   Once the store is full, I will move v12 to #o0 and send that to the lander. I will repeat this process for soil.
           
           **Finalization and Returning to Base**
           
           *   At this stage, all the imaging and analysis goals should be met.
           *   The final step is to make sure the rover is at its initial location and the store is free, fulfilling the remaining criteria for the axiom.
           
           **Implementation Details and Continuous Parameter Selection**
           
           *   To ensure this plan functions correctly, the configuration objects must meet the requirements of the initial conditions defined in the imagevisible, comvisible, and above predicates and is collision-free. I've selected the following approximate values based on geometric considerations:
               *   **#o3 (imaging):** Position (0.0, 0.5) with facing 90 degrees/North
               *   **#o0 (communication):** Position (-0.5, -1.8) facing West
               *   **#o5 (sampling):** Position (0.0, 0.0) facing East
           *   The rays (`#o4`, `#o1`, etc.) will provide directionality for camera and communication, but their specific values are not explicitly used in the plan steps.
           * The rover has to return to the initial location, making sure that its store is free after analysis is sent to the lander.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan failed because the chosen continuous values for configurations `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` resulted in collisions or being unreachable. I need to select new configurations that are collision-free, reachable, and provide the necessary line-of-sight/above conditions.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the object locations:
           *   `v12` (rover) AABB = ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)) - near (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14` (rover) AABB = ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)) - near (-1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v9` (lander) AABB = ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - located around (-1.9, -2.0)
           *   `v17` (objective) AABB = ((1.77, 2.094), (1.863, 2.187)) - near (1.8, 2.1)
           *   `v18` (objective) AABB = ((-0.463, 1.96), (-0.368, 2.055)) - near (-0.4, 2.0)
           *   `v19` (objective) AABB = ((-2.21, 2.144), (-2.131, 2.223)) - near (-2.17, 2.18)
           *   `v20` (objective) AABB = ((0.638, 1.768), (0.716, 1.846)) - near (0.68, 1.8)
           *   `v1` (rock type v2) AABB = ((-2.098, 0.455), (-1.999, 0.555)) - near (-2.05, 0.5)
           *   `v3` (rock type v2) AABB = ((1.336, 0.505), (1.434, 0.602)) - near (1.38, 0.55)
           *   `v4` (rock type v2) AABB = ((0.594, -1.27), (0.691, -1.173)) - near (0.64, -1.22)
           *   `v5` (rock type v6) AABB = ((0.879, -0.862), (1.003, -0.739)) - near (0.94, -0.8)
           *   `v7` (rock type v6) AABB = ((1.439, -1.53), (1.571, -1.398)) - near (1.5, -1.46)
           *   `v8` (rock type v6) AABB = ((1.771, -1.762), (1.9, -1.633)) - near (1.84, -1.7)
           *   Obstacle `v21`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - This is a thin wall or barrier along the y-axis at x=0.0.
           
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           The strategy remains the same: Rover `v12` will handle all tasks. Rover `v14` will stay at `v15`.
           
           **Configuration for Imaging (`#o3`):**
           The objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` are scattered.
           *   `v17`: (1.8, 2.1)
           *   `v18`: (-0.4, 2.0)
           *   `v19`: (-2.17, 2.18)
           *   `v20`: (0.68, 1.8)
           The previous `#o3` (0.0, 0.5) was colliding with `v21` (x=0.0). I need to move it away from x=0.0. A configuration around (0.5, 0.0) or (-0.5, 0.0) would be fine, but to see multiple objectives, it's better to be a bit further back. Let's try to place `#o3` for `v12` to the right of `v21` for imaging. Given `v12` is initially at (1.0, -1.75), moving to a point like (1.0, 0.0) could be reasonable. Let's place it at (1.0, 0.5) with a view towards the objectives in front. The maximum imaging range is 2.0.
           
           *   From (1.0, 0.5):
               *   To `v17` (1.8, 2.1): dist ~ sqrt((1.8-1)^2 + (2.1-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 1.6^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 2.56) = sqrt(3.2) ~ 1.79. Visible.
               *   To `v18` (-0.4, 2.0): dist ~ sqrt((-0.4-1)^2 + (2.0-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-1.4)^2 + 1.5^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 2.25) = sqrt(4.21) ~ 2.05. This is slightly over 2.0, so `v12` at (1.0, 0.5) is too far for `v18`.
               *   To `v19` (-2.17, 2.18): even further.
               *   To `v20` (0.68, 1.8): dist ~ sqrt((0.68-1)^2 + (1.8-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.32)^2 + 1.3^2) = sqrt(0.1024 + 1.69) = sqrt(1.7924) ~ 1.34. Visible.
           
           It seems a single configuration for `v12` cannot image all four objectives due to range and the `v21` obstacle. The prompt says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration...". This implies that the initial `imagevisible` predicates are valid and a configuration `#o3` exists that allows this. The coordinates I provide must respect this. If I try a configuration `x=0.0` or close to it, it hits `v21`. So I must move away from `x=0.0`.
           
           Let's assume the given `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, ...)` implies `#o3` is a single configuration for `v12` from which it can see all four objectives. This requires a central point. The problem statement says I must select valid actions from the list. The list contains `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`. This strongly suggests a *single* configuration `#o3` for `v12` for *all* objectives. The previous (0.0, 0.5) was equidistant but collided. Given `v21` is at x=0.0, let's try a point that avoids x=0.0, e.g., (0.1, 0.5) or (-0.1, 0.5). However, this might still be too close to `v21` for the robot's physical dimensions. Let's try (0.2, 0.5) to avoid the thin obstacle `v21`. This position is also far enough from v12's initial position (1.0, -1.75) for movement. Given the AABB definitions, rovers are about 0.36m wide. So x=0.2 is clear of x=0.0 for the center of the rover.
           If `#o3 = (0.2, 0.5, 1.57)` (facing generally +y):
           *   `v17` (1.8, 2.1): dist ~ sqrt((1.8-0.2)^2 + (2.1-0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.6^2 + 1.6^2) = sqrt(2*2.56) = sqrt(5.12) ~ 2.26. Too far.
           This suggests the initial state implies a specific geometric configuration for `#o3` that is visible and reachable for all objectives. This is tricky. Let's reconsider the problem statement about continuous parameters: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') ... you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that ... it is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible`... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all)...".
           
           Aha! This means if `v12` needs to image `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`, then `#o3` for `v17` can be different from `#o3` for `v18`, etc. This clarifies things! The `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` etc. facts in the initial state *do not* mean `#o3` is a single configuration. They mean there *exists* a configuration `#o3` (which can be different for each target) that fits the criteria. This is a crucial re-interpretation.
           
           So, I need to define *four* different `#o3` configurations for `v12`, one for each objective, or reuse if possible. Let's define:
           *   `#o3_17` for `v17`
           *   `#o3_18` for `v18`
           *   `#o3_19` for `v19`
           *   `#o3_20` for `v20`
           And correspondingly, the actions `calibrate v12 #o3_17 #o4 v17 v10`, `take_image v12 #o3_17 #o4 v17 v10 v11`, etc. However, the *available action instances* list only has `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`, not `(calibrate v12 #o3_17 #o4 v17 v10)`. This implies that the variable `#o3` in the initial state predicates *is* meant to refer to a single symbolic object `#o3` for all `imagevisible` predicates, *but* the actual continuous value associated with this symbolic object can be chosen differently for each (rover, target) pair. The problem statement says "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all)". This means I need to provide `#o3: (x,y,theta)` for `(v12, v17)`, `#o3: (x,y,theta)` for `(v12, v18)`, etc.
           
           Let's rename the continuous configurations in the plan for clarity when defining them, but use `#o3` in the actions as per the available action instances.
           
           **Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).**
           Objective targets:
           *   `v17` (1.8, 2.1)
           *   `v18` (-0.4, 2.0)
           *   `v19` (-2.17, 2.18)
           *   `v20` (0.68, 1.8)
           
           1.  **Image `v17` (1.8, 2.1):** From `v12`'s initial position (1.0, -1.75), moving slightly forward to (1.5, 0.5) and facing (1.8, 2.1).
               *   Distance: sqrt((1.8-1.5)^2 + (2.1-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 1.6^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 2.56) = sqrt(2.65) ~ 1.63. Within range (2.0).
               *   Let `#o3_17` = (1.5, 0.5, 1.57) (facing generally north). This avoids `v21`.
           
           2.  **Image `v20` (0.68, 1.8):** Can also be imaged from (1.5, 0.5).
               *   Distance: sqrt((0.68-1.5)^2 + (1.8-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.82)^2 + 1.3^2) = sqrt(0.6724 + 1.69) = sqrt(2.3624) ~ 1.54. Within range.
               *   Let's reuse `#o3_17` for `v20` as well.
           
           3.  **Image `v18` (-0.4, 2.0):** From `v12`'s initial position (1.0, -1.75), to image this, `v12` needs to cross `x=0` or be to its left. To avoid `v21` (x=0.0 wall) and minimize movement, let's try a configuration like (0.1, 0.5).
               *   Distance from (0.1, 0.5) to `v18` (-0.4, 2.0): sqrt((-0.4-0.1)^2 + (2.0-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + 1.5^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 2.25) = sqrt(2.5) ~ 1.58. Within range.
               *   To `v19` (-2.17, 2.18): From (0.1, 0.5) dist ~ sqrt((-2.17-0.1)^2 + (2.18-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-2.27)^2 + 1.68^2) = sqrt(5.1529 + 2.8224) = sqrt(7.9753) ~ 2.82. Too far.
           
           It seems `v12` will need to move to different locations for `v17/v20` and `v18` and `v19`.
           
           Let's define three distinct `#o3` locations:
           *   `#o3_right` for `v17`, `v20` (right of `v21`): e.g., (1.0, 0.5, 1.57) - this is within the allowed range and avoids `v21`.
           *   `#o3_center_left` for `v18`: e.g., (-0.5, 0.5, 1.57) - this is left of `v21`.
               *   From (-0.5, 0.5) to `v18` (-0.4, 2.0): dist ~ sqrt((-0.4-(-0.5))^2 + (2.0-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 1.5^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 2.25) = sqrt(2.26) ~ 1.5. Within range.
           *   `#o3_far_left` for `v19`: e.g., (-1.8, 0.5, 1.57).
               *   From (-1.8, 0.5) to `v19` (-2.17, 2.18): dist ~ sqrt((-2.17-(-1.8))^2 + (2.18-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.37)^2 + 1.68^2) = sqrt(0.1369 + 2.8224) = sqrt(2.9593) ~ 1.72. Within range.
           
           **Plan for imaging:**
           1.  Move `v12` to `#o3_right` (1.0, 0.5, 1.57)
           2.  Calibrate and image `v17`.
           3.  Calibrate and image `v20`.
           4.  Move `v12` to `#o3_center_left` (-0.5, 0.5, 1.57)
           5.  Calibrate and image `v18`.
           6.  Move `v12` to `#o3_far_left` (-1.8, 0.5, 1.57)
           7.  Calibrate and image `v19`.
           
           **Configuration for Communication (`#o0`):**
           Lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - around (-1.9, -2.0).
           `v12` needs to establish `comvisible` with `v9`. Max range is 4.
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           A good location for communication could be close to `v9` but avoiding `v21`. Let's try (-1.5, -1.8, 0.0) for `#o0`.
           *   Distance from (-1.5, -1.8) to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): sqrt((-1.9-(-1.5))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.8))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.2) ~ 0.44. Well within range (4.0).
           *   Reachable from all `#o3` locations. This also avoids `v21`.
           
           **Configuration for Sampling (`#o5`):**
           Need to sample `v1` (type `v2`) and `v5` (type `v6`).
           *   `v1` (rock type v2) AABB = ((-2.098, 0.455), (-1.999, 0.555)) - near (-2.05, 0.5).
           *   `v5` (rock type v6) AABB = ((0.879, -0.862), (1.003, -0.739)) - near (0.94, -0.8).
           `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75).
           To be `above` `v1` (-2.05, 0.5) and `v5` (0.94, -0.8), `v12` again needs to move significantly.
           Let's define two `#o5` locations:
           *   `#o5_v1` for `v1`: near (-2.05, 0.5). Let's try (-2.05, 0.2, 0.0). This is left of `v21`.
           *   `#o5_v5` for `v5`: near (0.94, -0.8). Let's try (0.94, -1.0, 0.0). This is right of `v21`.
           
           This plan involves quite a bit of movement for `v12`. I must ensure each `move` action specifies the correct current and target configuration for `v12`.
           
           **Revised Plan Strategy:**
           1.  **Image objectives `v17`, `v20` (right side):**
               *   `v12` moves from `v13` to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17)` - let's call this `img_config_right`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v17`.
               *   Take image of `v17`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v20`.
               *   Take image of `v20`.
           2.  **Image objective `v18` (center-left):**
               *   `v12` moves from `img_config_right` to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18)` - let's call this `img_config_center_left`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v18`.
               *   Take image of `v18`.
           3.  **Image objective `v19` (far-left):**
               *   `v12` moves from `img_config_center_left` to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19)` - let's call this `img_config_far_left`.
               *   Calibrate `v10` for `v19`.
               *   Take image of `v19`.
           4.  **Send all images:**
               *   `v12` moves from `img_config_far_left` to `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9)` - let's call this `com_config`.
               *   Send all four images.
           5.  **Sample and analyze rock `v1` (type `v2` - far left):**
               *   `v12` moves from `com_config` to `(#o5 v12 #o2 v1)` - let's call this `sample_config_v1`.
               *   Sample `v1`.
               *   `v12` moves from `sample_config_v1` to `com_config`.
               *   Send analysis of `v1`.
               *   Drop `v1`.
           6.  **Sample and analyze rock `v5` (type `v6` - right side):**
               *   `v12` moves from `com_config` to `(#o5 v12 #o2 v5)` - let's call this `sample_config_v5`.
               *   Sample `v5`.
               *   `v12` moves from `sample_config_v5` to `com_config`.
               *   Send analysis of `v5`.
               *   Drop `v5`.
           7.  **Return `v12` to `v13`:**
               *   `v12` moves from `com_config` to `v13`.
           
           **Configuration Coordinates:**
           *   `img_config_right` (for `v17`, `v20`): Let's use `(1.0, 0.5, 1.57)` (from `v13` (1.0, -1.75), turning to face +y, a bit forward, avoiding `v21`).
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v17)`: (1.0, 0.5, 1.57)
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v20)`: (1.0, 0.5, 1.57)
           *   `img_config_center_left` (for `v18`): `(-0.5, 0.5, 1.57)` (left of `v21`).
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v18)`: (-0.5, 0.5, 1.57)
           *   `img_config_far_left` (for `v19`): `(-1.8, 0.5, 1.57)` (further left).
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v19)`: (-1.8, 0.5, 1.57)
           *   `com_config` (for `v9`): `(-1.5, -1.8, 0.0)` (near lander, avoiding `v21`).
               *   `#o0` for `(v12, v9)`: (-1.5, -1.8, 0.0)
           *   `sample_config_v1` (for `v1`): `(-2.05, 0.2, 0.0)` (above `v1`, facing +x, avoiding `v21`).
               *   `#o5` for `(v12, v2, v1)`: (-2.05, 0.2, 0.0)
           *   `sample_config_v5` (for `v5`): `(0.94, -1.0, 0.0)` (above `v5`, facing +x, avoiding `v21`).
               *   `#o5` for `(v12, v6, v5)`: (0.94, -1.0, 0.0)
           
           All these chosen coordinates are outside the x=0.0 to x=0.05 range of `v21` for `x` coordinates.
           The `conf` objects with '#' (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) are associated with `v12`. `motion` objects `v12, current, #o2, target` are all available. `ray` objects (`#o1`, `#o4`) are also associated with `v12`.
           
           Let's ensure the configuration coordinates are reasonable for collision avoidance considering the rover's AABB. `v12` is ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)), center is (1.0, -1.75). Width/length around 0.36. So if x=0.0 is a wall, an x-coordinate of 0.1 means the left edge of the rover would be at 0.1-0.18 = -0.08, which still collides. So I need to keep the rover's AABB clear of `v21`. The AABB of `v21` is `(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0)` to `(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)`. This means it's a wall from x=-0.05 to x=0.05. So to avoid it, rover center should be |x| > 0.05 + rover_half_width (approx 0.18) = 0.23. So I should choose coordinates like x=0.25 or x=-0.25 to be safe from `v21`.
           
           Revising coordinates for collision avoidance with `v21`:
           *   `img_config_right`: `(0.5, 0.5, 1.57)` (x=0.5 > 0.23).
           *   `img_config_center_left`: `(-0.5, 0.5, 1.57)` (x=-0.5 < -0.23).
           *   `img_config_far_left`: `(-1.8, 0.5, 1.57)` (x=-1.8 < -0.23).
           *   `com_config`: `(-1.5, -1.8, 0.0)` (x=-1.5 < -0.23).
           *   `sample_config_v1`: `(-2.05, 0.2, 0.0)` (x=-2.05 < -0.23).
           *   `sample_config_v5`: `(0.94, -1.0, 0.0)` (x=0.94 > 0.23).
           
           These new coordinates should be collision-free with `v21`. They are also reachable from each other, and from the initial position `v13`.

Model:     The previous attempt failed due to collision with `v22` and reachability issues for many configurations, as well as a collision with the lander `v9` itself when trying to communicate. I need to be more careful with the exact bounding box of the rover and obstacles.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           *   `v21`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - thin wall at x=0.0.
           *   `v22`: AABB(lower=(0.36, 0.299), upper=(0.467, 0.406)) - a small obstacle around (0.4, 0.35).
           *   `v9` (lander): AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.34555], upper=[-1.3953, -1.65445]) - rover must not be inside this box for `comvisible`.
           
           **Rover `v12`'s AABB:** ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)). Center approx (1.0, -1.75). Half-width approx 0.183. Half-length approx 0.179.
           To avoid `v21` (x between -0.05 and 0.05), `v12`'s center x must be outside `(-0.05 - 0.183, 0.05 + 0.183)`, i.e., outside `(-0.233, 0.233)`. So, `x > 0.233` or `x < -0.233`.
           To avoid `v22` (x between 0.36 and 0.467, y between 0.299 and 0.406).
           
           Let's carefully choose configurations. Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           **Image Objectives (`#o3`):**

               *   Let's try `(-2.05, 0.2, 0.0)`. This was previously "not reachable". This needs careful attention. Reachability usually implies collision during movement or being out of bounds. The previous x=-2.05 was used for `sample_config_v1` and was said "not reachable". Rover initial position (1.0, -1.75). Moving to (-2.05, 0.2) from (1.0, -1.75) is a long path. Let's try to place it close to where the rover will be anyway for imaging far-left.
               *   If `v12` is at `(-2.0, 0.8)` for imaging `v19`, it's already quite close to `v1` (-2.05, 0.5).
               *   Let's define a new `#o5` close to `(-2.0, 0.8)` but `above` `v1`. Try `(-2.0, 0.4, 0.0)` for sampling `v1`.
                   *   Collision check for `(-2.0, 0.4, 0.0)`: x-range [-2.183, -1.817]. No obstacle collision.
               *   `#o5` for `(v12, v2, v1)`: `(-2.0, 0.4, 0.0)`.
           
           *   **`v5` (0.94, -0.8) (type `v6`):**
               *   From `v12`'s start (1.0, -1.75). `v5` is at (0.94, -0.8).
               *   A simple forward move is sufficient. Let's try `(1.0, -0.9, 0.0)`.
                   *   Collision check for `(1.0, -0.9, 0.0)`: x-range [0.817, 1.183]. No obstacle collision with `v21` or `v22`.
               *   `#o5` for `(v12, v6, v5)`: `(1.0, -0.9, 0.0)`.
           
           **Path and Reachability:**
           The sequence of moves for `v12` will be:
           `v13` (1.0, -1.75) -> `img_config_right` (0.8, 0.8) -> `img_config_center_left` (-0.6, 0.8) -> `img_config_far_left` (-2.0, 0.8) -> `com_config` (-1.0, -1.0) -> `sample_config_v1` (-2.0, 0.4) -> `com_config` (-1.0, -1.0) -> `sample_config_v5` (1.0, -0.9) -> `com_config` (-1.0, -1.0) -> `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           All these points are sufficiently far from `v21` and `v22` and each other to be reachable.
           
           The provided `motion` predicates in the initial state are for generic `#o2` trajectories between configurations:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o3)` (This can represent movement between different *continuous values* of `#o3`.)
           `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`
           `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`
           `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)`
           `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, v13)`
           
           This ensures that the symbolic moves in the plan `(move v12 from_conf #o2 to_conf)` are available.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The "not reachable" errors indicate that the pathfinding algorithm is struggling with the proposed coordinates, likely due to a combination of distance and potential implicit obstacles or narrow passages not explicitly described by AABBs but handled by the motion planner. The issue could also be due to the requested rotation.
           
           Let's simplify the strategy to minimize long-distance moves and try to pick locations closer to existing configurations or less extreme angles. Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142). The general area of operations for objectives is in the positive y direction (y > 0), and for communication/sampling rocks it's around the lower-left, close to `v9` or `v1` or `v5`.
           
           Since reachability is a consistent problem, let's consider using `v14` for some tasks if it helps with reachability, but the problem description implies `v14` is meant to stay `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           
           Let's try to choose configurations in relatively 'open' areas.
           A rover's AABB is `((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571))` for `v12`. Its width is ~0.366, length ~0.358.
           
           **Initial `v13` for `v12` is (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)**.
           **Lander `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0).**
           **Obstacles:**
           *   `v21`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) (wall at x=0).
           *   `v22`: AABB(lower=(0.36, 0.299), upper=(0.467, 0.406)) (small box at x=~0.4, y=~0.35).
           
           **Image Objectives (`#o3`):**
           Let's keep the facing direction consistent (e.g., facing generally towards positive y for objectives).
           *   **`v17` (1.8, 2.1) and `v20` (0.68, 1.8):** Both are generally to the right and forward.
               *   From `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Let's try to stay somewhat aligned in x with `v12`'s current position to minimize turning, or move straight.
               *   Proposed `#o3_17_20`: `(1.0, 0.0, 1.57)` (from `v13` (1.0, -1.75), move straight to y=0.0, face +y).
                   *   Dist to `v17` (1.8, 2.1) from (1.0, 0.0): sqrt((1.8-1.0)^2 + (2.1-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 2.1^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 4.41) = sqrt(5.05) ~ 2.25. **Too far!** Max range is 2.0.
               *   Need to move closer to the objectives.
               *   Let's try an x-coordinate closer to `v17` and `v20`, like x=1.5. And y=1.0 to get closer to objectives.
               *   Proposed `#o3_17_20`: `(1.5, 1.0, 1.57)`.
                   *   Dist to `v17` (1.8, 2.1) from (1.5, 1.0): sqrt((1.8-1.5)^2 + (2.1-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 1.1^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 1.21) = sqrt(1.3) ~ 1.14. OK.
                   *   Dist to `v20` (0.68, 1.8) from (1.5, 1.0): sqrt((0.68-1.5)^2 + (1.8-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.82)^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.6724 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.3124) ~ 1.14. OK.
                   *   Collision check: (1.5, 1.0). `v12`'s x-range [1.5-0.183, 1.5+0.183] = [1.317, 1.683]. y-range [1.0-0.179, 1.0+0.179] = [0.821, 1.179]. This is clear of `v21` and `v22`.
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v17)` and `(v12, v20)`: `(1.5, 1.0, 1.57)`. This is a long move from `v13`. Hopefully reachable.
           
           *   **`v18` (-0.4, 2.0):** Left of `v21`.
               *   Proposed `#o3_18`: `(-0.5, 1.0, 1.57)`.
                   *   Dist to `v18` (-0.4, 2.0) from (-0.5, 1.0): sqrt((-0.4-(-0.5))^2 + (2.0-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 1.0^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 1) = sqrt(1.01) ~ 1.0. OK.
                   *   Collision check: (-0.5, 1.0). `v12`'s x-range [-0.683, -0.317]. y-range [0.821, 1.179]. This is clear of `v21` and `v22`.
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v18)`: `(-0.5, 1.0, 1.57)`.
           
           *   **`v19` (-2.17, 2.18):** Further left.
               *   Proposed `#o3_19`: `(-2.0, 1.0, 1.57)`.
                   *   Dist to `v19` (-2.17, 2.18) from (-2.0, 1.0): sqrt((-2.17-(-2.0))^2 + (2.18-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.17)^2 + 1.18^2) = sqrt(0.0289 + 1.3924) = sqrt(1.4213) ~ 1.19. OK.
                   *   Collision check: (-2.0, 1.0). `v12`'s x-range [-2.183, -1.817]. y-range [0.821, 1.179]. This is clear of `v21` and `v22`.
               *   `#o3` for `(v12, v19)`: `(-2.0, 1.0, 1.57)`.
           
           **Communication (`#o0`):**
           *   **`v9` (lander) AABB:** lower=[-2.4047, -2.34555], upper=[-1.3953, -1.65445].
           *   The previous choice `(-1.0, -1.0)` was outside `v9`'s X range but inside `v9`'s Y range when considering rover dimensions.
           *   Need `v12` to be clear of `v9`'s AABB. Lander is centered around (-1.9, -2.0).
           *   Let's try a point that is more clearly outside `v9`. Say `(-1.0, -1.5)` (y=-1.5 is above the lander's max y).
           *   Proposed `#o0`: `(-1.0, -1.5, -1.57)` (facing generally south).
               *   Dist to `v9` (e.g., -1.9, -2.0) from (-1.0, -1.5): sqrt((-1.9-(-1.0))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.06) ~ 1.03. OK.
               *   Collision check: x=-1.0. `v12` x-range [-1.183, -0.817]. `v9` x-range [-2.4047, -1.3953]. No x overlap.
                   *   y=-1.5. `v12` y-range [-1.679, -1.321]. `v9` y-range [-2.34555, -1.65445]. No y overlap.
               *   `#o0` for `(v12, v9)`: `(-1.0, -1.5, -1.57)`.
           
           **Sampling (`#o5`):**
           *   **`v1` (-2.05, 0.5) (type `v2`):**
               *   Proposed `#o5_v1`: `(-2.0, 0.0, 0.0)` (above `v1`, facing +x).
                   *   Collision check: x=-2.0. `v12` x-range [-2.183, -1.817]. y-range [-0.179, 0.179]. Clear of obstacles.
               *   `#o5` for `(v12, v2, v1)`: `(-2.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           *   **`v5` (0.94, -0.8) (type `v6`):**
               *   Proposed `#o5_v5`: `(1.0, -0.5, 0.0)` (above `v5`, facing +x).
                   *   Collision check: x=1.0. `v12` x-range [0.817, 1.183]. y-range [-0.679, -0.321]. Clear of obstacles.
               *   `#o5` for `(v12, v6, v5)`: `(1.0, -0.5, 0.0)`.
           
           These coordinates seem more robustly collision-free. The issue of "not reachable for robot base" is tricky as it's an internal motion planner issue. I've tried to ensure:
           1.  Clearance from `v21` and `v22`.
           2.  Clearance from `v9` (lander).
           3.  All points are within the map bounds.
           4.  Distances are within range.
           5.  Movement between points is plausible (e.g., not requiring going through an obstacle or extremely sharp turns in confined spaces).
           
           Let's maintain the same plan sequence as before.

(Thoughts: **Navigating Reachability in a Constrained Environment**
           
           The "not reachable" errors are still plaguing me, and it's frustrating. It suggests something's fundamentally wrong with the path planning, possibly due to unseen environmental constraints or misinterpretations of what "reachable" means for the robot. Given the collision-free nature of my suggested coordinates according to the provided AABBs, I'm compelled to consider the following:
           
           1.  **Implicit Limits:** The task might be confined to a smaller region or have hidden boundaries for the rovers.
           2.  **Kinematic Constraints:** The robot might have a tight turning radius, which could be an issue.
           3.  **Elevation:** Although AABBs are in 3D, our input coordinates are in 2D and may not account for terrain changes.
           4.  **Planner Sensitivity:** Even small changes might result in "not reachable".
           
           So I must re-examine the rover's initial position and targets, in the hope of generating movement plans which are easily understood by the PDDL planner.
           
           The goal involves the rovers, imaging, and analysis tasks. Given that `v14` cannot move, all tasks must be carried out by `v12`. I must carefully evaluate `v12`'s `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) position.
           
           The challenge is to find valid configurations for the imaging and communication/sampling tasks.
           
           To achieve that, I will attempt to set configurations as close to possible, within range, so the rover can make small moves, while making all targets visible for imaging and within reach for communication and sampling. I'll make sure there are no other potential obstacles that the initial environment description did not include. The fact that motion predicates exist must mean that trajectories can be found and I should focus on the appropriate coordinates.
           
           I need to focus on reachability:
           *   I can't cover all goals in one configuration due to range constraints.
           *   The "not reachable" issue might stem from attempts to cross implicit regions or because moves are too long.
           *   I should simplify the path and keep the actions short, even though that goes against the intention of a move action in a PDDL plan.
           
           I have decided to create plans with the following structure:
           1.  Sample `v5` (nearby) - move, sample
           2.  Move to `#o0` (comm) - sample to drop
           3.  Sample `v1` (far away) - move to sample
           4.  Move to `#o0` (comm)
           5.  Move to all image targets.
           6.  Move to `#o0` (comm)
           7.  Return to `v13`.
           
           The core problem, I believe, is due to the "motion" path planning. Some of the distances between configurations are "too" large for the planner. 
           I have re-thought the plan and will focus on keeping moves as short as possible to have "reachable" destinations. For that, the location of communication and sampling has to be carefully chosen.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy: Minimizing Unique Configurations & Simplifying Paths**
           
           I'm hitting persistent "not reachable" errors, suggesting a fundamental issue with pathfinding. I'm an expert, so I've meticulously checked for obvious collisions, but I suspect the problem lies in the motion planner itself.  Given the constraints, I need to simplify the plan as much as possible.
           
           I'm focused on two main considerations: 1)  Reducing the number of unique configurations (`#o` values) and 2) Minimizing long-distance moves across the problematic x=0 axis (where the vertical wall, `v21`, is located).
           
           My initial analysis of the environment (rover dimensions, obstacles, and initial/target configurations) revealed the following:
           
           *   The goal requires a complex set of actions, including sampling rocks, imaging targets, and communication, all while navigating a constrained space.
           *   The "not reachable" errors consistently point to difficulties in reaching specific locations, especially those that involve crossing the x=0 line.
           *   The placement of the rover at start and end for `v12` is near the bottom-right and returning there.
           
           **Key Findings & Solutions:**
           
           *   I've carefully selected rover center (x, y) coordinates for specific tasks. I've ensured rover's right side is outside x = 0.05 and x < -0.05. I also ensured rover avoids `v22` (x: [0.36, 0.467] and y: [0.299, 0.406]). These coordinate values are designed to be reachable and avoid collisions.
           *   I've selected orientations that are appropriate for a simple path and clear observations.
           
           **The plan:**
           
           1.  **Sample `v5`:** From initial (1.0, -1.75), move to (0.95, -0.85, 3.142) for sampling.
           2.  **Image `v17` & `v20`:** From `v5` sample point, move to (0.7, 0.5, 1.57) to image top objectives.
           3.  **Image `v18`:** From `v17, v20` point, move to (-0.5, 0.5, 1.57) for imaging middle-left.
           4.  **Image `v19`:** From `v18` point, move to (-2.0, 0.5, 1.57) for imaging top-left.
           5.  **Communicate with `v9`:** From the imaging point for `v19`, move to (-1.0, -1.7, 0.0) for communication.
           6.  **Sample `v1`:** From `v9` point, move to (-2.05, 0.4, 0.0) to sample middle-left.
           
           This path minimizes the moves required across the x=0 axis. The key is in carefully choosing each coordinate. I will run the plan with the given coordinates.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Repositioning for Rover Reachability**
           
           Okay, so the "not reachable" errors are still haunting me, and now I've got this pesky `v23` obstacle to navigate on the right side of the map. It's becoming increasingly clear that the environment is more complex than just the obvious AABB obstacles.  My priority is to ensure these rover configurations are not just obstacle-free, but also placed in open spaces to give the motion planner a fighting chance.
           
           I've got Rover `v12` starting at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) and, as always, I need to keep the rover's dimensions in mind: half-width ~0.183, half-length ~0.179.
           
           **The Obstacle Landscape:**
           
           *   `v21`: That pesky wall at x=0.0 that I need to keep at least 0.233 away from.
           *   `v22`: That small box around x=0.4, y=0.35.
           *   `v23`:  And another small box at x=0.78, y=0.31 that I've got to avoid.
           *   `v9`: The lander down in the bottom-left corner.
           
           **Targeting the Objectives:**
           
           *   Objectives: `v17` (1.8, 2.1), `v18` (-0.4, 2.0), `v19` (-2.17, 2.18), `v20` (0.68, 1.8), max imaging range of 2.0m.
           *   Rocks and Soil:  `v1` (-2.05, 0.5), `v5` (0.94, -0.8).
           *   Lander: `v9` (~-1.9, -2.0) with a max comm range of 4.0m.
           
           **My Reachability Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Smart Grouping:**  Keep actions grouped in the same map area to cut down on long-distance moves.
           2.  **Extra Clearance:**  Keep the rover's center further from any obstacles than the minimum requirement.
           3.  **Simple Orientations:** Stick to these easier angles: (0.0, 1.57, 3.14, -1.57) to simplify things.
           4.  **Proximity Advantage:** Favor positions near `v12`'s starting position, as long as visibility/comm are maintained.
           
           **The Plan: Prioritize and Optimize**
           
           My revised plan is to image all objectives first, then communicate, sample, and return home. This minimizes the back and forth needed for communications.
           
           1.  Image all objectives.
           2.  Communicate all images.
           3.  Sample `v5`, send analysis, drop.
           4.  Sample `v1`, send analysis, drop.
           5.  Return home.
           
           **Configuration Details**
           
           *   **Imaging Config `#o3`:**
               *   I'll aim the rover at an angle of 1.57 for the north-facing objectives.
               *   I'll need to work out the positions for visibility while clearing the obstacles, especially boxes `v22` and `v23`.
               *   My math confirms the rover `(1.5, 0.6, 1.57)` is the preferred position for `v17` and `v20` images as I avoid collision.
               *   My calculations confirms the rover `(-0.6, 0.6, 1.57)` is the preferred position for `v18` image as I avoid collision.
               *   My calculations confirms the rover `(-2.0, 0.6, 1.57)` is the preferred position for `v19` image as I avoid collision.
           *   **Communication Config `#o0`:**
               *   I'll position the rover near the lander. The location `(-1.0, -1.0, 0.0)` is good to ensure successful comms.
           *   **Sampling Config `#o5`:**
               *   I'll need to figure out the right positions for sampling.
               *   For `v1`, I think `(-2.0, 0.2, 0.0)` is good.
               *   For `v5`, I think `(1.0, -0.5, 0.0)` is good.

           **Configuration Details**
           
           *   **Imaging Config `#o3`:**
               *   I'll aim the rover at an angle of 1.57 for the north-facing objectives.
               *   I'll need to work out the positions for visibility while clearing the obstacles, especially boxes `v22` and `v23`.
               *   My math confirms the rover `(1.5, 0.6, 1.57)` is the preferred position for `v17` and `v20` images as I avoid collision.
               *   My calculations confirms the rover `(-0.6, 0.6, 1.57)` is the preferred position for `v18` image as I avoid collision.
               *   My calculations confirms the rover `(-2.0, 0.6, 1.57)` is the preferred position for `v19` image as I avoid collision.
           *   **Communication Config `#o0`:**
               *   I'll position the rover near the lander. The location `(-1.0, -1.0, 0.0)` is good to ensure successful comms.
           *   **Sampling Config `#o5`:**
               *   I'll need to figure out the right positions for sampling.
               *   For `v1`, I think `(-2.0, 0.2, 0.0)` is good.
               *   For `v5`, I think `(1.0, -0.5, 0.0)` is good.
