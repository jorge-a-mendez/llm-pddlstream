           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal with several predicates. The critical ones I see are achieving four images and analyzing rocks, both stone and soil.  I've verified that the rovers are at their starting configurations and have free storage. The challenge lies in reaching the objectives for image capture and analysis.
           
           **Obstacles: Limited Rover Mobility and the `sample_rock` Action**
           
           The core of the problem stems from limited rover mobility. I've noted that `sample_rock` requires the rover to be *above* a rock. However, the available `move` actions restrict rover movement. The only permitted actions are self-loops: moving a rover to *its current configuration* using a useless trajectory. No actions are provided to move the rovers to configurations that allow the `sample_rock` operation, such as the initial state configuration where the rovers are already above the rocks (`#o5`).
           
           **Reaching an Unachievable State**
           
           I've examined `sample_rock` in detail. It requires: a rover *above* a rock, a store, the rover's *current configuration* must be at a particular location, and the store must be free.  With the current restrictions, the rovers are stuck at their initial configurations (v13 or v15). I've reviewed the explicit restrictions on '#' objects and configurations, and the `move` actions only allow them to return to the *same* initial state. Because of this, it is impossible for the rovers to satisfy the `atconf` condition for `sample_rock` action in any scenario. Thus, I won't be able to achieve the desired state of `receivedanalysis` due to the constraint on the available `move` actions.
           
           **Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Since I cannot achieve `sample_rock`, I cannot get `analyzed`. This means I cannot execute `send_analysis`. Consequently, I cannot reach the `receivedanalysis` predicates required for the goal. Because of the restrictions on mobility, I will not be able to achieve the state, `new-axiom@0()`.
