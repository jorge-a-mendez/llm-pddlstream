           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down how I'm tackling this placement problem.**  My primary objective is to find 50 stable positions for an object (ID 5) with dimensions of approximately 0.0759 x 0.0759, on a square surface (Surface 0) that spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A "placement" is defined by a surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates representing the center of the object's bounding box. Stability means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is completely within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object is a square, determining its AABB size based on the rotation is key. When theta is 0 or multiples of pi/2, the AABB is simply the object's original dimensions (0.0759 x 0.0759). However, rotation changes the effective AABB dimensions. The new AABB's width and height will change based on how the object is rotated (theta). For this square, I calculate the rotated effective width based on this formula: `w_eff = w * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`, where `w` is the object's original side length.
           
           The effective width is maximized when theta is pi/4 (45 degrees), resulting in a width of approximately 0.10738. This is the bounding box's biggest size. At 0 degrees, the width is the original, 0.0759.
           
           Now I need to consider the surface bounds.  I've defined functions to calculate the range of valid x and y coordinates given any rotation angle, using the effective width and height.  For each rotation, this gives me the valid area to center the object. I create a grid-like placement strategy that varies both theta and the x, y positions within this valid range.
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid for five different rotation values (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2).  For each rotation, I'll systematically create a 3x3 grid of positions, giving me 9 placements for each rotation.  This ensures an even distribution across the valid surface area for each rotation, and gives 45 placements (5 * 9). To get the remaining 5 placements, I'll utilize a few different angles, like pi/10, pi/6, 2*pi/5, and so on. For these remaining 5 placements, I will just center the object at (0,0), and it should be valid since the center will always stay within the bounding box of a square.
           
           The key is combining rotation and translation to cover the available space while ensuring that all placements are stable.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 7 Safely**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that Object 5 (a ~0.075x0.075 unit square) is successfully placed on surface 0, centered at approximately (-0.097, -0.097) with no rotation. Now, I need to place Object 7 (a ~0.093x0.093 square) on the same surface, which has extents of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), but crucially, I must *avoid collisions* with the existing Object 5.
           
           First, I calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of Object 5, which, given its lack of rotation, is straightforward. It takes up a region of approximately [-0.135, -0.059] x [-0.135, -0.059]. Object 5 is located in the bottom left corner of the surface.
           
           To place Object 7, I'll generate diverse placements by changing the rotation angle and then the center location. For any rotation, the *effective* width and height of the bounding box will change (due to the square's geometry), so I need to account for that. The max size is achieved at a 45-degree angle.
           
           My approach:
           1.  Try various rotations (`theta` values), ensuring they are diverse.
           2.  For each `theta`, calculate the effective width and height of Object 7.
           3.  Calculate the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates of Object 7, based on surface boundaries.
           4.  The center should not overlap Object 5. Create a check for the overlapping AABBs. If any placements do overlap the two objects, I'll skip it.
           
           To do this efficiently, I can create a grid of points within the valid ranges, and then check those points to ensure that they don't overlap. Since Object 5 is in the bottom-left corner of the surface, generating points starting from the upper area and going downwards should improve the process by quickly rejecting collision placements. A total of 50 non-colliding points are needed.
           
           I'll iterate through a set of angles, then create a 5x5 grid for each, which will result in 375 starting positions. I'll make sure to get 50 different locations, so any remaining places are filled up by central locations with unique angles. With this approach, I can ensure that Object 7 is correctly placed, without any clashes.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out 50 stable locations for object 4 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with existing objects. Object 4 is basically a square with dimensions of roughly 0.093 by 0.093, and surface 0 is a square area from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The trouble is, there are already two objects on the surface: object 5 in the bottom-left corner and object 7 in the top-right. I have their positions, dimensions, and rotations to calculate their bounding boxes. Object 5's AABB is roughly [-0.135, -0.059] x [-0.135, -0.059], and object 7's is [0.041, 0.135] x [0.041, 0.135].
           
           My plan is to iterate through different rotations of object 4, calculate the effective bounding box for each rotation, and then find valid center points within surface 0 that don't collide with the existing objects.
           
           I'm starting with a few rotations: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2 (and so on). For each rotation, I'll calculate the new "effective" width and height of the object. Then, I'll figure out the valid range of center points within the surface, taking into account the object's dimensions and the two existing objects.
           
           To do this, I will create x and y ranges. I will then make a 10x10 grid of center points, checking each one.  For each center point, I will calculate object 4's bounding box and check it against the bounding boxes of object 5 and object 7 to see if there is any overlap. This AABB check has to make sure that the bounding box of Object 4 doesn't have an x and y overlap in each respective axis with the existing objects.
           
           If a potential center point is collision-free and surface-contained, I will add it to the list of possible placements. I will continue generating potential placement locations until I've found 50 valid ones.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on a surface (surface 0). The object is roughly 0.0975 units wide and tall. The surface is a 0.27-unit square. Three other objects are already placed, acting as obstacles: object 5 (a small square in the bottom-left), object 7 (a medium square in the top-right), and object 4 (a medium square roughly center-left).
           
           My main challenge is to find space for the new object. Object 6 is roughly the same size as two of the fixed objects, making the available surface area increasingly difficult to divide. I have to avoid collisions. I am thinking to use a grid search to explore possible x- and y-coordinates for the new object. I'll need to calculate the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) at different rotation angles. I need to take into consideration the available area, so I'll also start with calculating the ranges where the center of the object can be validly placed.
           
           I’ll explore rotations of the object. For each rotation, I will generate a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for the center of the object. I'll focus on the bottom-right and top-left corners of the surface, avoiding the regions already occupied by other objects. I'll carefully check for collisions with the existing objects for each candidate position. The existing objects' AABBs are: obj5 [-0.135, -0.059]x[-0.135, -0.059], obj7 [0.0416, 0.135]x[0.0416, 0.135] and obj4 [-0.0563, 0.0367]x[-0.0367, 0.0563].
           
           Since space is at a premium, I’ll need a fine-grained search. The valid placement of the new object can be very precisely at the edge of other objects' AABBs, so I have to verify with floating point precision. With finer grid, I can detect the available space to satisfy the 50 unique placement requirement. I'll start with placing the new object near the bottom-right corner, given that it's the largest area available, and gradually add the other points to meet the placement requirement.
