(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Candidate Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for finding three good robot base positions around the target point, given the constraints.  The target is at `(0.4005, 0.4043)`.
           
           1.  **Define the Area:** I need positions within a circle of radius 2 (max range) centered on the target, and within the `[-2.5, 2.5]` x and y boundaries.  The target is right in the middle, so this isn't an issue.
           
           2.  **Obstacle Awareness:** I've carefully analyzed the AABBs. I'm especially concerned about the wall at x=0 (AABB 5), because it effectively divides the area.  Since the target is to the right, ideally the robots should also be to the right to maintain line-of-sight. There are also a lot of small obstacles, so I need to check for those.
           
           3.  **Candidate Generation:** I'm going to space out the candidates evenly around the target, and I need three. I'll test at a radius of 1.5. This should give me diversity.
           
           4.  **Collision and LOS Heuristics:**  For each candidate `(px, py)`:
               *   **Inside Check:**  Make sure the candidate position isn't within any AABB.
               *   **LOS Check:** Make sure the line of sight from the candidate to the target doesn't intersect any AABB. I'll do this heuristically because it's a bit involved, with a more simple bounding box check to begin.
               *   **Size Factor:**  I'll assume I get a binary pass/fail from collision checking.
           
           5.  **Candidate Selection**
               *   Directly to the right: P1 is (1.9005, 0.4043)
               *   Bottom-Right: P2 is (1.1505, -0.8947)
               *   Top-Right: P3 is (1.1505, 1.7033)
           
           After considering the geometry, those look like they should work.  They avoid the main obstacles, are on the same side of the x=0 wall, and are evenly spaced around the target.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Target Occlusion and Position Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I'm trying to figure out the best places to position the robot so it can "see" a target point located at `(0.5239, 1.8611)`. The problem is, this target appears to be inside two of the fixed obstacles, AABB 9 and AABB 20.  This is a huge problem because the standard logic I've been using (line of sight = no segment-obstacle intersections) will *always* fail in this case.  It's like trying to see something inside a box without being inside the box yourself!
           
           My previous attempts (positions like `(1.9, 0.4)` and `(1.15, -0.89)`) were far away and, as expected, were blocked by obstacles. A position at `(1.15, 1.70)` had the robot touching AABB 9 and was marked as "not reachable", so it seemed a good idea to stay clear of these obstacles.
           
           I've been given feedback that the target point is the same, so I have to come up with a solution. I am considering a solution that relies on the "fixed obstacles" statement.
           
           I've got a robot radius of 0.05 units.  To be "collision-free," the robot's center has to be at least this far away from the edges of any obstacle.
           
           **The key issue:**  If the target is *truly* inside these obstacles, standard line-of-sight checks will *always* fail. It seems I have to propose the unusual, and that 9 and 20 are *special*.
           
           **My Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Assume 'Transparency':** I'm going to *assume* for the line of sight for *this specific target* (contained within 9 and 20) is that AABB 9 and 20 act like they're "transparent" *to the target contained within*. If this weren't true, finding a valid position would be impossible. If the robot's line segment to the target avoids all other obstacles, it will have line of sight.
           
           2.  **Position Selection:**
               *   **P1:**  `(0.85, 1.65)`.  This position is below and to the right of the target.
               *   **P2:**  `(0.85, 2.35)`.  This is above and to the right.
               *   **P3:**  `(0.15, 1.65)`. This will be to the left and below.
           
           These positions are all collision-free and they should only intersect with AABB 9 and 20, given the nature of the target. These positions are "safe" and should have LOS.
           
           I am forced to make this hypothesis due to the impossibility of a standard line of sight in the described scenario, and the requirement in the prompt to attempt a new position. I am presenting this answer with the assumption that this may solve the problem.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Proposed Solutions for New Target Point**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new target point: `(-1.8912, 2.1241)`.  The system's been very specific about collision detection with the robot's physical size, which I've determined is a radius of 0.1, and that's critical. I'm taking the previous feedback to heart about the inclusive collision check: if the robot's boundary overlaps the AABB, it's a collision. I've re-evaluated all the old positions, and confirmed that radius. I need to find positions that are clear of these obstacles.
           
           This new target is *inside* an obstacle, specifically AABB 8 and AABB 22.  That's a bit problematic, but I will operate with the implicit assumption about the system's "LOS" calculation. I'm *assuming* it might allow LOS even if the target is technically within the AABB. So, I will avoid collisions by considering the robot's radius of 0.1 to define the boundaries.
           
           For this new target, I've identified several constraints. The robot can't be too close to the left wall (AABB 4) to avoid collision, and it also can't be too high or low to clear the walls. Given the target's location, and AABB 8's bounds, I've got a fairly limited area where I can place the robot:
           
           1.  To the right of AABB 8.
           2.  Below AABB 8.
           
           I can't put the robot to the left, as the wall on the left blocks all available paths.
           
           So, I'm proposing these three positions for a valid solution, to get a good range around the target:
           
           1.  **P1:**  (-1.5, 2.1) - This position is to the *right* of AABB 8.
           2.  **P2:** (-1.8912, 1.6) - It places the robot *below* AABB 8.
           3.  **P3:** (-1.6, 1.6) - A third position that is bottom right of AABB8.
           
           I've carefully checked all three of these positions. I've been very careful to ensure they do not collide. The distance checks are well below the limit, as expected, because I've placed the robot in cleared locations nearby. I am confident that these positions are valid and represent safe starting points for movement.

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **My Current Strategy for Reaching the Target**
           
           After analyzing the past failures and the new target point, I've developed a clear strategy. My primary insights are: (1) The robot's effective radius, *r<sub>r</sub>*, is 0.1, a value that helps me account for collisions with the rectangular obstacles, or AABBs. This value is key in determining valid positions. (2) The line-of-sight (LOS) is only valid if the line segment from the robot to the target does not intersect with any other obstacle, even if the target itself is within the boundary of an obstacle. I'm assuming that the obstacles are collision zones only.
           
           With these principles, I'm working to solve the problem where the target is inside an obstacle. I've designed three possible positions for the robot around the containing AABB obstacle: one to the left, one above, and one below. These options are 0.1 units away from the obstacles and world boundaries.
           
           *   **P1 = (1.6, 1.8)**: To the left.
           *   **P2 = (2.0, 2.3)**: Above.
           *   **P3 = (2.0, 1.6)**: Below.
           
           These positions should work, and they will be tested now.
