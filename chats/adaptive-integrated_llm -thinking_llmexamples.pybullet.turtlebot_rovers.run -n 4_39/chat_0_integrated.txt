           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Goal Unachievable**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unattainable within the provided constraints.  Let's break down why.  The `new-axiom@0()` axiom expands to several subgoals, including receiving images of four objectives and receiving analyses of stone and soil samples.
           
           To achieve image reception, I need to send images using `send_image`.  That action requires having an image (`haveimage`) and being in communication range (`comvisible`).  To get `haveimage`, I would need to take an image using `take_image`, which requires calibration (`calibrated`) and visibility (`imagevisible`) at my current configuration.  To get `analyzed`, I would need to sample the rock which requires that I be *above* the rock. All these actions are *conditional* upon preconditions like `comvisible`, `imagevisible` and `above`. Crucially, these predicates link to configuration parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           The key issue is that the given *actions* severely limit the rover's ability to change their position or configure themselves for these required operations.  I only have `move` actions which are essentially self-loops (they do not change configuration), and `drop_rock` actions (which require rocks I can't currently acquire).  The initial state provides many "objective" and "type" facts, and the various visibility and range predicates are defined. The fact that the rovers are locked to `v13` and `v15`, and the other operations are linked to the `#o` configurations (which are not `v13` or `v15`), prevents the formation of the necessary preconditions to perform `take_image` or `sample_rock`.
           
           Since I'm restricted to only the provided actions, and since those actions cannot modify the state in a way that allows the required visibility or range conditions to be met, the goal, as it currently stands, is unreachable.
