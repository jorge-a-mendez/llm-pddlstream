           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  I see that this goal translates to nine individual conditions that need to be true.  I quickly notice that four of these conditions, specifically about the rover's configuration and free store slots, are already satisfied in the initial state.  That leaves me with five more conditions to satisfy: getting three images (`receivedimage`), analyzing a rock of type `v2` and a soil sample of type `v6`.
           
           I then meticulously go through the available objects, modes, and their types to better understand the domain.  Based on my knowledge, I can see that achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates requires specific actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  However, I'm constrained: I can *only* use the actions in the provided list.
           
           The provided action instances are limited to `move` (which does nothing useful) and `drop_rock` (which won't help in the current state). I've reviewed the preconditions for each crucial action like `take_image` and `send_analysis` and their reliance on intermediate states like `haveimage` and `analyzed`. I know from experience that in this setup, the restricted action set makes the plan unreachable. The problem explicitly states that any action *not* in the list is prohibited. Thus, the crucial actions needed to satisfy those 5 missing conditions are not available. This directly leads to an unachievable goal. I'm confident my conclusion is correct.
