(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, while keeping in mind I'm dealing with a nearly square object. The key is to understand the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and how it changes with rotation.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid region for the object's center. Given the surface bounds and the object's dimensions (0.0977 x 0.0977), I calculated the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates where the object's center can be. This range shrinks as the rotation angle increases because the effective dimensions of the rotated object will always have maximum dimensions at the 45 degree angle.
           
           I then identified critical rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8 and pi/2. The AABB shape is effectively repeated every pi/2 for this almost-square object, but the specific angle needs to be recorded, so I used an additional group of rotations. At each of those angles, I'll spread out the object's center across a grid within the valid region.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll build a systematic approach. With the theta values, I'll calculate the valid x and y range with this python code:
           
           ```python
           import math
           
           object_w = 0.0977066407060902
           object_h = 0.09770664070609014
           surf_lx, surf_ly = -0.135, -0.135
           surf_ux, surf_uy = 0.135, 0.135
           
           def get_valid_xy_range(theta):
               cos_theta = abs(math.cos(theta))
               sin_theta = abs(math.sin(theta))
               
               half_width_rotated = (object_w * cos_theta + object_h * sin_theta) / 2
               half_height_rotated = (object_w * sin_theta + object_h * cos_theta) / 2
               
               x_min = surf_lx + half_width_rotated
               x_max = surf_ux - half_width_rotated
               y_min = surf_ly + half_height_rotated
               y_max = surf_uy - half_height_rotated
               
               return (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
           ```
           
           Then I'll generate the grid with the x and y ranges.
           
           After generating these placements, I will test the additional angles.
           
           With this strategy, I should be able to generate diverse, stable placements across the surface and rotations to fulfill the task.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Comprehensive Approach**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 5) onto a surface, right next to another object (ID 4) that's already in place. The surface is a square, and I need to make sure the new object doesn't collide with the existing one. Stability is key, so everything has to fit neatly within the surface.
           
           First, I need to get my bearings. I've got the dimensions of both objects, and I know where object 4 is positioned. I'll start by defining the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for object 4. This will give me the boundaries of the space it occupies. I need to figure out the exact coordinates of object 4's AABB.
           
           Now, for object 5. The key is to find 50 valid placements. To get the object to fit, I need to find the best angle for object 5. For each angle, I need to do the following:
           1. I calculate the new object's effective dimensions based on the new angle, which means calculating a rotated AABB for each.
           2. The dimensions are calculated by using the formula for area. Since the object is perfectly square, `W_rot` is always the same as `H_rot`.
           3. With the new dimensions, I can now calculate the valid ranges for the object's center point. This ensures object 5 stays within the surface area.
           
           Now, the collision check. I’ll make sure the position does not overlap with the AABB of object 4. I need to make sure I don't get any collision. I generate a bunch of potential placements using a 3x3 grid, for example. I check each one to see if it collides. If it does, I'll need to filter the placements.
           
           Since I am targeting 50 unique placements. I can get these placements easily if I rotate the object with the strategy of generating the valid space by checking for collisions as described. I know I will get more than enough.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a square object (Object 6) on a surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with two existing objects (Object 4 and Object 5) which are already in place. My goal is to maximize the space utilization without conflicts.
           
           Here's my strategy:
           
           1.  **Understand the Constraints:** I'm dealing with a square object, which means that any rotation will change its effective width and height. I need to calculate the bounding box (AABB) of the rotated object to check for collisions, and I will use the formula `W_rot = H_rot = size_x6 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           2.  **Calculate the Free Space:** Based on Object 4's bottom-left and Object 5's top-right positions, there are roughly two key regions: one in the top-left area and the other in the bottom-right of the surface's available space. I will need to focus on points that avoid both Object 4 (in the bottom-left) and Object 5 (in the top-right).
           3.  **Rotation and Collision Avoidance:** I'll iterate through a range of rotation angles (theta) in small intervals. For each angle, I'll calculate the new `x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max` boundaries using the half_W, half_H values and calculate the effective AABB (the rectangle that encloses the rotated object).
           4.  **Strategic Placement:** I need to find the right amount of `x` and `y` coordinates for object 6, given the range of the surface and its angle.
           5.  **Placement Algorithm:**
               *   Iterate through rotation angles from 0 to 2\*pi.
               *   For each angle:
                   *   Compute the rotated width and height, and determine the x and y limits for object center positions.
                   *   Generate coordinates for object center placements by calculating a grid within the surface boundaries.
                   *   For each placement:
                       *   Calculate the object's AABB.
                       *   Check the AABB against Object 4's and Object 5's AABBs for collision.
                       *   If no collision, add this placement to my candidate list.
           
           This approach should efficiently generate a diverse set of collision-free placements, ensuring I find 50 stable positions, accounting for the effect of rotation.
