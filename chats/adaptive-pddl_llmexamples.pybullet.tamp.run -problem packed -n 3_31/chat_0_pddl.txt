           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v14) currently at specific poses on an unknown surface (v11). The robot has two arms (v4, v6) and is at a base configuration (v3). The goal is to move all three objects (v8, v12, v14) onto another surface (v16).
           
           The provided initial state shows that objects v8, v12, and v14 are currently at `atpose` v9, v13, and v15 respectively. They are supported by v11. The goal is to have them `on` v16, which means `atpose` on v16. However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the robot's base from v3 to v3 (effectively not moving) and doesn't involve any manipulation of objects. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, which are necessary to move objects. Without these manipulation actions, the robot cannot pick up v8, v12, or v14 from v11 and place them on v16. Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the given available actions.
