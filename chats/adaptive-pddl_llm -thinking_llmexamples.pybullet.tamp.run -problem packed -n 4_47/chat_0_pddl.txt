           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Restrictions**
           
           My initial thought is that this task is impossible to complete. The objective is clear: to move four specific objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto a designated surface (v18).  My analysis of the "on" predicate and the supporting "supported" and "atpose" predicates confirms that achieving the goal requires physically changing the location of these objects. I recognized that this would necessitate using 'pick' and 'place' actions.
           
           The problem, as I see it, lies in the constraints imposed by the problem statement. I'm given a very specific list of "valid action instances." It includes only one action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The task's instructions clearly state that *only* actions on this list are permitted.
           
           Given my understanding of how the actions are defined, and specifically how `pick` and `place` manipulate the "on" relation, I concluded that since the `move_base` instance has no effect on these relations, the task is unsolvable.  The sole action instance moves the base, and has no capacity to perform the required object manipulation.
           
           I re-examined the question, trying to find an alternative way to interpret the rules.  I've considered all possible implicit interpretations of the phrasing of "action instances". But, each attempt reaffirms the conclusion: The explicit list of action instances is too restrictive to achieve the desired state.
