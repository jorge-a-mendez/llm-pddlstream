           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: Insufficient Action Instances**
           
           Okay, so the task is clear: get objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto v18.  The key here is understanding the `on` predicate and its reliance on the `atpose` of objects.  My initial assessment is straightforward:  I need to move each object from its current location (v11) to v18, which implies a series of `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           Checking the initial state, the objects are indeed on v11, as the `atpose` and `supported` facts indicate. The goal state, conversely, requires these same objects to be "on" v18.
           
           Here's the problem: I'm restricted to the *only* action instance provided: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This move_base action, according to its definition, does not alter the pose of any object and therefore cannot impact whether the object is on v18 or not.  It moves the base from position v3 to itself.
           
           The presence of `kin` predicates does suggest potential *for* picking and placing since the kins are specifying grasp positions etc, however the constraints on the problem statement are clear: I can't use an action instance unless it's given to me. And since *no* `pick` or `place` instances are listed, I'm stuck.
           
           Given only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I can't change any `atpose` facts, and thus I can't achieve the goal by manipulating the `on` predicate. I must state that the goal cannot be achieved within the problem definition.
