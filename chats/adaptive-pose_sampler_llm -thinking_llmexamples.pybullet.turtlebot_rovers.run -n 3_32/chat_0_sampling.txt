User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, the goal is to find three diverse, collision-free robot base positions (x, y) for a given target point within a maximum range of 2, considering fixed obstacles and overall arena limits. I'm focusing on providing solutions that are *not* blocked by the central vertical wall and are sufficiently diverse. I'll need to learn from the history if a second request is received for the same target and a previous position failed.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints and Arena Layout**
           
           The overall constraints are: robot base must be within `max_range = 2` of the target. Robot base (x, y) coordinates must be within the overall bounds: x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Additionally, the robot's orientation will automatically face the target, so I just need to determine the (x,y) location. The important obstacles are: a central wall (x = 0), and a scattering of other, smaller AABB obstacles.
           
           **Target Point and Search Space**
           
           The target is at (-1.0, -1.0). Based on the `max_range = 2` and the general x/y boundaries, I should consider robot positions within `[-2.5, 1.0]` for x and `[-2.5, 1.0]` for y.  I'm initially considering positions within that initial area, taking the fixed obstacles into account.
           
           **Obstacle Analysis and Refined Search Area**
           
           Given the central wall obstacle, robot positions on the right side of it will not be helpful (x > 0) with a target at (-1, -1), so I must refine the search. Therefore, I'm adjusting my effective search area to x: `[-2.5, -0.05]` and y: `[-2.5, 1.0]`.
           
           **Candidate Position Generation**
           
           I'm aiming to place positions along a circle of radius 1.5 centered on the target, since this range gives enough clearance. The following three positions should provide sufficient diversity:
           1.  **(-2.5, -1.0)** (to the left of the target)
           2.  **(-1.0, -2.5)** (below the target)
           3.  **(-2.061, 0.061)** (top-left of target)
           
           **Collision Checks and Validation**
           
           I have carefully checked for any collision with existing obstacles. I found that I should ensure the candidate robot locations are on the correct side of the wall with the target to ensure line of sight.
           
           **Final Solution**
           
           I will return the three positions as final answers: **(-2.5, -1.0), (-1.0, -2.5), (-2.061, 0.061)**

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Target and Obstacles**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback indicates I made a critical error in the previous iteration. I was working with an incorrect target point. Let's start with a clean slate, focusing on the target point explicitly provided in the feedback, now known to be `(-0.408, 1.913)`. I also have to respect the boundaries to stay *strictly* inside `x: (-2.45, 2.45)` and `y: (-2.45, 2.45)`.  The user's feedback confirms this, as I was colliding with walls when my coordinates approached or exceeded the boundaries.
           
           **Analyzing the Fixed Obstacles**
           
           I've re-examined the list of fixed obstacles in this environment to understand the "no line of sight" feedback and refine my strategy.  I am trying to find positions where the robot will be able to get close to the target point and avoid other *fixed* obstacles. The goal is no collisions, and to get in line of sight to view the object that contains the target `T = (-0.408, 1.913)`.
           
           The challenge is that the target point is embedded *within* two obstacles (10 and 19). Therefore, standard line-of-sight is impossible. I will treat the target as a object on an obstacle, meaning the goal is to get as close as possible without colliding with other obstacles, avoiding walls, and try to view the object it is on, instead.
           
           **Strategy for New Positions**
           
           Given the "target inside an obstacle" problem, the key is to aim for a position where I can get close to the containing obstacle without hitting something else first. Then, hopefully, I will also be positioned where the object on/in that obstacle may be viewed.  I am aiming for positions within the max range (`<= 2`) of the target to ensure they will satisfy the requirement.
           
           **Proposed Positions**
           
           Based on this strategy, I will use these points, all respecting the `(-2.45, 2.45)` bounding area and staying clear of the central wall:
           
           1.  `(-0.408, 0.413)`:  Directly *below* the target, at a distance of 1.5. This position is clear of all fixed obstacles. The path would intersect obstacle 10, but the target is *in* it.
           2.  `(-1.0, 1.0)`:  Further away, a distance of about 1.1, positioned to the left. Clear line of sight past the smaller obstacles. The path to the target will enter obstacle 10.
           3.  `(-0.2, 0.5)`:  Also within range at a distance of about 1.4, positioned right, below, and a bit closer to the central wall.  Clear of obstacles.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Candidate Positions for the New Target**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new target, `(0.455, 2.009)`, and I need to find a good spot for the robot base. Based on past failures, I've got to be extra careful about the arena boundaries (`x: [-2.5, 2.5]`, `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`), the 2-unit distance limit from the target, and especially that pesky central wall (`x = 0.05`).
           
           I've learned a few key lessons from those previous attempts, mainly regarding the central wall.  If the target is to the *right* of the wall, the robot *must* also be on the right side. And I need to watch out for those small, easy-to-miss obstacles.
           
           Now, the target itself is situated within some obstacles, so I will have to ensure line of sight is clear, by calculating from various viewpoints. I want to choose robot positions that are roughly 1.5 units away from the target to give me some breathing room.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           1.  **Directly Below the Target:** Place the robot base at `(0.455, 0.509)`. This keeps me right of the central wall, and at the 1.5-unit distance. Line of sight may be impacted by `Obstacle 13: ((0.4588, 1.1696), (0.5899, 1.3007))`. But my x-coordinate is `0.455` and not in the obstruction area, therefore this position is still valid.
           2.  **Below and to the Left of the Target:** Position the robot at `(0.1, 0.552)`. Still respecting the 0.05 central wall, this position keeps the distance 1.5. I calculate that this line of sight clears `Obstacle 13` as well, so that's good.
           3.  **Below and to the Right of the Target:** Position the robot at `(1.0, 0.612)`. Line of sight will not intersect other obstacles.
           
           I believe these three positions provide good options, and I will submit them for consideration.
