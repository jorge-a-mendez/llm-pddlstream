           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.107, 0.441), (0.19, 0.524)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, 0.373), (-0.192, 0.448)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.033, 0.235), (0.105, 0.307)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.099, 0.47), (-0.009, 0.559)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.228, 0.191), (-0.133, 0.286)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.148, 0.482, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.777, 0.629).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.229, 0.411, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.041).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.069, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.015).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.054, 0.515, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, 0.169).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.181, 0.239, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.856, 0.516).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan I've devised. The objective is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current positions on object v11 to a new surface, v20.  I need a sequence of robotic actions—specifically, "pick" and "place" actions—to accomplish this.
           
           Here's the setup: all the objects begin on v11, and the goal is to have each of them "on" v20. I'm also told that all objects are "stackable," which implies they're amenable to being placed on top of v20.
           
           The initial state provides the objects' current locations.  For example, v8 is at v9, supported by v11. We also have "kin" predicates that tell me which arm poses are able to pick up each object. There's also some initial base configuration atbconf(v3) and a canmove() predicate.
           
           I need a series of pick-and-place actions to achieve the goal. No move_base operations are necessary here because canmove() is already true initially and each pick/place action keeps it true. So, the process will be:
           
           1.  **Pick** an object from its current location.
           2.  **Place** the object onto v20 at a calculated pose.
           3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each object.
           
           The challenge is finding the right poses for placement on v20.  I must be certain that the objects are placed in a collision-free and stable manner. The initial state uses `#o2` as a placeholder for an arbitrary pose. I'll need to define five specific, unique poses for `#o2` (one for each object on v20).
           
           The initial state suggests that I'll need a different continuous value for `#o2` with each object. This means I'll need an absolute position of the objects. Given that I have already deduced the dimensions,  I'll place them on a 2x3 grid. Using the constraints, I will have all of them within an area where their support footprint lies within the boundries of surface v20. I have calculated five collision-free and stable positions for the objects on v20.
           
           I've determined the following absolute coordinates for object centers:
           
           *   v8: (0.00000, 0.00000, 0.78100, 0.00000)
           *   v12: (-0.04375, -0.04375, 0.78100, 0.00000)
           *   v14: (-0.04375, 0.04375, 0.78100, 0.00000)
           *   v16: (0.04375, -0.04375, 0.78100, 0.00000)
           *   v18: (0.04375, 0.04375, 0.78100, 0.00000)
           
           The plan, therefore, is to execute a sequence of five pick and place actions, one for each object and its corresponding target pose on v20. The arm will pick and place and `canmove()` is always true and no robot base motion is needed.
           
           I will also need to declare the values for `#o2`, which will be the position of the various objects. All the other continuous parameters (trajectories, grasps, base configuration, etc.) are already handled by the predicates.
           
           In summary, this plan ensures each object ends up in a valid, stable, and collision-free location on the target surface, adhering to all constraints.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the user's critique and they're absolutely right. My proposed plan is flawed. Apparently, the only allowed action here is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which, as I understand it, just means the base stays put.  It's effectively a no-op!
           
           The objective is to move objects *onto* surface `v20`.  That screams "pick" and "place" actions to me. But those action primitives aren't even *in* the allowed action set! Without the ability to pick up and put down objects, there's simply no way to achieve the goal state.  It's a straightforward deduction – the goal is unreachable given this ridiculously limited set of actions.  I need to go back and figure out what constraints *are* in place.
