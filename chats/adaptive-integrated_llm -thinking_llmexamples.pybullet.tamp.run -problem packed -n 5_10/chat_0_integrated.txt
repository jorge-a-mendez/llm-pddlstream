User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.107, 0.441), (0.19, 0.524)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, 0.373), (-0.192, 0.448)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.033, 0.235), (0.105, 0.307)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.099, 0.47), (-0.009, 0.559)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.228, 0.191), (-0.133, 0.286)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.148, 0.482, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.777, 0.629).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.229, 0.411, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.041).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.069, 0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.015).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.054, 0.515, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, 0.169).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.181, 0.239, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.856, 0.516).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Task: A Detailed Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to orchestrate a precise sequence of actions to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) currently resting on surface v11 to a new surface, v20. This will involve skillfully employing the `pick` and `place` actions, leveraging the robot's capabilities.
           
           The initial scenario presents a scene where all objects, with the exception of the surfaces v10 and v20, are situated on v11. Their positions are precisely defined:
           -   `atpose(v12, v13)` where `supported(v12, v13, v11)`
           -   `atpose(v18, v19)` where `supported(v18, v19, v11)`
           -   `atpose(v8, v9)` where `supported(v8, v9, v11)`
           -   `atpose(v14, v15)` where `supported(v14, v15, v11)`
           -   `atpose(v16, v17)` where `supported(v16, v17, v11)`
           
           The intended outcome is to position each object *on* surface v20.
           
           The robot has two arms at its disposal (v4 and v6), both presently unoccupied (`handempty`). Notably, a single `move_base` action is available, which indicates the robot does not need to move its base for this task.
           
           To accomplish this, I'll break down the action:
           1.  **Pick:** For instance, to pick v8, I'll need to use `kin` to make v8 be the object, using arm v4 or v6 to pick v8 from its current pose v9.
           2.  **Place:** The object will then be placed at an appropriate place pose on the v20 surface.  This pose must satisfy `supported(v8, ?p_new, v20)`.
           
           A key aspect of this planning will be to generate appropriate configurations to pick and place objects, along with the robot's trajectories for each move. All objects will use the `#o1` grasp, provided in the initial state.
           
           The core challenge will be ensuring the new placements on v20 don't cause collisions. To this end, I intend to carefully calculate the 2D locations of each object, within the bounding box of v20, considering their dimensions, surface constraints, and safety margins to ensure the success of the placement.
           
           The plan will be a sequence of pick and place operations where the robot's base remains stationary (as dictated by the move_base fact).
           
           Final check: Ensure all the object placements fit within the surface v20 and their dimensions, and collision avoidance rules are enforced within the action plan.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v18) , (place v4 v18 #o2_v18 #o1 v3 #t_place_v18) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v16) , (place v4 v16 #o2_v16 #o1 v3 #t_place_v16)`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Frustrating Dead-End**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's immediately clear we have a serious constraint here. The user has given me a ridiculously limited action space. All I have is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. And the goal? Place five objects, `v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18`, onto surface `v20`.
           
           The initial state reveals that those objects are currently chilling on `v11`, or at least their positions are defined by `atpose` facts.  To get those objects on `v20`, I would naturally want to use `supported` and `atpose`, understanding that 'on' is derived from those two. Which means, I *must* interact with each object individually!
           
           But here's the kicker: I have *no* pick-and-place actions! The valid action list is just the `move_base` thing. Absolutely no way to actually manipulate the objects. I can't pick, I can't place... I'm fundamentally hamstrung.
           
           Therefore, given *these* constraints, this goal is completely unattainable. It's a non-starter.  I'm basically staring at a brick wall.  Time to flag this and explain the utter impossibility of the situation.
