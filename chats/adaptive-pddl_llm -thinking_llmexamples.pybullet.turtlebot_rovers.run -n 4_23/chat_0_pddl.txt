           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Planning for `new-axiom@0()` Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal defined by `new-axiom@0()`. This involves several key steps related to image acquisition, analysis, and communication, with a focus on specific conditions at the end. I need to ensure rovers `v12` and `v14` are "free" (presumably meaning their storage is empty) and in their starting configurations, images are received and analysis are completed.
           
           First, I examined the `new-axiom@0()` to identify the sub-goals. Four `receivedimage` predicates (for images from `v17, v18, v19, v20`) need to be satisfied and the analysis of two specific objects (one stone and one soil) has to be received. I verified the initial state satisfies `atconf` and `free` for the rovers.
           
           I've identified actions for each step. Rover `v12` will handle the image-taking and `v12` will obtain and transmit images for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and `v20`. To do this, I'll need to use the `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions. Each image requires calibration, capturing, and sending to the base station (`v9`). This also involves understanding the preconditions of those actions and ensuring they are true.
           
           Similarly, I have the goal of analysis being received. I will select objects to be sent, and `v1` and `v5` (representing the stone and soil respectively), from a list of objects present. Then both rovers need to `sample_rock` the chosen objects, which will need to then `send_analysis` for them.
           
           Since the goal states the rover has to be `free` at the end, I included a `drop_rock` action after the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` step.
           
           The entire plan hinges on the interpretation of continuous parameters in the `atconf` condition and the available move actions. The lack of move action between discrete and continuous parameters suggests there might be an implicit connection between the `atconf` location and the other visible locations, that can be interpreted with the actions.
           
           With this in mind, here is my plan. I'll need to calibrate for each objective, capture and transmit those images. I'll then, for each relevant stone and soil sample, use `sample_rock`, and then `send_analysis`, and finally `drop_rock`. This order ensures all the criteria are met at the final state.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem's Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a set of valid actions and a plan generated previously. My immediate thought is, the previous plan must be flawed because it contains actions that aren't even permitted. Specifically, I'm only allowed to *move* rovers (`v12` and `v14` in this case), and *drop rocks* from their stores. The `move` actions are practically useless, as they don't change the rover's configuration.
           
           The ultimate objective is `new-axiom@0()`, which necessitates achieving several states: being at specific configurations (`atconf`), being free to move around (`free`), and *most critically*, receiving images and analyses (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`).
           
           Now, the problem. To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to use actions like `take_image` and `send_image`.  To get `receivedanalysis`, I'd require actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. **None of these actions are available to me.** The valid actions I *do* have just won't cut it.  I'm basically given these rovers, told to move them around and drop rocks - but I'm not allowed to do anything that would remotely come close to completing the main goal.
           
           My conclusion is simple: based on these constraints, the ultimate goal is **unachievable**. There's no way to reach those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates with only `move` and `drop_rock`. I'm forced to explain that the plan is impossible to realize given the provided actions.
