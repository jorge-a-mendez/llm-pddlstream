User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's see what we've got here. The goal is to find three good spots for a robot base to see a target. The catch? Stay within a two-unit radius of the target, dodge obstacles, and have a clear line of sight.**
           
           My first step is to get a handle on the environment. I need to understand where the walls and obstacles are. From the provided list of AABBs, I can see the outer boundary is a big square, and there's a central wall. There are also a few rectangular and square obstacles scattered around. A few obstacles are *very* close to the target!
           
           Next, I have to make sure any position I suggest is valid. The position must be close enough to the target, it must be within the overall environment boundaries (`x` and `y` within -2.5 and 2.5), it must not be inside any obstacles and there must be a clear line of sight (LoS) between the robot base and the target point.
           
           Then, the actual strategy for finding positions. I want to generate three positions that are spread out. I will first establish the search area defined by the two-unit range around the target. Then, I'll generate some candidate points at a distance of, e.g., 1.5 units, from the target in different directions.
           
           **With target (1.527, -0.627), here's what I propose:**
           1.  **Candidate 1:** I'll place a candidate at `(2.5, -1.7686)`, about 1.5 units below and to the right of the target. I'll make sure to double check that this location is not within obstacles and does in fact have clear LoS. My calculations show a clear line of sight.
           
           2.  **Candidate 2:** The next candidate is at `(2.5, 0.5146)`, about 1.5 units above and right of the target. Again, my preliminary LoS checks indicate this is a clear spot. The line would have to go above obstacle 17.
           
           3.  **Candidate 3:** The third spot, `(0.527, -1.745)`, is about 1.5 units below and to the left. The calculations are again confirming LoS, passing below the relevant obstacles.
           
           Each point, I confirm, is approximately 1.5 units from the target to ensure the three points are nicely spread out, not in any obstacles, and within limits.
           
           The target being at x=1.527 puts it to the right of the vertical wall (x=0). The closest obstacles are 14 and 17, which are very close, above, and left of the target, so that is what I had to work around in the placement.
