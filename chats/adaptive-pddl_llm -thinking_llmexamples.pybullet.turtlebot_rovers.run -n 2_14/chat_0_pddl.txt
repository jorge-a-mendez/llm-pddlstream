           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, here's my analysis of how to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, but it looks like we've hit a roadblock.  The goal has several parts, but the key ones are getting images and analyzing rocks, specifically, achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           To get an image, I need to have an image, and to get an image, I need to calibrate the camera and take the image, then send the image.  To analyze a rock, I need to have it analyzed and then send the analysis. This requires sampling the rock first. It's a series of actions that must be completed in the correct order: *calibrate*, *take\_image*, *send\_image*, *sample\_rock*, *send\_analysis*.
           
           I looked at what's already true in the initial state. The problem is that the rovers are stuck in specific configurations at the start.  We have rovers `v12` and `v14` at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively.  To perform the image and rock analysis actions, rovers need to be at different *configurations* which have to do with where they need to be to take pictures of things or where the rocks are.  For example, to take an image of `v17` or `v18`, it needs to be at `#o3` or `#o0`, and to analyze rocks, it needs to be at `#o5`.
           
           The trouble is, the only available *move* actions are basically no-ops, for example `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` or `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  This means the rovers *cannot* change their configurations to reach the necessary spots to take pictures or analyze rocks.
           
           So, I can't *calibrate*, *take\_image*, *send\_image*, *sample\_rock*, or *send\_analysis* because the rovers can't be at the required locations. Since those actions are necessary for completing the other tasks, the entire goal is, unfortunately, unreachable given the actions. The solution is unachievable given the specific actions provided and the constraints on movement.
