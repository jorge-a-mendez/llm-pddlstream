           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q0', '#t4'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t1', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` (which could be `v8` or `v12`) onto object `v18`.  Initially, I broke down the plan into picking up the desired object (either `v8` or `v12`) and placing it on `v18`. From the scene description, I see that #o2 is a pose on `v18` that can support both `v8` and `v12`. I know that I need the robot arm to perform the `pick` and `place` actions, which each action requires several preconditions to be met.
           
           **Initial Plan:  Moving `v8`**
           
           My initial thought was to pick `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) and place it on `#o2`. This involves actions like `pick` (using parameters like arm `v4`, object `v8`, `atraj` `#o4`) and `place` with the same arm using `#o4`. I identified that the robot arm (v4) needs to move into an acceptable base configuration before the pick can begin.  This seems straightforward, but I then recognized that the `move_base` action would need to be considered.
           
           **The Fatal Flaw: The Blocking Object**
           
           The main problem emerged when analyzing the `pick` action preconditions.  There's a precondition `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(?t)` for the action. Through analyzing the previous attempt's error log, I discovered that the trajectory (`#t1`, a concrete parameter value for `#o4`) collides with `v15` at `v16`. Since I am required to use a fixed value(`#o4`) for the `pick` and `place` actions, I realized that I cannot pick up and place an object while `v15` is in its current pose.
           
           **The Unsolvable Obstacle: The Double-Meaning of new-axiom@0() and the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Then, I came across the `new-axiom@0(?o: object)` axiom. This is where I found the true problem.  The `pick` action has a crucial precondition, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. However, according to the scene definition, `new-axiom@0(?o)` is always true because there are always other graspable objects, violating the pick precondition.
           
           This precondition effectively says that the only graspable object must be `?o` and *nothing else* in order to be picked up. Because there are several graspable objects, the precondition is not met, which blocks the execution of any `pick` action. Therefore, no objects can be moved, and thus the goal is unreachable.
