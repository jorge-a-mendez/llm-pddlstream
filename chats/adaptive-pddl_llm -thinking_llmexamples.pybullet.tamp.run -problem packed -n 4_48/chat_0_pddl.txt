           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis: Unreachable Goal State with Current Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. My objective is straightforward: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* object `v18`. That "on" predicate hinges on having an `atpose` and `supported` fact, which I'll keep in mind.
           
           Initially, I see that these target objects are already *on* `v11`, so they are supported at that location. My initial reaction is to consider `pick` and `place` actions; those are my go-to tools for moving things around in this kind of problem.
           
           I then look into what poses and support relations are available with the target object, `v18`.  It appears that each target object can, indeed, be *supported* by `v18`, but at some new pose, lets call it `#o2`. This gives me a direction.
           
           However, things take a turn when I investigate the *available* actions.  I'm only given a single `move_base` action instance!  There are *no* `pick` or `place` instances provided. This is a huge constraint.
           
           With this constraint, the problem becomes clear: The robot cannot change the poses of any objects. The robot can only move its base around from the same position using the single available action, which does not affect object poses.
           
           The initial state puts these objects at poses on `v11`. To achieve the goal, I need them *atpose* on `v18`.  But without `pick` and `place`, I can't modify the `atpose` facts.  I am essentially stuck!
           
           Therefore, based on the limited action set, I conclude that the desired goal state is *unachievable*.
