           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to stack those objects!**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on` object `v18`.  I see that currently they are each on `v11`, and all the `graspable` and `stackable` facts are in place. Since the `on` predicate is based on `supported`, and the initial state already tells me that each object can be *supported* on `v18`, it looks like I just need to get them all to the right pose, which I see that `#o2` is. The key is to pick and place them.
           
           My strategy is as follows: Since I've only got one arm, I'm going to have to do this one object at a time. The kinematic information is all there, meaning `kin(v4, vX, vY, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is true, allowing actions to work.
           
           First, I will **pick** object `v8` from pose `v9`. Then, I'll **place** `v8` onto pose `#o2`. I will repeat this process for objects `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, each time picking them up from their starting poses (`v13`, `v15`, `v17` respectively) and placing them onto pose `#o2`. I need to make sure that the base config is correct, and since `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, it will stay that way.
           
           The actions I need will then be executed one by one using the right poses to do the desired pick and place.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user highlighted that my previous attempt used invalid actions. I completely missed that memo! The instructions were crystal clear: only use actions *in* the provided list, which was just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. And that's it. No `pick`, no `place`, nothing else!
           
           Now I need to reassess. The goal is to get several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) *on* `v18`. From the initial state and the `supported` predicates, it's clear these objects are currently *on* `v11`. To move them from `v11` to `v18`, I would *obviously* need `pick` and `place` actions. It's the most straightforward path.
           
           But the only allowed action? `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This moves the base… well, nowhere, it simply consumes a `canmove()` token. It doesn’t affect the `atpose` of objects at all, let alone move them from one place to another. 
           
           So the conclusion is simple. This goal is impossible. We *must* use `pick` and `place` to accomplish the goal. With only the useless `move_base` action, there's no way to manipulate the objects and achieve `on(?o, v18)`.  I need to inform the user that this plan cannot be completed.
