           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. The goal is straightforward: I need to stack objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` on top of object `v20`.  The `on` predicate, which defines this, relies on the `supported` and `atpose` predicates.  Basically, for something to be "on" something else, it needs to be supported at a specific pose.
           
           I start by examining the initial state of the goal objects. They're all supported by `v11` at their initial poses. To get them on `v20`, I need to change their poses to `#o2` and ensure they're supported by `v20`.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: the *only* available action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This action just moves the robot's base configuration from its current configuration `v3` to the same configuration `v3`.  It doesn't actually *do* anything useful for this task. It doesn't move objects, pick them up, or put them down. It's essentially a no-op!
           
           My plan to solve this would have been to use `pick` and `place` actions. I would have needed to pick up each object, move it to the right pose, and then place it on `v20`.  I know I have facts like `graspable` and `grasp`, but without `pick` and `place`, I'm stuck.
           
           The preconditions for `pick` and `place` check out, and I have the information, but those *specific actions* are not available instances of an action. The only move base action is useless for this.
           
           Given the constraint of the limited action instance, I can conclude that the goal state is unreachable. I can't change the `atpose` of the objects because I can't pick them up or place them.  The initial state doesn't satisfy the goal, and the available action can't change it.  It's a frustrating situation, but the plan is simple: I cannot do this.
