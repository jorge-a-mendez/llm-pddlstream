               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get these five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – all *on* object v20.  Now, the 'on' predicate is defined by 'supported' and 'atpose'.  Essentially, for each object, I need to figure out a pose (position) where it's supported by v20 and then ensure that object *is* at that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the provided facts, each of those five objects is currently in a different pose, supported by v11. However, crucially, the system *also* knows that if the objects were at pose #o2, they *would* be supported by v20. Therefore my plan needs to *move* each object to pose #o2.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: I have a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This looks fishy.  It's a move_base action starting and ending at the same 'base' configuration. It also states that this is the *only* allowed action instance!
           
           **The Challenge: Restricted Actions**
           
           The implications are clear to me: I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions to accomplish this rearrangement. However, the constraints are very specific.  The task states that I can only use action instances *explicitly* provided. The *only* action provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means that `pick` and `place` actions are *not* allowed. I've re-read the problem carefully, and the constraint is absolute.
           
           **The Inevitable Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Given that I'm restricted to a single, ultimately irrelevant action, I can't achieve the goal. I cannot manipulate the objects because `pick` and `place` are necessary but disallowed. The *only* action I *can* use doesn't modify the object positions at all.  Therefore, the goal is *unreachable*.
