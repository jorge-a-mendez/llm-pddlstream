User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by walls at x, y = +/- 2.5. There's a vertical wall along x=0. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters near (2,2), (-2,2), (0.5,2), (-0.5,2), and some others in the middle and corners. The target is at (-0.08182767016140552, -1.9868725894178385). I will try to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point, avoiding the walls and known obstacles. I'll prioritize positions that offer a good line of sight.
           
           Positions:

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous request's target point was (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723). My previous proposed positions were (-0.08182767016140552, -0.9868725894178385), (0.9181723298385945, -1.9868725894178385), and (-1.0818276701614056, -1.9868725894178385). These were calculated relative to a different target point, (-0.08182767016140552, -1.9868725894178385), which was not the actual target.
           
           The failure analysis from the previous turn showed that:
           1. Position (-0.08182767016140552, -0.9868725894178385) collided with obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This confirms the presence of a central vertical wall along x=0. My proposed point was too close to this wall.
           2. Positions (0.9181723298385945, -1.9868725894178385) and (-1.0818276701614056, -1.9868725894178385) had no line of sight to the target (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723). This is expected as these positions are far from the target and likely behind some obstacles.
           
           The current target is (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723). This point is in the top-right quadrant, near the corner and close to obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point, avoiding the walls and the known obstacle 7. I also need to be mindful of the surrounding obstacles like 3 ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) which is the right wall, and potentially 21 ((1.9647628351976238, 1.928825049095329), (2.0454872563551105, 2.0095494702528156)) which is very close to the target. I will try to place the robot in open spaces around the target.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous request had a target point of (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723). The previous set of proposed positions were (1.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723), (2.005125045776367, 0.9691872596740723), and (2.005125045776367, 2.4691872596740723). It appears the feedback provided with the new request is identical to the feedback from the previous request. This means the positions I just proposed were not yet evaluated. I will assume this is a re-submission of the same request, and I should propose new positions for the target (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723).
           
           The target is (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723), which is in the upper right quadrant. I need to find positions within 2 units of this target, avoiding obstacles. Obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) is a square directly over the target, so I need to be careful not to place the robot or occlude the view with it. Obstacle 21 ((1.9647628351976238, 1.928825049095329), (2.0454872563551105, 2.0095494702528156)) is also very close to the target. The right wall is obstacle 3 ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)).
           
           Considering these, I will try positions that are slightly offset from the target, trying to keep a clear line of sight and avoid collisions. Since the target is within obstacle 7, it's very tricky. I will try to place the robot slightly below or to the left of obstacle 7, outside of 21 and the right wall.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point for the last valid attempt was (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723). The feedback provided is still the *initial* feedback from two turns ago, referring to positions far from the current target. This indicates that the system is not providing feedback on the positions I've proposed for the *current* target. I will assume my last set of proposals from the previous turn for target (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723) were not evaluated, and I must propose new positions for this same target.
           
           The target is (2.005125045776367, 1.9691872596740723). This is in the top-right quadrant.
           Obstacle 7 is ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). The target is inside this obstacle. This is problematic as the robot itself cannot be inside a fixed obstacle. This means the target must be *visible* from outside the obstacle, but the robot cannot share the same space as obstacle 7.
           Obstacle 21 is ((1.9647628351976238, 1.928825049095329), (2.0454872563551105, 2.0095494702528156)). This is also very close to the target and actually overlaps with obstacle 7.
           
           Given the target is inside obstacle 7, I need to place the robot *outside* obstacle 7, but within a distance of 2 from the target *point*. This implies I need to find a position that is near the edge of obstacle 7.
           
           I will try positions directly adjacent to obstacle 7, but outside of it, and also outside the bounding box of obstacle 21.
