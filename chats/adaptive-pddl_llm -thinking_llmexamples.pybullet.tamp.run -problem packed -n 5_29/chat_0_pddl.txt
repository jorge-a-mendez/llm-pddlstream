           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End in Planning**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that achieves the state: `(on v8 v20), (on v12 v20), (on v14 v20), (on v16 v20), (on v18 v20)`.  This essentially means I need to make sure that each of these objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) ends up "on" object v20.  The "on" predicate is defined by two other predicates: `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So, to have an object on something, it must be both supported and at the correct pose.
           
           Looking at the starting conditions, all five objects are presently resting on v11 at their individual, specific poses (e.g., v8 at v9, v12 at v13, etc.). I then considered how I could potentially achieve `on(v8, v20)` specifically. To do this, I would need `atpose(v8, ?p_new_v8)` and `supported(v8, ?p_new_v8, v20)`. The initial state *does* include a `supported(v8, #o2, v20)` fact, meaning that if v8 could be brought to pose `#o2`, it would indeed be on v20. The same logic applies to v12, v14, v16, and v18.
           
           Here's the problem: the only available action is `move_base`. No instances of the fundamental `pick` and `place` actions needed to change the poses of these objects are provided. Therefore, I'm stuck with the current object poses. I am limited to the information that any action instance not explicitly listed is prohibited. With the tools I have, I am unable to modify the pose of the objects, so the initial configuration of the `atpose` facts remains unchanged. Consequently, the "on" predicates must also remain at their initial state (i.e., each object remains on v11).
           
           Because I can't alter the `atpose` facts, and the actions required to set them are not available, it's impossible to achieve the goal state.  My analysis indicates a fundamental limitation: there's no way to move these objects to v20 given the available actions.  The goal is, effectively, unreachable. The single move base instance has no impact.
