User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, -0.224), (-0.198, -0.126)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.263, 0.408), (-0.176, 0.495)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.026, -0.406), (0.061, -0.319)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.054, 0.292), (0.152, 0.39)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.247, -0.175, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.349, 0.937).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.207, -0.159), (0.293, -0.072)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.22, 0.451, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.797, 0.604).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.018, -0.362, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.803, 0.595).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.103, 0.341, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.948, -0.318).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.25, -0.116, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.141, 0.99).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis:  Unachievable Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this planning problem. The core objective is clear: to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto surface `v20`. Currently, they're all supported on `v11`.  My understanding is that I need to use the `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` axiom, which relies on two key conditions: that the object `o` is at a pose `p`, and that `o` is supported at that pose `p` on surface `r` (in this case `v20`).
           
           The initial state already provides poses for each object on `v20` (using the #o2 variable).  So, conceptually, it *seems* simple –  find appropriate poses on `v20` and put the objects there.
           
           The problem, however, lies in the *actions* I'm allowed to use.  The list of "valid action instances" is severely limited. I am only permitted to use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move action keeps the robot stationary, which is clearly a problem.  I can't pick up or place anything.
           
           To achieve my goal of `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, `on(v18, v20)`, I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions, or actions that have the same effect. I must be able to move them from their initial location on `v11` and place them onto `v20`.  These actions, however, are not explicitly provided in the list.  
           
           Given the constraints outlined, my conclusion is unavoidable: **the goal is unachievable**. I am effectively prevented from moving any objects because the only allowed action is a no-op (the `move_base` action doesn't change the robot's base configuration). I can't modify the `on` predicates in the initial state, and therefore I cannot accomplish the specified goal state.  The action instance restriction is the critical constraint, and it renders the planning problem unsolvable.
