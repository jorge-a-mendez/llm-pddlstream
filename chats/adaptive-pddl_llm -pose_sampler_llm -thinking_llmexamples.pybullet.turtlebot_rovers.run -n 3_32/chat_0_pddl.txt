           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan to Tackle new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate objective, `new-axiom@0()`, is essentially a conjunction of several conditions. My initial assessment reveals that four of these conditions (`atconf` and `free` predicates) are already satisfied in the starting state. The real challenge lies in achieving the remaining conditions, particularly those involving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll need to employ the `send_image` action. This requires meeting several preconditions, including having the image (`haveimage`), being in the correct configuration (`atconf`), and ensuring the communication channel is clear. The problem is, `haveimage` is the result of using a `take_image` action, which also has its own preconditions related to calibration and visibility.
           
           Similarly, I'll need `send_analysis` to meet my `receivedanalysis` needs. It's pre-conditions are similar in that I'll need to `sample_rock` and also satisfy configuration and communication requirements.
           
           My initial thought was to use rover `v14` for all tasks, assuming the available actions would enable me to calibrate, take, and send images efficiently. I would need to calibrate the camera and take images of each objective, then send them to the base. I was thinking of following up with sampling a stone and soil sample, and then sending these for analysis.
           
           However, I've hit a major roadblock. The provided actions are severely limited, restricted to just `move` and `drop_rock`. This means I can't even get started! Neither `send_image` nor `send_analysis` (the key actions needed) are present in the list of permissible action instances. Without these, the goal is simply unattainable. It looks as if I can only achieve the first few conditions and remain stuck at that point.
           
           Given these strict action constraints, the goal is unreachable.
