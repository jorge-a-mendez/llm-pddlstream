           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Frustrating Impasse**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I see a few preconditions are already met, but I'm stuck on achieving `receivedimage` for two specific objectives, and `receivedanalysis` for two specific types of materials (stone and soil).
           
           My initial thought is to go through the typical plan generation process: Backchain from the desired `receivedimage` using `send_image`, which needs `haveimage`.  `haveimage` is obtained through `take_image`, which requires that the rovers are at the correct configuration, as specified by the `imagevisible` preconditions. Same goes for `receivedanalysis`, which is achieved by `send_analysis`, which requires the rovers be at the proper configuration, according to `above` preconditions.
           
           That's when I hit the brick wall.  The `imagevisible` facts state that I need to be at `#o3` and I have to send to `#o0`, but the only allowed "move" actions keep the rovers stuck in their starting locations, `v13` and `v15` respectively, with their only allowed move action being a no-op that keeps them at those initial locations.  I can see that the rovers can't move, and are therefore unable to take and transmit images, or send analyses.
           
           I've examined the PDDL code and tried to reason about any implicit relationships, but there's a disconnect.  The action preconditions all state the need for `atconf(rover, configuration)`, but the rovers start in configurations that prevent them from accessing the necessary objects. I'm hitting a fundamental problem: no matter how much I trace back through the actions, I can't find a way to make those essential configuration preconditions true.
           
           The initial state facts say the rovers are at the wrong configurations (`v13` and `v15`) to achieve any of my goals that involve imaging or analysis transmission.  The rovers can't change their positions!  This means that, as it stands, this goal is, sadly, *unreachable*.  I can't devise a plan because the actions just aren't there to make it possible.
