(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on a square surface. The object's dimensions are almost square (0.098369 m by 0.098369 m), and the surface is a 0.27 m square centered at the origin. No collisions are permitted, and there are no initial obstacles.
           
           I need to figure out the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates for each placement. Stability means the object has to be fully within the surface.
           
           I've analyzed the surface and object, noting that since the object is nearly a square, its rotation will primarily influence how much space it occupies within the surface.  I've calculated the maximum extents of the bounding box for different angles, specifically, to find the maximum possible x and y center coordinate ranges for stable placements.
           
           Given the almost square dimensions of the object, there will be some redundancy in using angles from 0 to 2pi. Because the problem states to only place the *object's AABB* within the *surface's AABB*, the stable bounding box orientation will become periodic with `pi/2`.
           
           So, I will use a systematic approach, using a set of 10 angles between 0 and pi. Specifically, I'll use angles of: 0, pi/10, 2pi/10, 3pi/10, 4pi/10, 5pi/10, 6pi/10, 7pi/10, 8pi/10, 9pi/10. For each angle, I will use the corners of the available space, (0, 0) and center point to generate five placements. The idea is to cover the surface space by evenly distributing the object's center coordinates across the permitted range.  I've already figured out exactly what these maximum bounds are given a rotation.

(Thoughts: **My current focus is on placing a new square object (ID 4) onto Surface 0, which has already successfully accommodated another object (ID 5) at (0, 0, 0, 0).**  I've calculated the dimensions of object 4 and understand its placement constraints: it must fit entirely within the surface boundaries of [-0.135, 0.135] on both the x and y axes. Because it's a square, its rotation angle (theta) won't impact its required bounding box, simplifying the placement calculations.
           
           Object 5 is at (0,0) and its AABB is calculated. I've determined that object 4's AABB cannot fit within the allowed surface area without colliding with object 5, which is already present at (0,0) and slightly larger than object 4. I've double-checked my calculations, but my geometric reasoning strongly suggests there is *no* possible way to place object 4 on this surface without an overlap. I have attempted various placements using an evenly spaced grid of positions and several angles but due to size of object 5, collision is unavoidable.
           
           Even though collision is unavoidable, I must provide 50 stable placements, because I must "never give up", as instructed. My "stable" placement definition follows the instructions, which requires that it be completely within the bounds of the surface.  Since it is impossible to avoid a collision, I must comply with generating 50 positions to attempt placement.  I will be returning 50 placements that, while within the surface, *will* necessarily collide with object 5. This is the only way to meet all the instructions of the task.  My system will detect the collisions and reject the positions, but this is the appropriate response given the constraints.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've been given some successful placement data for objects 4 and 5 on Surface 0, which has an area of -0.135 to 0.135 on both x and y axes. Object 6 is a square, and I need to figure out where it can go without causing a collision.
           
           First, I define the key parameters.  `half_s6` is 0.0367, which means Object 6 can't go closer than this to the surface edges.  To avoid overlapping Object 5, I need to ensure that the absolute value of the x and y coordinates of its center are greater than 0.0859 (sum of half the object's dimensions).
           
           Object 4 is placed at (-0.088, -0.088) with the edges touching the surface. To avoid collisions, the center of Object 6 cannot be within  0.0831 of the center of Object 4.  
           
           So, here's the game plan: I need to consider all possible non-colliding positions for the center of Object 6, (x, y), within the bounds of Surface 0.
           
           *   To avoid object 5:  `abs(x) >= 0.0859` OR `abs(y) >= 0.0859`.
           *   To avoid object 4: `(x <= -0.005)` OR `(y <= -0.005)`.
           
           I create a grid of points on the surface. For a 7x7 grid, these coordinates are checked. By ensuring a finer grid, I am hoping to create more options for placement. I define a 15x15 grid of points, using this finer grid to pick 50 valid placements of `(x, y)` locations for the center of Object 6.
