           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 on object v20. All these objects are currently on object v11, at different poses. The robot starts at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5 for arm v4, and arm v7 for arm v6. Only arm v4 is controllable.
           
           There is only one available action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from v3 to v3 (effectively staying in the same place) via trajectory #o0. This action is possible because `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()` are true. After this action, `atbconf(v3)` remains true, `canmove()` becomes false, and `atbconf(v3)` becomes false (due to the `NegatedAtom atbconf(q1)` effect). This leads to a contradiction. However, the `NegatedAtom atbconf(q1)` effect means `atbconf(v3)` will be false after the action. This would prevent any further pick or place actions that require `atbconf(q)`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the `move_base` action and its effects. The `NegatedAtom atbconf(?q1)` effect means that the *previous* base configuration is no longer active. The `Atom atbconf(?q2)` effect means the *new* base configuration is active. In this specific case, `?q1` and `?q2` are both `v3`, so it effectively just makes `canmove()` false and has a cost. This is problematic because `canmove()` is required for picking and placing, but the action itself consumes `canmove()`.
           
           More critically, even if `move_base` were not problematic, the only other available actions are `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. None of these actions are directly available as instances other than the `move_base` action. This means the robot cannot pick up or place any objects, nor can it clean or cook.
           
           Since the goal is to move several objects to be `on` `v20`, and there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, the goal is unachievable.
           
           Even if `pick` and `place` actions were available, the initial state shows that arm `v6` is at `v7` and `handempty(v6)` is true. Arm `v4` is at `v5` and `handempty(v4)` is true. All the `kin` facts are for arm `v4`. The `bconf(#o3)` implies that there would be a different base configuration necessary for the `kin` actions, and `ataconf(v4, v5)` is the current arm configuration. The problem is that there are no available `pick` or `place` action instances to choose from, only the `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
