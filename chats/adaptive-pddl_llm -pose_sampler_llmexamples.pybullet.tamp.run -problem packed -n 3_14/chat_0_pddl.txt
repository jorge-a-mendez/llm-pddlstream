           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.099 x 0.099.
           
           To place the object stably on the surface, its center must be within the bounds of the surface, taking into account the object's dimensions and orientation. Since the object is square, its x and y extents are the same, and rotating it by multiples of 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) will result in the same effective bounding box. For other angles, the effective bounding box will be larger, specifically with a diagonal of the object's square as its extent, but given the small size of the object relative to the surface, this should not be an issue.
           
           The surface's x-range is -0.135 to 0.135, and its y-range is -0.135 to 0.135.
           The object's half-extent is approximately 0.099 / 2 = 0.0495.
           
           For a stable placement, the center (x, y) of the object must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0495 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0495
           -0.0855 <= x <= 0.0855
           
           -0.135 + 0.0495 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0495
           -0.0855 <= y <= 0.0855
           
           I will generate a variety of placements covering different positions within this valid range and different orientations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at the origin.
           A new object (ID: 5) is introduced, which is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0916 x 0.0916.
           An object with ID 4 has been successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 is centered at (0,0) with no rotation.
           
           The object's half-extent is approximately 0.0916 / 2 = 0.0458.
           
           For a stable placement of object 5, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0458 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0458
           -0.0892 <= x <= 0.0892
           
           -0.135 + 0.0458 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0458
           -0.0892 <= y <= 0.0892
           
           Additionally, object 5 must not collide with object 4, which is located at (0, 0, 0, 0) and has dimensions 0.0989 x 0.0989.
           Object 4 occupies the region from -0.04946 to 0.04946 in both x and y.
           
           Therefore, for object 5, its center (x, y) should avoid the region of object 4.
           This means the x-coordinate of object 5's center should be either less than -0.04946 - 0.0458 = -0.09526 or greater than 0.04946 + 0.0458 = 0.09526.
           Similarly for the y-coordinate.
           
           However, the maximum stable x and y coordinates are 0.0892 and -0.0892. This means that if object 5's x-coordinate is greater than 0.04946 + 0.0458, it would be outside the stable placement range. The same applies for the negative x and y.
           
           So, for the current object sizes, it seems impossible to place object 5 without overlapping object 4, if object 4 is at (0,0,0,0). Let me re-evaluate.
           
           Object 4 bounding box: x from -0.04946 to 0.04946, y from -0.04946 to 0.04946.
           Object 5 half-extent: 0.0458.
           
           If object 5 is placed, for example, to the right of object 4:
           min_x_obj5 = center_x - 0.0458
           max_x_obj4 = 0.04946
           For no collision: min_x_obj5 > max_x_obj4 => center_x - 0.0458 > 0.04946 => center_x > 0.09526.
           But the maximum stable x for object 5 is 0.0892.
           Since 0.09526 > 0.0892, there is no valid x position to the right.
           Similarly, for the left:
           max_x_obj5 = center_x + 0.0458
           min_x_obj4 = -0.04946
           For no collision: max_x_obj5 < min_x_obj4 => center_x + 0.0458 < -0.04946 => center_x < -0.09526.
           But the minimum stable x for object 5 is -0.0892.
           Since -0.09526 < -0.0892, there is no valid x position to the left.
           
           This implies that it is impossible to place object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with object 4, which is fixed at (0,0,0,0).
           This suggests I might have misunderstood the problem. If a placement failed, it meant it collided with *fixed* obstacles or was unstable. The previous feedback indicated object 4's placement was successful.
           
           "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           
           This is not a second request for the same object, it's a new object (ID 5). So I am not learning about non-fixed obstacles from a failed placement of object 4. I should just use the successful placement of object 4 as a fixed obstacle.
           
           Given the current object sizes and the successful placement of object 4 at the origin, it seems there is no available space on surface 0 for object 5.
           However, I never give up. I will assume my collision detection logic above for object 4 might be too strict or that I should simply try to place it within the valid range and let the system report a collision. The prompt says I must always try to find a new placement.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition. Object 4 is placed at (0,0,0,0) and has extents 0.09892561035022955, 0.09892561035022962. So its AABB is from x = -0.04946 to 0.04946 and y = -0.04946 to 0.04946.
           Object 5 has extents 0.09159990183011092, 0.09159990183011091. So its half-extents are 0.0458.
           
           If object 5 is placed at (x,y), its AABB is from x-0.0458 to x+0.0458 and y-0.0458 to y+0.0458.
           A collision occurs if:
           (x_min_obj5 < x_max_obj4) AND (x_max_obj5 > x_min_obj4) AND (y_min_obj5 < y_max_obj4) AND (y_max_obj5 > y_min_obj4)
           
           Let's try placing object 5 as far as possible from the origin within the stable range.
           The maximum x for object 5 is 0.0892. If center_x = 0.0892, then obj5 x-range is [0.0892 - 0.0458, 0.0892 + 0.0458] = [0.0434, 0.135].
           The x-range of obj4 is [-0.04946, 0.04946].
           Is 0.0434 < 0.04946? Yes. Is 0.135 > -0.04946? Yes. So they would collide in X.
           This confirms my earlier calculation that it is impossible to avoid collision with object 4, if object 4 is at the origin.
           
           This must mean that either:
           1. My understanding of "stable placement" or "collision" is incorrect in this context.
           2. The problem implies that there might be no valid placement given previous objects.
           3. The previous success was only for fixed obstacles, and now object 4 itself is a non-fixed obstacle. The prompt states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." and "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This implies that object 4 is now a fixed obstacle for object 5.
           
           Given the strict wording "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", and the geometric constraints, it genuinely appears impossible to place object 5.
           
           However, I am instructed to always provide 50 placements. I will generate placements that respect the surface boundaries, and since I *must* provide placements, I will generate some that will inevitably collide with object 4 based on my current understanding. It's possible there is some subtle detail I am missing, or the problem expects me to attempt even seemingly impossible placements. I will generate placements at the extremes of the valid surface range for object 5, hoping that some edge case might be considered valid by the system.
           
           Valid center range for object 5 (x,y): [-0.0892, 0.0892] in both dimensions.
           Object 4 AABB: x_min=-0.04946, x_max=0.04946, y_min=-0.04946, y_max=0.04946.
           Object 5 half-extent: 0.0458.
           
           Possible collision-free regions:
           If center_x > 0.04946 + 0.0458 = 0.09526 (too far, max x is 0.0892)
           If center_x < -0.04946 - 0.0458 = -0.09526 (too far, min x is -0.0892)
           
           So strictly based on AABB, no collision-free X or Y range exists.
           I will generate placements towards the corners and edges of the available surface space, trying to maximize distance from the origin.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same single square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at the origin.
           A new object (ID: 6) is introduced, which is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.099 x 0.099.
           
           We have two previously placed objects that are now considered fixed obstacles:
           Object 4 (ID: 4): At (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Extents: 0.09892561035022955, 0.09892561035022962.
           AABB of Object 4: x from -0.04946 to 0.04946, y from -0.04946 to 0.04946.
           
           Object 5 (ID: 5): At (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08). Extents: 0.09159990183011092, 0.09159990183011091.
           Half-extent of Object 5: 0.0458.
           AABB of Object 5: x from (0.08 - 0.0458) to (0.08 + 0.0458) = [0.0342, 0.1258]
           y from (0.08 - 0.0458) to (0.08 + 0.0458) = [0.0342, 0.1258]
           
           New Object 6 (ID: 6) has extents 0.09896703379344429, 0.09896703379344429.
           Half-extent of Object 6: 0.09896703379344429 / 2 = 0.04948.
           
           First, determine the stable placement range for Object 6 on Surface 0:
           Surface x-range: -0.135 to 0.135.
           Surface y-range: -0.135 to 0.135.
           Stable x for Object 6: [-0.135 + 0.04948, 0.135 - 0.04948] = [-0.08552, 0.08552]
           Stable y for Object 6: [-0.135 + 0.04948, 0.135 - 0.04948] = [-0.08552, 0.08552]
           
           Now, consider collision avoidance with Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           Object 4 AABB: [-0.04946, 0.04946] x [-0.04946, 0.04946]
           Object 5 AABB: [0.0342, 0.1258] x [0.0342, 0.1258]
           
           Let Object 6 be at (x,y). Its AABB is [x-0.04948, x+0.04948] x [y-0.04948, y+0.04948].
           
           Collision avoidance with Object 4:
           To be clear of Object 4 in X:
           center_x + 0.04948 < -0.04946 => center_x < -0.09894 (Outside stable range)
           OR
           center_x - 0.04948 > 0.04946 => center_x > 0.09894 (Outside stable range)
           
           This implies that if Object 6 were to avoid Object 4 in the X direction, its center would need to be outside the stable placement range for the surface.
           The same logic applies for Y.
           
           Let's verify.
           Max stable x for Object 6 is 0.08552.
           If center_x = 0.08552, Object 6 x-range: [0.08552 - 0.04948, 0.08552 + 0.04948] = [0.03604, 0.135].
           This range overlaps with Object 4's x-range [-0.04946, 0.04946] because 0.03604 < 0.04946.
           
           This is the exact same situation as with Object 5. It appears geometrically impossible to place Object 6 on Surface 0 without colliding with Object 4, based on AABB.
           Since Object 5's placement (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08) was successful, it must be the case that my AABB collision check is too conservative for what the system considers a "collision".
           The previous successful placement for ID 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08) had an AABB of [0.0342, 0.1258] in x.
           Object 4's AABB is [-0.04946, 0.04946].
           These two AABBs definitely overlap (0.0342 < 0.04946). This means the system does not use AABB for exact collision, or there is some tolerance, or the actual geometry allows for some overlap.
           
           Given this new information from the success of Object 5, the strict AABB collision check I was doing is incorrect. The key insight is that even if the AABBs overlap, the placement might still be considered valid. This could be due to more precise (non-AABB) collision detection, or some other rule. However, I am not given the precise geometry of objects beyond their AABB extents.
           
           Since the system allowed Object 5 to overlap Object 4's AABB, I should focus on finding stable placements within the surface boundaries and *not* explicitly avoid the AABBs of previous objects if that avoidance leads to no possible placements. I will generate placements that are within the stable surface range. I will prioritize placements away from (0,0) and (0.08, 0.08) where the other objects are, but if that's not possible within the stable range, I will generate placements that might still overlap.
           
           Let's try to find an empty quadrant or edge.
           Object 4 is centered at (0,0).
           Object 5 is centered at (0.08, 0.08).
           This leaves the negative x, negative y quadrant relatively free. Or the negative x, positive y quadrant.
           
           Stable range for Object 6: x, y in [-0.08552, 0.08552].
           I will focus on the far corners and edges of this range.
