(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, size 0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is an AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object must be entirely within the surface's bounds.  I'll define a placement as (surface index, theta, x, y), where 'theta' is the object's rotation and (x, y) is the center of the object's bounding box.
           
           The object's a square, so I'm thinking about the *world-aligned* bounding box.  When it's rotated, the size is,  `W = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This simplifies to `S_eff = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. We need to minimize the effective size, `S_eff`, to maximize our placement options.  When `theta = 0` (or 90, 180, etc.), `S_eff = 0.07`.  At `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), `S_eff = 0.07 * sqrt(2)`. So, the easiest/largest usable area to place this object is with `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2` (90 degrees).
           
           For `theta = 0`, the half-extents are simply 0.07 / 2 = 0.035. This gives me a valid range for x: [4.235, 4.765] and y: [-0.565, -0.035]. For `theta = pi/2`, the same calculations apply. I decided to generate 25 placements at theta = 0 and 25 placements at theta=90.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I'll place the x positions starting at 4.235, then add 0.1 increments until I get to 4.635. I will start the y position at -0.565, add 0.1 to get up to -0.165. This will give me a 5 x 5 matrix of positions on the xy plane.
           
           For `theta = pi/2` I'll create a second 5 x 5 matrix, where the initial point has a smaller x and y point: The initial point is 4.285 and -0.515 with an increment of 0.1 for the rest of the array.
           
           This gives me 50 placements to use and, since they have an xy range that's only shifted slightly between them, I am confident they will all be stable.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 10**
           
           My approach here involves generating 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with previously placed object ID 5.  I've already analyzed the dimensions of object 10 (`size_x` and `size_y`, both approximately 0.07485), recognizing it's essentially a square with a side length of about `0.07485`.
           
           First, I calculated the half-extents (0.0374257) for object 10, which will be crucial for determining valid placement ranges.  The surface 0 `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))` provides the boundaries for object placement.
           
           Considering the surface constraints, when `theta = 0`, the x range is `[4.2374, 4.7625]` and the y range is `[-0.5625, -0.0374]`. Similarly for `theta = pi/2`. Since object 10 is almost square, `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2` are the most efficient orientations.
           
           Crucially, I need to avoid collisions with the placements of object 5, which are currently in the x range of approximately `[4.2, 4.37]` and y range of approximately `[-0.6, -0.13]`.  To achieve this, I'll shift the placements for object 10 to higher x-values (i.e., to the right side of the occupied region).
           
           I'll generate two grids, each with 25 points, one rotated 0 degrees and the other rotated pi/2.
           
           For the first grid, with `theta = 0`, I've chosen `x_coords = [4.42, 4.49, 4.56, 4.63, 4.70]` and `y_coords = [-0.55, -0.44, -0.33, -0.22, -0.11]`. These coordinates avoid the x range occupied by object 5 and ensure the object remains within the surface boundaries.
           
           For the second grid, with `theta = pi/2`, I chose slightly offset coordinates, `x_coords = [4.45, 4.52, 4.59, 4.66, 4.73]` and `y_coords = [-0.52, -0.41, -0.30, -0.19, -0.08]`, keeping to the right of object 5.
           
           I've ensured these grid values are within both valid ranges, and safe from collision with object 5. Therefore the final placement locations are ready.
