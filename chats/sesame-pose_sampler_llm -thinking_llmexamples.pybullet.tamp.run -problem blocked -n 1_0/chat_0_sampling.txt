           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface, surf_0, with bounds ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement is "stable" if the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) *fully* fits within the surface's AABB. The task requires determining `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` coordinates for each of these 50 placements.
           
           **Understanding Stability and Rotations**
           
           The wording of the problem hints that it's the rotated AABB that must be contained, not the local, unrotated AABB, which simplifies things. Since the object is a square (W = H), rotating it doesn't change the dimensions of its global AABB, only the orientation.  Effectively, the bounding box of the rotated square is always a square.  This makes containment calculations straightforward.
           
           **Surface Dimensions and Object Sizing**
           
           The surface surf_0 has dimensions 0.6 x 0.6. The square has a side of 0.07. To find valid placement positions, I need to account for the object's rotated AABB to ensure complete containment. This means considering the object's maximum rotated size along each axis. Given that it's a square, I can calculate `S' = 0.07 * ( |cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`, which is the side of its global bounding box when rotated. The biggest rotated square will be at 45 degree angles; in this case, S' is ~ 0.099.
           
           **Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           The core approach is to strategically pick theta values and calculate a grid of x,y locations where the rotated object can fit on the surface. Since I need to generate multiple points, I chose a set of 8 distinct thetas (0, pi/4, ..., 7*pi/4) covering the full 2*pi range to include all possible rotated orientations. However, for a square that would repeat every pi/2, but using a diverse set ensures a more diversified set of 50 stable placements. I will generate a 3x3 grid for each value of theta for both x,y for a total of 9 combinations for the 50 desired placements.
           
           **Placement Calculation**
           
           1.  I calculate S' (size of global bounding box) and its half (S'/2) for each theta to determine padding (safety margin) from the surface boundaries.
           2.  I then use S'/2 to define the permissible ranges for the object's center (x, y) coordinates within the surface to avoid any overlap.
           3.  I construct the 3x3 grid of x and y locations (so 9 combinations) across those ranges.
           4.  I iterate through the theta values, calculating the valid (x, y) ranges. Then, for each, the x and y grid is calculated to place points within the valid regions. I take the first 50 stable (theta, x, y) placements.
           
           This approach provides a diverse set of valid and unique stable (non-colliding) placements for the square object within the surface.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object ID 10 on a surface, avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (ID 5). The key issue I'm focusing on is ensuring the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains entirely within the surface's AABB, especially when the object is rotated.  My previous attempts failed, and the feedback pointed to problems with containment when the rotation was at pi/4.
           
           First, I re-evaluated the AABB calculations, particularly for a rotation of pi/4. I calculated the effective width and height (W' and H') using the standard trigonometric formulas involving sine and cosine. Given the object's dimensions and the surface size, the maximum effective size (diagonally) should be well within the surface dimensions, even with rotation.
           
           The issue, as I discovered, was due to floating-point imprecision.  When calculating the center point of the object's AABB, I was using values close to the surface boundaries.  This meant that subtracting half the object's effective width/height from the calculated center could result in coordinates *slightly* outside the surface AABB due to small rounding errors.
           
           To address this, I'm introducing a few key changes. Instead of directly calculating the center point at `surf_lower_x + eff_w/2`, I'm creating a *safe* range for the center coordinates. The minimum safe `x` coordinate is `surf_lower_x + eff_w/2 + epsilon`, and the maximum safe `x` is `surf_upper_x - eff_w/2 - epsilon`, where `epsilon` is a tiny positive value (a very small float). This ensures that no matter the floating-point errors, the object will *always* be within the bounds.  I'm also applying this to the Y dimension.
           
           To pick suitable placements, I'm generating a dense grid of candidate points (7x7) for each rotation angle (0, pi/4, pi/2, etc.). For generating points, I have `num_points_per_dim = 10`. I then, for efficiency, check each candidate's AABB against the existing, successful, placements of object ID 5 to avoid collision. If a point is free, it's considered valid.  This method will guarantee, with high probability, 50 safe placements on the surface for ID 10. The epsilon factor is a critical aspect for generating precise points and to prevent collisions. I'll test each placement and verify stability afterwards.
