(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (surface 0).  The object is a square with dimensions 0.079884934411938 x 0.079884934411938, and the surface is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  "Stable" means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be entirely within the surface's AABB. Since this is the first placement for this object, I don't need to consider any previous collision data.
           
           To ensure stability for any rotation (theta), I must carefully calculate the allowed x and y coordinates. The *object's* AABB is described by `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y`, and I need to account for how this AABB expands in the *global* frame when rotated. Because the object is a square,  I calculate the *global* AABB's effective half-width/height using the formula `obj_half_x * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value determines how much the object's center must be offset from the surface's edges to remain inside.
           
           First, I calculate the allowed (x, y) ranges for the object's center considering the object's AABB. For a square, I know that the most 'extended' AABB happens at a rotation of 45 degrees, which I represent using `pi/4`. For this placement, I generate two separate sets of (x,y) placements, one using `theta = 0` (no rotation) and the other using `theta = pi/4`. I use two `5x5` grid for positions, `5 * 5 = 25`. This gives me the 25 required points.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, making sure they don't collide with the existing object 4. Object 4's already in the scene, and I know its location and size. Both objects are squares, which simplifies things a bit. I need to calculate the allowable area for object 5, considering surface boundaries and object 4's presence.
           
           First, I determine the effective area for object 5 to be stably placed based on its size and any rotation it might have. I consider two primary rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4). For each rotation, I'll calculate the valid range for object 5's center coordinates on the surface. These ranges will be slightly smaller than the surface itself to account for object 5's dimensions.
           
           The tricky part is avoiding collisions with object 4. I need to determine the area around object 4 that object 5 cannot occupy. I'll use the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of object 4 for this. The collision check is straightforward: two AABBs collide if their projections overlap on both the X and Y axes.
           
           I'll generate a grid of potential placement points for object 5, spaced at even intervals across the valid area. I'll need a way to ensure that the grid points are outside the collision region. For `theta = 0`, I know that I need to skip the bottom left collision part by checking if the point overlaps with Object 4 by calculating how much each `x` and `y` coordinate would overlap with Object 4. For `theta=pi/4`, it's the same collision check, but I'll also check if each `x` and `y` coordinate overlaps with Object 4. I'll then filter out any points that fall within object 4's AABB.  By carefully defining a forbidden region I can then create valid 50 placements. I'll combine the results from the various orientations to reach the minimum number (50).

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: placing Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 4 and 5, and giving me 50 stable options. I'll need to figure out how to avoid collisions, but first, let's nail down what we know:
           
           *   **Surface 0:** The usable area is defined, giving me some immediate bounds.
           *   **Objects 4 and 5:** I've got the exact dimensions, placements, and AABB information for these. This is key for collision detection.
           *   **Object 6:** It's a square and its size is known.
           
           Now, I'll need to get to work generating placements.
           
           Here's my plan of action to find these stable placements:
           
           1.  **Define and rotate Object 6's AABB:** I'll first calculate the AABB size for Object 6 for different rotations (`0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`).
           2.  **Obstacle AABBs:** I'll precisely define the AABBs for the already-placed Objects 4 and 5. This will be the "no-go" zone.
           3.  **Placement Grids:** Next, I'll generate possible center points for Object 6, using a grid for each of the three angles.
           4.  **Collision Checks:** For each candidate, I'll check if its AABB overlaps with any of the obstacle AABBs (O4 and O5).
           5.  **Filtering:** I'll keep only the placements that don't collide, making sure to hit my target of 50 viable options.
           
           I've generated several grid point placement candidates based on surface size and existing object dimensions. Let's make sure that I've accounted for collision conditions correctly. I will then have the set of potential placements. I'll filter based on their collision with objects 4 and 5. I expect to filter to the target number, and, with some luck, well above the 50. I'll finalize the placement points and move on with the broader task.
