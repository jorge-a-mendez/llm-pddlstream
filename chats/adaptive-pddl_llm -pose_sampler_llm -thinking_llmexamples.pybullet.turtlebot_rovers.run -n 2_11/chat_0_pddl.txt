User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Strategic Robotic Base Placement for Target Viewing**
           
           Alright, let's break down how I'm going to solve this. The core task is to find three optimal positions for a robot base to view a target, given the environment's constraints. I'm operating within a world defined by the robot's movement limits (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]) and a maximum viewing range of 2 units from the target. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target, so my job is to propose the right (x,y) location. The primary challenges are dodging fixed obstacles and ensuring a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           I'm given a set of Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) representing these obstacles.  I've got a good mental picture of the environment now: the outer boundaries of the world, walls (top, bottom, right, left) and some strategically placed interior obstacles. The central vertical wall at x=0 is the big one; it fundamentally splits the area in two and impacts how I select candidate locations.
           
           My plan is broken down into key steps:
           
           1.  **Analyze the Target's Location**: First, I'll need to figure out which side of the x=0 wall the target is on. If the target is on the right, I'll favor robot positions to the right, and vice versa.  If the target is super close to the wall, like right on top of it, things get tricky; it's practically impossible to be in line of sight.
           
           2.  **Generate Candidate Points**:  Once I've got a handle on the target's position, I'll whip up a list of potential (x, y) coordinates for the robot. I'll focus on points within a circle of radius 'd' centered on the target, where 'd' will vary to cover a range (around d=1.0 and d=1.8), but will always be less than or equal to the max range of 2. I’ll consider angles (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and some diagonals for diversity.
           
           3.  **Filtering & Collision Detection**: Here's where it gets real. For each candidate point, I'll run it through a gauntlet:
           
               *   **Bounds Check**: Is this point even within the permitted workspace? If not, it's out.
               *   **The Wall Heuristic**:  The x=0 wall is the biggie. If a candidate point and the target are on opposite sides, there’s no line of sight, so that's a no-go. I’ll also exclude candidate points inside the wall itself, to avoid any collision.
               *   **Collision Detection**: I've got to ensure the robot base doesn't collide with any of the fixed obstacles.
           
           4.  **Selection**: Finally, I'll choose the best three diverse, line-of-sight-ensured positions from my list.
           
           Now, let's apply this to the specific target point you gave: (-0.95, -0.9).
           
           **Specifics for Target (-0.95, -0.9)**
           
           *   This target is clearly to the left of the x=0 wall. So, I will focus on locations where 'x' will also be less than -0.05.
           *   I will generate candidate points, and for these specific values I have found:
           
               *   Position 1:  (-2.22, 0.37)
               *   Position 2:  (-0.95, 0.1)
               *   Position 3:  (-0.95, -1.9)
           
           These are my final, strategic recommendations for the robot base positions.  They cover different quadrants and ensure that the robot can view the target while avoiding any physical obstructions and maintaining a line of sight.
