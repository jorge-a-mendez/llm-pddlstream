           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.232, 0.214, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.132, 0.991).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.105, 0.339, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.933, -0.36).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.067, -0.334), (0.142, -0.259)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.275, 0.171), (-0.189, 0.257)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.154, 0.29), (-0.056, 0.389)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.105, -0.296, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.681, 0.732).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all currently supported by `v11`. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but only `v4` is given in the `kin` predicates. The robot's base is at `v3` and `v4`'s arm is at `v5`. `v11`'s AABB is `((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6))`. `v16`'s AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Since all objects are on `v11` and the goal is to move them to `v16`, the plan will involve picking each object from its current location on `v11` and placing it on `v16`. `v11` is larger than `v16`.
           The current poses of `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, all on `v11`.
           The target pose for all objects on `v16` is `#o2`.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           2. Place `v8` on `#o2` on `v16`.
           3. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           4. Place `v12` on `#o2` on `v16`.
           5. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           6. Place `v14` on `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The base configuration `#o3` is required for the `kin` facts, which is generated for picking and placing. Since the robot starts at `v3`, and the kin relations indicate that a new base configuration `#o3` is used, the base will implicitly move to `#o3` and back to `v3` as needed. The cost function will prioritize minimizing travel distance for the base, but since all pick/place actions use the same `#o3` and `#o0` bmotion, those move costs are implicitly handled by the choice of pick/place actions. The problem statement does not provide any information on how to choose `bconf` for picking and placing, so `o3` which has `basemotion` from `v3` to `o3` and vice versa, must be used.
           
           The bounding box of `v16` is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. The object `v8` has AABB `((0.067, -0.334), (0.142, -0.259))`. This object is wider than `v16` along the y-axis, but not so much as to make a stable placement impossible. It can be placed at a pose that places it in the center or a corner of `v16`. The x and y values for all objects should be chosen such that they are within the `v16`'s bounds and don't collide with each other. A simple approach is to spread them out slightly. Since they are all small, they can fit on `v16`.

           (#o2 v14 v16): (0.0 0.05 0.781 0.0)

User:      Pose #o2 = (0.0 -0.1 0.781 0.0) for object v12 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.035, -0.13500000149011612), upper=(0.035, -0.06500000149011612))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The previous plan failed because the provided pose for `v12` on `v16` was not stable. The bounding box of `v12` `((-0.154, 0.29), (-0.056, 0.389))` needs to be placed on `v16` `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` such that it is fully contained. This means the object should be shifted to be within the bounds of `v16`. Since `v12` is relatively small, it can fit comfortably within `v16`. The previous attempt had a y-coordinate of -0.1, and its AABB range was `(-0.135, -0.065)` when rotated, which is within the bounds of `v16`. However, based on the error, the AABB given for `v12` in the error message is `(lower=(-0.035, -0.13500000149011612), upper=(0.035, -0.06500000149011612))`. This means the provided AABB for `v12` `((-0.154, 0.29), (-0.056, 0.389))` in the problem description is not the AABB being used for the collision checking for `v12`, but rather a different one (probably the AABB of the actual object in its original frame).
           
           Assuming the error message's AABB `(lower=(-0.035, -0.135), upper=(0.035, -0.065))` for `v12` is correct for collision checking at an angle of 0.0, the object has a width of 0.07 along x and 0.07 along y (0.135-0.065 = 0.07). The new coordinates should make sure these dimensions are within `v16`'s `(-0.135, 0.135)` bounds.
           
           Let's try placing the objects at the center of `v16`, spread out slightly in the x-direction.
           For `v8`, current AABB is `((0.067, -0.334), (0.142, -0.259))`. This object is also small. We'll use a rotated version to estimate the AABB, but since the error messages do not indicate any specific rotation or size, we assume it's just the dimensions in the given `AABB` or a simple center-point for estimation.
           
           Let's try the following placement:
           `v8`: centered on `v16` at x=-0.06, y=0.0
           `v12`: centered on `v16` at x=0.0, y=0.0
           `v14`: centered on `v16` at x=0.06, y=0.0
           
           Let's adjust the `y` positions of `v8`, `v12`, `v14` on `v16` to ensure stability based on the general idea of putting them within `v16`'s bounds and not colliding with each other. The `v16` surface has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For `v12`, using the error-provided AABB, if placed at `(0.0, 0.0)`, its bounding box for `y` is `(-0.065, 0.065)` and `x` is `(-0.035, 0.035)`, which is well within `v16`'s bounds.
           Let's try to arrange them to avoid collision, spreading them along the x-axis, using a 0 rotation.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf(v35)` was not satisfied. This indicates that a base configuration `v35` was expected, but `v3` was the initial base configuration. The `kin` relations provided in the initial state mention `#o3` for the base configuration. The available action instances for `move_base` show `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)`. This means we need to explicitly move the base to `#o3` before picking and placing, and then perhaps back to `v3` if the problem requires it (though the goal does not specify `atbconf(v3)`). Since the `kin` facts all use `#o3`, we must move to `#o3`.
           
           Let's modify the plan to include `move_base` actions to go to `#o3` before the first pick, and then the robot can operate from `#o3` for all pick and place operations. We don't need to return to `v3` as the goal does not require it.
