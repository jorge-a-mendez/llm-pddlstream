(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable locations for an object (ID 5, dimensions roughly 0.078 x 0.078) on a rectangular surface defined by the AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  This requires determining tuples of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, where the object is fully contained within the surface.  Since the object is almost a square, I plan to leverage this by strategically selecting a limited number of orientations (`theta`) and then generating placements within those orientations.
           
           Here's my thinking:
           
           1.  **Understanding the Constraints:** The object must remain entirely within the bounds of the surface.  This means its AABB, after rotation, must not extend beyond the surface's limits.  I need to compute the *effective* width (`W_eff`) and height (`H_eff`) of the rotated object's AABB for any given rotation (`theta`).  The formulas for `W_eff` and `H_eff` are:
               *   `W_eff = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))`
               *   `H_eff = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`
               where `obj_w` and `obj_h` are the object's dimensions.
           
           2.  **Strategic Orientation Selection:** Because the object is almost square, there will be minimal variation in `W_eff` and `H_eff` across a range of angles. I'll pick two angles to provide a representative distribution on the surface.
               *   **`theta = 0` (and `pi`):** This aligns the object's AABB directly with its given dimensions.  This offers an easier to calculate safe area.
               *   **`theta = pi/4`:**  This corresponds to a 45-degree rotation, which results in the largest *effective* dimensions for the object's bounding box.
           
           3.  **Calculating Valid Placement Regions:**  For each selected orientation:
               *   I'll calculate `W_eff` and `H_eff` using the formulas above.
               *   I'll determine the valid range for the object's center coordinates (`x`, `y`) by accounting for the effective AABB dimensions and the surface boundaries:
                   *   `surf_lower_x + W_eff / 2 <= x <= surf_upper_x - W_eff / 2`
                   *   `surf_lower_y + H_eff / 2 <= y <= surf_upper_y - H_eff / 2`
           
           4.  **Generating Placement Grids:** I will generate a 5x5 grid of evenly spaced placement points within the calculated valid ranges.  Because I have two strategies, two different 5x5 grids are created, giving a total of 50 placements.  The object ID is 5.
           
           5.  **Output:** Provide a list of 50 tuples `(0, theta, x, y)`. The rationale for this approach is included.
           
           This strategy will generate 50 well-distributed and stable placements, all while considering and accommodating the constraint of object containment. No previous object placements need to be considered.

(Thoughts: **My current focus is on strategically placing a new, nearly square object (ID 4) onto a surface (0) while strictly avoiding collision with a pre-existing object (ID 5).**  Object 5 is already situated at (-0.096, -0.096) with zero rotation (theta = 0), and its dimensions are (0.078, 0.078).  Object 4, which measures (0.083, 0.083), needs to find 50 stable placements on the surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           First, I precisely calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of object 5.  Given its location and rotation, object 5's AABB occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface, spanning from x = -0.135 to -0.057 and y = -0.135 to -0.057.
           
           Next, I determined the valid placement space for object 4. The initial constraint is the surface bounds.  Using both zero- and pi/4-rotation possibilities, the calculation resulted in valid center ranges for x and y coordinates.
           
           The crucial step involved calculating the "no-go" zone, or the colliding region, to ensure no overlap with object 5's AABB.  By carefully computing the collision scenarios, I created a collision-free placement strategy.  I divided the space into collision-free regions, specifically focusing on the top and right sides of the available space, and used precise formulas to generate a 5x5 grid of valid (x,y) coordinates within these non-colliding regions for theta 0 and theta pi/4. I then plan to combine these results to satisfy the 50 desired placements. I will rigorously verify these coordinates for both object rotations to ensure no intersections.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've developed to find 50 stable placements for object 6 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects 4 and 5:**
           
           First, I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for objects 4 and 5. This helps determine the "forbidden zones" where object 6 can't be placed without overlapping. I've also defined the valid placement area on surface 0, which is a square bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).
           
           To place the object, I'll consider two orientations: `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees). For each orientation, I determined the object's effective dimensions and valid placement ranges based on the surface boundaries.
           
           Then I considered the forbidden regions and found the zones where Object 6's center *could* collide with the existing objects 4 and 5.  This analysis showed that for `theta=0`, the forbidden area is approximately `[-0.0888, -0.0056]` x `[-0.0888, 0.0719]`.  And, for `theta=pi/4`, the right half of the surface is mostly forbidden.
           
           So, I will generate a 5x5 grid in the region where there are no collisions.
           
           For theta=0:
           I will generate a 5x5 grid in the region, centered vertically.
           X: `[-0.005684427288081774, 0.08882292696808177]`
           Y: `[-0.08882292696808174, 0.08882292696808174]`

           I believe this dual-orientation approach will produce diverse, collision-free placements, fulfilling the requirement for 50 stable placements.
