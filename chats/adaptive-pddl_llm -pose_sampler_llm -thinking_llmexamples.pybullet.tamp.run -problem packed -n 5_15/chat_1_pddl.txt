           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal state of having several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) on `v20`. This requires that each object be supported by `v20` and be at a specific pose, as defined by the axiom `on(?o, ?r) <=> supported(?o, ?p, ?r) AND atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           Initially, all of these objects are on `v11`, with associated `atpose` facts indicating their positions. To move them, I need to find a pose for each object such that `supported(vX, p, v20)` is true and then ensure `atpose(vX, p)` is true.
           
           The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Since the goal does not involve cleaning or cooking, I only consider the first three. The only base configuration I am able to work with is `v3`.
           
           I examined the `supported` facts and have determined the poses on `v20` that are compatible with the objects.  I now need to get each object on to those poses.
           
           The problem lies with the robot's ability to reach the necessary configurations for picking and placing. The available `kin` facts indicate that the robot's arm (v4) can reach the desired poses from base configuration `#o3`. However, the current base configuration is `v3`, and there is no way to reach `#o3` using the only `move_base` action available (which does nothing). This is the constraint which blocks me from progressing.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions both require `atbconf(?q)`, where ?q is `#o3` based on the `kin` facts.  Since the base configuration is currently `v3` and cannot be moved, the preconditions for picking and placing cannot be met.
           
           Thus, because the only `move_base` action available does not result in a new valid base configuration which the robot can use to pick objects, the robot will be unable to satisfy the conditions for any `pick` or `place` action. Consequently, the preconditions of the goal cannot be satisfied because the objects cannot be moved to their goal locations. I conclude that the goal is unattainable given the current robot state and available actions.
