(Thoughts: **My Plan for Achieving `Atom new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out a plan to make `Atom new-axiom@0()` true.  Based on the axiom definitions, that means I need to get an object, which I'll call `?green`, to be both *on* something (`v18`) and of a certain *type* (`v17`).
           
           Now, looking at the initial state and the properties of the objects, I can see that `v12` has the type `v17` already. So, I can use `v12` as my `?green` object and I'll need to make sure that `v12` is on `v18`.  
           
           The *on* relationship is defined as an object being at a pose supported by the other object.   My intuition is telling me I'll need to *pick* and *place* `v12`.   I can see that `v12` is *supported* at pose `#o2` by `v18`. So if I can get `v12` to `#o2`, I should be good.  Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           From what I can see, I have to pick up `v12`, which is currently at `v13`, and place it on `v18`, with the pose `#o2`. I need to execute `pick` and `place` actions, but my robot needs to be in a certain base configuration to do that.  This means I need to move the base *before* picking.   The `kin` facts and other base configuration initial facts tell me I have a `move_base` action that can move my base configuration to `#o3`.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** I'll first *move* my robot to base configuration `#o3` so I can reach `v12` at pose `v13` to pick it.
           2.  **Pick up `v12`:** I'll *pick* up `v12` using the available grasp `#o1` from its current pose `v13`.
           3.  **Place `v12` on `v18`:** I'll *place* `v12` at pose `#o2`.
           
           I've carefully checked all the preconditions for all of the actions, and I'm fairly certain this should do the trick to satisfy the goal. I'm going to proceed assuming no unsafe conditions or trajectory problems.
