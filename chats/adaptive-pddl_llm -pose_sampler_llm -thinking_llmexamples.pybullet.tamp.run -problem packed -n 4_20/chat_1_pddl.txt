           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning:**
           
           Okay, I need to devise a plan to stack four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, onto `v18`.  My initial state analysis is crucial:  I've got two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and the one I'm concerned with, `v4`, is currently hand-empty.  The base configuration is fixed at `v3`, which is essential. These objects are all graspable and stackable, and they're initially supported by `v11`.  The target is to get them all on `v18`.  Essentially, the plan involves picking the objects from their current poses supported by v11, and placing them at the appropriate pose on v18.
           
           **Goal Decomposition and Action Selection:**
           
           The key here is the `on` axiom: `on(?o, ?r)` means I need to support an object at a certain pose. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find a pose (`#o2`) that `v8` can be placed at so that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true. The same logic applies to `v12`, `v14` and `v16`. Since I'm working with a robot, I need to move these objects.  I can't `clean` or `cook`. I can only `pick` and `place` using the available `kin` facts and arm configurations. The available `move_base` action indicates that I'm staying put at `v3`.
           
           **Plan Refinement - Pick, Place**
           
           So, for each object, I'll need a "pick" action, and a "place" action.  For instance, for `v8`:
           1.  **Pick:**  Get `v8` from its current location (`v9`) on `v11`.
           2.  **Place:**  Put `v8` at a new pose, `#o2`, on `v18`.
           
           The `kin` predicates provide the necessary information for the `pick` and `place` actions, using arm `v4`.  The `kin` facts also use `#o1` (a grasp), `#o3` (the base configuration), and `#o4` (the arm trajectory) and these have been provided to me. The constraints mean that all movements must be relative to bconf `v3`. I need to ensure that the base configuration for pick and place operations is `v3`.
           
           **Detailed Action Sequencing and Constraints:**
           
           I'm confident `v3` will work for `#o3` (base configuration).  Therefore, The plan involves picking each object from its initial location, then placing it on v18.  The key is the `kin` facts, which are all present for me to use in both the `pick` and `place` actions.  I'm interpreting `#o2` as a specific pose for placement, the same pose for all the objects. Although a literal interpretation might allow for different poses, I'm assuming that it is the same. The objects are:
           
           *   `v8`: From `v9` on `v11` to `#o2` on `v18`.
           *   `v12`: From `v13` on `v11` to `#o2` on `v18`.
           *   `v14`: From `v15` on `v11` to `#o2` on `v18`.
           *   `v16`: From `v17` on `v11` to `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           I'm checking that the preconditions are correct for each action, verifying all the preconditions such as hand empty and atbconf are satisfied.
           
           The final plan is to execute a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions using the information about arm kinematics. This assumes `#o3` is `v3` for simplicity and for the plan to function.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Problem with This Plan**
           
           Okay, so I understand the problem. The user's telling me that the plan I came up with is invalid. It looks like my actions weren't in the acceptable set. Specifically, the only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's... restrictive.
           
           The goal is to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all *on* `v18`.  Thinking this through, to achieve an `on(?o, ?r)` predicate, I need two things:  `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` (meaning the object is supported *on* the new position, *r*, by grasp *p*), and `atpose(?o, ?p)` (meaning the object is at the grasp *p*).
           
           Initially, all these objects are at their original poses on `v11`, right? So I have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and similarly for the other objects.  My plan was clearly based on manipulating the `atpose` of the objects – using `pick` and `place` actions, which change where the objects are placed -  to get them to `v18`. For instance, to get `v8` *on* `v18`, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. The crucial fact `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, so I simply need `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           But, here's the rub: I *only* have access to `move_base`.  This action does nothing useful. It just keeps me at the same `atbconf`. It doesn't alter `atpose` at all, nor does it affect `handempty`, `atgrasp`, or `holding` states.  It also removes `canmove()`, which is a constraint I did not initially consider.
           
           Since I can't `pick` or `place` any of the objects with the allowed action `move_base`, I can't possibly change their current `atpose` from their initial locations on `v11` to the desired positions on `v18`.  Therefore, I've got a fundamental problem. The goal of placing all these objects *on* `v18` is simply *unachievable* given the limited action set I have.
