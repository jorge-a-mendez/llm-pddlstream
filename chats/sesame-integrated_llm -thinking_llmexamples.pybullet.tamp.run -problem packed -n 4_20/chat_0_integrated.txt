           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Problem Breakdown and Planning for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from surface v11 to surface v18 using a robot arm (v4). The robot is initially at base configuration v3 and the arm is handempty. My goal is to achieve the state where each object is 'on' v18.
           
           **Key Considerations:**
           
           *   **Stable Placement:** The crucial constraint is that the placement of each object on v18 must be "stable." This means each object's bounding box must fully fit within the bounding box of v18. The geometry is provided in the form of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs).
           *   **Sequential Actions:** I have only one robot arm. Since the `handempty` effect of the `place` action means the robot can only hold one object at a time, I must move each object sequentially. The actions available are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`.
           *   **The Shared Pose:** A problematic aspect of the initial state is that it describes all objects being placed on the same pose `#o2`. I must interpret this as each object being placed in a distinct pose in practice.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move Base (If Needed):** Check if the base needs to move from initial position v3 to the pick/place base pose `#o3`. Since the kin facts are specific to `#o3`, I'll start by assuming the base must move, costing `distance(v3, #o3)`.
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:** For each object (v8, v12, v14, v16):
               *   Pick the object from its initial position using arm v4.
               *   Place the object at a unique position, `#o2`, on surface v18 using arm v4.
           
           **Challenges and Solutions:**
           
           *   **Stable Placement and Bounding Box Geometry:** I have to be careful with where to move and place. The bounding boxes for v8, v12, v14, and v16 are larger than or extend outside the bounds of surface v18. However, after careful interpretation, I understand the AABB coordinates are local and will need to provide the translation for those. I will choose a valid pose that is within v18's AABB.
           *   **Conflicting Shared Pose:** The problem states I need to specify separate continuous values for `#o2` for each object, even though all objects must go to the same pose symbol. I interpret this to mean that the poses need to be close to one another but distinct, or else they would collide. The value of `#o2` also describes a rotation, which must also be stable.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Instantiation**
           
           I must provide concrete values (x, y, z, theta) for these parameters:
           
           *   `#o2`: Target pose for each object on v18: I will place the objects in a 2x2 grid on v18 for easy, stable, and collision-free placement with a height of 0.781. The rotation will be 0 radians.
           *   `#o3`: Base configuration. I will set the base position to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). I assume this position enables the robot to reach all target locations (close to the target surface, in the vicinity of the objects), but the environment may require specific values depending on the range of the arm.
           *   The other parameters that start with '#' will be determined by the specific algorithm the robot planning engine will run in the plan.
           *   Since I need to provide different poses for each object with the same target value, and the initial state already dictates poses for objects, I'll interpret each `(obj #o2 v18)` as a pose relative to surface v18, placing objects close to each other so the action succeeds. The pose `#o2` is the same symbol for each object in the initial setup, but I will provide distinct poses per the instructions, giving different x,y values for each and making z = 0.781 to ensure each is on the surface.
           
           **Collision Avoidance:**
           
           I must arrange the pick and place locations in order to maintain collision-free operations. I assumed no obstacles, but I must provide the 4x distinct pose locations and confirm that such positions work and are within valid ranges.
           
           **Final Plan and Positional Parameters**
           
           In the instructions I must now provide x, y, z, theta for each object that is placed:
           
           1.  `(#o3): 0.0 0.0 0.0`
           2.  `(#o2 v8 v
