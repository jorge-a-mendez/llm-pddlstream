User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Position Generation for Robot Base**
           
           My primary task is to devise 25 suitable (x, y) coordinates for a robot base, given a specific target point. These base positions must adhere to certain constraints: they have to be within a 4-meter radius of the target, situated within a 2.5 x 2.5 meter area centered at the origin, and possess an automatic orientation towards the target. Crucially, I must avoid a set of fixed obstacles and be able to provide a diverse set of valid locations.
           
           The input obstacles are AABBs. I'll need to interpret the room geometry. The critical element is the central vertical wall (x=0), as it obstructs line-of-sight if the base and the target are not on the same side.
           
           My initial approach is to focus on a polar coordinate system centered on the target point and systematically filter candidate positions. Initially, points near to the target will be prioritized, and then an expanding radius will provide more positions. This helps create a diverse set of positions while remaining close to the target, a critical aspect. Any positions too close to an obstacle or outside the feasible area will be immediately discarded. 
           
           The approach must address edge cases, primarily due to the central wall. I will ensure that the robot base resides on the side of the central wall opposite the target, guaranteeing a clear line of sight.
           
           Additional measures include applying a safety margin around obstacles, accounting for the robot's physical size. I intend to sample locations at regular intervals to achieve a well-distributed and representative set of positions. If an initial strategy fails, more positions are generated. I have a plan for random sampling if all else fails.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's the plan for generating those 25 base positions for the robot to view the target point (0.125, -0.125).** I've got a lot to consider to make sure these positions are valid and useful.
           
           First, I need to stick to the rules. The robot's base can't be more than 4 meters away from the target, and it has to stay within the environment's boundaries (x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]).  But, I'm applying a safety margin of 0.1 meters, effectively keeping the robot within x: [-2.4, 2.4] and y: [-2.4, 2.4] to account for its physical footprint.  Crucially, the robot needs a clear line of sight to the target, meaning it must be positioned to the right of the central wall (x > 0.05).  I'll add another safety margin of 0.1 meters to that, so the robot's center has to be at x > 0.15.  Also, these positions have to avoid a list of fixed obstacles that I've been given, and I have to be careful with the inflated obstacles.
           
           I'm assuming this is a fresh request, so I can't rely on any previous positions I generated, even if they looked good before. I need to make sure I am generating *different* positions.
           
           The `is_position_valid` function is the core of this whole process. It's my gatekeeper. It checks each proposed position against all the rules. It uses the `is_collision_with_obstacle` function to determine if a collision is detected.
           
           Here's how I'm going to find these positions: I'll start by doing a polar sampling around the target. I'll test several radii at different angles.  I'll use higher angular resolution to increase chances of finding valid positions. If that still doesn't get me enough valid spots, I'll fall back to random sampling within the valid region.
           
           During the random sampling, the x coordinates are from `0.05 + safety_margin` to `2.5 - safety_margin` and y coordinates from `-2.5 + safety_margin` to `2.5 - safety_margin`
           
           Finally, since the problem states I never give up, I'll return what I've got, even if it's less than 25.
