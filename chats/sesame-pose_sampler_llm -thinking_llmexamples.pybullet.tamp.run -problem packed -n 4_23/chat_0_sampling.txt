(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7, a square with side approximately 0.09875, on surface 0, a square with side 0.27.  A placement is "stable" if the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is *fully* contained within the surface's AABB.  This is straightforward enough geometrically.
           
           The key to this problem lies in the rotation of the square. A square's AABB changes with rotation; it's smallest when aligned with the axes (0 or 90 degrees rotation) and largest when rotated by 45 degrees. I need to account for this. The instructions state "axis-aligned bounding box", not an oriented bounding box which is something else.
           
           First, I calculate the maximum possible AABB size of the square. That is, the diagonal times the side of the square and divide by 2 for the bounds of the valid (x,y) locations within the surface. The surface has a bounds that I have simplified as x_lim.
           
           My strategy will be to systematically vary the object's rotation angle (theta) from 0 to Pi/2 radians. And at each rotation, the bounding box of the square changes. I can take several sample points by dividing the largest range into 10 equally spaced segments. For each angle, I calculate the x_lim (and y_lim), then I take a selection of stable points by checking which fit into that x_lim.
           
           For the initial state (theta=0), the range is quite large, so I need to place a higher density of points. But at an angle that will diminish, so the density can also be less. I'll test at the center and edges of each, so I am able to guarantee placement coverage.
           
           I've carefully calculated the limits of x and y for different rotation angles to ensure stability. I've also verified the math. I think this approach guarantees I'll find 50 valid, *stable*, and diverse placements, no matter what the scene geometry may turn out to be.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 4, that needs a stable placement on surface 0, and crucially, it *cannot* collide with the existing object, ID 7.  The challenge is that object 7 is already smack-dab in the center, and object 4 is a square of a specific size.
           
           First, I had to ensure previous object (ID:7) placement was successful.
           
           The surface is a square, 0.27m x 0.27m, and I've got the dimensions of object 4 (a square, 0.0737m on each side). I also know the coordinates of object 7 (it's at the origin).
           
           My primary thought is to find 50 *valid* spots for this new object, ID 4. This means checking that it doesn't run into object 7 and staying within the surface's boundaries.
           
           Initially, I start with `theta = 0`, but the key insight is that *some* rotations won't work at all due to the object's size and the existing object's location.
           
           To make this placement work, I need to know how large the object's *bounding box* is based on the rotation angle.  A key calculation will be `s4_effective = s4 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This tells me the size of the square object's *effective* AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for a given rotation.  The goal is to keep object 4's bounding box well away from object 7's AABB.
           
           Since, both the object to be placed and the obstacle are squares, then there can be only 4 effective rotations to place this object safely. Any angles outside this range would have an effective bounding box too large to find a valid placement location.
           
           To put it more formally:
           *   I'll calculate `x_surf_lim` (the limits of the available space on surface 0) based on `theta`.
           *   I'll calculate `x_coll_lim` which is the threshold for how *close* I can place object 4 without a collision (the size of object 7 plus half of the effective size of object 4).
           
           Then, I need to make sure the center coordinate is either too far to the left, right, top, or bottom to avoid collision. Then I've got it.
           
           So, I'm generating 50 positions using x, y coordinates, and rotation `theta=0` or `theta=PI/2`. The coordinates are selected such that they are within the available space but are away from the center such that they don't collide.
           
           The points I select are either far on the horizontal, the vertical, or the diagonal. I do this by measuring the bounding box, then place the object further from the center than it. The corners are also valid.
           
           I am using `0, PI/2` as they will provide a good distribution with the calculations already made.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 5**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got to place Object 5, that little square with its side of 0.084, a solid 50 times on Surface 0.  But, and this is crucial, I have to avoid crashing into Object 7, a smaller square already there, and Object 4, another square situated a bit off-center.
           
           I'm zeroing in on a *strategic approach* for this placement. I know that rotating Object 5 changes its effective size.  To keep things simple, I'm thinking of focusing on rotations of 0 and 90 degrees. I figure I'll get enough variety with those two.
           
           First thing: staying within the bounds of Surface 0. Easy, right?  The center of Object 5 can't drift past a certain point.  The tricky part is taking the rotation into account for the width.  For each rotation angle, I need a specific boundary calculation (as the effective side length of the object changes depending on the rotation).
           
           Now, the collision avoidance.  Object 7 is a problem because it's right in the center. I'll need to stay a safe distance away from it, which means that the center of object 5 needs to be outside an inner square.
           
           Next, Object 4.  It's positioned off to the side, and it's even trickier because the permitted locations change based on where it is in the world.  It turns out that it creates a forbidden rectangle that I have to avoid as well.
           
           The core of my approach is to identify all areas where Object 5 can safely sit. I figured I would start by putting the 50 points into the available region, i.e. the Surface. Then, I will remove the locations in the "forbidden" region caused by Object 7 and Object 4. The available areas for Object 5 become thin rectangles around the edges of surface, that are further limited by the forbidden rectangular region formed by Object 4. So, I will create sets of coordinates and combine them to create regions:
           - Left strip: `x = -0.092`, and different `y` values.
           - Right strip: `x = 0.092`, with different `y` values.
           - Bottom strip: `y = -0.092`, with different `x` values.
           - Top strip: `y = 0.092`, with different `x` values.
           - and then two corners which are the intersections of each strip.
           
           I will iterate points to fill a list with these coordinates. Finally, I will make sure I generate 50 unique points, as this is the objective of the placement. I will use the above grid for `theta = 0` and reuse those points for `theta = PI/2`.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out the best way to place 50 stable instances of Object 6 on Surface 0, a square of size 0.27 x 0.27.  I've got a couple of pre-placed objects I need to avoid: Object 7, Object 4, and Object 5.  Object 7 is centered at (0, 0), Object 4 is at (0.09816846, 0), and Object 5 is at (-0.092, -0.09).  All these are squares, and I'm assuming Object 6 is also a square.
           
           First, I need to figure out the collision zones.  Object 7's half-size is about 0.049. Object 4's is about 0.0368 and Object 5's is about 0.042.  Object 6 has a size of 0.074.  I have to ensure stability.  For *theta = 0*, Object 6's effective half size is about 0.037.  So, I calculate how far from the surface's edges I can place Object 6's center. It's about 0.0979.
           
           To avoid collisions with Object 7, the center of Object 6 can't be too close to (0, 0), it needs to be at least 0.0864 away from (0,0). I have to avoid colliding with Object 4: Object 6's center *x* can't be in the region (0.0242, 0.097) as long as *y* is within (-0.073, 0.073). I also have to avoid Object 5: Object 6's center *x* can't be in the region (-0.0979, -0.0127) as long as *y* is within (-0.0979, -0.0107).
           
           I can simplify this. Object 7 is a cross shape in the middle. Object 4 is a rectangle along the right side. Object 5 is a rectangle along the bottom-left side. I'll need to figure out how to navigate these.
           
           After more thinking, I can break down the available placement space into four quadrants, considering the surface bounds and collision zones, focusing on points near the edges or corners. I will be looking to place points with theta = 0. So I will focus my placements.
           
           Here are the target ranges that I determined:
           - For the Top Left and Bottom right the corners are good
             - x from [-0.097,-0.087] and y from [0.087, 0.097]
             - x from [-0.097,-0.010] and y from [0, -0.010]
           
           - Far Top Right:
             - x from [0.086,0.097] and y from [0.074, 0.097]
             - x from [0, 0.025] and y from [0.076,0.097]
           
           - For the Bottom Left quadrant,  I'll want x from [-0.097,-0.087] and y from [-0.097,-0.010].
           
           Using these as targets I can generate a total of 50 stable placements, which is exactly the number requested. I am satisfied with the layout plan.

Model:     **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out the best way to place 50 stable instances of Object 6 on Surface 0, a square of size 0.27 x 0.27.  I've got a couple of pre-placed objects I need to avoid: Object 7, Object 4, and Object 5.  Object 7 is centered at (0, 0), Object 4 is at (0.09816846, 0), and Object 5 is at (-0.092, -0.09).  All these are squares, and I'm assuming Object 6 is also a square.
           
           First, I need to figure out the collision zones.  Object 7's half-size is about 0.049. Object 4's is about 0.0368 and Object 5's is about 0.042.  Object 6 has a size of 0.074.  I have to ensure stability.  For *theta = 0*, Object 6's effective half size is about 0.037.  So, I calculate how far from the surface's edges I can place Object 6's center. It's about 0.0979.
           
           To avoid collisions with Object 7, the center of Object 6 can't be too close to (0, 0), it needs to be at least 0.0864 away from (0,0). I have to avoid colliding with Object 4: Object 6's center *x* can't be in the region (0.0242, 0.097) as long as *y* is within (-0.073, 0.073). I also have to avoid Object 5: Object 6's center *x* can't be in the region (-0.0979, -0.0127) as long as *y* is within (-0.0979, -0.0107).
           
           I can simplify this. Object 7 is a cross shape in the middle. Object 4 is a rectangle along the right side. Object 5 is a rectangle along the bottom-left side. I'll need to figure out how to navigate these.
           
           After more thinking, I can break down the available placement space into four quadrants, considering the surface bounds and collision zones, focusing on points near the edges or corners. I will be looking to place points with theta = 0. So I will focus my placements.
           
           Here are the target ranges that I determined:
           - For the Top Left and Bottom right the corners are good
             - x from [-0.097,-0.087] and y from [0.087, 0.097]
             - x from [-0.097,-0.010] and y from [0, -0.010]
           
           - Far Top Right:
             - x from [0.086,0.097] and y from [0.074, 0.097]
             - x from [0, 0.025] and y from [0.076,0.097]
           
           - For the Bottom Left quadrant,  I'll want x from [-0.097,-0.087] and y from [-0.097,-0.010].
           
           Using these as targets I can generate a total of 50 stable placements, which is exactly the number requested. I am satisfied with the layout plan.
