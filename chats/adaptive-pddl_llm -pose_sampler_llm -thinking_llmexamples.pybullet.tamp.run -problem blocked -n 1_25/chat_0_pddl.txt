           Surfaces ((lower_x, lower_y), (upper_x, upper_y)):

           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I've got a square object of size `(0.07, 0.07)` and need to find 50 stable placements on a surface defined by the AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. A "stable placement" means the object's fully contained within the surface's bounds. Since the object's a square, its rotation angle (`theta`) doesn't impact its bounding box.  This means I can set `theta = 0` for simplicity and focus on finding valid `(x, y)` coordinates for the object's center.
           
           First, I calculated the valid range for `x` and `y` by considering the object's half-extents (0.035).  This results in:  `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.  Both ranges are 0.53 units long.
           
           To get 50 diverse placements, I'll create a grid within these ranges.  I'll use 8 steps for the x-coordinate and 7 steps for the y-coordinate, resulting in 56 placement combinations. This ensures a decent distribution.  I'll then discard the last 6.  I'll calculate the step sizes for `x` and `y` using the ranges and the number of steps.  I'll then calculate the exact coordinates to place the objects in their valid placements.
           
           In summary, I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates, placing an object at each coordinate within their valid ranges. I will keep the first 50 stable placements. I will not avoid any collision as this is the first request.
