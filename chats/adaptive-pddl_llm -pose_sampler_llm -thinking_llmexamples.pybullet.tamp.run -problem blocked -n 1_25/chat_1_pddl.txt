           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Due to Base Configuration Constraint**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which means placing an object (`?green`) of a specific type (`v17`) onto `v18`. I've identified two potential candidates: `v8` and `v12`, both of which satisfy `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           The crucial part is the `on(?green, v18)` requirement. This translates to needing both `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` for some pose `?p`. Both `v8` and `v12` are *potentially* supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`, according to my knowledge base. However, they are currently on different supports, `v11` and `v14` respectively.
           
           To get them onto `v18`, I need a plan that involves picking them up and placing them on `v18` at `#o2`. This requires `pick` and `place` actions.  Looking at the details of the pick action, it has some preconditions related to the base configuration, specifically `atbconf(?q)`, which *must* be `#o3` for the relevant kinematics involving the arm `v4` in order to lift the object.
           
           Unfortunately, my current base configuration is `v3`, and the only available action to change base configuration is a `move_base` action restricted to remaining in the same configuration. This means I'm stuck at `v3`, and I cannot reach `#o3` configuration, no matter what I do.
           
           Without the ability to move to `#o3`, I cannot satisfy the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition necessary for the `pick` and `place` actions using the arm `v4`. It is impossible to achieve `on(?green, v18)` under these conditions.  
           
           Therefore, given the current constraints on base movement, the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*.  My efforts are stymied because I can't reach the base configuration necessary to manipulate the objects and satisfy the target condition.
