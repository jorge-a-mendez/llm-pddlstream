(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of `type v17` be `on v18`.  We have two candidates that fit the bill: `v8` and `v12`, both of `type v17`. The crucial part is getting one of them *on* `v18`.  The `on` predicate means something has to be *supported* by `v18` and *at* a certain pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, but there's a promising situation with `v8`:  we have a pose `#p0` where it can be *supported* by `v18`.  The current pose `v9` where `v8` is located needs to be changed.
           
           Since `v8` seems more readily movable, let's go for it first. We'll need to move `v8` from its initial pose (`v9`) to `#p0`. This involves `pick` and `place` actions, and the whole idea is that the arm moves v8.
           
           To `pick` `v8`, we will choose arm `v4`, because it has the most related `kin` predicates. The action requires a grasp (`#g0`), a base configuration, an arm trajectory, and, crucially,  that the hand be empty.  Checking the preconditions, the base needs to be configured at `#q0` first (it's currently at `v3`). After a quick double-check on unsafe approaches, trajectories, and the rest, we can say that picking `v8`  is doable. The effects would be that `atgrasp` is true, canmove is true, and the pose becomes false.
           
           Once picked, we need to `place` `v8` at the goal. We have kin facts to find the target location and then, like before, we have some pre-conditions to satisfy: an empty hand, the robot at a different base configuration, and the negation of some unsafe operations. So, we'll need a base move from `#q0` to `#q1`, and then we can place.  Placing would move the pose to `#p0` and the hand will be empty.
           
           Finally, we confirm that by placing v8 at pose `#p0` we satisfy the objective and then the type predicate also becomes true and the goal is reached.
           
           The plan:
           1.  Move base to `#q0`.
           2.  Pick `v8`.
           3.  Move the base to `#q1`.
           4.  Place `v8`.
           
           The core principles and steps are pretty clean. We'll rely on the existing facts for the specific poses, grasps, and arm trajectories.  It seems sound and should achieve the objective.
