(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable locations for object ID 7, a square with sides of approximately 0.094 units, on surface 0, a square region from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and the x and y coordinates of the object's center.  Since I only have one surface (surface 0) to work with and a square object, the key will be to find a range of x and y center coordinates that allows for all rotations.
           
           To achieve this, I calculated the maximum possible size of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) after rotation. Since it's a square, its bounding box will also be square, and the maximum half-side length of this AABB occurs when the object is rotated by 45 degrees, which gives me `R_max = 0.06660144596`. To guarantee stability for any rotation, I must restrict the object's center to a smaller square region within the surface, such that `-0.06839855403510151 <= x <= 0.06839855403510151` and `-0.06839855403510151 <= y <= 0.06839855403510151`.
           
           To provide a diverse set of placements, I'll strategically vary both the x and y coordinates within the valid range and use two rotation angles.
           I'll set `theta = 0` (axis-aligned) and `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), which represents a worst-case scenario. For each theta value, I will generate 25 placements in a 5x5 grid evenly spread within the valid x and y range. This results in 50 (x, y) coordinates. These will be added to my list with the corresponding `theta` and the surf index, which remains 0 for all cases. I will output these pairs of tuples representing a set of diverse and stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Object Placement for Object ID 4**
           
           I've successfully received feedback regarding the placement of Object ID 7, which is now positioned in the scene. My current task is to place Object ID 4, a square with known dimensions, on the same surface without causing any collision with Object ID 7.
           
           Based on my understanding of the problem space, I need to take several things into consideration:
           
           1.  **Object Dimensions:** I have the size information for Object 4. From this, I've calculated the maximum radius (`R_max_4`) to consider rotation and determine the valid placement area for the center of the object on the surface.
           2.  **Surface Boundaries:** The surface boundaries act as the first constraints. The center of Object 4 must be within a certain range to fit within the surface. I have derived those boundaries by using surface extents and `R_max_4` value.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** The crucial constraint is avoiding collisions with Object 7, whose position and size are known. I must ensure the AABB of object 4 (given at any `theta`) should not overlap with the AABB of object 7.
           4.  **Collision Detection Strategy:** To check for collisions, I calculated the AABBs for both objects. Since the AABB of object 7 is a rectangular box, the process involves ensuring that the AABB of object 4 (at any rotation) does not intersect with object 7's AABB.
           
           To ensure safe placement of Object 4, I've computed the *forbidden zone*, which is the area where collision will occur.
           
           I will proceed by generating 50 possible placement locations (centers, rotations) for Object 4 to find valid placements. I'll test these locations against the 'forbidden zone' and surface bounds. Finally, I will iterate through all valid placements, with a distribution of placements in two orientations to ensure diversity.

(Thoughts: **Scene Understanding and Placement Strategy for Object ID: 8**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object 8 (ID 8) on Surface 0. This involves a careful analysis of the existing objects, ID 7 and ID 4, on this same surface. Surface 0 is a square region: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Object 7 is a square with size 0.094, positioned at (x_7, y_7) = (-0.068, -0.068), with theta_7 = 0. Its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is approximately: `[-0.1155, -0.0213] x [-0.1155, -0.0213]`.
           
           Object 4 is another square with size 0.080, located at (x_4, y_4) = (0.0355, -0.0782), also with theta_4 = 0. Its AABB is approximately: `[-0.0047, 0.0757] x [-0.1184, -0.0380]`.
           
           Object 8, the new object, is also a square with a size of 0.0818. To ensure stability, I need to keep the object centered within the surface. The maximum rotational extent of a square is at 45 degrees. The maximum radial extent is  `0.0578`. Thus, its center can't be more than 0.0579 away from any edge of the surface.
           
           I've determined that the valid center points for Object 8 must fall within `[-0.077, 0.077] x [-0.077, 0.077]`. This provides my starting valid placement area, but I need to avoid collisions with the other two objects. The bounding boxes will be expanded to account for various rotations.
           
           To find valid areas I need to account for collision, my strategy will use a conservative expansion of the object 7's AABB (and Object 4). I've calculated the forbidden regions for the center of object 8 due to Object 7 to be [-0.173, 0.0366] x [-0.173, 0.0366] and due to object 4 to be [-0.0625, 0.1336] x [-0.176, 0.0199].
           
           I have determined the valid placement strategy by excluding those regions, I will place 25 of the placements with a fixed rotation of 0, and the other 25 with a rotation of 45 degrees. I have already generated placement points in safe regions to achieve this requirement. These will make sure my solution will be collision free.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for a New Object on Surface 0**
           
           I'm focused on the challenge of placing a new, square object (ID 5) stably on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (IDs 7, 4, and 8). The surface is defined as a 0.27-unit square centered at the origin, and I need to find 50 stable placements. I'll need to consider this new object at two different orientations: aligned with the axes (0 radians) and rotated 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).
           
           First, I need to map out the available space. I've already determined the dimensions and positions of the existing objects, calculating their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each to easily detect any collision. Object 7 is close to the bottom-left, Object 4 is near the bottom-right, and Object 8 sits in the top-left area. 
           
           I've determined that the placement of ID 5 will be "stable" (not falling over) if it has a center that falls within the available, non-colliding space. This can be framed as a problem of finding 50 unique coordinates, 25 for 0 radians and 25 for pi/4 radians.
           
           For each, I determine the boundaries of collision, and what coordinate values are "forbidden", then establish viable regions for placement. After the collision bounds are determined, I can define appropriate non-overlapping clear regions that represent x- and y-coordinate values that avoid overlap with any existing objects.
           
           I've carefully considered two strategies: generating a grid of candidate points and checking for collisions and identifying these "safe regions" based on the x and y ranges. I calculated safe, collision-free zones in this space. I can use these zones to sample 50 points, 25 in each orientation, and generate a final set of stable placements.
