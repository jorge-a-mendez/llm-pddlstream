(Thoughts: **Placing a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface (Surface 0). The object's dimensions are roughly 0.082 x 0.082 units, and Surface 0 is defined by the corners (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Since both the object and the surface are square, the object's orientation (theta) doesn't change its bounding box (AABB) dimensions, but I still need to vary theta for a more interesting solution. The object has to be entirely within the surface.
           
           I've calculated the valid ranges for the center coordinates (x, y) of the object's AABB: they must be within [-0.094, 0.094] for both x and y.  With the valid area in mind, I need to create 50 placements.  I'll start by generating a 7x7 grid (49 placements) to ensure good coverage of the available surface area. I will then add an extra data point.
           
           The grid generation strategy: For the placements, I'll create a 7x7 grid, assigning unique x and y positions. I'll make the steps from `x_min_valid` to `x_max_valid` and from `y_min_valid` to `y_max_valid`. Then, I'll generate the grid with values in this range.
           The x step will be: `(x_max_v - x_min_v) / 6`, or `0.03138531499461303`, and the same for y. For theta, I'll cycle through a few key angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll put it at the center (0, 0) and use a slightly different theta, to have an evenly spaced rotation value.
           
           Based on the calculations, I believe this strategy should yield a good distribution of placements within the constraints.  The object is definitely smaller than the surface.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface ID 0, and there's already an object (ID 4) in place at (0, 0.0, -0.094, -0.094).  I *must* avoid collisions with object 4, which is essentially a square of size 0.081, centered at -0.094 in both x and y.
           
           First, I figured out the valid placement region on the surface for object 6, which is also a square (0.096 size). Surface 0 has dimensions of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), so object 6 can be centered anywhere within a smaller square centered at the origin, with side length 0.086.
           
           Then came the crucial part: accounting for object 4. I calculated object 4's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box).  Object 4's AABB extends from -0.135 to -0.053 in both x and y.  To avoid a collision, object 6's AABB *cannot* overlap with this.
           
           That means object 6's center can't be in a small, forbidden rectangular region in the bottom-left corner of the larger valid placement square.  This collision region is defined by an x-range from -0.086 to -0.005 and a y-range from -0.086 to -0.005.
           
           So, the game plan is this: I'll divide the valid space into two regions for object 6's center. Region A: The upper portion of the available space, where y coordinates are greater than -0.005 (thus avoiding collision in y), and Region B: The right side where x is greater than -0.005 (again, avoiding collision). To ensure diversity in my placements, I will distribute 25 points in a grid over Region A and 25 points in a grid over Region B. The grid points are calculated precisely to fit within the valid regions. I'll then cycle through four different angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4 radians) for object 6 at each of the 50 positions.

(Thoughts: **Planning Placement of Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable positions for Object ID 5, a square with sides of approximately 0.083 units, on Surface 0. I must avoid collisions with previously placed objects, Object ID 4 and Object ID 6, while respecting the boundaries of Surface 0.
           
           **Analysis:**
           
           First, I define the allowable region for the center of Object 5 on Surface 0, taking into account the object's size. Then, I calculate the collision regions based on the known positions and sizes of Object 4 and Object 6, using their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). The "forbidden" regions, where the center of Object 5 cannot be placed, are determined by these collision regions. I then establish the overall possible space and forbidden space for placing Object ID 5.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           The surface area is effectively divided into two main regions. The largest, region 1, will have the center of object 5, and the smaller, region 2. Both will include 25 placements. For a uniform strategy, I will use a 5x5 grid in both regions, and calculate the x and y coordinates. A good strategy for placing the objects uniformly through the surface is to spread the objects equally in both the x and y directions.
           
           After calculating the regions and placements, I will generate the final locations.
