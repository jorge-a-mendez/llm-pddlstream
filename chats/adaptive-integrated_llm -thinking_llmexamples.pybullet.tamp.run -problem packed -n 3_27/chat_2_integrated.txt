User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.148, -0.238, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.716, 0.698).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.017, 0.329, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.089, 0.996).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.15, 0.311, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.706, 0.708).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.183, -0.274), (-0.112, -0.202)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.057, 0.288), (0.024, 0.369)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.185, 0.276), (-0.115, 0.346)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get these objects where they need to be. The goal is to get v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. Simple enough, right?  The catch is, I need to use the robot's arm (v4) to do it, and I have to define *specific* placement poses for each object on v16.  This isn't just about getting them *on* the surface, it's about defining *where* on the surface they go.
           
           First, I looked at the initial state.  v8, v12, and v14 are currently on v11 at the poses v9, v13, and v15, respectively. The target, v16, offers multiple potential poses (indicated by #o2). The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 has the relevant 'kin' facts defined (which I need for the actions).  Both arms are currently handempty. The robot's base is at bconf v3, and canmove() is true.
           
           The plan itself is straightforward: I'll pick up each object from v11 and place it on v16.  I need a `move_base` action too, because the 'kin' facts are provided relative to base configuration #o3, but my initial state has the base at v3. The actions are: `pick` and `place` using arm v4.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll need to move the robot base from its current configuration, v3, to the required configuration, #o3, with `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`. This is necessary for the following actions, the  `pick` and `place`.
           
           2.  **Object Placement Loop:** I'll repeat the following sequence for each object (v8, v12, and v14):
               *   **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to pick the object with the `v4` arm from its current pose on v11, for example, `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
               *   **Place:** Then use the `place` action to place the picked object on v16 at the pose I define, for example,  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. Remember, #o2 is a *parameter* here.
           
           The crucial part is the #o2 parameter.  Because the prompt says I need distinct positions for each object when it's placed on the target surface, I *must* define separate and specific continuous values for the #o2 pose for each object. The coordinate system is Cartesian (x,y,z) with angles expressed in radians, with (x,y) representing a position on a surface and `z` the height over that surface.
           
           **Crucially, I need to provide values for #o2 as:**
           
           *   `(#o2 v8 v16): (-0.08 -0.05 0.781 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v12 v16): (0.0 0.05 0.781 0.0)`
           *   `(#o2 v14 v16): (0.08 -0.05 0.781 0.0)`
           
           These are within the boundaries of v16, given the assumptions. The poses will also be collision-free with respect to the objects themselves.
           
           The overall goal is achieved when all objects are placed correctly. The `supported` fact in the initial state, along with the correct `atpose` in the plan, guarantees that `on(obj, v16)` will be true. The robot can handle this task using the `pick` and `place` action, given all preconditions are satisfied. The solution is thus optimized for this specific context, using what's available and guaranteed, and with continuous values where requested.
