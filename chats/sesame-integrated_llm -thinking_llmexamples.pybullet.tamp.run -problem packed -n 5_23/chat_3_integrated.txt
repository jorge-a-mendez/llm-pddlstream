           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v14', 'p12', 'v8', 'p10')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Solving the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking to solve this problem.  I'm given a scenario where I need to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current positions on surface v11 to surface v20.  The main challenge is avoiding collisions, specifically because a previous plan failed when placing two objects too close together on v20.
           
           First, I looked at the initial setup and the goal: place each object "on" v20.  I know I'll be using "pick" and "place" actions. I need to figure out the right locations (poses) on v20 for each object. The problem gave me some hints. The previous plan failed with objects v8 (a rectangle) and v14 (a square), specifically at poses p10 and p12.
           
           I immediately analyzed the key issue – **collision avoidance**.  I know I have two arms (v4 and v6) and both are empty, so let’s use v4. The simulator, or the problem description, provides us with information about object AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes).  I knew I had to use these details about their shape, along with the positions and orientation to prevent any collisions during object placement.  The object's poses are their center, origin, so I need to account for the object being centered at the specified pose, with their bounding box around it.
           
           Because of the previous failure, I knew the existing poses, p10 through p14, were likely too close. So I needed to generate new poses, which the task suggested using `#o2`. I analyzed the existing plan and the AABB definitions, and understood that the given poses p10-p14 were arranged on the x-axis, separated by a distance of 0.03 units. Since I know my bounding boxes of objects extend on an y-axis, and all objects are at the same y-value when these are placed, they are guaranteed to have overlaps with these given poses.
           
           I then realized I needed to carefully calculate new poses for each object to ensure there's enough space. I considered using a grid-like arrangement, 2 rows of 2 or 3 objects, trying to fit all 5 objects while staying within the boundaries of v20. I analyzed and computed the x and y ranges for each object when placed at various poses, and I computed whether these would cause any kind of collision. 
           
           I carefully examined the object dimensions and the surface boundaries of v20 (`[-0.135, 0.135]`).

Model:     **My Reasoning for Solving the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking to solve this problem.  I'm given a scenario where I need to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current positions on surface v11 to surface v20.  The main challenge is avoiding collisions, specifically because a previous plan failed when placing two objects too close together on v20.
           
           First, I looked at the initial setup and the goal: place each object "on" v20.  I know I'll be using "pick" and "place" actions. I need to figure out the right locations (poses) on v20 for each object. The problem gave me some hints. The previous plan failed with objects v8 (a rectangle) and v14 (a square), specifically at poses p10 and p12.
           
           I immediately analyzed the key issue – **collision avoidance**.  I know I have two arms (v4 and v6) and both are empty, so let’s use v4. The simulator, or the problem description, provides us with information about object AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes).  I knew I had to use these details about their shape, along with the positions and orientation to prevent any collisions during object placement.  The object's poses are their center, origin, so I need to account for the object being centered at the specified pose, with their bounding box around it.
           
           Because of the previous failure, I knew the existing poses, p10 through p14, were likely too close. So I needed to generate new poses, which the task suggested using `#o2`. I analyzed the existing plan and the AABB definitions, and understood that the given poses p10-p14 were arranged on the x-axis, separated by a distance of 0.03 units. Since I know my bounding boxes of objects extend on an y-axis, and all objects are at the same y-value when these are placed, they are guaranteed to have overlaps with these given poses.
           
           I then realized I needed to carefully calculate new poses for each object to ensure there's enough space. I considered using a grid-like arrangement, 2 rows of 2 or 3 objects, trying to fit all 5 objects while staying within the boundaries of v20. I analyzed and computed the x and y ranges for each object when placed at various poses, and I computed whether these would cause any kind of collision. 
           
           I carefully examined the object dimensions and the surface boundaries of v20 (`[-0.135, 0.135]`).  I needed a configuration that ensured each object was fully contained within the surface area.

           I also made sure I had all the details for pick, place, and move base to make the full plan.
