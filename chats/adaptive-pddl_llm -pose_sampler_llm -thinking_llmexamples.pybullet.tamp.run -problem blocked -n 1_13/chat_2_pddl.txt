           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Goal Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal. Digging into the definition, it means finding an object, let's call it *?green*, that is both *on* `v18` and has a certain *type*,  represented by `v17`.  The initial state reveals that there are two contenders for *?green*: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. The crucial part is getting one of these objects *on* `v18`.
           
           **Focusing on the 'on' Predicate**
           
           The `on` predicate hinges on two key conditions:  *supported* and *atpose*.  Specifically, *?green* needs to be *supported* by something and have a particular *pose*, denoted by `?p`.  I know from looking at initial conditions that the object `v8` is supported by `v18`, with pose `#o2`.
           
           **Forming a Plan**
           
           My initial thought is to make a plan using `v8` as *?green*.  I notice that `v8` currently has pose `v9`, so I'll need to use `kin` relations. Since the goal requires `on(v8, v18)` I know `v8` will have to have the pose `#o2`. Also, since `v8` is supported by `v18`, this makes that part of my goal simple.  `v8` is initially supported by `v11`, so I'll need a mechanism to pick it up and place it.
           
           **Action Selection: Pick and Place**
           
           The actions needed are `pick` and `place`. The robot has two arms: `v4` and `v6`. I'll use arm `v4` because it's controllable.  To `pick` `v8` from pose `v9`, I'll use the available `kin` relations. These relations dictate how the arm should approach and grasp the object.   However, there's a base configuration issue. The `kin` relation for picking up requires a base configuration `#o3` and initial state has a different base configuration, `v3`.
           
           Therefore I need to account for this and will have to utilize a `move_base` action.
           
           **Base Configuration Adjustment**
           
           Currently, I need to use the `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to allow `v4` to perform the `pick` action.  This has some preconditions as well, I've checked these and they hold.
           
           **Final Plan Sequence**
           
           With the base now in place, the complete plan looks like this:
           
           1.  **(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)**:  Move the robot's base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)**:  Pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`, using the appropriate grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3` etc.
           3.  **(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**: Place `v8` at the goal pose `#o2` supported by `v18`, using the appropriate grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3` etc.
           
           I've carefully verified the preconditions and effects of each action to ensure the plan's feasibility and that it ultimately satisfies the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The plan is sound.
