           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Base Configuration Constraint**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having something green (type `v17`) *on* `v18`. From the initial state, I see that `v8` and `v12` are green.  To be "on" something means being supported by it, and also being at the correct pose (position/orientation).
           
           Both `v8` and `v12` are *supported* by `v18` already (specifically, both are supported by `#o2` which *is* supported by `v18`), so I just need to get one of them *at* pose `#o2`.
           
           The problem is, the current state shows both are *not* at `#o2`:  `v8` is at `v9`, and `v12` is at `v13`.  To change this, I'd need to use `pick` and `place` actions.  I've got the `kin` information, and can see the preconditions.
           
           However, here's where it falls apart. The `pick` action requires `atbconf(?q)` where the base configuration `?q` is `#o3`. However, the initial state gives me `atbconf(v3)`. The *only* base movement action is from `v3` to `v3`. I can't *move* my base to `#o3`, and `pick` demands it!
           
           Essentially, I'm stuck with a base configuration `v3` that doesn't align with the movements I need to make. The `kin` information forces a specific `#o3` configuration for all manipulations, and I can't reach it. Given this constraint, `pick` is impossible, and thus, I can't adjust the pose of either `v8` or `v12` to satisfy the goal.  I have to conclude that the goal is currently unreachable given the initial state and available actions.
