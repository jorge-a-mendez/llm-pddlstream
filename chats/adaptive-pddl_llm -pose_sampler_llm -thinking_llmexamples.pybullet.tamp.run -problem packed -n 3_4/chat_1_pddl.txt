           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a stacking problem. The goal is straightforward: get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked *on* `v16`. I know the initial state of the world: objects are at specific locations (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`), both arms are empty, and the base is at configuration `v3`. The key to achieving the goal lies in a series of `pick` and `place` actions, using arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`. The target pose for the stacked objects is `#o2` on surface `v16`.
           
           Looking at the preconditions, all `pick` and `place` actions require a specific kinematic configuration (`kin`) to be valid AND for `atbconf(?q)` to be true, where ?q is `#o3`. However, the base is currently at configuration `v3` and the only available base motion keeps the robot at `v3`. It is impossible to go from `v3` to `#o3` or change the base configuration to `#o3`.
           
           Furthermore, all the `kin` facts are defined with base configuration `#o3` required. This creates a critical mismatch. Since the robot cannot change its base configuration to `#o3`, it cannot pick or place any of the objects at the defined target pose on `v16`. Essentially, the `kin` facts and available base motions are incompatible. Therefore, achieving the goal is impossible with the currently available actions. The base configuration needed for manipulation is not accessible.
