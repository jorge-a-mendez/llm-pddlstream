           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10. They are at configurations v13 and v15, respectively, and each has a free store v16. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20). There is also a lander v9 for communication.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state that requires several conditions to be met, as defined by the axiom:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12 has a free store v16. This is true initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14 has a free store v16. This is true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: An image of objective v19 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: An image of objective v20 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object is of type v2 (stone).
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of that stone has been received.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object is of type v6 (soil).
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of that soil has been received.
           
           Looking at the available actions:
           - `move` actions are provided for both rovers to their current configurations, which don't change their state significantly (only re-asserting the `atconf` predicate). There are no moves to new configurations.
           - `drop_rock` actions are provided, but since both rovers have free stores, these actions would only be useful if they had full stores that needed to be emptied to sample more. However, no `sample_rock` action is available.
           
           Crucially, there are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances. Without these actions, the rovers cannot:
           - Take images of any objectives.
           - Calibrate their cameras.
           - Send any images back to the lander.
           - Sample any rocks.
           - Send analysis of any rocks.
           
           Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` predicates or the `receivedanalysis` predicates, which are essential components of the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The goal is unreachable given the limited set of allowed actions.
