           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each with a camera `v10` and a storage unit `v16`. Both rovers are initially at a specific configuration (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`). There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). The rovers can move, take images, calibrate their cameras, send images, sample and analyze rocks, and send analysis data. The camera `v10` supports mode `v11`. A lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be expanded as:
           `atconf(v12, v13)` AND `atconf(v14, v15)` AND `free(v12, v16)` AND `free(v14, v16)` AND `receivedimage(v17, v11)` AND `receivedimage(v18, v11)` AND `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)` AND `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This requires taking an image of `v17` in mode `v11` and sending it to the lander `v9`. Both rovers `v12` and `v14` can image `v17` and communicate with `v9`.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This requires taking an image of `v18` in mode `v11` and sending it to the lander `v9`. Both rovers `v12` and `v14` can image `v18` and communicate with `v9`.
           7.  `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to find a rock of type `v2` (which are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`) and analyze it, then send the analysis.
           8.  `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to find a rock of type `v6` (which are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and analyze it, then send the analysis.
           
           The problem is that the provided action instances only allow for `move` and `drop_rock`. None of the actions for imaging, analyzing, or sending data are available. This means that if the goal requires any of these unavailable actions, it cannot be achieved.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the provided actions, we see that `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are not true in the initial state. Since there are no actions to achieve these predicates, the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is not achievable as the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis, calibrate) are not provided in the list of valid action instances.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is not achievable as the necessary actions (take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis, calibrate)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each with a camera `v10` and a storage unit `v16`. Both rovers are initially at a specific configuration (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`). There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). The camera `v10` supports mode `v11`. A lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` expands to:
           `atconf(v12, v13)` AND `atconf(v14, v15)` AND `free(v12, v16)` AND `free(v14, v16)` AND `receivedimage(v17, v11)` AND `receivedimage(v18, v11)` AND `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)` AND `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Let's check the initial state against the goal predicates:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`: True (initial state).
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`: True (initial state).
           *   `free(v12, v16)`: True (initial state).
           *   `free(v14, v16)`: True (initial state).
           
           The remaining predicates are:
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This requires a `take_image` and `send_image` action for objective `v17` in mode `v11`.
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This requires a `take_image` and `send_image` action for objective `v18` in mode `v11`.
           *   `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This requires a `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` action for a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v1`, `v3`, `v4`).
           *   `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This requires a `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` action for a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v5`, `v7`, `v8`).
           
           Upon reviewing the list of valid action instances, only `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))` are available. None of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. The `move` actions do not change the location of the rover, as the start and end configurations are the same. The `drop_rock` actions would change `full(v,s)` to `free(v,s)`, but currently, both rovers have `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`, so dropping a rock would have no effect since they are not full.
           
           Since the initial state does not satisfy all the goal conditions (specifically `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates), and there are no available actions to achieve these conditions, the goal is unreachable.
