           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. Several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18) are present. The rovers are initially at configurations v13 and v15, respectively, and their storage units are free. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           From the initial state, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)` are already true. We need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Looking at the available actions:
           - `move` actions are provided for both rovers to move to their current configurations, which doesn't change their state relevant to the goal.
           - `drop_rock` actions are provided for both rovers, but their storage units are already free, so these actions are not helpful and their preconditions are not met (since `full` is false).
           
           There are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances. Since the goal requires sending images and analysis, and these actions are not available, the goal is not achievable.
           
           No plan can be generated because the necessary actions to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not available.
