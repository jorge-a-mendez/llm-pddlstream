(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a small square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a given rectangular surface (defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires the object to be fully contained within the surface boundaries.  To handle the object's rotation, I need to consider its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). The AABB's dimensions will change with the rotation angle (theta), but given that the object is a square and small relative to the surface, the effect should be manageable.  I've simplified my strategy to cover 10 equally spaced theta values between 0 and 2*pi. For each rotation, the bounding box must fit into surface. To get 50 placements I'll take a sampling of rotations, then place the object at five distinct positions for each rotation: the corners and center. I calculated the AABB's dimensions for each rotation, and use the rectangle made by the new dimensions to place a set of points. The surface in the problem is surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0. This is tricky because "stable" means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must be *fully contained* within the surface's AABB, even when rotated. The previous feedback on similar requests flagged placements as "not stable" due to slight boundary violations – a clear sign of floating-point precision issues.
           
           To handle this, I'm going to be very careful with my calculations. The object is nearly square (sides ~0.0885), and the surface is defined by its two corner coordinates. My main goal is to compute a *safe* range for the object's center coordinates (cx, cy) for any angle.
           
           Here's my strategy:
           
           1.  **Rotated AABB Calculation:** First, I'll calculate the dimensions of the object's AABB after rotating it by any given angle (theta). The formulas for the rotated AABB are straightforward using sine and cosine.
           
           2.  **Unbuffered Boundary Calculation:** From these rotated AABB dimensions, I'll determine the theoretical minimum and maximum center coordinates for cx and cy based on the surface bounds.
           
           3.  **Applying a Safety Buffer (Epsilon):** To prevent those pesky floating-point errors, I'll introduce a small safety margin, which I'll call "epsilon" (set to 1e-6). I will *add* this epsilon to the minimum boundaries and *subtract* it from the maximum boundaries. This means that if my calculated center is on the *unbuffered* boundaries there may be a precision issue; to handle this, the centers will always be safely *within* the range. This inward shift will guarantee that when I later compute the AABB and then compute the lower bounds (e.g., *s\_lx + half\_rsx = s\_lx*) it will be *smaller* than the s\_lx boundary. This is key: the safety buffer will address previous issues.
           
           4.  **Point Distribution:** I'll generate 50 placements by picking 5 distinct center points per angle across 10 angles. The center points will be distributed across the buffered (safe) center coordinate ranges (cx, cy).
           
           5.  **Robust Point Generation:** I'll be using `alpha_val` to generate the cx and cy point. It ensures the points are strictly *inside* the safe ranges to counteract the precision loss. I'm choosing a value, such as, if there are 5 points at an angle `0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9` of the available range.
           
           6.  **Collision Avoidance:** No need to check for collisions between fixed obstacles for this request since those are pre-checked in the stability feedback.
           
           The epsilon approach is the most robust strategy I know to ensure that my placement logic returns only placements that are fully contained by the surface's boundary.
