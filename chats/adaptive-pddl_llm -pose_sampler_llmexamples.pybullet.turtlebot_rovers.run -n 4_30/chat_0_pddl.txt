User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is constrained by a square boundary defined by AABBs 1, 2, 3, 4, with corners at approximately (-2.5, -2.5) and (2.5, 2.5). There's a vertical wall (AABB 5) along x=0. Other AABBs represent various smaller obstacles. The strategy is to find points within a radius of 2 from the target that are not inside any of the fixed obstacles. I will prioritize points that seem to be in open areas. Given a target point {target_point}, I will try to find points on a circle of radius 1 and 1.5 around it, and then check against the known obstacles.
           
           Let's break down the process for a new target point:
           1. **Identify the target point**: The given target is {target_point}.
           2. **Calculate potential base positions**:
               *   **Polar coordinates**: It's often helpful to think in terms of a radius and angle from the target. A good starting point is to try positions at a distance of, say, 1.5 or 1 from the target, at various angles.
               *   **Cartesian coordinates**:
                   *   Point 1: Directly to the left of the target, at a distance of 1.5.
                   *   Point 2: Directly to the right of the target, at a distance of 1.5.
                   *   Point 3: Directly below the target, at a distance of 1.5.
                   *   Point 4: Directly above the target, at a distance of 1.5.
                   *   Point 5: Some other angle, e.g., 45 degrees, 135 degrees, etc., at distance 1.5.
               *   I'll make sure these positions are within the overall [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds.
           3. **Collision check with fixed obstacles**: For each proposed position (x, y), I'll check if it lies within any of the fixed AABBs.
               *   AABB 0: ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)) - This is the overall boundary, so any point inside is fine, as long as it's not inside other obstacles.
               *   AABB 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - This is a central vertical wall. I need to avoid it.
               *   AABBs 1-4: These are boundary walls.
               *   Other AABBs: These are smaller internal obstacles.
           
           Given target {target_point}, I will generate 3 points.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempts for the target point (2.1633541584014893, 2.103583335876465) revealed a few issues:
           1.  (0.8529457697472097, 0.9634710156942485) was "not reachable". This often implies an occlusion or a collision not with a fixed obstacle but perhaps a dynamic one, or simply a location that the robot's kinematics can't reach. Given the target is in the upper right quadrant, this position is quite far and to the bottom-left, possibly behind the central wall (AABB 5).
           2.  (0.4079457697472097, 1.4084710156942486) collided with AABB 12: ((0.23143987821031792, 1.228961040243399), (0.3680333597810151, 1.365554521814096)). This tells me there's a small obstacle in the upper-middle left of the scene. My proposed point was just outside the x-range but within the y-range of this obstacle. This also implies a line of sight issue if the target is on the far side of this obstacle.
           3.  (0.1879457697472097, 0.4534710156942485) collided with AABB 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This is the central vertical wall, which I explicitly wanted to avoid if the target was on the other side. This position is on the right side of the wall but close to it.
           
           The target point is (2.1633541584014893, 2.103583335876465). This is in the top-right quadrant. The previous positions were too far to the left and ran into the central wall or other small obstacles. I need to focus on points closer to the target, likely still in the top-right quadrant, to ensure line of sight and avoid the central wall. I'll try positions at a distance of about 1.5 from the target, directly to its left, directly below, and then one at an angle, making sure to stay well clear of the central wall (x=0).
