(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is essentially a near-square rectangle, on surface 0. A stable placement means the object won't slide off, so its AABB must stay within the surface bounds.
           
           First, I need to figure out how the object's orientation (theta) impacts the valid placement region (x, y) on the surface. The object's AABB dimensions will change as I rotate it. For a rotation `theta`, the width (`w`) and height (`h`) of the AABB will be `w = abs(size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y * sin(theta))` and `h = abs(size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(size_y * cos(theta))`. Given that the dimensions `size_x` and `size_y` are nearly identical, the AABB won't change drastically as I rotate. However, the valid range for the center (x, y) *does* shrink as the object's AABB extends outwards during rotation.
           
           To cover a range of orientations, I'm going to consider a few angles. Since the rectangle is almost square, using angles between 0 and pi radians should provide a good diversity of orientations. I've decided to discretize the angle space with 10 values, using the `linspace` function to produce 10 angles between 0 and pi.
           
           For each angle, I need to calculate the allowable (x, y) range. The valid range depends on the surface boundaries and the AABB dimensions, which change with theta. The valid ranges are where `surface_lx + w/2 <= x <= surface_ux - w/2` and `surface_ly + h/2 <= y <= surface_uy - h/2`. I can call a function to quickly calculate `w, h` and the bounds. If no valid range is possible, i.e., `x_max < x_min` or `y_max < y_min`, then I'll skip that particular orientation.
           
           Then, to select the points within each valid (x,y) region, I'll generate a few points, say, 5. This includes placing points in the corners of the valid rectangle and the center. The function `linspace` is helpful here to generate those points.
           
           I'll iterate through all the angles and their valid x, y points, stopping when I hit 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on a given surface, while avoiding collision with a pre-existing object (ID 4) already placed on that surface.
           
           I'm starting with the surface defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and the new object having dimensions of `0.09414566992526568 x 0.09414566992526568` which means a square. Object 4 is located at `(-0.08577393151448355, -0.08577393151448357)` with rotation 0 and has dimensions of `0.09845213697103289 x 0.09845213697103286`. Object 4's bounding box will have dimensions `0.09845213697103289, 0.09845213697103286`.
           
           To prevent collisions, I have to ensure that the bounding boxes of object 4 and object 6 do not overlap. The surface boundaries are -0.135 and 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The approach involves the following:
           
           1.  **Define Bounding Boxes and Regions:** I know that the minimum extents of object 6's bounding box is `0.09414566992526568`. And I calculate object 4's bounding box using the provided center coordinates and dimensions, and find that it occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface: from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.0365, -0.0365).
           
           2.  **Rotation Calculations:** For any rotation theta, the bounding box width/height of a square is calculated with `s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The maximum dimensions happen when the object is rotated 45 degrees.
           
           3.  **Identify Unoccupied Regions:** Since object 4 is in the bottom-left, the collision-free space is broken down into two main regions: one above object 4 and one to the right of it. I'll need to use these to create the diverse locations.
           
           4.  **Point Generation:** To find the placements, I'll divide the surface area above and to the right of object 4. Then, for a variety of angles, I calculate the `w_obj` (width of the object bounding box) and define the range of acceptable x and y coordinate values (surface bounds minus bounding box's width). Within the defined region, I'll systematically create positions so that for a given rotation, the positions do not collide with the AABB of object 4. I plan to use 10 different angles for rotations of the object.
           
           5.  **Placement Strategies:** I start by calculating the bounds of the AABB. Object 6 can be placed above and to the right of Object 4. To populate those spaces, I will split the regions into a grid (5 by 5), which guarantees the locations are unique, and thus it will make for more stable placements.
           
           6.  **Collision Avoidance:** During the point generation, I will always make sure the AABB of object 6 does not intersect the AABB of object 4. If the points overlap with object 4, the placements are rejected.
           
           7.  **Collection and Filtering:** To start I will calculate `x_cands` and `y_cands`. Then, these candiates will be used to generate the locations. I do a collection and deduplication of the points for efficiency, I plan to have at least 50 points generated in the end.
           
           In this way, I'm confident I can generate the required 50 stable placements, that are guaranteed to be collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable and collision-free positions for a new square object (ID 5) on surface 0.  This requires careful consideration of the existing objects (ID 4 and ID 6) already present.
           
           First, I precisely define the surface's boundaries and the dimensions/placements of the existing objects.  Then, I calculate the axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for each object and their union, effectively mapping the occupied space. This combined occupied space forms a critical area to avoid.
           
           The new object's placement strategy hinges on two main elements.  I will explore a range of rotations (0 to pi), calculating the AABB dimensions of the object for each.  Since the object is a square, the width will vary according to the rotation.  Using the occupied AABB dimensions to carve out valid search space, I will define safe regions to place the object: specifically to the right or above the existing objects.
           
           I have found that the region right of the occupied space is more often available.  Therefore, I systematically calculate suitable center points in those regions, while always keeping in mind the object's rotation.   I will select from a set of angles, which leads to 3x3 point placement grids in the safe regions.
           
           The code generates these placement points, and once 50 points are generated, the process stops.  This strategic approach, utilizing AABB collision checks, allows for efficient generation of non-overlapping placement options, fulfilling the original objective.
