(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with extents of about 0.07 on a square surface. The surface is defined as a square region centered at (0, 0) and with side length 0.27.  Since the object is also a square, this simplifies things considerably. A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x,y coordinates of the object's center.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. When the object is axis-aligned (theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2), the valid placement region is determined by ensuring the object's edges remain within the surface boundaries.  The half-extent for the object in each axis-aligned direction is simply half the object's side length, approximately 0.035. This leads to a valid center region with the ranges of -0.09964 to 0.09964 in both x and y.
           
           Now I have to consider rotation.  Rotating the square object requires calculating the size of the *minimum bounding box* (AABB). The largest bounding box is created with theta = pi/4 or multiples of pi/2, and that bounding box has side length, r_max, that is 0.05. Using 0.05 as the boundary to compute the placements, the valid center region ranges for the object will be -0.085 to 0.085, on both axes.
           
           The plan is to create placements that cover the surface as much as possible, with different rotation values. I will use 0 degrees (no rotation) and 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians) and create a 5x5 grid of points for each. That's 25 placements at 0 degrees and 25 at 45 degrees, making a total of 50. I'll need to calculate the grid spacing appropriately based on the valid x and y ranges for each rotation.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating 50 non-colliding placements for object 5, a square, while avoiding collision with a previously placed object 4. Object 4's location is known, and I've got the dimensions and bounds of both objects and the workspace. Here's my thought process:
           
           1.  **Understand the Problem:** I need to find 50 stable placements (x, y coordinates and rotation angle, theta) for object 5 that don't overlap with object 4, which is also a square. I am treating the problem as avoiding collisions with the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).
           
           2.  **Key Insight: Rotation Matters:**  Since object 5 is a square, its effective AABB size changes with rotation (theta).  I've figured out that the AABB's effective half-width and half-height, `r5`, will change according to  `(s5/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`  where `s5` is the side length.
           
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I know object 4's AABB location.  So, I will generate placements for object 5, calculate its AABB based on the chosen rotation (theta). I will then use simple overlapping criteria using the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates to check if object 5's AABB collides with object 4.
           
           4.  **Grid-Based Placement:**  To efficiently generate placements, I will use a grid-based approach. The valid x and y range are calculated based on the maximum AABB dimension considering the square dimensions.
           
           5.  **Placement Strategy:** I'll begin by analyzing `theta = 0.0`. I'll generate a 5x5 grid of placements and filter out placements that would collide with object 4, generating around 21 valid placements.
               I'll also analyze `theta = pi/4`. Similar to `theta = 0`, I'll generate another 21 valid placements.
               Finally, I'll analyze `theta = pi/2`. I'll generate additional valid placements to reach 50 total.
           
           6. **Round Coordinates**: I will ensure to round coordinates to 8 decimal places as shown in the feedback.
           
           7. **The result:** I'll have a list of 50 non-colliding placements for object 5.

(Thoughts: **My current objective is to efficiently find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on a defined surface (Surface 0), while ensuring it doesn't collide with two pre-existing, placed objects (ID 4 and ID 5).**  I need to consider the dimensions and the current positions of Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           The surface is a square space, so I need to make sure the bounding box for object 6 is within the range to fit within Surface 0.
           
           To solve this, I will use a grid-based approach. I will consider Object 6 at different center points and with different rotations. I'll test common angles like 0 degrees (no rotation), 45 degrees, and 90 degrees.
           For each considered placement, I'll calculate the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of Object 6, for a square with side length s6.
           
           I will also calculate the ranges for placing object 6, according to the surface space.  I then need to check if the AABB of my proposed Object 6 placement would collide with the pre-existing bounding boxes of Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           If a proposed placement causes a collision with the existing objects, it will be discarded.
           
           The key to collision detection is to determine the AABB for each possible position of Object 6 and compare its bounding box range on the X and Y axes to the bounding box ranges of Object 4 and Object 5.  If any overlap exists on both axes, then a collision is flagged.
           
           If the collision tests pass, then the placement is valid.
           
           For placements with common rotations (0, 45, and 90 degrees), I will create grids in both the X and Y dimensions. A dense 10x10 grid will be used to generate candidate positions. Using this grid and these common rotations, the collision checks are then performed. I then expect to have found 50 valid placements.
