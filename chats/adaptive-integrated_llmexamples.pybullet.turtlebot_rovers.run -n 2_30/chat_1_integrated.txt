User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` axiom. This axiom requires several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (implicitly satisfied as we need to analyze rocks of type `v2`)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (meaning some rock of type `v2` is analyzed)
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (implicitly satisfied as we need to analyze rocks of type `v6`)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (meaning some rock of type `v6` is analyzed)
           
           Let's break down the initial state and how to achieve each goal component:
           
           **Initial State Analysis:**
           *   **Rovers and Configurations:**
               *   `rover(v12)` is at `atconf(v12, v13)`
               *   `rover(v14)` is at `atconf(v14, v15)`
               *   These satisfy the first two conditions of the axiom.
           *   **Stores:**
               *   `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true. These satisfy conditions 3 and 4.
           *   **Camera:**
               *   `camera(v10)` is onboard both `v12` and `v14`.
               *   `supports(v10, v11)` is true, where `v11` is a mode.
           *   **Objectives:**
               *   `objective(v17)` and `objective(v18)` are the targets for images.
           *   **Rocks:**
               *   Rocks with type `v2` (stone): `v1`, `v3`, `v4`
               *   Rocks with type `v6` (soil): `v5`, `v7`, `v8`
           *   **Lander:**
               *   `lander(v9)` is the communication target.
           *   **Visibility:**
               *   `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates exist for both rovers from various continuous configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`) to the objectives (`v17`, `v18`) and lander (`v9`).
               *   `above` predicates exist for both rovers from configuration `#o5` for all rocks.
           
           **Goal Achievement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Received Images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`):**
               *   To get `receivedimage`, we need to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
               *   `take_image` requires `calibrated(v10, <rover>)` which means we need to `calibrate` first.
               *   Both `v17` and `v18` are visible from `#o3` for both `v12` and `v14`. We can use either rover. Let's use `v14` as it's closer to the objects (based on their coordinates, though not strictly required for this problem, it's good practice for geometry). `v14` is at `v15` and `#o3` is a valid configuration for `v14`. We'll need to move `v14` to `#o3` first if it's not already there. The initial state says `atconf(v14, v15)`. We have `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`.
               *   `send_image` requires `comvisible` and `haveimage`. `comvisible` exists from `#o0` to `v9` for `v14`.
               *   So, the sequence would be: Move `v14` to `#o3`, calibrate, take image of `v17`, take image of `v18`, move `v14` to `#o0`, send image of `v17`, send image of `v18`.
           
           2.  **Received Analyses (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`):**
               *   To get `receivedanalysis`, we need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
               *   `sample_rock` requires the rover to be `above` the rock at a specific configuration, and a `free` store. Both rovers have `free` store `v16`. `above` predicates exist for configuration `#o5` for all rocks for both rovers.
               *   We need one rock of type `v2` (stone) and one of type `v6` (soil). Let's pick `v3` (type `v2`) and `v5` (type `v6`).
               *   `send_analysis` requires `comvisible` and `analyzed`. `comvisible` exists from `#o0` to `v9` for `v14`.
               *   So, the sequence would be: Move `v14` to `#o5`, sample `v3`, sample `v5`, move `v14` to `#o0`, send analysis of `v3`, send analysis of `v5`.
           
           We can combine these steps using `v14` for everything.
           *   Start at `v15`.
           *   Move to `#o3` for images.
           *   Calibrate and take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Move to `#o5` for sampling.
           *   Sample `v3` and `v5`.
           *   Move to `#o0` for sending data.
           *   Send images and analyses.
           
           All continuous parameters (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) have `conf` predicates and motion paths in the initial state. The rays (`#o1`, `#o4`) are also provided. We will need to provide concrete coordinates for the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for `v14` and for the rays `#o1`, `#o4` as per instructions.
           
           **Configuration selection (v14):**
           *   **Image acquisition (target v17, v18):** `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
               *   v17 AABB: ((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879))
               *   v18 AABB: ((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01))
               *   For `v14` (initial x=-1.0, y=-1.75), a position around (0.0, 1.0) would be a good candidate for `#o3` to observe both `v17` and `v18`. Let's pick (0.0, 1.0) for `#o3` for `v14` and a ray to v17.
           *   **Sampling (targets v3, v5):** `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`.
               *   v3 AABB: ((1.462, -1.767), (1.549, -1.68))
               *   v5 AABB: ((2.04, -2.153), (2.179, -2.014))
               *   `v14` is initially at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. To be `above` `v3` or `v5`, it would need to move to their vicinity. A configuration like (1.5, -1.7) for `#o5` for `v14` could work.
           *   **Communication (target v9):** `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
               *   v9 AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
               *   `v14` is initially at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is already somewhat close to `v9`. A configuration like (-1.5, -1.75) for `#o0` for `v14` could work for communication.
           
           Let's refine the specific (rover, target) pairs for configurations.
           *   `#o3` will be for `v14` to image `v17`. (0.5, 1.7)
           *   `#o3` will be for `v14` to image `v18`. (-0.7, 1.9)
           *   `#o5` will be for `v14` to be above `v3`. (1.5, -1.7)
           *   `#o5` will be for `v14` to be above `v5`. (2.1, -2.1)
           *   `#o0` will be for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. (-1.5, -2.0)
           
           Since the plan will only use `v14`, we only need configurations for `v14`. Also, the problem statement says "if your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This means we only need to specify values for `#o0`, `#o3` used in `imagevisible`/`comvisible` predicates. `#o5` is only used in `above`, so we don't need to specify it. However, if we need to move to `#o5`, then we would need to specify it. Since there are motions for it, it should be fine. The question specifies for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` only.
           
           Let's pick consistent configurations. For simplicity, we can try to reuse configurations if possible, but the prompt says to provide a different value for each (rover, target object) pair. However, in our case, `v14` will image `v17` and `v18` from `#o3`, and communicate from `#o0` to `v9`.
           
           We'll choose one `#o3` for imaging both `v17` and `v18`, and one `#o0` for communicating.
           Let's choose specific coordinates for these:
           *   `#o3` for `v14` to image `v17`: `v17` is around (0.55, 1.83). Let `#o3` be (0.5, 1.0).
           *   `#o3` for `v14` to image `v18`: `v18` is around (-0.67, 1.96). Let `#o3` be (-0.5, 1.0). This means we'll need two distinct `#o3` configurations. Let's call them `#o3_v17` and `#o3_v18` for clarity in the plan, even though the PDDL uses `#o3` for all. For the response, I must stick to `#o3`. The problem states "if the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the imagevisible or comvisible predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
               This means if I image v17 and v18 using the same configuration `#o3`, I should provide two values for `#o3`, one for v17 and one for v18.
           *   `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`: `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). Let `#o0` be (-1.5, -1.75).
           
           Plan Steps:
           1.  Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3` (for `v17`).
           2.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v17`.
           3.  Take image of `v17` with `v10` from `#o3`.
           4.  Move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o3` (for `v18`).
           5.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3` for `v18`. (Calibrated is negated after taking image, so recalibrate).
           6.  Take image of `v18` with `v10` from `#o3`.
           7.  Move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o5`.
           8.  Sample rock `v3` (type `v2`) at `#o5`.
           9.  Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`) at `#o5`.
           10. Move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           11. Send image of `v17`.
           12. Send image of `v18`.
           13. Send analysis of `v3`.
           14. Send analysis of `v5`.
           
           This plan covers all requirements for `new-axiom@0`. The rover `v12` is not used and its `atconf` and `free` predicates are already satisfied.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to unreachable and collision-prone configurations. Let's re-evaluate the configuration choices for `v14` to ensure they are collision-free, reachable, and provide occlusion-free line of sight.
           
           **Revisiting Configurations for `v14`:**
           
           *   **Rover `v14` initial position:** `v15` is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           *   **Obstacles:**
               *   `v19`: AABB((-0.376, 0.991), (-0.245, 1.122)) - an obstacle in the upper-left quadrant.
               *   `v9`: AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - the lander itself, in the lower-left.
               *   `v20`: AABB((-1.655, -1.611), (-1.543, -1.499)) - an obstacle near `v9`.
           
           **1. Imaging `v17` and `v18` from `#o3` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   `v17` AABB: ((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)) - top right.
               *   `v18` AABB: ((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)) - top left.
               *   The previous `#o3` for `v17` (0.5, 1.0) was not reachable.
               *   The previous `#o3` for `v18` (-0.5, 1.0) was in collision with `v19`.
               *   We need to find a new `#o3` that is reachable from `v14`'s initial position (-1.0, -1.75) and has line of sight to both `v17` and `v18` without colliding with `v19` or other obstacles.
               *   Let's try a position for imaging `v17` to the right, away from `v19`. `v17` is at (0.55, 1.83). How about `#o3_v17` = (0.0, 0.0)? This should be reachable from (-1.0, -1.75) and potentially have line of sight.
               *   For `v18` at (-0.67, 1.96), `v19` is at ((-0.376, 0.991), (-0.245, 1.122)). So, we need to be to the left of `v19` to view `v18`. Let's try `#o3_v18` = (-1.0, 0.0). This should be reachable and not collide with `v19`. The max distance is 2 for `imagevisible`.
           
           **2. Sampling `v3` and `v5` from `#o5` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   `v3` AABB: ((1.462, -1.767), (1.549, -1.68)) - bottom right.
               *   `v5` AABB: ((2.04, -2.153), (2.179, -2.014)) - bottom right, further.
               *   `#o5` is for `above` predicate, so it needs to be directly over the rock.
               *   For `v3`, `v14` needs to be near (1.5, -1.7). Let `#o5_v3` = (1.5, -1.7).
               *   For `v5`, `v14` needs to be near (2.1, -2.1). Let `#o5_v5` = (2.1, -2.1).
               *   Since `#o5` doesn't require line-of-sight based on the problem statement for continuous parameter specification, and there's no mention of collisions with `v19`, `v9`, `v20`, these look reasonable.
           
           **3. Communication with `v9` from `#o0` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - lower left.
               *   `v20` AABB: ((-1.655, -1.611), (-1.543, -1.499)) - obstacle near `v9`.
               *   The previous `#o0` = (-1.5, -1.75) for `v14` at `v9` was in collision with `v9` itself and `v20`. This means the rover was trying to occupy the space of the lander or another object.
               *   We need `v14` to be *near* `v9` but not *in* `v9` or `v20`. `v14` is initially at (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Let's try to place `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9` at (-1.0, -2.0). This is close to `v9`'s right boundary and avoids `v20`.
           
           **Revised Plan Strategy:**
           The sequence of actions remains largely the same, but the continuous values for the configurations must change.
           
           1.  Move `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `#o3_v17` (0.0, 0.0).
           2.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3_v17` for `v17`.
           3.  Take image of `v17` with `v10` from `#o3_v17`.
           4.  Move `v14` from `#o3_v17` (0.0, 0.0) to `#o3_v18` (-1.0, 0.0).
           5.  Calibrate camera `v10` for `v14` at `#o3_v18` for `v18`. (Need to recalibrate as `calibrated` is negated after `take_image`).
           6.  Take image of `v18` with `v10` from `#o3_v18`.
           7.  Move `v14` from `#o3_v18` (-1.0, 0.0) to `#o5_v3` (1.5, -1.7).
           8.  Sample rock `v3` (type `v2`) at `#o5_v3`.
           9.  Move `v14` from `#o5_v3` (1.5, -1.7) to `#o5_v5` (2.1, -2.1).
           10. Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`) at `#o5_v5`.
           11. Move `v14` from `#o5_v5` (2.1, -2.1) to `#o0_v9` (-1.0, -2.0).
           12. Send image of `v17`.
           13. Send image of `v18`.
           14. Send analysis of `v3`.
           15. Send analysis of `v5`.
           
           Since the problem uses the same `#o3`, `#o5` and `#o0` for different instances, I have to ensure the plan uses these exact object names. The problem statement says "if the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the imagevisible or comvisible predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This implies that even if the PDDL object is `#o3`, for example, I can provide two separate coordinate values if it's used for different (rover, target) pairs.
           
           Let's use the object names as they are in the PDDL, and list distinct coordinates for each (rover, target) pair for `#o0`, `#o3`. For `#o5`, as it's not in `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, I'll use a single value for `v14` for sampling, as I do not need to specify it for each rock separately, but the movement between sampling locations should be handled by the plan. So I'll define a configuration for `v14` to be above `v3` and another for `v5`.

           **Obstacles to consider:**

           **Rover `v14` initial position:** `v15` is at (-1.0, -1.75).

               *   **For `v17`:** We need to be on the right side of `v21` (i.e., x > 0.05) to avoid collision. `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75). To reach `v17` (around 0.55, 1.83), we need to move far. A possible viewing spot on the right of `v21` and near `v17` could be (0.5, 1.0). But this might be too close to `v17` or `v21`. Let's try (0.2, 0.0) for `v14` to image `v17`. This avoids `v21` and is closer to `v17` than the initial position.
               *   **For `v18`:** We need to be on the left side of `v21` (i.e., x < -0.05) and avoid `v19` (around -0.3, 1.0). `v18` is at (-0.67, 1.96). A viewing spot could be around (-1.0, 1.0). This is far from `v21` and `v19`.
           
           **2. Sampling `v3` and `v5` from `#o5` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   `v3` AABB: ((1.462, -1.767), (1.549, -1.68)) - bottom right.
               *   `v5` AABB: ((2.04, -2.153), (2.179, -2.014)) - bottom right, further.
               *   All previous `#o5` configurations were not reachable. This likely means the path was obstructed or the coordinates were too far or in an unreachable region.
               *   We need `v14` to be directly above the rocks, avoiding `v21`. The rocks `v3` and `v5` are in the positive x-region. So `v14` needs to move to x > 0.05.
               *   For `v3` (around 1.5, -1.7): Let's try `#o5_v3` = (1.5, -1.0). This keeps it away from `v21` and on a straight path from the initial location.
               *   For `v5` (around 2.1, -2.1): Let's try `#o5_v5` = (2.1, -1.5).
           
           **3. Communication with `v9` from `#o0` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - lower left.
               *   `v20`: AABB((-1.655, -1.611), (-1.543, -1.499)) - obstacle near `v9`.
               *   Previous `#o0` was not reachable.
               *   We need `v14` to be in line of sight with `v9`, avoiding `v9` and `v20`, and `v21`. `v9` is in the negative x-region.
               *   From `v14`'s initial position (-1.0, -1.75), this area is relatively close. Let's try `#o0_v9` = (-0.5, -2.0). This is close to the initial position, on the left of `v21` and right of `v20` and `v9`.
           
           **Revised Plan Strategy:**
           
           1.  Move `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `#o3_v18` (-1.0, 1.0) to image `v18`. (Less movement than going to `v17` first from initial position).
           2.  Calibrate `v14` at `#o3_v18` for `v18`.
           3.  Take image of `v18`.
           4.  Move `v14` from `#o3_v18` (-1.0, 1.0) to `#o3_v17` (0.2, 0.0) to image `v17`.
           5.  Calibrate `v14` at `#o3_v17` for `v17`.
           6.  Take image of `v17`.
           7.  Move `v14` from `#o3_v17` (0.2, 0.0) to `#o5_v3` (1.5, -1.0) to sample `v3`.
           8.  Sample rock `v3`.
           9.  Move `v14` from `#o5_v3` (1.5, -1.0) to `#o5_v5` (2.1, -1.5) to sample `v5`.
           10. Sample rock `v5`.
           11. Move `v14` from `#o5_v5` (2.1, -1.5) to `#o0_v9` (-0.5, -2.0) to communicate.
           12. Send image of `v17`.
           13. Send image of `v18`.
           14. Send analysis of `v3`.
           15. Send analysis of `v5`.
           
           This order minimizes large movements and tries to stay away from known obstacles.

Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous attempts consistently failed on reachability for sampling and communication, and collisions for imaging. It seems the environment is quite constrained, especially with `v21` (x=0.0 obstacle) and obstacles near `v9`.
           
           Let's carefully consider the rover's initial position `v14` at `v15` which is (-1.0, -1.75). The rover is in the bottom-left quadrant.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           *   `v19`: AABB((-0.376, 0.991), (-0.245, 1.122)) - upper-left.
           *   `v9`: AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - lander, far lower-left.
           *   `v20`: AABB((-1.655, -1.611), (-1.543, -1.499)) - near `v9`.
           *   `v21`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - thin vertical wall at x=0.
           
           **Targets:**
           *   `v17` (objective): AABB((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)) - top-right.
           *   `v18` (objective): AABB((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)) - top-left.
           *   `v3` (rock, type v2): AABB((1.462, -1.767), (1.549, -1.68)) - mid-right, low.
           *   `v5` (rock, type v6): AABB((2.04, -2.153), (2.179, -2.014)) - far-right, low.
           
           **Let's assume `v14` can only easily move in its quadrant or directly forward/backward relative to its current orientation to avoid obstacles. The `v21` obstacle at x=0 is critical.**
           
           **1. Imaging `v17` and `v18` from `#o3` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   **For `v17` (top-right, x > 0.5):** `v14` must be on the right side of `v21` (x > 0.05). To be reachable from (-1.0, -1.75), and not collide with `v21`, a configuration like (0.1, -1.0) could be a start, then moving up to view `v17`. A configuration like (0.6, 1.0) might work for viewing `v17` (0.55, 1.83). Max range for imagevisible is 2. (0.6, 1.0) to (0.55, 1.83) is roughly sqrt(0.05^2 + 0.83^2) ~ 0.83, which is within range. This avoids `v21`.
               *   **For `v18` (top-left, x < -0.6):** `v14` must be on the left side of `v21` (x < -0.05) and avoid `v19` (around x=-0.3, y=1.0). `v18` is at (-0.67, 1.96). A configuration like (-1.5, 1.0) seems reasonable. From (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, 1.0) is reachable. From (-1.5, 1.0) to (-0.67, 1.96) is sqrt(0.83^2 + 0.96^2) ~ 1.27, which is within range.
           
           **2. Sampling `v3` and `v5` from `#o5` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   Both rocks `v3` and `v5` are in the positive x region. `v14` needs to cross `v21`.
               *   **For `v3` (around 1.5, -1.7):** A configuration like (1.5, -1.7) itself. We need to ensure the path to it is clear and `v14` can physically get there.
               *   **For `v5` (around 2.1, -2.1):** A configuration like (2.1, -2.1) itself.
               *   Let's ensure the path. From (0.6, 1.0) (last imaging spot) to (1.5, -1.7) is a large movement. We could go to (0.1, -1.0) first, then to the rocks.
           
           **3. Communication with `v9` from `#o0` (rover `v14`)**:
               *   `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   `v20` is at ((-1.655, -1.611), (-1.543, -1.499)).
               *   `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   We need to be to the right of `v9` and `v20`, and to the left of `v21`.
               *   Let's try ( -0.7, -1.75). This is close to the initial position and avoids `v20` and `v9`. Distance to `v9` from (-0.7, -1.75) to (-1.9, -2.0) is sqrt(1.2^2 + 0.25^2) ~ 1.22, within comrange (4).
           
           **Revised Plan Sequence:**
           
           Let's arrange the tasks to minimize movements across the `v21` obstacle. It's probably better to finish all tasks on one side of `v21` before crossing. `v14` starts on the left side (x=-1.0).
           
           1.  **Image `v18` (left side of `v21`):**
               *   Move `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `#o3_v18` (-1.5, 1.0).
               *   Calibrate `v14` at `#o3_v18` for `v18`.
               *   Take image of `v18`.
           2.  **Send Communications (left side of `v21`):**
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v18` (-1.5, 1.0) to `#o0_v9` (-0.7, -1.75).
               *   (We'll send images and analyses later, but we need to ensure the rover can reach this position).
           3.  **Cross `v21` to the right side.**
               *   Move `v14` from `#o0_v9` (-0.7, -1.75) to a point on the right of `v21`, say (0.1, -1.0).
           4.  **Image `v17` (right side of `v21`):**
               *   Move `v14` from (0.1, -1.0) to `#o3_v17` (0.6, 1.0).
               *   Calibrate `v14` at `#o3_v17` for `v17`.
               *   Take image of `v17`.
           5.  **Sample rocks (right side of `v21`):**
               *   Move `v14` from `#o3_v17` (0.6, 1.0) to `#o5_v3` (1.5, -1.7).
               *   Sample rock `v3`.
               *   Move `v14` from `#o5_v3` (1.5, -1.7) to `#o5_v5` (2.1, -2.1).
               *   Sample rock `v5`.
           6.  **Return to communication spot on left to send all data.**
               *   Move `v14` from `#o5_v5` (2.1, -2.1) back to `#o0_v9` (-0.7, -1.75).
               *   Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Send analyses of `v3` and `v5`.
           
           This plan involves more moves, but it explicitly addresses collision zones. The moves through (0.1, -1.0) are implied as intermediate steps on the path and not new PDDL configurations, so they don't need explicit `#o` labels in the PDDL plan, only the continuously valued configurations.
           
           Let's check reachability for these configurations. The problem specifies `motion` predicates for many combinations of existing and new configurations. We are effectively choosing the values of `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` which will then be connected by an underlying motion primitive. I need to make sure the values are reasonable for a rover to reach.
           
           The plan will look like:
           1. Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3` (for `v18`).
           2. Calibrate and `take_image` for `v18`.
           3. Move `v14` from `#o3` (for `v18`) to `#o3` (for `v17`).
           4. Calibrate and `take_image` for `v17`.
           5. Move `v14` from `#o3` (for `v17`) to `#o5` (for `v3`).
           6. `sample_rock` for `v3`.
           7. Move `v14` from `#o5` (for `v3`) to `#o5` (for `v5`).
           8. `sample_rock` for `v5`.
           9. Move `v14` from `#o5` (for `v5`) to `#o0` (for `v9`).
           10. `send_image` for `v17`.
           11. `send_image` for `v18`.
           12. `send_analysis` for `v3`.
           13. `send_analysis` for `v5`.
           
           This plan assumes a path can be found between these points.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem persistently indicates that the proposed configurations are not reachable, even when they seem geometrically plausible given the initial rover position and obstacle locations. This suggests that either the "reachability" constraint is very strict, the available motion primitives are limited in how far they can move, or there are implicit obstacles or path constraints not fully described by the AABBs.
           
           Given the continuous rejections for reachability, let's consider using **Rover `v12`** as well, as it is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), which is on the other side of the `v21` obstacle. This might make some targets more reachable for `v12` than for `v14`.
           
           **Rover `v12` initial position:** `v13` is at (1.0, -1.75).
           *   `onboard(v10, v12)` is true. `v10` is the camera, `v11` is the mode.
           *   `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           
           **Let's split the tasks between `v12` and `v14` to see if reachability improves.**
           
           **Tasks for `v14` (starts at -1.0, -1.75):**
           *   This rover is on the left side of `v21`.
           *   **Image `v18` (top-left):** `v18` at ((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)).
               *   Let's try a very conservative approach for `#o3` (for `v18`): close to `v14`'s initial position, but further away from `v21` (x=0) and `v19` (x=-0.3). How about (-1.0, 0.0)? This is on the left of `v21` and `v19`. Range to `v18` from (-1.0, 0.0) is sqrt((-0.67 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.96 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.33^2 + 1.96^2) ~ 1.99, which is just within range (2).
           *   **Communicate with `v9` (lander, far-left):** `v9` at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v20` near `v9`.
               *   `v14` is initially at (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is further left. Let's try `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9` at (-1.2, -1.5). This is still close to `v14`'s start, on the right of `v9` and `v20`, and on the left of `v21`. Distance to `v9` from (-1.2, -1.5) to (-1.9, -2.0) is sqrt(0.7^2 + 0.5^2) ~ 0.86, well within range (4).
           *   **Sample Rock `v4` (type v2, stone):** `v4` at ((-2.095, 0.914), (-2.008, 1.0)). This is also on the far-left. `above(v14, #o5, v4)`.
               *   From `v14`'s initial position (-1.0, -1.75), moving to `v4` (around -2.0, 0.95) is a large movement. Perhaps (-2.0, 0.5) for `#o5` for `v14` over `v4`.
           
           **Tasks for `v12` (starts at 1.0, -1.75):**
           *   This rover is on the right side of `v21`.
           *   **Image `v17` (top-right):** `v17` at ((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)).
               *   From `v12`'s initial position (1.0, -1.75), to view `v17` (around 0.55, 1.83), let's try `#o3` for `v17` at (0.5, 0.0). This is on the right of `v21`. Range to `v17` is sqrt(0.05^2 + 1.83^2) ~ 1.83, within range (2).
           *   **Sample Rock `v8` (type v6, soil):** `v8` at ((1.942, 0.696), (2.079, 0.833)). This is far right. `above(v12, #o5, v8)`.
               *   From `v12`'s initial (1.0, -1.75), to be above `v8` (around 2.0, 0.75), let's try `#o5` for `v12` over `v8` at (2.0, 0.5).
           
           **Combined Plan:**
           
           **Rover `v14` actions:**
           1.  Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3` (for `v18`).
           2.  Calibrate `v14` at `#o3` for `v18`.
           3.  Take image of `v18`.
           4.  Move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o5` (for `v4`).
           5.  Sample rock `v4`.
           6.  Move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0` (for `v9`).
           7.  Send image of `v18`.
           8.  Send analysis of `v4`.
           
           **Rover `v12` actions:**
           1.  Move `v12` from `v13` to `#o3` (for `v17`).
           2.  Calibrate `v12` at `#o3` for `v17`.
           3.  Take image of `v17`.
           4.  Move `v12` from `#o3` to `#o5` (for `v8`).
           5.  Sample rock `v8`.
           6.  Move `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0` (for `v9`).
           7.  Send image of `v17`.
           8.  Send analysis of `v8`.
           
           The goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., v4 of type v2), and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., v8 of type v6). This plan achieves all these.
           
           Let's order the plan for execution. Since both rovers operate independently and the goal state is a conjunction, the order between rover actions doesn't strictly matter for logical correctness, but we should make sure each rover completes its tasks. I will interleave them slightly or perform one fully then the other. Let's do `v14`'s tasks, then `v12`'s tasks.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The consistent failure of reachability, even with conservative and split-rover strategies, suggests a fundamental issue with the assumed motion model or hidden obstacles/constraints. The problem explicitly states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." This implies that the reachability is being checked against the provided `motion` facts, and the coordinates provided by the continuous values need to align with these.
           
           Let's re-examine the `motion` facts. Many of them refer to `conf(rover, #<name>)` where `#<name>` is one of `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. This indicates that these continuous configurations are indeed potential intermediate points or destinations. The problem also specifies that `#o2` is a continuous parameter for motion, likely representing a trajectory.
           
           The rejections for "not reachable" imply that there's no path (sequence of `motion` primitives) from the rover's current `atconf` to the proposed `#o` configuration, even if the straight-line distance is short. The `v21` obstacle (x=0.0) is a significant barrier.
           
           Let's analyze the existing `motion` predicates for `v14` (at `v15` = -1.0, -1.75) and `v12` (at `v13` = 1.0, -1.75):
           
           **For `v14` (starting at `v15`):**
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`: Can stay put.
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`: Can move from `v15` to `#o0`.
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`: Can move from `v15` to `#o3`.
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`: Can move from `v15` to `#o5`.
           *   And vice-versa for these, e.g., `motion(v14, #o0, #o2, v15)`, etc. Also motions between `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`.
           
           It seems the `motion` predicates allow movement between the existing configurations (`v13`, `v15`) and the continuous configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`). The issue is finding *collision-free* values for these continuous configurations such that *all* required actions (image, sample, send) can be performed.
           
           The collision with `v21` at (0.0, -2.0) for `v12` to communicate is understandable. `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). Moving to (0.0, -2.0) puts it directly on `v21`.
           
           **Let's try a radical approach, assuming very limited direct movement for the rover base, and focusing on positions very close to the objects, and keeping `v14` on the left of `v21` and `v12` on the right.**
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` = -1.0, -1.75):**
           *   **Target `v18` (objective, top-left):** AABB((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)).
               *   To image `v18`, need to be left of `v21` (x=0) and far enough from `v19` (x around -0.3).
               *   Let `#o3` for `v14` & `v18` be (-0.8, 1.5). From (-1.0, -1.75) this is reachable. Distance to `v18` is sqrt((-0.67 - (-0.8))^2 + (1.96 - 1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.13^2 + 0.46^2) ~ 0.48. This is within range and avoids obstacles.
           *   **Target `v4` (rock, type `v2`, left-mid):** AABB((-2.095, 0.914), (-2.008, 1.0)).
               *   To sample `v4`, need to be above it. Let `#o5` for `v14` & `v4` be (-2.0, 0.95). This is a big move from (-1.0, -1.75), but if motions exist, it might be allowed.
           *   **Target `v9` (lander, far-left):** AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   To communicate, need line-of-sight and avoid collision with `v9` and `v20`.
               *   Let `#o0` for `v14` & `v9` be (-1.5, -1.5). This is just to the right of `v9` and `v20`, and on the left of `v21`. From `v14`'s initial position (-1.0, -1.75) it's a short move. Distance to `v9` is sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.5^2) ~ 0.64. Good.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` = 1.0, -1.75):**
           *   **Target `v17` (objective, top-right):** AABB((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)).
               *   To image `v17`, need to be right of `v21` (x=0).
               *   Let `#o3` for `v12` & `v17` be (0.7, 1.5). From (1.0, -1.75) it's a move. Distance to `v17` is sqrt((0.55 - 0.7)^2 + (1.83 - 1.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.15^2 + 0.33^2) ~ 0.36. Good.
           *   **Target `v8` (rock, type `v6`, right-mid):** AABB((1.942, 0.696), (2.079, 0.833)).
               *   To sample `v8`, need to be above it. Let `#o5` for `v12` & `v8` be (2.0, 0.75). This is a large move from (1.0, -1.75).
           *   **Target `v9` (lander, far-left):**
               *   `v12` cannot directly see `v9` if it's restricted to the right side of `v21`. The problem states `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So there must be a valid configuration.
               *   If `v12` has to communicate with `v9`, it must be able to view it from the right of `v21` or cross `v21`. Crossing `v21` might be difficult if `v12` is stuck to its side.
               *   Let's check `v9`'s boundaries: max_x = -1.395. So `v9` is entirely on the left side of `v21`.
               *   It's impossible for `v12` to have `comvisible` to `v9` without crossing `v21`.
               *   The only way for `v12` to communicate with `v9` from the right side of `v21` would be if `v9` itself was not fully occluded by `v21` to `v12`, which is unlikely given `v9`'s bounding box and `v21`'s definition.
           
           **This indicates that a single rover MUST be able to communicate with the lander. So, the lander communication task cannot be split across `v12` and `v14` if they are stuck to their sides of `v21`.** This means `v14` is the only viable option for communicating with `v9`, as it starts on the same side as `v9`.
           
           So, the plan must use `v14` for `v18` image and `v4` analysis, and `v12` for `v17` image and `v8` analysis. All communication `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions must go through `v14` to `v9`. This requires `v12` to somehow get its images/analyses to `v14`, which is not an action.
           
           **Conclusion:** If `v12` cannot communicate with `v9` from its side of `v21`, and there's no way to transfer data between rovers, then the goal is actually unreachable if one of the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates depends on `v12` for imaging/sampling and `v14` for sending.
           However, the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions only require `haveimage` or `analyzed` and `comvisible`. They do not specify *which* rover generated the image or analysis.
           So, `v12` can *take* the image/sample, and `v14` can *send* it, if the `haveimage` or `analyzed` predicate is global.
           Let's check the PDDL. `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)` and `analyzed(?v, ?r)` are tied to the rover `?v`. `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` and `receivedanalysis(?r)` are global. This means the rover that takes the image/samples the rock must be the one to send the data.
           
           Therefore, `v12` must be able to send data to `v9`. The collision of `v12` at (0.0, -2.0) with `v21` when trying to communicate indicates `v12` needs a different communication spot that is clear of `v21`.
           
           **Revisiting `v12` communication:**
           *   `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v21` is at x=0.
           *   To get `comvisible` to `v9`, `v12` must be on the left of `v21`. But `v12` starts on the right.
           *   This implies `v12` must cross `v21`. But motion to cross it has not worked.
           *   If `v12` cannot cross `v21` to reach a `comvisible` spot with `v9`, then the plan is impossible as `v12` cannot send its data.
           
           Is there a `comvisible` predicate for `v12` that is *not* `v9`? No, only `v9` is the lander.
           
           **The most likely remaining interpretation is that a combination of valid `motion` links exists, and my continuous coordinates are still leading to pathfinding failures or collisions with hidden path segments/other objects.**
           
           Let's stick to **one rover for all tasks**, which minimizes complex inter-rover transfers or crossing `v21` for tasks that are inherently on the other side. Let's try `v14` to do everything. This means `v14` must cross `v21` to image `v17` and sample `v8` (if we keep using these).
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` = -1.0, -1.75):**
           
           *   **1. Image `v18` (top-left, x < 0):**
               *   `v18` at ((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)).
               *   `#o3_v18` for `v14` at (-1.0, 1.5). This is a move up from start. Distance to `v18` is sqrt(0.33^2 + 0.46^2) ~ 0.56. Collision-free.
           *   **2. Sample `v4` (rock, type `v2`, left-mid, x < 0):**
               *   `v4` at ((-2.095, 0.914), (-2.008, 1.0)).
               *   `#o5_v4` for `v14` at (-2.0, 0.95).
           *   **3. Image `v17` (top-right, x > 0):**
               *   `v17` at ((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)).
               *   `v14` needs to cross `v21`. A spot like (0.5, 1.5) on the right side.
               *   `#o3_v17` for `v14` at (0.5, 1.5). Distance to `v17` is sqrt(0.05^2 + 0.33^2) ~ 0.33. Collision-free (right of `v21`).
           *   **4. Sample `v8` (rock, type `v6`, right-mid, x > 0):**
               *   `v8` at ((1.942, 0.696), (2.079, 0.833)).
               *   `#o5_v8` for `v14` at (2.0, 0.75).
           *   **5. Communicate with `v9` (lander, far-left, x < 0):**
               *   `v9` at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   `#o0_v9` for `v14` at (-1.5, -1.5). Distance to `v9` is sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.5^2) ~ 0.64. Collision-free.
           
           **The critical point is the moves across `v21`.**
           From `v14`'s initial at (-1.0, -1.75) to `#o3_v18` at (-1.0, 1.5)
           Then from `#o3_v18` at (-1.0, 1.5) to `#o5_v4` at (-2.0, 0.95).
           Then from `#o5_v4` at (-2.0, 0.95) to `#o3_v17` at (0.5, 1.5). This crosses `v21`.
           Then from `#o3_v17` at (0.5, 1.5) to `#o5_v8` at (2.0, 0.75).
           Then from `#o5_v8` at (2.0, 0.75) to `#o0_v9` at (-1.5, -1.5). This crosses `v21` again.
           
           This extensive movement across the map and crossing `v21` seems to be the main problem with reachability. Given that simple moves are being rejected, maybe the continuous range for `motion` is extremely limited, and there are very few valid regions.
           
           If the goal is truly unreachable because all proposed coordinates are rejected due to reachability, even when seemingly close to the target from the initial position, then I should state that. However, I am tasked to never give up.
           
           Let's consider if the `motion` predicates allow for a sequence of moves through an intermediate, un-named configuration. The problem states: "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter*...". The `motion` predicate's third argument, `#o2`, is a continuous parameter (trajectory).
           
           What if the existing configurations `v13` and `v15` are the *only* reachable `conf`s for the rovers, and the `#oX` configurations are strictly defined by their relation to the targets, and not necessarily easy to reach in themselves? This would be a very hard problem.
           
           Given the consistent failure of reachability, I will try one last set of *very minimal* moves to configurations that are as close as possible to the rover's initial position and the target, trying to keep them out of direct obstacle bounding boxes.
           
           **Using `v14` for all tasks, and keeping paths simple.**
           
           *   **`v14` starts at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)**
           
           1.  **Image `v18` (objective, top-left):** `v18` at ((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)).
               *   Let `#o3` for `v14` & `v18` be (-0.7, 1.0). This is somewhat close to `v18` and clear of `v21` and `v19`. Distance from `v15` is sqrt((-0.7 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 2.75^2) ~ 2.76. This is a big move. Let's try (-1.0, 1.0). This is a direct move up from `v15`'s x. Distance from `v15` to (-1.0, 1.0) is 2.75. Distance to `v18` from (-1.0, 1.0) is sqrt((-0.67 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.96 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.33^2 + 0.96^2) ~ 1.0. This seems like a reasonable candidate.
           2.  **Sample `v4` (rock, type `v2`, left-mid):** `v4` at ((-2.095, 0.914), (-2.008, 1.0)).
               *   Let `#o5` for `v14` & `v4` be (-2.0, 0.95).
           3.  **Image `v17` (objective, top-right):** `v17` at ((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)).
               *   This requires crossing `v21`. Let's try (0.6, 1.0). Distance from `v15` is sqrt((0.6 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.6^2 + 2.75^2) ~ 3.18. This is also a large move, but on the other side of `v21`.
           4.  **Sample `v8` (rock, type `v6`, right-mid):** `v8` at ((1.942, 0.696), (2.079, 0.833)).
               *   Let `#o5` for `v14` & `v8` be (2.0, 0.75).
           5.  **Communicate `v9` (lander, far-left):** `v9` at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Let `#o0` for `v14` & `v9` be (-1.0, -1.5). This is a very short move from `v15` and avoids `v20` and `v9` itself. Distance to `v9` is sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.5^2) ~ 1.03.
           
           This is extremely difficult without more information on the environment's traversability or motion primitive limitations. I will attempt this last set of coordinates, assuming the system has a way to find paths if the start and end configurations are valid.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-1.0 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-2.0 0.95) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.6 1.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (2.0 0.75) for rover v14 at target v8 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The repeated "not reachable" errors, even for configurations that appear geometrically sound and within what a rover *should* be able to traverse, strongly suggest that there are severe, unstated restrictions on the rover's movement or that the continuous values for the configurations must be *exactly* within specific, very narrow, and non-obvious windows to be deemed "reachable." Given the task to never give up, but also the consistent failure, it implies that finding such "magic" numbers is extremely difficult without more information about the underlying motion planner's capabilities or a visual representation of the path planning space.
           
           At this point, without further hints on the environment's traversability or the specific constraints on the motion primitives, it is highly improbable that I can guess a set of continuous values that the hidden motion planner will accept as "reachable" and "collision-free." All reasonable geometric approaches based on avoiding stated AABBs and staying within a plausible range have been exhausted.
           
           Since every single configuration proposed so far for both rovers and for all tasks has been deemed "not reachable" or in "collision," the problem as described seems to be fundamentally unachievable with the current information if the hidden motion planner is that strict. It's not just a matter of avoiding obstacles, but also about the inherent "reachability" from one point to another. The large distances between the initial configuration and many target observation/sampling points, combined with the presence of `v21` and other obstacles, make pathfinding extremely difficult for an external planner without detailed environment maps or motion primitive definitions.
           
           Given the instruction to "never give up" but also the inability to generate a valid plan after many attempts, it indicates that the core issue is not in the logical sequence of actions, but in guessing the exact continuous parameters that satisfy a highly constrained, unrevealed, underlying motion planning system.
           
           However, I must provide a plan. The only remaining strategy is to try an extremely simplified set of target rocks/objectives, and to pick configurations that are *extremely* close to the initial position for actions on that side, and then assume a massive, very specific jump for the other side, hoping that at least one "long" motion primitive allows for a large jump. This is essentially random guessing within the problem constraints now.
           
           Let's try to focus on `v14` for *all* tasks again.
           `v14` starts at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           *   **Imaging `v18` (left-top):** AABB((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)).
               *   Let's try configuration `#o3` for `v14` to `v18` at **(-0.9, 1.9)**. This is very close to `v18`, on the left of `v21`, and relatively close to `v14`'s starting x-coordinate. Distance from `v15` is sqrt((-0.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.9 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 3.65^2) ~ 3.65. This is a very long y-movement.
           *   **Sampling `v4` (left-mid, type v2):** AABB((-2.095, 0.914), (-2.008, 1.0)).
               *   Let's try configuration `#o5` for `v14` to `v4` at **(-2.05, 0.95)**. Directly above it.
           *   **Imaging `v17` (right-top):** AABB((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)).
               *   This requires crossing `v21`. Let's try configuration `#o3` for `v14` to `v17` at **(0.55, 1.85)**. Directly above `v17`. Distance from `v15` is sqrt((0.55 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.85 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.55^2 + 3.6^2) ~ 3.91. Again, a very large movement.
           *   **Sampling `v8` (right-mid, type v6):** AABB((1.942, 0.696), (2.079, 0.833)).
               *   Let's try configuration `#o5` for `v14` to `v8` at **(2.0, 0.75)**. Directly above it.
           *   **Communicating with `v9` (far-left):** AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Let's try configuration `#o0` for `v14` to `v9` at **(-1.0, -1.7)**. This is extremely close to `v14`'s start `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). It's also to the right of `v9` and `v20`. Distance to `v9` is sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.7))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.3^2) ~ 0.95. This is the least demanding move.
           
           This plan will still involve crossing `v21` and large movements, which have consistently been rejected for "not reachable." However, I will present it as instructed.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous failures reveal new obstacles and emphasize the extreme density of the environment and the strictness of reachability. It's clear that the configurations need to be chosen with much finer precision and a more complete understanding of all obstacles, including potentially implicit ones (like object bounding boxes that the rover cannot occupy).
           
           **New obstacles revealed:**
           *   `v22`: AABB((-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), (-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)) - This is a new obstacle in the top-left, where `v18` is.
           *   `v23`: AABB((0.25, 1.75, 0.0), (0.75, 2.25, 0.1)) - This is a new obstacle in the top-right, where `v17` is.
           *   The collision with `v17` itself when trying to image it is a strong hint: the rover cannot occupy the same space as the target objective. This means the imaging configuration needs to be *near* the objective, but not *on* or *in* its bounding box.
           
           This information is crucial. Let's re-strategize one final time, assuming *extremely precise* placement and avoiding all known obstacle AABBs.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` = -1.0, -1.75):**
           
           *   **1. Image `v18` (objective, top-left):**
               *   `v18` AABB: ((-0.717, 1.922), (-0.629, 2.01)).
               *   `v22` AABB: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)).
               *   Previous `#o3` (-0.9, 1.9) collided with `v22`. We need to be left of `v22`'s `min_x` (-0.75) and not collide with `v18`.
               *   Let's try a spot significantly to the left of `v22` and `v18`: **(-1.5, 1.0)**.
                   *   Reachability from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, 1.0) is sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (2.75)^2) ~ 2.8.
                   *   Distance to `v18` (center ~ -0.67, 1.96) from (-1.5, 1.0) is sqrt(( -0.67 - (-1.5) )^2 + (1.96 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.83^2 + 0.96^2) ~ 1.27. Within range (2). Collision-free from `v22` and `v18`.
           *   **2. Sample `v4` (rock, type `v2`, left-mid):**
               *   `v4` AABB: ((-2.095, 0.914), (-2.008, 1.0)).
               *   Previous `#o5` (-2.05, 0.95) was not reachable. This is directly in `v4`'s x-range. The rover base cannot be *inside* the rock. It has to be *above* it but not in collision.
               *   Let's try **(-2.05, 0.5)**. This is still `above` `v4`'s x range but possibly slightly offset in y to avoid collision, and still within `v4`'s area. Distance from current (-1.5, 1.0) to (-2.05, 0.5) is sqrt((-0.55)^2 + (-0.5)^2) ~ 0.74.
           *   **3. Image `v17` (objective, top-right):**
               *   `v17` AABB: ((0.512, 1.792), (0.6, 1.879)).
               *   `v23` AABB: ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
               *   Previous `#o3` (0.55, 1.85) collided with `v17` and `v23`. We need to be right of `v23`'s `max_x` (0.75) or left of `min_x` (0.25), and avoid `v17`.
               *   Let's try a spot to the right of `v23` and `v17`: **(1.0, 1.0)**.
                   *   Reachability from (-2.05, 0.5) to (1.0, 1.0) is sqrt((3.05)^2 + (0.5)^2) ~ 3.09. This is a very large move, crossing `v21`.
                   *   Distance to `v17` (center ~ 0.55, 1.83) from (1.0, 1.0) is sqrt((0.55 - 1.0)^2 + (1.83 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.45)^2 + 0.83^2) ~ 0.95. Within range (2). Collision-free from `v17` and `v23`.
           *   **4. Sample `v8` (rock, type `v6`, right-mid):**
               *   `v8` AABB: ((1.942, 0.696), (2.079, 0.833)).
               *   Previous `#o5` (2.0, 0.75) was not reachable. Rover base cannot be inside the rock.
               *   Let's try **(2.0, 0.5)**. This is above its x-range, slightly offset in y. Distance from current (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 0.5) is sqrt((1.0)^2 + (-0.5)^2) ~ 1.12.
           *   **5. Communicate with `v9` (lander, far-left):**
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` (-1.0, -1.7) was not reachable.
               *   Let's try **(-1.2, -1.7)**. This is slightly different from the initial `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), away from `v21`, and to the right of `v9` and `v20`.
                   *   Distance from current (2.0, 0.5) to (-1.2, -1.7) is sqrt((-3.2)^2 + (-2.2)^2) ~ 3.88. This is another massive move across the map.
                   *   Distance to `v9` (center ~ -1.9, -2.0) from (-1.2, -1.7) is sqrt((-0.7)^2 + (-0.3)^2) ~ 0.76. Within range (4).
           
           The continuous reachability failures are truly the most challenging aspect here. These new coordinates are attempting to be very safe in terms of collision. The reachability remains the major unknown.

Model:     The repeated "not reachable" errors are consistent across all proposed configurations, for both rovers, and even for seemingly short and obstacle-free movements. This situation is highly unusual and suggests a deeper, implicit constraint that is not being captured by the explicit PDDL domain or the provided AABB obstacle list.
           
           Given the instructions to "never give up," but also the reality of having exhausted all geometrically plausible and collision-free options for continuous parameters without success, the problem becomes unsolvable from my perspective without more information on the underlying motion planning system's capabilities, map details, or specific valid coordinates.
           
           The "reachability" constraint seems to be the critical bottleneck, more so than simple AABB collisions. It's possible that:
           1.  The `motion` primitives only allow for extremely limited movement, far less than implied by the available configurations.
           2.  There are complex, non-AABB obstacles or impassable terrain features.
           3.  The problem expects the continuous configurations to be *exactly* specific values that are not discoverable through general geometric reasoning.
           4.  There might be a very specific, winding path that is "reachable" but all direct guesses are not.
           
           Since I cannot infer these hidden constraints or specific "magic" coordinates, and every attempt is met with the same "not reachable" error, I have no basis to continue guessing coordinates for the same actions. Every new set of coordinates will just be another guess without additional information.
           
           Therefore, I have to conclude that given the information provided and the repeated rejections for reachability for all geometrically sound attempts, **the goal is not achievable under the current interpretation of the environment and motion capabilities.** The rover seems to be stuck in its initial position or has an extremely limited movement range that cannot reach any of the target observation/sampling/communication points.
           
           I will state this conclusion directly. I cannot generate a valid plan if no path exists for the robot, and the system explicitly rejects all proposed paths.
