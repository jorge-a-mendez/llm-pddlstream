           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. Let's break down `new-axiom@0()` into its constituent predicates:
           
           `new-axiom@0()` is true if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` is true
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)` is true
           3. `free(v12, v16)` is true
           4. `free(v14, v16)` is true
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is true
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is true
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` is true (where `?stone` is a rock of type v2)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` is true (for rocks of type v2)
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` is true (where `?soil` is a rock of type v6)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` is true (for rocks of type v6)
           
           Let's check the initial state for these conditions:
           
           **Conditions related to configurations and storage:**
           * `atconf(v12, v13)`: True (initial state)
           * `atconf(v14, v15)`: True (initial state)
           * `free(v12, v16)`: True (initial state)
           * `free(v14, v16)`: True (initial state)
           These conditions are already met.
           
           **Conditions related to images:**
           * `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False (not in initial state)
           * `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False (not in initial state)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(objective, mode)`, we need to:
           1. `calibrate(rover, conf, ray, objective, camera)`
           2. `take_image(rover, conf, ray, objective, camera, mode)`
           3. `send_image(rover, conf, ray, lander, objective, mode)`
           
           Let's look at the available objects:
           * `objective(v17)` and `objective(v18)`
           * `mode(v11)`
           * `camera(v10)`
           * `lander(v9)`
           * `rover(v12)` and `rover(v14)`
           
           We have `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)`, meaning both rovers have camera v10. We also have `supports(v10, v11)`.
           
           For `v17` (objective) and `v11` (mode):
           * We need `imagevisible(rover, conf, ray, v17)`:
               * `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` is given.
               * `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is given.
           * We need `comvisible(rover, conf, ray, v9)`:
               * `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is given.
               * `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` is given.
           
           For `v18` (objective) and `v11` (mode):
           * We need `imagevisible(rover, conf, ray, v18)`:
               * `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is given.
               * `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` is given.
           * We need `comvisible(rover, conf, ray, v9)`:
               * `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is given.
               * `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` is given.
           
           Let's use `v12` for `v17` and `v14` for `v18` to simplify the plan.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (using `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`)
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` (using `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`)
           
           For `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` (using `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`)
           2. `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)` (using `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`)
           
           We can potentially use the same ray and configuration for image and communication, but the problem states different configs may be needed. `#o3` is for `imagevisible` and `#o0` is for `comvisible`. Both need to be collision-free and have line-of-sight. We assume these conditions can be met for the given `#o` parameters. Note that `calibrated` becomes false after `take_image`, so we need to calibrate again if we want to take another image with the same camera.
           
           **Conditions related to analysis:**
           * `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
               * Rocks of type `v2`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
               * We need `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, and `receivedanalysis(v4)`.
           * `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
               * Rocks of type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
               * We need `receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, and `receivedanalysis(v8)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(rock)`, we need to:
           1. `sample_rock(rover, conf, rock, store)`
           2. `send_analysis(rover, conf, ray, lander, rock)`
           
           Let's pick one rock of each type and analyze it.
           For type `v2`: Let's choose `v3`.
           * `above(v14, #o5, v3)` is given.
           * `above(v12, #o5, v3)` is given.
           * `store(v16)` is given.
           * `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true.
           Let's use `v12` for `v3`.
           1. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)`
           2. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           
           For type `v6`: Let's choose `v8`.
           * `above(v12, #o5, v8)` is given.
           * `above(v14, #o5, v8)` is given.
           Let's use `v14` for `v8`.
           1. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)`
           2. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           
           Combining all these steps, ensuring preconditions are met. We need to be careful with `calibrated` predicate.
           
           Plan Outline:
           
           1.  **Image v17 (using v12):**
               * Calibrate camera v10 for v12 targeting v17.
               * Take image of v17 with v12.
               * Send image of v17 from v12 to lander v9.
           2.  **Image v18 (using v14):**
               * Calibrate camera v10 for v14 targeting v18.
               * Take image of v18 with v14.
               * Send image of v18 from v14 to lander v9.
           3.  **Analyze v3 (type v2, using v12):**
               * Sample rock v3 with v12.
               * Send analysis of v3 from v12 to lander v9.
           4.  **Analyze v8 (type v6, using v14):**
               * Sample rock v8 with v14.
               * Send analysis of v8 from v14 to lander v9.
           
           Order of actions can be intertwined since rovers can operate in parallel. However, since the problem doesn't specify parallel execution and we are building a sequential plan, we'll just chain them.
           
           Important note: The initial state provides configurations like `conf(v12, v13)`, `conf(v14, v15)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`. The `atconf` predicates are `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. This means if we need to use a different configuration (like `#o3`, `#o5`, `#o0`), the rover needs to `move` to that configuration. However, the only `move` actions allowed are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are self-moves. This means the rovers are assumed to be already at the configurations needed for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates when those predicates are used with the `#o` configurations. We need to verify if this is possible.
           The initial state explicitly states `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           However, `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates use `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and `above` predicate uses `#o5`. If we need to use these, the rover must be at `atconf(rover, #oX)`. But the only `atconf` are `v13` and `v15`. And no `move` actions are given to move from `v13` to `#o3` or `v15` to `#o5`. This indicates that the problem expects us to use the configurations that the rovers are currently at, or the problem statement about `move` is incomplete.
           
           Let's re-read: "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a continuous parameter ... If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           
           This implies that the rover *can* be at `#o3` or `#o0` or `#o5`, even if `atconf(rover, #oX)` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, and we are expected to provide the values.
           However, the available actions list only `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. This means we cannot actually `move` to `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`. This is a crucial constraint.
           If the rover needs to be at `#o3` for `imagevisible` but is currently at `v13`, and no `move` action exists from `v13` to `#o3`, then `take_image` and `calibrate` cannot be executed. The same applies to `sample_rock` (needs `atconf(v, q)` where `q` is `#o5`) and `send_image`/`send_analysis` (needs `atconf(v, q)` where `q` is `#o0`).
           
           Given the limited `move` actions, it seems we are constrained to using `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14` for all actions requiring `atconf`. Let's check if the predicates that are true in the initial state use these base configurations `v13` and `v15`.
           No, they don't. All `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates are defined using `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` respectively, not `v13` or `v15`.
           For example, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` requires `atconf(v14, #o3)` as a precondition for `take_image`. But initially `atconf(v14, v15)` is true, and there is no `move` action from `v15` to `#o3`.
           
           This means the task is likely unsolvable with the provided `move` actions and initial `atconf` states, as the rovers cannot reach the necessary configurations for any of the sensor or sampling actions.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of "If your plan uses some object #<name> ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration...". This means we can *assume* that the rover can get to that configuration. However, the *preconditions* of actions still need to be satisfied, and `atconf` is a precondition. The available actions *explicitly list* only two `move` actions, both of which are self-loops. This strongly implies we cannot move to a different configuration.
           
           If the goal is to be achievable, then the `atconf` for the rovers must somehow be compatible with the `#o` configurations mentioned in `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above`. But they are not.
           
           If `atconf(v12, v13)` is true, and for `take_image`, we need `atconf(v12, #o3)`, and there's no way to change `atconf`, then `take_image` cannot be executed.
           
           Conclusion: The goal is unreachable because the rovers cannot move to the required configurations (e.g., `#o3` for `imagevisible`, `#o0` for `comvisible`, `#o5` for `above`) given the limited `move` actions provided and their current configurations. The `move` actions provided are self-loops, meaning the rovers cannot change their configuration from `v13` or `v15`.
           
           Let's consider an alternative interpretation: what if the `atconf` predicates for `#o` were implicitly true if the `conf(rover, #o)` and the relevant `visible` or `above` predicate were true? No, PDDL states facts not explicitly stated are false. And `atconf` is a concrete predicate.
           
           The prompt states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This strictly limits `move` actions to the self-loops.
           
           Therefore, the plan cannot be constructed.
           
           One final check: "If there are sufficient configurations without '#' to solve the problem, you should use those configurations instead of any with '#'.". Here, we only have `v13` and `v15` without `#`. But no `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, or `above` predicates are true for `v13` or `v15`.
           
           For instance, to `take_image(v12, ?q, ?y, v17, v10, v11)`, we need `atconf(v12, ?q)`. The only `?q` for which `imagevisible(v12, ?q, ?y, v17)` is true is `#o3`. So we need `atconf(v12, #o3)`. But currently `atconf(v12, v13)` and there's no way to change that.
           
           Thus, the goal is unreachable.
