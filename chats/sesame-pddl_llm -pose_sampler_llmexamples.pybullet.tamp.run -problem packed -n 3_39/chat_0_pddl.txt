           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is a square with side length approximately 0.097.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to place the object's center (x, y) on the surface such that the entire object is contained within the surface boundaries, regardless of its orientation. Since the object is square, rotating it by 0 or pi/2 radians will result in the same bounding box dimensions.
           
           For a square object with side `s_obj` on a square surface with side `s_surf`, the maximum allowed extent for the object's center from the surface's center is `(s_surf - s_obj) / 2`.
           
           For surface 0:
           `s_surf_x = 0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27`
           `s_surf_y = 0.135 - (-0.135) = 0.27`
           `s_obj = 0.09744422829171295`
           
           Maximum center offset: `(0.27 - 0.09744422829171295) / 2 = 0.17255577170828705 / 2 = 0.08627788585414352`
           
           So, for surface 0, the object's center (x, y) can be anywhere within `[-0.08627788585414352, 0.08627788585414352]` in both x and y.
           
           I will generate placements that cover the surface, including the center and various corners and edges within the valid range. I will primarily use rotations of 0 and pi/2 radians.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I have successfully placed object 4 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 4, a square of side ~0.097, is now at the center of the surface.
           
           The new object, ID 5, is also a square, with side length approximately 0.0779.
           
           To find stable placements for object 5, I need to place its center (x, y) on the surface such that:
           1. The entire object 5 is contained within the surface boundaries.
           2. Object 5 does not collide with object 4.
           
           For surface 0:
           `s_surf_x = 0.27`
           `s_surf_y = 0.27`
           `s_obj_5 = 0.07794811643817257`
           
           Maximum center offset for object 5: `(0.27 - 0.07794811643817257) / 2 = 0.19205188356182743 / 2 = 0.09602594178091372`
           So, for surface 0, object 5's center (x, y) can be anywhere within `[-0.09602594178091372, 0.09602594178091372]` in both x and y, if there were no other objects.
           
           Object 4 is centered at `(0,0)` and has `s_obj_4 = 0.09744422829171295`.
           The bounding box for object 4 is `(-0.09744422829171295/2, -0.09744422829171295/2)` to `(0.09744422829171295/2, 0.09744422829171295/2)`, which is roughly `(-0.0487, -0.0487)` to `(0.0487, 0.0487)`.
           
           For object 5 to not collide with object 4, the distance between their centers must be greater than `(s_obj_4 + s_obj_5) / 2`.
           `s_obj_4 + s_obj_5 = 0.09744422829171295 + 0.07794811643817257 = 0.17539234473088552`
           Minimum center distance: `0.17539234473088552 / 2 = 0.08769617236544276`
           
           Since object 4 is at `(0,0)`, object 5's center `(x,y)` must satisfy `sqrt(x^2 + y^2) >= 0.08769617236544276`.
           This means object 5 cannot be placed too close to the center. I'll aim for placements towards the corners and edges, ensuring they are outside this radius but still within the surface bounds.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27.
           I have successfully placed object 4 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This object is a square with side ~0.0974. Its bounding box is `(-0.0487, -0.0487)` to `(0.0487, 0.0487)`.
           I have successfully placed object 5 at `(0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)`. This object is a square with side ~0.0779. Its bounding box is `(0.09 - 0.0779/2, 0.0 - 0.0779/2)` to `(0.09 + 0.0779/2, 0.0 + 0.0779/2)`, which is roughly `(0.051, -0.039)` to `(0.129, 0.039)`.
           
           The new object, ID 6, is also a square, with side length approximately 0.0986.
           
           To find stable placements for object 6, I need to place its center (x, y) on the surface such that:
           1. The entire object 6 is contained within the surface boundaries.
           2. Object 6 does not collide with object 4.
           3. Object 6 does not collide with object 5.
           
           For surface 0:
           `s_surf_x = 0.27`
           `s_surf_y = 0.27`
           `s_obj_6 = 0.09862835777604989`
           
           Maximum center offset for object 6: `(0.27 - 0.09862835777604989) / 2 = 0.17137164222395011 / 2 = 0.08568582111197505`
           So, object 6's center (x, y) can be anywhere within `[-0.08568582111197505, 0.08568582111197505]` in both x and y, considering only surface bounds.
           
           Collision with object 4 (center `(0,0)`, `s_obj_4 = 0.09744422829171295`):
           Minimum center distance from object 4: `(s_obj_4 + s_obj_6) / 2 = (0.09744422829171295 + 0.09862835777604989) / 2 = 0.19607258606776284 / 2 = 0.09803629303388142`
           So, `sqrt(x_6^2 + y_6^2) >= 0.09803629303388142`.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center `(0.09,0)`, `s_obj_5 = 0.07794811643817257`):
           Minimum center distance from object 5: `(s_obj_5 + s_obj_6) / 2 = (0.07794811643817257 + 0.09862835777604989) / 2 = 0.17657647421422246 / 2 = 0.08828823710711123`
           So, `sqrt((x_6 - 0.09)^2 + y_6^2) >= 0.08828823710711123`.
           
           Given these constraints, object 6 needs to be placed far enough from both `(0,0)` and `(0.09,0)`.
           This makes the space a bit tight. I'll focus on areas like `(-0.08, 0)` or `(0, -0.08)` or `(-0.08, -0.08)` etc, which are far from `(0,0)` and also sufficiently far from `(0.09,0)`.
           
           Let's test `(-0.08, 0)`:
           Distance from object 4: `sqrt((-0.08)^2 + 0^2) = 0.08`. This is LESS than `0.098`. So `(-0.08, 0)` will collide with object 4. This also means placing it at `(0.08, 0)` would collide with object 4. Placing it at `(0, 0.08)` or `(0, -0.08)` would also collide with object 4.
           
           The first constraint means that the object's center cannot be within a circle of radius ~0.098 around `(0,0)`.
           The second constraint means the object's center cannot be within a circle of radius ~0.088 around `(0.09,0)`.
           
           Let's reconsider the valid range for placing object 6, which is `[-0.085, 0.085]`.
           We need `x_6^2 + y_6^2 >= 0.098^2 = 0.0096`
           And `(x_6 - 0.09)^2 + y_6^2 >= 0.088^2 = 0.0077`
           
           Consider placing it on the negative x-axis, far from both.
           Let `x_6 = -0.08`. Then `y_6` must be close to `0` for it to be close to the boundary.
           Distance from obj 4: `0.08 < 0.098`. This won't work.
           
           This implies that there's not enough room for object 6 without colliding with object 4, because the maximum allowed center offset for object 6 from the surface boundary is ~0.085, but its minimum non-collision distance from object 4 is ~0.098.
           
           This suggests that perhaps a stable placement for object 6 on the *surface* is not possible without colliding with object 4.
           Let's re-check the numbers carefully.
           Object 4 radius from its center to edge = `0.09744422829171295 / 2 = 0.048722114145856475`
           Object 6 radius from its center to edge = `0.09862835777604989 / 2 = 0.049314178888024945`
           
           Max coordinate for center of object 6 = `0.135 - 0.049314178888024945 = 0.08568582111197505`
           Min coordinate for center of object 6 = `-0.08568582111197505`
           
           So the range for `x` and `y` for object 6 is `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`.
           Object 4 is at `(0,0)`. Its extent is `[-0.0487, 0.0487]` in both x and y.
           For object 6 not to overlap with object 4, the center of object 6 must be such that `|x_6| > 0.0487 + 0.0493 = 0.098` OR `|y_6| > 0.0487 + 0.0493 = 0.098`.
           This means if `x_6` is between `0.0` and `0.098`, and `y_6` is between `0.0` and `0.098`, there is a collision.
           
           However, the maximum allowed `x_6` or `y_6` for object 6 is `0.0856`.
           Since `0.0856 < 0.098`, it is impossible to place object 6 without colliding with object 4 if object 4 is at `(0,0)`.
           
           This is a scenario where I must acknowledge that there might be no valid placement that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. However, the instructions say "You never give up." and "you will always try to find a new placement."
           
           Perhaps my understanding of "stable placement" implicitly assumes non-collision with *fixed* obstacles (surfaces), but that object 4 and 5 are "non-fixed" obstacles (other objects) that I am learning about. The feedback says "placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles".
           
           If object 4 and 5 are "non-fixed obstacles" then I should *avoid* them but the system might still consider a placement valid if it only collides with "non-fixed" obstacles and doesn't collide with "fixed" obstacles. This interpretation is problematic as it makes no sense to put things on top of each other.
           
           Let me assume that I must *not* collide with previously placed objects. In that case, based on my calculations, no placement is possible for object 6.
           
           Let me re-read "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This is about *my* previous placements for a single object. Here I am placing a *new* object.
           
           The constraint is to find a stable placement for the object on *one of the surfaces*. Stable usually means not falling off and not colliding with anything fixed. The other objects are not fixed. However, my "knowledge of the scene" should include the placement of other objects.
           
           If I strictly follow the collision detection (sum of radii for squares), then `max_abs_coord_for_6 = 0.0856`. Collision with 4 requires `abs(x_6) > 0.098` or `abs(y_6) > 0.098`.
           Since `0.0856 < 0.098`, any placement of object 6 will overlap with object 4's bounding box.
           
           This is a critical point. If it's truly impossible, I can't generate 50 unique *non-colliding* placements.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. I will generate placements that are stable *relative to the surface boundaries* (i.e., within the `[-0.0856, 0.0856]` range) and maximize distance from the existing objects, or place them such that they would 'share' the space if that was allowed. I will pick placements that are as far as possible from the current objects.
           
           If object 4 is at `(0,0)` (occupies `x in [-0.0487, 0.0487], y in [-0.0487, 0.0487]`).
           Object 5 is at `(0.09,0)` (occupies `x in [0.051, 0.129], y in [-0.039, 0.039]`).
           
           The available region on the surface for object 6's *center* is `x in [-0.0856, 0.0856], y in [-0.0856, 0.0856]`.
           This region *is entirely contained* within the `x` range of object 4 `(-0.0487 - 0.0493, 0.0487 + 0.0493) = (-0.098, 0.098)`.
           So indeed, any placement of object 6 *will* collide with object 4, if they are both squares and oriented at 0 or pi/2.
           If object 6 is rotated at pi/4, its bounding box becomes larger, making it even harder.
           
           I will attempt to place it on the edges of the allowed region, prioritizing spots away from object 4 and 5. Although the math indicates unavoidable collision, I will provide the placements that are geometrically "most separated" while still being on the surface. For example, placing it at `(-0.08, 0)` tries to get as far from `(0,0)` as possible on the x-axis, while being as far as possible from `(0.09,0)`.
