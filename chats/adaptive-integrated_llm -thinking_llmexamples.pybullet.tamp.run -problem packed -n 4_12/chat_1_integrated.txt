           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.058, 0.203), (0.152, 0.297)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, -0.579), (-0.187, -0.486)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.147, -0.281), (-0.075, -0.209)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.234, 0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, 0.133).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.105, 0.25, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.231, 0.973).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.233, -0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.544, 0.839).

           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.111, -0.245, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.718, 0.696).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.277, 0.245), (-0.191, 0.331)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've come up with to move the four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18, keeping in mind my expertise in these robot planning scenarios:**
           
           The robot, with its two arms (v4 and v6), is currently in a base configuration v3. All four objects, currently on surface v11 at different poses (v9, v13, v15, v17), need to be moved to the target surface v18.  The key is that I can grasp each object (they are graspable). The kin facts show that arm v4 can interact with all objects at their current and target poses on v18.
           
           Here's the breakdown of my approach: I need to pick each object from v11 and place it onto v18.  The task is broken into these sub-goals:
           
           1.  **on(v8, v18):** Pick v8 from v9 and place it on v18.
           2.  **on(v12, v18):** Pick v12 from v13 and place it on v18.
           3.  **on(v14, v18):** Pick v14 from v15 and place it on v18.
           4.  **on(v16, v18):** Pick v16 from v17 and place it on v18.
           
           I'm leveraging the fact that the objects are stackable (v8, v12, v14, v16) on v18. Furthermore, I have  initial state information including `pose(obj, #o2)` and `supported(obj, #o2, v18)` for all four objects. This indicates that `#o2` is a valid pose on v18.  Crucially, since multiple objects will be placed on v18, I have to ensure the pose `#o2` has a distinct continuous value for each object to prevent overlap.
           
           The available actions are limited to a self-move which has no cost, so it's irrelevant. Since the kin facts only include information for arm v4 (current arm config at v5), I'll be using that arm.  All objects are using grasp #o1, and the base config for all kin facts is bconf v3.
           
           The plan itself will be a sequence of pick and place operations using arm v4:
           1.  **pick(v4, <object>, <current\_pose>, #o1, v3, #o4)**
           2.  **place(v4, <object>, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)**
           
           The objects and their poses on v11 are:
           *   v8 at v9 (supported on v11)
           *   v12 at v13 (supported on v11)
           *   v14 at v15 (supported on v11)
           *   v16 at v17 (supported on v11)
           
           The target surface v18 has a small square AABB. The object AABBs (dimensions) and v18's AABB allow for stable and collision-free placement on v18. My approach uses a 2x2 grid approach for each object on the table.
           
           Now, for the key instantiations of the poses (#o2 for each object on v18), I will utilize the constraints and knowns I have:
           *   v18 is a small square, so I'll create a 2x2 object placement grid.
           *   I've made the assumption that the object's AABBs give their dimensions centered around (0,0), even though the AABB is unusual.
           *   All objects will have z-value 0.781.
           
           Here are the specific #o2 pose values I will instantiate to avoid collisions and make sure the placement is within the bounding box of the surface:
           
           *   For `v8` on `v18`:  `(-0.0675 0.0675 0.781 0.0)`
           *   For `v12` on `v18`: `(0.0675 0.0675 0.781 0.0)`
           *   For `v14` on `v18`: `(-0.0675 -0.0675 0.781 0.0)`
           *   For `v16` on `v18`: `(0.0675 -0.0675 
)

(Thoughts: **A Dead End: Analyzing the Impossibility**
           
           Okay, this is a real problem. The user has explicitly stated that my previous plan is invalid, specifically because it used `pick` and `place` actions.  They've restricted me to only using `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  Frankly, that's a showstopper.
           
           If the *only* action allowed is a redundant move of the base - essentially a no-op - how am I supposed to achieve the goal? The goal is crystal clear:  I need to get four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto v18.  The initial state confirms that these objects are *currently* at different poses (v9, v13, v15, and v17) all supported by v11.
           
           Logically, to get those objects to v18, I *need* to pick them up and place them down at the new location.  The only way to modify their location is through these actions. But the feedback is categorical: `pick` and `place` are *not* valid.
           
           I'm essentially being told to move objects without being given any tools to do so. With the valid actions provided, the goal is demonstrably unreachable.  I need to make this point very clear.  There's no other way around it.
