User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.341, 0.043), (-4.258, 0.126)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.299, 0.085, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.629, 0.777).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`. We also know `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`. The goal is to put either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Since `v18` is a table-like object ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), we can place an object on it.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`. Both are not on `v18`. We need to pick one of them and place it on `v18`. Let's choose `v8` to put on `v18`. To do this, we need to pick `v8` from `v9` and then place it on a pose on `v18`. The pose `v9` for `v8` is (4.5, 0.3, 0.8). `v11` is also an object with AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)), which `v8` is supported on. `v18` is a sub-region of `v11`.
           
           The current robot base configuration is `v3` at (2.5, 0.0, 0.0). The object `v8` is located at `v9` (4.5, 0.3, 0.8). The robot arm is `v4` at `v5`. There are `kin` relations for picking `v8` from `v9` and placing it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Let's pick `v8` from `v9` using `arm v4` and `grasp #o1`. Then place `v8` at a new pose `#o2` on `v18`. The `basemotion` action is available, but the `move_base` action itself doesn't change the robot's configuration unless a new `atbconf` is specified. Here `move_base v3 v3 #o0` keeps the robot at `v3`.
           
           The initial state does not contain any `cfreeposepose`, `cfreeapproachpose`, or `cfreetrajpose` predicates. This means we have to assume the robot can perform the actions without collisions or these predicates would be negated.
           
           The available `kin` action instances for `v4` and `v8` are:
           `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (pick `v8` from `v9`)
           `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (place `v8` at `#o2`)
           
           We will use these `kin` values for the pick and place actions. The pose `#o2` for `v8` on `v18` must be determined.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.4 0.0 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The available actions list only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action does not change the robot's base configuration (`atbconf(v3)` remains true) and its only effect is to assert `canmove()` (which is already true) and negate `canmove()` (which it asserts again, so it's a no-op in terms of `canmove()`). It also increases the cost. This action cannot achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires changing the state of an object (specifically, putting an object `on` `v18`).
           
           The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which expands to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. To achieve `on(?green, v18)`, an object needs to be picked up and placed. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances. Without `pick` or `place` actions, it's impossible to move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
