           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will try to find positions around the target point that avoid these known obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are relatively far from any obstacles, and try to explore different directions around the target point.
           
           The target point is now at (1.9121298789978027, 2.1450886726379395). Previous failures indicate that obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) is a major collision risk for positions near the target. Also, the central vertical wall (x=0) and other obstacles on the left side of x=0 occlude the view. I will try positions further away from obstacle 7, and specifically positions with smaller y-coordinates, further away from the top wall. I'll continue to explore within the allowed range on the right side of the x=0 wall.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           The target point is now at (-1.827656626701355, 2.0014007091522217). This target is on the left side of the x=0 wall. Previous failures show that placing the robot on the right side of the x=0 wall results in no line of sight, which is expected due to the vertical wall. Also, attempts to place the robot at x = -1.69 and y = 2.19 collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and obstacle 21 ((-1.8765392932032308, 1.952518042650346), (-1.7787739601994792, 2.0502833756540975)). This means there's a cluster of obstacles near the target, making it difficult to approach from the left or directly above/below while maintaining a high y-value. I will try to place the robot below the target, further away from the top wall and the mentioned obstacles, or directly to the left, further into the corner, but not colliding with wall 4.
