           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.26, 0.145), (-0.165, 0.24)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.29, -0.104), (-0.192, -0.007)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.138, 0.399), (-0.042, 0.494)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, 0.494), (0.177, 0.593)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.213, 0.193, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.503, 0.864).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.197, -0.411), (-0.126, -0.34)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.056, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.458, 0.889).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.09, 0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.503).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.128, 0.543, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.436, 0.9).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.162, -0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.7, 0.714).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve Goal Due to Geometric Constraints**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to place five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a single surface (v20). Initially, these objects are supported by other surfaces and are in different configurations relative to a robot with two arms. The robot's base is fixed, so the plan must be feasible from a single base configuration.
           
           Each placement must be stable, meaning each object must be entirely contained within the surface bounds of v20.  This implies I need to identify five unique, non-overlapping poses for the objects on v20. Given the robot's base constraint, I intend to place the objects directly in their positions, requiring a pick-and-place operation for each object.
           
           Initial analysis focused on potential collision-free placements. The AABB data, I'm interpreting, indicates the object's spatial extent relative to its local origin, and to determine this pose, I have to ensure the objects will be within the boundaries of v20.
           
           The problem lies in v20's limited size, a 27cm x 27cm square surface, and the objects' sizes. By determining each object's volume (bounding box) the goal seemed attainable.
           However, I discovered that no feasible combination of placements exists given the surface dimensions. All placement strategies, including grid-like layouts and linear arrangements, have failed because two remaining objects exceed the space available in either dimension. The total area of the objects is less than the v20's area. However, it's the efficient packing, or lack thereof, which causes the problem.
           Therefore, a solution where five objects are placed on surface v20 while also satisfying the stability conditions is impossible, based on the geometrical constraints of v20 and the AABB sizes for these objects.
