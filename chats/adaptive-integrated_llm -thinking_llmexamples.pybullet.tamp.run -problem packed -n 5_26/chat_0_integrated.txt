User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.26, 0.145), (-0.165, 0.24)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.29, -0.104), (-0.192, -0.007)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.138, 0.399), (-0.042, 0.494)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, 0.494), (0.177, 0.593)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.213, 0.193, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.503, 0.864).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.197, -0.411), (-0.126, -0.34)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.056, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.458, 0.889).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.09, 0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.503).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.128, 0.543, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.436, 0.9).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.162, -0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.7, 0.714).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Plan Feasibility**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto `v20`.  Looking at the initial state, all those objects are currently chilling on `v11`. The catch?  The only action I can use is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  No picking, no placing, no cleaning, no cooking, just... movement.
           
           Now, let's break down the `on` predicate. I know that `on(?o, ?r)` means both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are true.  So, for each object, I need to check if the `atpose` predicate matches the required pose on `v20`.
           
           For `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`, I see that the `supported` relation is correct, meaning the objects are capable of being placed on `v20`. However, the `atpose` predicates currently have all these objects at poses on `v11`, not on `v20`.
           
           To satisfy the goal, I'd need to move each object: pick it up from `v11`, and then place it on `v20`.  But... the only allowed action, `move_base`, doesn't let me do that!  It only deals with the base, and it doesn't change `atpose` or `on` for any object.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, this goal is *unreachable*. I simply can't manipulate the objects' positions to achieve the desired state.  It's a no-go.
