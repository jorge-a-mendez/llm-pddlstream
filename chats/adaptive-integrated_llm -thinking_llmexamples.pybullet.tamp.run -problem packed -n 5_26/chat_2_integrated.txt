           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.26, 0.145), (-0.165, 0.24)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.29, -0.104), (-0.192, -0.007)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.138, 0.399), (-0.042, 0.494)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.079, 0.494), (0.177, 0.593)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.213, 0.193, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.503, 0.864).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.197, -0.411), (-0.126, -0.34)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.241, -0.056, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.458, 0.889).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.09, 0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.864, 0.503).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.128, 0.543, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.436, 0.9).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.162, -0.375, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.7, 0.714).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My primary objective is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current locations on surface v11 to a new surface, v20. The key constraint is that they must end up "on" v20, a relationship defined by the 'supported' and 'atpose' facts in the problem definition. Since the robot hand has a handempty condition, I have to ensure the arm v4 is free to pick things up.
           
           The available information shows that I have to use arm v4 for picking and placing, and the system is initialized at base config v3. The robot has to be at configuration #o3 to do pick and place. Hence, the initial action must always be a `move_base` action to relocate to this configuration. The initial action's cost is the distance between `v3` and `#o3`, as defined by the provided `distance()` function. Each pick and place action incurs a fixed cost of 1.
           
           The robot's picking and placing will be performed using `#o3` (base config) and #o1 (grasp configuration), as shown by the provided kin facts. All pick and place require the use of these actions. The actions must adhere to the provided initial and goal states.
           
           For each object, I'll need to:
           1.  Move the base to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick up the object from its initial pose (v9, v13, v15, v17, or v19).
           3.  Place the object at the target pose, which is defined as `#o2` on surface v20.
           
           The order of these actions will be as follows: move base to `#o3`, then execute the pick and place actions on each of the objects. The total cost equals the distance between `v3` and `#o3` plus 10 (5 pick and 5 place).
           
           The continuous parameter `#o2` used in `atpose(o, #o2)` is a continuous parameter, which means I should provide a coordinate for each of the objects. Since `#o2` appears in multiple goals, it requires a different coordinate for each of the objects that is to be placed on v20. Based on the position of v20 and the requirement of distinct coordinates for `#o2`, I will place each object within the range of the surface. So, the coordinate for each of the objects that is to be placed is as follows: ((-0.1, 0.1, 0.781), (0.1, 0.1, 0.781), (-0.1, -0.1, 0.781), (0.1, -0.1, 0.781), (0.0, 0.0, 0.781)).
           
           The planned actions are:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           4.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           5.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           6.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           7.  `place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           8.  `pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           9.  `place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           10. `pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           11. `place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           This sequence should successfully fulfill the goal of placing all five objects on surface v20 while also adhering to the established rules and constraints within the given environment.

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **Addressing Stability Concerns in Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the user has flagged that some object poses aren't stable, specifically for objects on surface v20. The core issue is that the 2D AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the object needs to be fully contained within the 2D AABB of the surface.  The error message is pretty clear, and the hint is the size of the box derived from the object coordinates is 0.07x0.07.
           
           The initial provided AABBs, like `((-0.26, 0.145), (-0.165, 0.24))` for object v8, don't look like the objects' actual dimensions, but rather the bounding box of their *initial poses*. I need to focus on how the system *calculates* the object's AABB based on its pose. It seems the system calculates the AABB by taking the 0.07 dimensions and adding them to the pose coordinates of the placement.  So, if an object has dimensions 0.07 x 0.07 and the center is at (x, y), the AABB should be (x - 0.035, y - 0.035) to (x + 0.035, y + 0.035).
           
           The surface v20's AABB is  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  For stability, the object's (x, y) center must be within a range.  This range should avoid edge cases, so I'll try to keep them *strictly* inside the boundary. To make it easier and more stable I need to adjust it by 0.035 for each object and account for a margin. The new positions should be `x in (-0.1, 0.1)` and `y in (-0.1, 0.1)`. The provided placement for the previous plan was not contained due to precision issues with the floating point.
           
           I have decided to place the objects like this:
           
           *   v8: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v12: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v14: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v16: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   v18: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With a 0.07x0.07 object, these should guarantee that the AABBs are fully contained, with a little buffer room.
           
           The plan should be valid with these updated object poses for #o2.  The order of placement doesn't matter for the plan's validity. The `move_base` cost has some unknowns about the distance between v3 and #o3, but in general the actions have very small cost because the start position (v3) will be v3, with #o3 being an intermediate point.
