           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.236, 0.553, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.053, 0.999).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.198, 0.515), (0.275, 0.592)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.188, 0.202, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.933, -0.361).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.012, 0.388, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.937, -0.35).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.061, 0.339), (0.037, 0.437)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.139, 0.153), (0.238, 0.252)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v12, v8, and v14. The goal is to place all three objects on v16. Currently, v8, v12, and v14 are on v11, at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively. The robot currently has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are empty. The base is at v3. The provided action instances only contain a `move_base` action that moves the robot from v3 to v3, which means the robot cannot move its base. Since no pick or place actions are available in the provided action instances, and no actions to change the arm configuration or generate new trajectories, the robot cannot pick or place any objects. Therefore, the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 on v16 is not achievable.
