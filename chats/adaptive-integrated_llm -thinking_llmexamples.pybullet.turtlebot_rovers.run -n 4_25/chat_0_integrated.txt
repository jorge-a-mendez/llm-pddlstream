           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the "new-axiom@0()" Goal**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate objective, `new-axiom@0()`, is a big conjunction of things we need to achieve: rovers at certain configurations, stores free, images received, and analyses performed.  First off, the initial state shows the rovers are already where they need to be, and stores are free. Great. But the image and analysis parts are trickier.
           
           We need images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. We *also* need to receive analyses of a stone and soil sample.  I've got the rock types figured out.  The plan is usually: calibrate, take an image, send the image (for the objectives).  Sample a rock, send the analysis. Seems straight forward until I got to the problem of where to place the rovers for image taking and analyzing.
           
           I've got two rovers: `v12` and `v14`.  Both have a camera and are capable of communication with the lander `v9`.  The initial state says both rovers can *see* all the target objectives from their current configurations. This is where it gets interesting... The catch, though, I can only rely on the actions I'm given.
           
           To fulfill the image-related tasks, I must use calibration, imaging, and image-sending.  And for analyses, I have to sample and then send the information.  
           
           Based on the preconditions, I need the rovers to be at a specific configuration, say `#o3` for imaging, and `#o5` for sampling, to complete the actions.  If they aren't, the plan is moot.  I can *only* use an action if it's been given to me. And the only 'move' action lets the rovers stay put - so I am tied to `v13` or `v15` for these actions.
           
           This is where the problem gets problematic. Based on my calculations, from those points (`v13` and `v15`), the images of those targets can *not* be acquired given the distance constraints, even if the statement said so.
           
           Therefore, since the only move I have is for them to move from and to the *same* location, the plan is not possible since the geometry does not support the preconditions being fulfilled.
           
           **In summary, due to the lack of movement actions, the geometric constraints of the problem render the given goals unreachable. The rovers are statically placed, and must meet geometric constraints that aren't possible given these static parameters.**
