           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down from my perspective as the expert planner.** My primary objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a goal that essentially boils down to: (1) getting images of specific objectives to the lander, and (2) getting analyses of a couple of rock types to the lander as well.  The starting point is a bit of a clean slate, with both rovers in their initial configurations, their stores empty, and all the necessary cameras and communication links available.
           
           My initial thought is to make the plan efficient. I immediately see the need to divide the workload between the two rovers. Rover v12 and v14 will team up to get the job done quickly. One of them will handle imaging the objectives, and the other will focus on rock sampling and analysis. Both rovers need to image and communicate via the lander. The prompt's requirement for distinct coordinates for the rover's position will add to the complexity.
           
           Now, let's map out the strategy in detail. I'll get rover v12 to take the pictures of all the targets. Then, I will focus on coordinating rock sampling and analysis. I will get rover v14 to take care of sampling the rocks and sending their analyses to the lander. Both of these tasks are done while making sure that the coordinates of each location are specified with all the data.
           For the pictures, both rovers have a camera and the communication tools needed. As long as it is done efficiently, I should not have a problem.
           
           Rover v12 has the following plan:
           1.  Move to a good spot to take the photos. This is the imaging pose. I choose the best spot I see, where all the target objects are visible.
           2.  With each location, it must calibrate the camera.
           3.  Take the photos.
           4.  Send the images to the lander.
           5.  Move back to its starting spot, as required.
           
           For Rover v14:
           1. Move to a good spot to sample the rocks
           2. Sample the specific types.
           3. Move to the communication pose and send the analysis.
           4. Drop the rock sample
           5. Move back to initial configuration.
           
           There are certain complexities with naming. My goal is for a system of actions and configurations that will get my job done as fast as possible.
           I plan on providing explicit coordinates for locations where I need to meet all the criteria specified in my PDDL plan.

           1.  Move to a good spot to take the photos. This is the imaging pose. I choose the best spot I see, where all the target objects are visible.
           2.  With each location, it must calibrate the camera.
           3.  Take the photos.
           4.  Send the images to the lander.
           5.  Move back to its starting spot, as required.
           
           For Rover v14:
           1. Move to a good spot to sample the rocks
           2. Sample the specific types.
           3. Move to the communication pose and send the analysis.
           4. Drop the rock sample
           5. Move back to initial configuration.
           
           There are certain complexities with naming. My goal is for a system of actions and configurations that will get my job done as fast as possible.
           I plan on providing explicit coordinates for locations where I need to meet all the criteria specified in my PDDL plan.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan, based on my analysis of the problem and the constraints:**
           
           The initial plan I generated had some issues: the configurations I created for the rover `v12` were either unreachable by the base, or colliding with obstacle `v21`. I need to fix this and come up with new configurations for both `v12` and `v14`. I'll focus on the specific coordinates and AABB bounds to select locations that are both *reachable* from their starting points and *collision-free* with the obstacle, while still allowing line-of-sight to the imaging targets or the lander.
           
           For `v12`, my starting point is (1.0, -1.75). My objectives are to:
           
           *   Image targets: `v19` at (0.41, 2.025) and `v20` at (1.777, 1.791)
           *   Communicate with `v9` near (-1.9, -2.0)
           
           For `v14`, my starting point is (-1.0, -1.75). My objectives are to:
           *   Image targets: `v17` at (-0.494, 2.002) and `v18` at (-2.035, 1.91)
           *   Communicate with `v9` near (-1.9, -2.0)
           
           I will assign `v12` for imaging and sampling on the eastern side and `v14` on the western side, as I think this would lead to shorter paths. 
           
           The obstacle `v21` is a thin wall. Any X-coordinates between -0.05 and 0.05 will cause collision.
           
           Here's my refined plan with the specific *continuous* values I have come up with for the required configurations:
           
           **Rover `v12`** will:
           
           1.  Move to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19): (0.7 0.5)`  (To image `v19`)
           2.  Calibrate for target `v19`
           3.  Take image of `v19`
           4.  Move to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v20): (1.5 0.5)`  (To image `v20`)
           5.  Calibrate for target `v20`
           6.  Take image of `v20`
           7.  Move to `(#o5 v12 None v5): (1.3 -0.7)` (To sample near Rock)
           8.  Sample `v5` (rock type `v6`)
           9.  Move to `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (0.8 -2.0)` (To communicate with lander)
           10. Send image `v19`
           11. Send image `v20`
           12. Send analysis of `v5`
           13. Drop rock `v5`
           14. Return to starting point (1.0, -1.75)
           
           **Rover `v14`** will:
           
           1.  Move to `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (-0.6 0.5)` (To image `v17`)
           2.  Calibrate for target `v17`
           3.  Take image of `v17`
           4.  Move to `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (-1.7 0.5)`  (To image `v18`)
           5.  Calibrate for target `v18`
           6.  Take image of `v18`
           7.  Move to `(#o5 v14 None v3): (-0.3 0.3)` (To sample near Rock)
           8.  Sample `v3` (rock type `v2`)
           9.  Move to `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-0.8 -2.0)` (To communicate with lander)
           10. Send image `v17`
           11. Send image `v18`
           12. Send analysis of `v3`
           13. Drop rock `v3`
           14. Return to starting point (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           I've made sure that the X coordinates are outside the collision zone. The distances of each imaging configuration are within the given constraints.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Updated Strategy and Configurations for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, based on the previous feedback, I need to generate a new plan that avoids collisions and unreachable positions. The main challenge is to find appropriate configurations for each task, considering obstacles and ensuring line of sight.
           
           My starting point is the goal: `new-axiom@0()`, meaning I need to have both rovers at specific configurations, their stores free, the necessary images received, and two rocks of different types analyzed.
           
           The key adjustments involve re-evaluating the previous problematic configurations:
           
           *   **Obstacles:**  I've got to circumnavigate the wall at x=0 (`v21`) and the small object (`v22`) located around (0.73, 0.27) .
           *   **Imaging:** For Rover v12, the configuration (0.7, 0.5) to view `v19` collided with `v22`. Now, I'll aim for (0.4, 0.7) for v19 and (1.5, 1.0) for v20 for imaging targets. The range is 2 meters, so this should work. Rover v14 will use `(-0.6, 0.5)` for `v17` and `(-1.7, 0.5)` for `v18`.
           *   **Sampling:** For Rover v12,  I'll position (1.3, -0.7) and for Rover v14, I'll position `(-0.3, 0.3)`.
           *   **Communication:**  I've revised the comms setup.  Since the previous (0.8, -2.0) was not reachable, I'll try  (-0.2, -1.5) for `v12` and (-0.8, -2.0) for `v14` to communicate with the lander.  These seem to have good line of sight and be in the correct area.
           
           The overall approach of assigning tasks by proximity still makes sense. I have to make sure each move is reachable and line of sight is clear, so I've revised the continuous configurations and the path plan.
           
           I have to carefully provide values for *each* unique (rover, target) pair where I use the same PDDL symbol. I need unique coorindates for the `#o3` imaging actions, `#o5` sampling, and `#o0` communications.  Then the PDDL actions can use the specified parameters.
           
           The planned steps for the rovers are now:
           
           **Rover v12:**
           
           1.  Move to (0.4, 0.7) and image v19.
           2.  Move to (1.5, 1.0) and image v20.
           3.  Move to (1.3, -0.7) and sample v5.
           4.  Move to (-0.2, -1.5) to communicate.
           5.  Send images and analysis to the lander.
           6.  Drop the rock.
           7.  Return.
           
           **Rover v14:**
           
           1.  Move to (-0.6, 0.5) and image v17.
           2.  Move to (-1.7, 0.5) and image v18.
           3.  Move to (-0.3, 0.3) and sample v3.
           4.  Move to (-0.8, -2.0) to communicate.
           5.  Send images and analysis to the lander.
           6.  Drop the rock.
           7.  Return.
           
           This approach will meet the goals and should address previous issues with reachability and collisions. I'll make sure each move action in my generated plan explicitly directs the rover to a valid position and maintains line of sight for each task to get the correct results.

(Thoughts: **My Refinement of Rover Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I messed up the formatting of the continuous configuration values.  I need to go back and correct all the `(x, y)` coordinates, making sure they're in the correct `(<x> <y>)` format.  It looks like I either had missing parentheses, spaces instead of commas, or even included that pesky `theta` value that's not required here.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the configurations for both rovers, keeping the environment in mind, especially those obstacles: the wall at x=0 (v21) and the AABB (v22) positioned at (0.666, 0.201) to (0.804, 0.339).
           
           **Rover v12** (Starting at (1.0, -1.75)):
           
           *   **v19 (Target)** - Previously, I had `(0.4, 0.7)`. I believe this is a valid configuration for the rover base, allowing it to have a clear line of sight to v19 (at approximately (0.46, 2.07)) given the roughly 1.37 distance (which is within 2). This path avoids v21 and v22. Now it's `(0.4 0.7)`.
           *   **v20 (Target)** - The previous attempt was `(1.5, 1.0)`. Distance from base to v20 (around (1.82, 1.84)) is ~0.4, within reach. And this configuration should be clear of obstructions, too. The corrected configuration now is `(1.5 1.0)`.
           *   **v5 (Rock Target)** - I was confused about the use of `above` but it appears to be a *rover conf* (and not necessarily a camera pose). The old `(1.3, -0.7)` should be okay as it seems valid for the base sampling v5, and the point is near the rock. So now it's  `(1.3 -0.7)`.
           *   **v9 (Lander Target)** - Previously, it was `(-0.2, -1.5)`. The rover v12 should be able to communicate with v9 at approximately (-1.9, -2.0) given the 1.77 distance, as well.  That location is within the communication range and doesn't collide with obstacles. So it's fixed to `(-0.2 -1.5)`.
           
           **Rover v14** (Starting at (-1.0, -1.75)):
           
           *   **v17 (Target)** - The previous point, `(-0.6, 0.5)`, places the robot base within a suitable distance (1.55) to v17 (approximately (-0.44, 2.05)), and clear of obstacles. Now it's `(-0.6 0.5)`.
           *   **v18 (Target)** - Point `(-1.7, 0.5)` is 1.48 distance from the target (-1.98, 1.96), so it's a good candidate for the base and avoids any collision with walls. So now it's `(-1.7 0.5)`.
           *   **v3 (Rock Target)** - `(-0.3, 0.3)` is the rover conf for v3, as it allows sampling, now it's `(-0.3 0.3)`.
           *   **v9 (Lander Target)** - My location of `(-0.8, -2.0)` is close to where v14 begins (-1.0, -1.75). Distance to v9 is ~1.1; this is much within communication reach. Now it's `(-0.8 -2.0)`.
           
           Based on those corrections and re-evaluations, the configurations appear sound regarding collision avoidance, line-of-sight, and reachability. No plan changes are needed, and now I've ensured the proper formatting for the configuration values in the `--Configurations--:` section.

Model:     **My Refinement of Rover Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I messed up the formatting of the continuous configuration values.  I need to go back and correct all the `(x, y)` coordinates, making sure they're in the correct `(<x> <y>)` format.  It looks like I either had missing parentheses, spaces instead of commas, or even included that pesky `theta` value that's not required here.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the configurations for both rovers, keeping the environment in mind, especially those obstacles: the wall at x=0 (v21) and the AABB (v22) positioned at (0.666, 0.201) to (0.804, 0.339).
