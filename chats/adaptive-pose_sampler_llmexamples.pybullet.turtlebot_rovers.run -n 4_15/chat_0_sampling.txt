User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.55 and y = +/- 2.55. There's a vertical obstacle (wall) at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters around (2, 2), (-2, 2), (0.5, 2), (-0.5, 2) and some smaller ones. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are within the max_range of 2 from the target point, avoiding these obstacles and the central wall. I will prioritize diversity and positions that are likely to be clear.
           
           Positions:
           ({x_0} {y_0})
           ({x_1} {y_1})
           ({x_2} {y_2})
