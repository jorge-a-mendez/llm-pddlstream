           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin. The object is also square, with side length 0.07867585193886983. Since the object is square, its orientation does not affect its footprint on the surface, so I can use an angle of 0. I will place the object at various x and y coordinates within the bounds of the surface, ensuring it is fully contained. The surface has extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a side length of approximately 0.0787. To be fully contained, the center of the object must be at least half its side length away from the edges of the surface. So, the x and y coordinates of the center must be between -0.135 + 0.0787/2 and 0.135 - 0.0787/2, which is approximately -0.135 + 0.03935 = -0.09565 and 0.135 - 0.03935 = 0.09565. I will generate a grid of positions within these limits.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have knowledge of one previously placed object with ID 5, located at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Its dimensions are 0.07867585193886983 by 0.07867585193886983. This means it occupies the area from approximately -0.0393 to 0.0393 in both x and y on surface 0.
           
           The new object (ID 4) is also square, with side length 0.0921983898382327. Its orientation will not matter, so I'll use 0 radians. The surface (0) is the same: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           To place object 4, I need to ensure it is within the bounds of surface 0 and does not collide with object 5.
           The center of object 4 must be between -0.135 + 0.0922/2 and 0.135 - 0.0922/2, which is approximately -0.135 + 0.0461 = -0.0889 and 0.135 - 0.0461 = 0.0889.
           
           The previously placed object 5 spans from approximately x: [-0.0393, 0.0393] and y: [-0.0393, 0.0393].
           I need to find placements for object 4 such that its AABB does not overlap with object 5's AABB.
           
           This means for object 4 at (x, y) with half-side 0.0461:
           Either x + 0.0461 <= -0.0393 (x <= -0.0854) OR x - 0.0461 >= 0.0393 (x >= 0.0854)
           AND
           Either y + 0.0461 <= -0.0393 (y <= -0.0854) OR y - 0.0461 >= 0.0393 (y >= 0.0854)
           
           However, I can also place it such that its x range overlaps but its y range does not, or vice versa.
           A simpler strategy is to just avoid the center region. I will prioritize placing it near the edges of the surface, as far from the center as possible, while respecting the surface boundaries.
           
           The allowed range for the center of object 4 is approximately [-0.0889, 0.0889] for both x and y.
           The collision zone for the center of object 4, due to object 5, is approximately x: [-0.0393 - 0.0461, 0.0393 + 0.0461] = [-0.0854, 0.0854] and y: [-0.0854, 0.0854].
           This means almost all valid placement locations on the surface would collide with object 5.
           I need to find placements where the center is such that it is outside this collision zone, but still within the surface bounds.
           This means x should be around -0.0889 or 0.0889, and y should be around -0.0889 or 0.0889.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have knowledge of two previously placed objects on surface 0:
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with extents 0.07867585193886983 x 0.07867585193886983. This occupies x: [-0.0393, 0.0393] and y: [-0.0393, 0.0393].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, -0.088, -0.088) with extents 0.0921983898382327 x 0.0921983898382327. This occupies x: [-0.088 - 0.0461, -0.088 + 0.0461] = [-0.1341, -0.0419] and y: [-0.1341, -0.0419].
           
           The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with side length 0.09181328062621238. Its half-side length is approximately 0.0459. Its orientation will not matter, so I'll use 0 radians. The surface (0) is the same: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           To place object 7, I need to ensure it is within the bounds of surface 0 and does not collide with object 5 or object 4.
           The center of object 7 must be between -0.135 + 0.0459 and 0.135 - 0.0459, which is approximately -0.0891 and 0.0891 for both x and y.
           
           Collision zones for the center of object 7:
           - With object 5: x: [-0.0393 - 0.0459, 0.0393 + 0.0459] = [-0.0852, 0.0852] and y: [-0.0852, 0.0852].
           - With object 4: x: [-0.1341 - 0.0459, -0.0419 + 0.0459] = [-0.18, 0.004] and y: [-0.18, 0.004].
           Since the surface only extends to -0.135, the effective collision zone for object 4 is roughly for x and y between -0.135 and 0.004.
           
           Let's look at the available space:
           The overall valid range for the center of object 7 is x, y in [-0.0891, 0.0891].
           Collision due to object 5: x, y in [-0.0852, 0.0852]. This almost completely covers the allowed range.
           Collision due to object 4: x in [-0.0891, 0.004] and y in [-0.0891, 0.004].
           
           This is a very constrained problem. The remaining valid regions for object 7's center are where it is outside the collision zones.
           From object 5, object 7's center must have abs(x) > 0.0852 or abs(y) > 0.0852.
           From object 4, object 7's center must have x > 0.004 or y > 0.004.
           
           Considering both, the available points are very small, near the upper-right corner of the surface.
           The max x and y are 0.0891.
           So, potential placements could be (0.089, 0.089), (0.089, 0.088), etc.
           Let's try the corners that are not occupied.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have knowledge of three previously placed objects on surface 0:
           - Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with extents 0.07867585193886983 x 0.07867585193886983. This occupies x: [-0.0393, 0.0393] and y: [-0.0393, 0.0393].
           - Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, -0.088, -0.088) with extents 0.0921983898382327 x 0.0921983898382327. This occupies x: [-0.1341, -0.0419] and y: [-0.1341, -0.0419].
           - Object 7 (ID: 7) at (0, 0.0, 0.088, 0.088) with extents 0.09181328062621238 x 0.09181328062621241. This occupies x: [0.088 - 0.0459, 0.088 + 0.0459] = [0.0421, 0.1339] and y: [0.0421, 0.1339].
           
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with side length 0.07295337341198249. Its half-side length is approximately 0.0365. Its orientation will not matter, so I'll use 0 radians. The surface (0) is the same: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           To place object 6, I need to ensure it is within the bounds of surface 0 and does not collide with objects 4, 5, or 7.
           The center of object 6 must be between -0.135 + 0.0365 and 0.135 - 0.0365, which is approximately -0.0985 and 0.0985 for both x and y.
           
           Collision zones for the center of object 6 (half_side = 0.0365):
           - With object 5 (center (0,0), half_side 0.0393): x: [-0.0393 - 0.0365, 0.0393 + 0.0365] = [-0.0758, 0.0758] and y: [-0.0758, 0.0758].
           - With object 4 (center (-0.088, -0.088), half_side 0.0461): x: [-0.088 - 0.0461 - 0.0365, -0.088 + 0.0461 + 0.0365] = [-0.1706, -0.0054]. Clamping to surface bounds for center of obj 6: x: [-0.0985, -0.0054]. Similarly for y.
           - With object 7 (center (0.088, 0.088), half_side 0.0459): x: [0.088 - 0.0459 - 0.0365, 0.088 + 0.0459 + 0.0365] = [0.0056, 0.1704]. Clamping to surface bounds for center of obj 6: x: [0.0056, 0.0985]. Similarly for y.
           
           Let's look at the available space for the center of object 6, within x,y in [-0.0985, 0.0985]:
           - Avoid x in [-0.0758, 0.0758] and y in [-0.0758, 0.0758] (due to obj 5)
           - Avoid x in [-0.0985, -0.0054] and y in [-0.0985, -0.0054] (due to obj 4)
           - Avoid x in [0.0056, 0.0985] and y in [0.0056, 0.0985] (due to obj 7)
           
           This is complex. Let's visualize.
           There's a "hole" in the middle from object 5.
           There's a "hole" in the bottom-left from object 4.
           There's a "hole" in the top-right from object 7.
           
           This leaves potentially the top-left, bottom-right corners, or thin strips along the axes that avoid the central overlap.
           Top-left corner for object 6:
           x range: [-0.0985, -0.0758] (from obj 5 avoidance) AND x range: [-0.0054, 0.0985] (from obj 4 avoidance). This means x must be outside [-0.0985, -0.0054] for x < 0. So, it needs to be x in (-0.0054, -0.0758]. This is an empty range. So x must be greater than -0.0054 to avoid 4 and also less than -0.0758 to avoid 5. No values.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision zones and available regions more carefully.
           Valid range for center: x, y in [-0.0985, 0.0985].
           
           Collision due to object 5 (center (0,0)):
           Center x must be < -0.0758 or > 0.0758.
           Center y must be < -0.0758 or > 0.0758.
           
           Collision due to object 4 (center (-0.088, -0.088)):
           Center x must be outside range [-0.0985, -0.0054]. So x > -0.0054. (within overall valid range)
           Center y must be outside range [-0.0985, -0.0054]. So y > -0.0054. (within overall valid range)
           
           Collision due to object 7 (center (0.088, 0.088)):
           Center x must be outside range [0.0056, 0.0985]. So x < 0.0056. (within overall valid range)
           Center y must be outside range [0.0056, 0.0985]. So y < 0.0056. (within overall valid range)
           
           Combining all these conditions for a potential region:
           Region 1: x > 0.0758 AND y > 0.0758 (from obj 5). This is already blocked by obj 7's center collision zone: x in [0.0056, 0.0985], y in [0.0056, 0.0985]. So this region is [0.0758, 0.0985] x [0.0758, 0.0985], which completely overlaps with object 7's collision range. There are no safe points here.
           
           Region 2: x < -0.0758 AND y < -0.0758 (from obj 5). This is already blocked by obj 4's center collision zone: x in [-0.0985, -0.0054], y in [-0.0985, -0.0054]. So this region is [-0.0985, -0.0758] x [-0.0985, -0.0758], which completely overlaps with object 4's collision range. There are no safe points here.
           
           What about a "cross" shape?
           For example, along the positive x-axis, avoiding objects 4 and 5 and 7.
           To avoid 5: x > 0.0758.
           To avoid 4: x > -0.0054. (satisfied if x > 0.0758)
           To avoid 7: x < 0.0056. This conflicts with x > 0.0758. No points possible on the positive x-axis for object 6 if it avoids all three.
           
           Let's rethink. If object 6 is small enough, there might be gaps.
           Let's consider regions.
           The surface is a square from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Object 5 is in the middle: x,y in [-0.0393, 0.0393].
           Object 4 is bottom-left: x,y in [-0.1341, -0.0419].
           Object 7 is top-right: x,y in [0.0421, 0.1339].
           
           The available space for object 6, given its half-side 0.0365:
           Possible x for center: [-0.0985, 0.0985]
           Possible y for center: [-0.0985, 0.0985]
           
           Collision-free zones for center of object 6:
           - Object 5 avoidance: |x_center| > 0.0393 + 0.0365 = 0.0758 OR |y_center| > 0.0758.
           - Object 4 avoidance: x_center > -0.088 + 0.0461 + 0.0365 = -0.0054 OR y_center > -0.088 + 0.0461 + 0.0365 = -0.0054.
           - Object 7 avoidance: x_center < 0.088 - 0.0459 - 0.0365 = 0.0056 OR y_center < 0.088 - 0.0459 - 0.0365 = 0.0056.
           
           Let's try to find a point that satisfies all conditions.
           Suppose x_center is in (-0.0758, 0.0758) (violates first condition, needs to be avoided).
           Suppose x_center is in [-0.0985, -0.0054] (violates second condition, needs to be avoided).
           Suppose x_center is in [0.0056, 0.0985] (violates third condition, needs to be avoided).
           
           This means for a valid placement, one of the 'OR' conditions must be true for each object.
           Let's try to place it in the bottom-right quadrant: x > 0 and y < 0.
           Possible region for center (x_c, y_c):
           x_c in [0.0, 0.0985]
           y_c in [-0.0985, 0.0]
           
           From object 5: x_c > 0.0758 OR y_c < -0.0758.
           From object 4: x_c > -0.0054 (always true for x_c in [0, 0.0985]) OR y_c > -0.0054.
           From object 7: x_c < 0.0056 OR y_c < 0.0056 (always true for y_c in [-0.0985, 0]).
           
           So for a point in bottom-right (x_c > 0, y_c < 0):
           1. (x_c > 0.0758) OR (y_c < -0.0758)
           2. (x_c > -0.0054) is always true.
           3. (y_c < 0.0056) is always true.
           
           So we only need to satisfy condition 1: (x_c > 0.0758) OR (y_c < -0.0758).
           Let's choose x_c = 0.08 and y_c = -0.08.
           Both 0.08 > 0.0758 and -0.08 < -0.0758 are true.
           This point is valid for object 5.
           For object 4: 0.08 > -0.0054. Valid.
           For object 7: -0.08 < 0.0056. Valid.
           And it is within the overall surface bounds for object 6: 0.08 is in [-0.0985, 0.0985].
           
           So (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08) is a candidate. This is the bottom-right corner that is currently empty.
           Similarly, the top-left corner should be empty. x < 0 and y > 0.
           x_c in [-0.0985, 0.0]
           y_c in [0.0, 0.0985]
           
           From object 5: (x_c < -0.0758) OR (y_c > 0.0758).
           From object 4: (x_c > -0.0054) OR (y_c > -0.0054) (always true for y_c > 0).
           From object 7: (x_c < 0.0056) (always true for x_c < 0) OR (y_c < 0.0056).
           
           So for a point in top-left (x_c < 0, y_c > 0):
           1. (x_c < -0.0758) OR (y_c > 0.0758)
           2. (x_c > -0.0054) OR (y_c > -0.0054)
           3. (x_c < 0.0056) OR (y_c < 0.0056)
           
           Let's pick x_c = -0.08, y_c = 0.08.
           Condition 1: -0.08 < -0.0758 is true. Valid.
           Condition 2: -0.08 > -0.0054 is false. 0.08 > -0.0054 is true. So valid.
           Condition 3: -0.08 < 0.0056 is true. Valid.
           So (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08) is also a candidate.
