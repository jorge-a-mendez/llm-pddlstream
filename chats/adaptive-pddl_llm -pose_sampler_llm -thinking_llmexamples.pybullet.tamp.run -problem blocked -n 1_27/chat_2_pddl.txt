           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to find an object `?green` that's both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. I've got two candidates right off the bat, `v12` and `v8`, both confirmed as `type(..., v17)` in the initial state. Since I need `on(?green, v18)` to be true, I'll explore the path with `v12` first.
           
           The `on` axiom spells it out: I need to get `v12` supported on `v18` at some pose. Looking at the initial state, I see `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` – meaning `v12` is already designed to be supported by `v18` at a specific pose, which is `#o2`. The initial state also indicates that `v12` is currently at pose `v13`.
           
           My plan then becomes clear: move `v12` to `#o2`. To get `v12` to `#o2`, I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions, and since the base configuration changes, I will need to move the base first to the appropriate configuration.
           
           I need to pick `v12` from its current pose `v13` with the right arm configuration. This means I'll need a `move_base` action followed by a `pick` action. The preconditions for `move_base` are all present. Let's see about the `pick` action. Its preconditions look sound given what I know.
           
           Now, I'll need a `place` action to get `v12` to `#o2`. The preconditions seem valid. After the `place` action, `v12` will be at `#o2` which is supported by `v18`, thereby, creating `on(v12,v18)`. With `type(v12,v17)` already in the initial state, I should have successfully satisfied `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Essentially, my plan breaks down as follows: First, I will execute a `move_base` to get the robot into the configuration to handle the grasping actions. Next, I will `pick` `v12` from `v13`, and finally, I will `place` `v12` at `#o2`. This fulfills all conditions and gets me to the goal. It looks like a solid, actionable plan that should work based on my analysis.
