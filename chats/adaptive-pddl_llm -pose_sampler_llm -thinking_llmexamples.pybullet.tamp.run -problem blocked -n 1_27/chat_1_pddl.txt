           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've dissected. It boils down to ensuring an object, let's call it `?green`, is both `on(v18)` and `type(?, v17)`.  I've identified two potential candidates for `?green` from the initial state: `v12` and `v8`, both satisfying the `type` constraint.
           
           Now, to make either `v12` or `v8` `on(v18)`, I'd need to leverage the `supported` and `atpose` predicates. My analysis reveals that `v12` is currently `atpose(v12, v13)` and supported on something other than v18, and `v8` is similarly situated at a different location. To achieve my goal, I need to manipulate these poses.
           
           This is where the problem hits a wall. The only available action is `move_base`, which is useless for changing object positions.  The absence of `pick` and `place` actions is fatal. I've explicitly checked the available action list against my requirements, and there is no way to alter the positions of `v12` or `v8`.
           
           Given the limited set of permissible actions, moving either object to v18 is simply impossible.  Therefore, I have to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable, as there's no sequence of actions that can satisfy the `on(?, v18)` predicate with the given action set.
