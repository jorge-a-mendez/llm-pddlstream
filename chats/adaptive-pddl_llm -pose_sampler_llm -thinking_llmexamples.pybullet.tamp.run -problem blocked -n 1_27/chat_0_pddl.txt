           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.09853052439149401, 0.09853052439149468)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 10 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to identify 50 stable placements for object ID 10 (almost square, dimensions ~0.0985 x 0.0985) on surface 0 (an AABB: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))). A stable placement requires full containment within the surface boundaries and no collision with other objects.
           
           Given the object's near-square shape, its effective dimensions post-rotation won't change much. I'll utilize this property to simplify calculations. I determine the valid placement region by calculating the maximum half-dimension of the object, which I round up to the value 0.0493.
           
           Surface 0 has a width and height of 0.6. Since the object is much smaller, there's ample space for varied placements. My strategy is to create a 5x10 grid of (x, y) coordinates within the surface, constrained by the object's maximum half-dimension (4.2493 to 4.7507 for x, -0.5507 to -0.0493 for y). I then assign unique rotation angles (from 0 to 2*pi, evenly spaced) to each placement on the grid. This approach guarantees 50 distinct stable placements, considering object rotation.
