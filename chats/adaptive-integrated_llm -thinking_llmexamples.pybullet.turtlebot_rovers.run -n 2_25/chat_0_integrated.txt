           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.159, 1.754), (-2.06, 1.853)).
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.031, 1.101), (1.14, 1.21)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.08, -0.513), (-0.959, -0.393)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).

           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.994, -1.388), (2.098, -1.284)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.356, 1.728), (1.448, 1.819)).

           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Based on the provided list of allowed actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. This is because the necessary actions for achieving the sub-goals are not permitted.
           
           **Analysis of the Goal:**
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires us to:
           
           1.  Ensure certain initial conditions (`atconf`, `free`) are met, which are already true in the initial state.
           2.  Receive two images (which requires taking, calibrating, and sending images)
           3.  Receive analysis of a rock (which requires sampling and sending analysis)
           4.  Receive analysis of soil (which requires sampling and sending analysis)
           
           **Problematic Constraints:**
           
           *   **Limited Action Set:** The only permitted actions are self-looping `move` actions and `drop_rock`. This severely restricts our ability to manipulate the environment.
           *   **Missing Actions:** The crucial actions for image acquisition (`take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`) and sample analysis (`sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are *not* included in the allowed action instances.
           *   **Unachievable `drop_rock`:** The `drop_rock` action has a precondition that the rover is full of rocks which is not satisfied in the initial state, and since we cannot take rocks in, we cannot fulfill this precondition.
           
           **Conclusion:**
           
           Due to the absence of essential actions (imaging, sampling, sending data) and the inability to fill the store, the overall plan cannot be achieved. I am, therefore, unable to generate a plan.
