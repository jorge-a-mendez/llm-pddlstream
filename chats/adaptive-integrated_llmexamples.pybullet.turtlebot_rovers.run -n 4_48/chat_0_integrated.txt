           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two stores (`v16`), several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`), several objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), a lander (`v9`), a camera (`v10`), and a mode (`v11`). Both rovers are at known configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`), and they both have a free store (`v16`). The camera (`v10`) is onboard both rovers and supports the mode (`v11`). There are also several continuous parameters (`#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5`) that represent configurations, rays, or trajectories.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to a conjunction of several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           9. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's break down the goal and check the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           
           The remaining parts of the goal require taking images of objectives and sending them, and analyzing rocks and sending the analysis.
           
           For the images:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           
           Each `receivedimage` predicate requires a `send_image` action, which in turn requires a `haveimage` predicate, which requires a `take_image` action. `take_image` requires `calibrated`. So, for each objective, we need to calibrate the camera, take the image, and then send it. The lander `v9` is available for communication.
           
           For the rock analysis:
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Rocks `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2` (stone). We need to sample and send analysis for at least one of them.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Rocks `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6` (soil). We need to sample and send analysis for at least one of them.
           
           Given the limited available actions, it seems the problem is designed to test if we can identify the specific instances of actions that *are not* provided. The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           The initial state does not contain `receivedimage` for any objective, nor `receivedanalysis` for any rock. The allowed actions do not include `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. Without these actions, it is impossible to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           The allowed actions are:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This is a no-op move for rover v12.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This is a no-op move for rover v14.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This would make `free(v12, v16)` true if `full(v12, v16)` were true. It's already free.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: This would make `free(v14, v16)` true if `full(v14, v16)` were true. It's already free.
           
           None of these actions can generate the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the goal's axiom.
           
           The goal is not achievable.
