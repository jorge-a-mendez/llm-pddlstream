           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis and Conclusion**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. My objective is to achieve the goal state: all five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) are `on` object v20. The key predicate here is `on(?o, ?r)`, which depends on two conditions: `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  Essentially, I need to get each object `o` at a pose `p` that's supported on v20.
           
           The initial state provides some crucial information.  `supported(?o, #o2, v20)` is true for all five target objects, meaning they *can* be placed on v20 at pose `#o2`. The problem, however, lies in achieving the second condition: `atpose(o, #o2)`. Currently, each object has its own initial pose (v9, v13, v15, v17, v19 respectively). The *only* way to change an object's pose, as far as I can see, is through `pick` and `place` actions.  `pick` removes the existing `atpose`, and `place` sets a new `atpose`.
           
           Here's where the problem becomes clear. I'm given a very specific constraint: I *can only use* the action instance explicitly provided: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  No `pick` or `place` instances are in the allowed action list. This is a severe limitation.  Without `pick` and `place` actions, I can't manipulate the objects' poses at all.  The provided `move_base` action doesn't impact any of the predicates relevant to my goal. It merely moves the base, and base movement is irrelevant to this problem.
           
           Therefore, because I cannot pick up and place the objects given only `move_base` action, it is impossible to change the state to the goal state. Thus the goal is unreachable.
