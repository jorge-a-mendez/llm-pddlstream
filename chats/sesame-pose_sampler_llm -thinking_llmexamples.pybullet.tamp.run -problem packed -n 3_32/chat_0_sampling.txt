(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this. The primary goal is to get 50 stable and distinct placements for a square object (ID 5) on a square surface (Surface 0). Given the constraints, my focus is on ensuring the object is fully contained within the surface, and that we have adequate diversity in the placements.
           
           Since it's a square object, rotation doesn't change its bounding box dimensions, making things easier. I need to vary the object's (x, y) center location, as well as its orientation (theta, or rotation).
           
           First, I calculated the allowed ranges for x and y center coordinates, ensuring the object's entire bounding box remains within the surface. I determined that x and y can range from approximately -0.090566 to 0.090566.
           
           Next, I created a grid for these x and y values, selecting five equally spaced points within the allowed range. For added diversity, I included 8 different theta values (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, 7pi/4).
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'm taking the first 50 points from the combination of x, y coordinates and rotations.
           - 5 x-coordinate values, 8 rotations for y_coords[0] and then 2 rotations for y_coords[1]
           - This produces 50 distinct placements, with variation in x, y, and theta.
           Each placement is on Surface 0.
           
           Here are the final 50 placements as required:
           ```

(Thoughts: **My approach to placing Object 4, considering Object 5's position, boils down to a systematic process of ensuring valid positions and minimizing collisions. Here's a breakdown:**
           
           *   **Understanding the Constraints:** I've carefully calculated the allowable range for Object 4 on Surface 0, a square area. I know I have to avoid colliding with Object 5, which is already fixed in the bottom-left corner.
           *   **Collision Detection Simplified:** Since the objects are squares, collision checking is straightforward. I'm focusing on their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs), comparing their x and y ranges.
           *   **Identifying the 'Forbidden Zone':** Because of Object 5's placement, I've determined a "forbidden" region within Surface 0 where Object 4 cannot be placed without collision. This is a bottom-left square region.
           *   **Generating Safe Positions:** To avoid collisions, I'm setting up a grid to find coordinates that are:
               *   Within the boundaries of Surface 0.
               *   Outside the collision-prone area.
           *   **Diversity Through Rotations:** To increase the variety of possible placements and get 50 different placements, I'll apply multiple rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) to each valid (x, y) location.
           *   **Coordinate system for non-collision positions:** I'm splitting the surface into a coordinate system such that the bottom-left corner is not included in the collision zones. The (x, y) coordinates of the center of Object 4 that are valid are then passed to the main loop and multiplied by the rotations.
           
           In essence, I'm using geometric reasoning and a structured approach to find a diverse set of collision-free positions for Object 4.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable locations for Object 6, a square with side length ~0.0974, on Surface 0, a square area of size 0.27 x 0.27 centered at (0,0). Existing objects, Object 5 and Object 4, are in the area and must be avoided.
           
           First, I define the permissible area for Object 6's center on Surface 0: it's basically the surface's bounding box shrunk by half the object's side length, so about 0.0487. That gives me a valid center region of approximately -0.0863 to 0.0863 in both the x and y directions.
           
           I then calculate fixed Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for Object 5 and Object 4. Object 5 is in the bottom-left corner and Object 4 is in the top-right.  Based on their positions and sizes, I identify regions on the valid center area that are forbidden (overlapping Object 5 and Object 4's AABBs, considering the object size).  
           
           I see a clear 'no-go' zone in the center, and these no-go zones are separated by a narrow strip (about 0.01 width).
           The 'no-go' zone can be approximated with an L shape that has two arms.
           
           Then I break the valid center region into two areas: the top-left quadrant and bottom-right quadrant (where the 'no-go' zone is not present).
           
           I calculate x, y coordinates to create two 3x3 grids (9 points for each of the areas) with values which will be stable placements for the object.
           I will generate 18 placements in total (with no more than 3 sampling points for each dimension).
           
           Finally, I decide to use 3 rotations: 0, 90, and 180 degrees.  This should provide the desired diversity for this square object.
           Then, I'll combine the 18 center points with the 3 rotations for a total of 54 placements, more than the 50 desired.  These 54 placements will be returned, taking care that the placement points are uniformly distributed.
