(Thoughts: **Understanding Stable Object Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable and distinct placements for an object (ID 5, square with side 0.08256343983875603) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27, centered at (0,0)).  A "stable" placement means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), even when rotated, remains fully within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object is a square, its bounding box when rotated has a predictable behavior. The smallest bounding box occurs at rotations of 0 and 90 degrees (or multiples of), and the largest bounding box occurs at 45 degrees (and multiples thereof). To calculate the "effective" radius (half the side of the bounding box), I need to use `0.5 * side_length * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Given the size of my object (0.08256343983875603) and the surface (0.27), I can be sure that a full range of rotations are fine.  I'll start with 0 and see if things get complicated. The object's AABB is always smaller than the surface, even in the "worst-case" rotation. The range of my object's center coordinates (x, y) must always be within the surface dimensions minus the "effective radius". 
           
           I'll strategically place the object in the surface by carefully varying the rotation angle and the position. I will use five rotation angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, and pi. I need to generate 10 placements per angle for a total of 50. I will generate ten distinct x and y positions for each angle for 50 total. This ensures a broad spread of placements and should give a variety of stable configurations, since all sizes are within bounds.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with a spatial problem involving the placement of rectangular objects on a surface, specifically Surface 0. There's already an object, Object ID 5, placed at `(-0.0937, -0.0937)` with a side of approximately 0.08256.  Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) spans from `-0.135` to `-0.0524` in both x and y.
           
           Now, I'm given another object, Object ID 4. This one is also square-like, but has dimensions slightly different than Object ID 5 (0.0826 x 0.0826). The goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0, ensuring that there are no overlaps with Object ID 5. This is tricky because the object can be rotated, and I need to consider all angles.
           
           First, I need to define the 'effective' AABB of Object ID 4, depending on the rotation angle. If I treat it as a square, that makes the math easier. This depends on `theta` (the angle). For `theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2`, the AABB is just the original dimensions. For others, `pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, 7pi/4`, it increases.
           
           The key is to use the AABB representation.  I've simplified my collision detection by finding the valid center points for Object ID 4:
           
           1.  **Define the Surface Boundaries:** Surface 0 has bounds `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           2.  **Define Object ID 5's AABB:** Spans from `-0.135` to `-0.0524` on both the x and y axes.
           3.  **Define s_eff_half:**  This represents how much the bounding box shrinks or increases depending on the rotated position
           4.  **Find "Safe Space":** I use the AABB for each object and the surface bounds to define a non-overlapping region.
           5.  **Placement Strategies:** I start by testing each of the 5 angles and creating a uniformly spread grid.  Then, I reject placements that collide.
           6.  **Collision Condition:** To avoid collision, I need the conditions:
               *   `(x_c - s_eff_half >= x_max_5) OR (y_c - s_eff_half >= y_max_5)`
           
           This should provide me 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with placing 50 instances of a new object (ID 6) onto Surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with the existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4) already there. Surface 0 is a 0.27m x 0.27m square.
           
           First, I precisely determine the occupied space. Object ID 5, a near square, sits near the lower-left corner, and Object ID 4 is positioned immediately adjacent to it, forming a combined rectangular block along the surface's bottom edge. By calculating their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs), I determine their exact x and y ranges.
           
           The occupied region is thus: `[-0.135, 0.03020] x [-0.135, -0.05236]`.
           
           Knowing the occupied space, I can now identify the free regions where ID 6 can be placed.  Essentially, there are two viable areas: one above the existing block and a narrow strip to its right. However, the right strip proves too narrow for ID 6, regardless of its rotation.  Therefore, I'll focus exclusively on the space above the combined block.
           
           ID 6 has dimensions of approximately 0.095 x 0.095. With varying degrees of rotation, the effective bounding box changes.  At 0 and pi/2 radians rotation, the bounding box sides are 0.095m, and at pi/4 and 3*pi/4 radians rotation, the width/height are 0.135 m.  I'll then derive the appropriate half-extents for each case.  These half-extents are crucial for determining the valid center point ranges for ID 6 to avoid collisions.
           
           For placement, I am planning to try five orientations (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi) to find 50 valid placements. This will require calculating new center coordinates using the free AABB and the bounding box for each rotation.
           
           Since the available y-range is smaller, I'll divide the x-range into 5 points and the y-range into 2 points to generate the required placements.
           I'll iterate through each orientation and generate the center coordinates based on the available space, the object size, and the required half-extents.
           For example, if I wanted to find the center coordinates (x_c and y_c) for `theta = 0`, I would calculate it as such:
           `x_c_range = [-0.08731986729654484, 0.08731986729654484]`
           `y_c_range = [-0.004680404365874435, 0.08731986729654483]`
           And so on.
