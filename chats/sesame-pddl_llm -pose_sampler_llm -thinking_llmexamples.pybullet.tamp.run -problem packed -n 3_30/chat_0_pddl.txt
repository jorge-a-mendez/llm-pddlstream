(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions 0.0952 x 0.0952) on a square surface (`0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). A stable placement means the object is entirely within the surface. The key is understanding how rotating the square affects its bounding box's dimensions.
           
           Since the object is square, its bounding box width and height remain the same when aligned with the axes (theta = 0, pi/2, etc.). However, when rotated, the bounding box dimensions change. The maximum bounding box diagonal, and therefore AABB side length, occurs at a 45-degree angle (pi/4), while the minimum occurs at 0 (and multiples of pi/2).
           
           To guarantee stability, I need to consider the worst-case scenario: the object rotated at the angle causing the largest bounding box. This occurs when it is rotated at an angle of pi/4, making `half_w_rotated = half_h_rotated` = `0.06733`. The half-width of the surface is `0.135`. With the object fully rotated, the object is still able to fit inside the surface bounds.
           
           The object is centered in the surface so it can be stable in any orientation. Now I have a range for x and y of `[-0.06767, 0.06767]`.
           
           To find 50 placements, I will vary the angle of rotation (theta) and the position (x, y).
           
           **My Strategy**
           
           1.  I'll pick a couple of theta angles. The values 0 and pi/8 will provide enough diversity because the square has 4-fold rotational symmetry.
           2.  For each theta, I'll calculate the valid x and y range, considering the rotated object's bounding box dimensions. The valid area changes because the bounding box size depends on the angle.
           3.  I'll create a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this valid area. This ensures I get a diverse set of placements within the constraints.
           4.  Since I want 50 placements, I'll use 5 positions at each of the two different angles, giving me the required number.
           
           This approach ensures the object is stable, entirely within the surface bounds, and in a diverse set of positions and rotations.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 5 on Surface 0: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. I've got a new object, ID 5, that needs a home on the same surface (Surface 0) where object 6 is already successfully placed.  Object 5 is pretty much a square (size_x ≈ size_y), so I'll simplify and use a single "size" value (s) to approximate its extent.  I also know object 6's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) and that it's sitting snugly in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           My primary task is to find 50 stable placements for Object 5 that don't collide with Object 6.  I'll start with a simple strategy: try a few rotations and find the placement center points (x, y).
           
           I've calculated the size, AABB, and possible placement constraints for Object 5. I’ll make a denser grid. I’m starting with two rotations: 0 and pi/8 radians. I'll test each point to avoid collision.
           
           Object 6's AABB is the key obstacle. I need to ensure Object 5’s AABB doesn't overlap with it. I have the collision check function to make sure each placement is safe and contained within the surface’s boundaries.
           
           Initially, I tried placing Object 5's center anywhere within the valid range. Collision with Object 6 is prevented by either `xc` being far enough to the right, or `yc` being high enough. I did some basic grid generation and filtering to establish the valid points (x, y).
           
           I’ll make 8x8 grid of candidate points for theta=0 and another 5x5 grid for pi/8, then eliminate overlaps. 
           
           With detailed checks, the logic works. I’ll implement this, and then take the first 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0 (ID 4)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, ensuring no collisions with existing objects (ID 6 and ID 5). Surface 0 is defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've analyzed the already placed objects and determined that Object 6 is positioned in the bottom-left corner and Object 5 is adjacent, placed to the right and above Object 6.  Object 4's size is `0.082909`.
           
           To avoid collisions and stay within surface boundaries, I will generate placements considering two rotation angles: 0 radians and pi/4 radians.
           
           **For `theta = 0.0`:**
           
           I calculated that, after rotation and consideration of overlap, `x_start_0 = 0.0028768` and `y_start_0 = -0.0935454`.  The valid x-range is `[0.0028768, 0.0935454]` and y-range is `[-0.0935454, 0.0935454]`.
           I will generate a 5x5 grid of placements within the safe region on the top right area by ensuring that object 4 is placed such that its x coordinate is greater than a minimum value, avoiding overlap.  A grid is chosen.
           
           **For `theta = pi / 4` (0.785 radians):**
           
           Similarly, I calculated safe x and y ranges. After the correct rotation and overlap calculations, I determined `x_start_pi4 = 0.0200293` and the safe valid ranges: [0.0200293, 0.07639285] and [-0.0763928, 0.0763928]. Then, I generated another 5x5 grid.
           
           This should give me the required 50 stable, collision-free placements. The key is in determining the overlap region and shifting the placement, while accounting for the dimensions of each object, the two angles, and avoiding collisions.
