(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, dimensions: ~0.097 x ~0.097) on a given surface (surface 0, defined as a square: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`).  The core of this is finding valid `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples. Since we're only dealing with one surface, `surf_idx` will always be 0.  I have to determine 50 `(theta, x, y)` combinations that ensure the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, some geometric considerations. The object is effectively a square (its dimensions are almost identical), and to simplify, let's treat the rotation as about a Z-axis perpendicular to the surface. Axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) make the calculations more manageable. With `theta = 0`, the object's width and height are directly its given dimensions, defining the AABB. Rotating by `pi/2` swaps width and height, but in this near-square case, that's not significant. Other angles require re-evaluating the object's projected width and height.
           
           I need to calculate the valid `(x, y)` ranges for different `theta` values. With `theta = 0`, the effective width and height are the object's dimensions directly. To ensure the object remains within the surface, I need to constrain `x` and `y` such that the object's AABB remains within the surface boundaries. Specifically, if `(lower_x, lower_y, upper_x, upper_y)` are the bounds of the surface, then the object's center `(x, y)`'s range for placement is calculated by considering the object's dimensions subtracted from or added to the bounds. For an object of dimensions `size_x, size_y`, the range for `x` is `[lower_x + size_x/2, upper_x - size_x/2]` and the range for `y` is `[lower_y + size_y/2, upper_y - size_y/2]`.
           
           Let's calculate the valid range for `x` and `y` with `theta = 0`. With a bit of math, for this surface, and the object's size of approximately `0.097`, the valid range for x and y becomes `[-0.086398807243588775, 0.086398807243588775]`. For a different rotation angle, this will change.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll use a mix of different rotations `theta` and different positions `(x,y)`.  For diversity, I'll pick two `theta` values: `0` and `pi/4`. The surface area is pretty small relative to the object's size and the amount of placements requested, so grid spacing is important.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I'll generate a 5x5 grid of `(x, y)` coordinates within the calculated range of `[-0.086398807243588775, 0.086398807243588775]`. This will give me 25 placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, it's more complicated. The object's AABB's dimensions are increased. Now, the valid range becomes smaller. After calculating the new effective size, the new ranges are approximately `[-0.06626673, 0.06626673]` for x and y, and I'll generate another 5x5 grid of 25 placements here as well. The two grids are completely non-overlapping and together make a set of 50 different positions.
           
           In total, I'll use 50 placements made up of 25 positions each at `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, while avoiding collision with object ID 6, which is already present. I have the dimensions of both objects, the surface bounds, and the current placement of object 6. The key challenge is to efficiently generate placement candidates, perform collision checks, and ensure I end up with the right number of stable positions.
           
           I know that the input `0, 0.0, -0.086398807243588775, -0.086398807243588745` was successful for ID: 6. I am now looking to place ID: 4. The feedback confirmed ID 6's placement.
           
           **Object 6 Analysis**
           
           First, I'm analyzing the current configuration, specifically the position and dimensions of object 6.  Object 6's placement seems straightforward as its rotation angle is 0, so I can use its extents directly to construct its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB). This gives me the precise region object 6 occupies on surface 0.
           
           **Object 4 Placement Generation**
           
           Next, I have to figure out where to place object 4, a nearly square object. I will consider two orientations: `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` to get some diversity in the results. I will use a simple grid to generate potential placement locations and test each point for collision. I will check that the coordinate is in the valid surface bounds.
           
           **Collision Detection and AABB Overlap**
           
           The critical step here is collision detection.  I will use an AABB overlap test. If any proposed placement of Object 4 has an AABB that *intersects* Object 6's AABB, then it's a collision, and I can discard that placement. This check is fast and efficient.
           
           I determine that if the X max of Object 4 is less than the x-min, OR Y max of Object 4 is less than the y min for Object 6, then Object 4 does not collide. I must filter for non collision by ensuring the opposite.
           
           **Iterative Refinement and Grid Generation**
           
           Using the AABB approach, I'll set up a grid of possible positions for object 4 within the surface bounds.  For each grid point, I check for collision with object 6. I use math to generate a number of grid points in the valid range.
           
           By calculating and using valid ranges, I should be able to make quick placements. I consider rotating by `pi/2` and `pi`.
           
           **Resulting Placement Generation**
           
           I compute the grid coordinates and test the collision and record the valid coordinates. I have a script that computes these.
           
           My calculations yield 16 valid placements per angle (0 and pi/4), and I plan to select from the 64.
           Then, I double check my logic.
           I use AABB and the given x and y bounds to check my collision logic.
           I will apply AABB test for all 4 angles and take 50 good placements.
           I can generate all the grid coordinates.
           I will now generate and select the placements.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Placing Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           I've been tasked with placing object ID 7 on surface 0, and my primary concern is avoiding collisions with the two objects already present: ID 6 and ID 4.  To ensure proper placement, I need to thoroughly consider their bounding boxes.  Object 7 is a square, so its size is constant regardless of rotation.  I need to check for collision with the previous two object’s bounding boxes, regardless of the angle, and then I can start placing objects.
           
           Firstly, I calculate the occupied area by the two already-placed objects to determine the available space.  Object 6 occupies a region in the bottom-left corner and Object 4 is in the bottom-middle-right. I have to find placements without collisions with previous placements and surface edges, so that Object 7 doesn't overlap those areas or the edge of Surface 0.
           
           Now, I'll generate a grid of potential placement positions for object 7. I'll test 4 different rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4).  For each rotation, I'll divide the available surface into a grid (using 7 steps on each side to make a 7x7 grid).  I'll check for collision in the X and Y dimensions.
           
           My approach is systematic:
           1.  Calculate the effective size (AABB) of object 7 for the current rotation.
           2.  Based on the current rotation, compute the grid space.
           3.  Then I start iterating through the grid and verify each position to make sure it's valid.
           4.  If the AABB for a potential placement collides with either object 6 or object 4, the placement is discarded.
           5.  If it fits on the surface and doesn't overlap either pre-placed object, I add it to a list.
           6.  To obtain 50 valid placements, I will calculate the range to cover the available surface.
           
           This method guarantees that all the placements will be non-colliding and valid on surface 0.
