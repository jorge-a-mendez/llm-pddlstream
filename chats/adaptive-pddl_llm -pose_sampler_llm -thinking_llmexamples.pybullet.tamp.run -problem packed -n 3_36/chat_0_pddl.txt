(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to identify 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions: 0.08036785144804504 x 0.08036785144804504) on a square surface (Surface 0, corners: (-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The object must be fully contained within the surface to be considered stable.
           
           Since the object is a square, its effective dimensions for containment purposes change with rotation. The key is to determine the maximum effective half-width/height of the object when rotated, which occurs at a 45-degree angle.  To ensure containment, the center of the object can move within a specific range, constrained by the effective dimensions of the rotated square.
           
           My strategy involves generating a diverse set of placements by varying the rotation angle and position. I selected 10 evenly spaced angles, from 0 to π (inclusive). Then, for each rotation, I calculated the effective half-dimension and the resulting boundaries for the center coordinates (x and y).  Within these boundaries, I chose a set of positions to cover the space effectively.  The set of x,y positions will provide variety.  This strategy will guarantee that all placements are stable and distinct.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 5 at (0, 0, 0) in the scene, which is great. Now, my task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while ensuring it doesn't collide with object 5.
           
           Object 6 has a side length of approximately 0.0918. Surface 0 is a square region centered at (0,0) and extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. A crucial constraint is to avoid collision with object 5, which is placed at (0,0) with a side length of approximately 0.0804.
           
           I need to account for rotation (theta) when placing object 6, which affects its effective half-dimension (effective_half_dim_6). This value changes depending on rotation. It ranges from a minimum of approximately 0.0459 to a maximum of approximately 0.0649. Since both dimensions of the surface are 0.27, I *know* it can fit.
           
           I've determined that the maximum and minimum coordinates of object 5 are within the bounds, so collision avoidance requires object 6's AABB not to overlap. For containment on the surface, object 6's center must be within the bounds of  [-0.135 + effective_half_dim_6, 0.135 - effective_half_dim_6]  in both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 6 cannot be within the bounds of object 5 AABB. I've set up formulas for that!
           
           The key is to place object 6 such that its center is sufficiently far from object 5's center. I've been running through the math to calculate how far from the origin I need to place object 6 based on its effective half-dimension. The goal here is to place object 6 near the edges of surface 0 to ensure it is not overlapping with object 5.
           
           For the rotations, I initially went through a calculation to determine which angles of rotation would allow object 6 to be far away enough. For square objects, I saw that rotations around 0, pi/2, and pi, are the most forgiving for fitting object 6 on the surface.
           
           I've calculated that for values of rotation close to 0, pi/2, and pi, I will be able to have valid placements. So I created a list with 7 possible rotation values close to those angles. For each of those, I generated 8 positions, yielding 56 candidates, of which I will pick the first 50. I believe I am able to meet the requirements of the task.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object 4: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Alright, I've got to place this new object (Object 4) without it bumping into Objects 5 and 6, which are already fixed in place. The surface is a square, and I've got to make sure Object 4 stays within it.  My main strategy is to figure out the best place for the *center* of Object 4, so it doesn't collide, knowing the dimensions of the object and also the *rotation* I can apply.
           
           I know Object 5 is a small square in the middle, and Object 6 is a bit to the right of it. So, I figured the only way to avoid the crash is to place Object 4 to the left of both objects, I already have a few candidates. I will only consider very minor angles close to 0, pi/2, and pi, to have a smaller width.
           
           I know I can't put Object 4 *above* or *below* these two objects because of their Y values. So that's out.  That means the key is placing it to the left. I've crunched some numbers about how far left it has to be, depending on its rotation.  It's crucial that I get the `h_4` value right and the object is close to the valid angle range.
           
           In this region, the only available `y` values would be `0, +0.02, -0.02, 0.04, -0.04, 0.06, -0.06, 0.08, -0.08`.
           
           After all this, I've got a decent plan: I'll stick to a few carefully chosen angles (near 0, pi/2, pi), and then test a bunch of different center positions within those Y values. This way, I should be able to get Object 4 placed without any conflicts.
