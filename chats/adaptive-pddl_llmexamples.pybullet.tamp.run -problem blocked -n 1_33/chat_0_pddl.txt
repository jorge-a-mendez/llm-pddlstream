User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, including `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` which are graspable and stackable. `v4` and `v6` are arms, both currently empty. `v3` represents the base configuration. Objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are currently at specific poses on various supports. The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies that `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` must be true for some object `?green`.
           
           From the initial state, we know that `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So, `?green` could be `v8` or `v12`.
           We also have `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`.
           The goal `on(?green, v18)` can be satisfied if `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` are true.
           From the initial state, we have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           However, there are no actions to move `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which just moves the base from its current configuration to the same configuration, essentially doing nothing to change the state of objects or their poses.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the given actions.
           
           It seems I made a mistake in the previous analysis and overlooked some facts. Let me re-evaluate.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           From the initial state:
           - `type(v8, v17)`
           - `type(v12, v17)`
           
           So, `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`.
           
           Let's check if `on(v8, v18)` can be satisfied:
           `on(v8, v18)` requires `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           From the initial state:
           - `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`
           - `pose(v8, #o2)` is given, and a potential pose for `v8` on `v18`.
           - However, `atpose(v8, #o2)` is *not* given in the initial state. The given `atpose` for `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           - `supported(v8, v9, v11)` is also given, meaning `v8` is currently supported by `v11` at `v9`.
           
           Let's check if `on(v12, v18)` can be satisfied:
           `on(v12, v18)` requires `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.
           From the initial state:
           - `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`
           - `pose(v12, #o2)` is given, and a potential pose for `v12` on `v18`.
           - `atpose(v12, #o2)` is *not* given. The given `atpose` for `v12` is `atpose(v12, v13)`.
           - `supported(v12, v13, v14)` is also given, meaning `v12` is currently supported by `v14` at `v13`.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the pose of any object. It only moves the base from `v3` to `v3`. Therefore, it cannot change the `atpose` of `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           Since there are no pick or place actions available in the provided list, and no other actions that can change the `atpose` predicate, it's impossible to achieve the `on(?o, v18)` condition.
           
           Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unachievable.
