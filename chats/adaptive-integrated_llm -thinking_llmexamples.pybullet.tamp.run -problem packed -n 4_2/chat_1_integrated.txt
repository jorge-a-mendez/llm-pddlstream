User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, 0.358), (-0.193, 0.453)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.201, -0.226), (0.278, -0.149)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.183, -0.587), (-0.09, -0.493)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.116, 0.463), (0.193, 0.541)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.24, 0.406, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.969, 0.248).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.239, -0.188, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.051).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.136, -0.54, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.847, 0.532).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.154, 0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.745, 0.667).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this plan:**
           
           My primary goal is to move four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, onto the surface `v18`.  `v18` is a likely surface (AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))).  Each object needs to be "on" `v18`, meaning it must be supported by the surface. This translates to each object needing to be at a specific pose supported by `v18`.
           
           Currently, all the objects are stacked on `v11`.  The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently empty. The base is configured as `v3`.
           
           The core actions I can use are `pick` and `place`. `pick` requires an empty hand, the object's current pose, and the ability to reach the pose with the correct arm and grasp.  `place` also requires a grasp, the destination pose, and the arm's reachability. There is also a trivial `move_base` action that moves the base to the same position, which adds 0 cost and will be applied at start.
           
           The key challenge is the placement poses. The instructions state that if multiple objects are placed at the same pose (which is initially referenced as '#o2' for all objects), I *must* use distinct poses. However, the available `kin` predicates *only* reference the symbolic pose `#o2` for placement. This means the symbolic pose '#o2' is meant to be the general, symbolic target pose and I need to come up with four different pose values to be assigned to '#o2'.
           
           I plan on picking `v4` to perform all the actions since it is initially `handempty`. My plan will be as follows:
           1. `move_base v3 v3 #o0` to set `canmove()` to false.
           For each object:
              1. `pick`: pick object from its current position on `v11` using arm `v4`.
              2. `place`: place the object on `v18` at a custom pose I've calculated (that corresponds to '#o2'), using arm `v4`.
           
           The placement poses are:
           -   `v8`:  (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v12`: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v14`: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v16`: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           I believe these poses are collision-free and on the surface. These coordinates ensure the objects fit within the bounds of `v18` and don't overlap. Since the provided `kin` predicates use the base configuration `v3` for all pick/place actions, the robot does not move its base during this task, only its arm.
           
           Assuming all `kin` predicates, `atpose` and `grasp` conditions are met, and I have addressed all preconditions and effects, the plan should work, and the total cost would be 8.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impasse of the Problem**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan using `pick` and `place` is out – those actions aren't on the approved list. Looking at the constraints, the *only* action I have is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This simply moves the robot's base around; it's a navigational maneuver, really.  It doesn't interact with the objects at all, and doesn't change their state!
           
           The goal is to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – *on* `v18`.  But the initial state shows that they are currently *not* on `v18`. They're supported and at specific poses, which means they're on another support. To get them where they need to be, I'd have to move them.
           
           The problem is, the way this PDDL domain is defined, the *only* way to move objects is through `pick` and `place`. And since those actions are explicitly *forbidden*, it seems logically impossible to achieve the desired goal with the tools I've been given.  The constraints are fundamentally at odds with the goal's requirements.  It's an unreachable state given the current action set.
