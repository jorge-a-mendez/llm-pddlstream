User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.288, 0.358), (-0.193, 0.453)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.201, -0.226), (0.278, -0.149)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.183, -0.587), (-0.09, -0.493)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.116, 0.463), (0.193, 0.541)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.24, 0.406, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.969, 0.248).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.239, -0.188, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.051).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.136, -0.54, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.847, 0.532).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.154, 0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.745, 0.667).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Impossibility of Object Manipulation**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to devise a plan to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto object `v18`. This screams "pick up and place" to me – I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions.  The robot's base can move but only stays at its initial position. That's a constraint, but it should still be solvable.
           
           Let's dissect the initial state. Those four objects are currently all sitting on `v11`.  The given `atpose` facts directly translate into `on` relationships because of the supporting relationships (i.e. if `v12` is at `v13` and `v12` is supported at `v13` on `v11`, then `v12` is on `v11`).
           
           The goal is to get all those objects onto `v18`.  Easy enough, right?  Pick, move, place, repeat.  The robot has two arms, both initially empty.
           
           However, here's where things get tricky.  I need a series of `pick` and `place` actions.  The preconditions for each of these actions are quite specific, needing kinematic trajectories and collision-free conditions. But the rub is the very limited allowed actions: the only action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move base action is essentially a no-op: it won't change anything, the robot base just stays put. And crucially, there are *no*  `pick` or `place` action instances available.
           
           This presents a fundamental problem. Since I'm strictly limited to using only the provided actions, and since the only action doesn't actually affect the state of the objects, I'm completely stymied. To achieve the `on(vX, v18)` goal, I'd need to pick each object and place it on `v18`, and that's just not possible with the provided actions.
           
           Let's quickly double-check - is there some implicit way to make this work? There are axioms connecting `supported`, `atpose`, and `on`. While the initial state does include that `supported` relationship for the target objects, it's not enough. The `atpose` predicate still needs to change for the goal to be satisfied. And as I've already realized, I can't modify `atpose` because I can't execute any `place` actions.
           
           So, after careful consideration of the scene, available actions, and preconditions, I have to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* within the given constraints. The robot can't move any objects because the only available action is a do-nothing.  We're stuck.
