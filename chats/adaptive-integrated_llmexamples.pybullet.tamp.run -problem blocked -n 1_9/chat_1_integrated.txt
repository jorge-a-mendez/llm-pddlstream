User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.557, -0.12), (-4.463, -0.026)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.51, -0.073, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.234, 0.972).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom indicating that `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. In the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`, so 'green' must refer to either `v8` or `v12`. The goal is `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`. The predicate `on(object, region)` is an axiom for `supported(object, pose, region)` and `atpose(object, pose)`.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`.
           - `v12` is `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`.
           - `v15` is `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)`.
           - `v18` is a region represented by AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v11` is AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`. `v14` is AABB `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`.
           
           We need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. Let's choose `v8`.
           `v8` is currently on `v11`. We need to move it to `v18`.
           We have `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, indicating a possible placement for `v8` on `v18`.
           The robot arm `v4` is `handempty(v4)`. `v4` can grasp `v8`.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`.
           2. Place `v8` at `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.
           
           Let's check the preconditions for these actions.
           For `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`:
           - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is in the initial state.
           - `atpose(v8, v9)` is in the initial state.
           - `handempty(v4)` is in the initial state.
           - `atbconf(#o3)` needs to be true. `bconf(#o3)` is in the initial state, but `atbconf(#o3)` is not. However, we have `atbconf(v3)`, and the only motion action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which doesn't change `atbconf`. This suggests that `v3` and `#o3` are probably the same (the base doesn't move), or we need to find a motion to `#o3`. Given `kin` uses `#o3`, it means that `#o3` is the base configuration at which this specific `kin` is achievable. So we should consider `#o3` to be `v3`.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, v9, #o1)`: We need `~test-cfree-approach-pose-negative(v8, v9, #o1, o2, p2)` for all other objects. `v15` is at `v16`. `v12` is at `v13`. These positions are far from `v8`'s position `(4.5, 0.3, 0.8)`. `v16` is `(4.35, 0.3, 0.8)` which is close, but we assume the computed continuous parameters for grasp `#o1` would be collision-free.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: We assume the trajectory `#o4` is collision-free.
           
           For `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`:
           - `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is in the initial state.
           - `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` will be true after the pick action.
           - `atbconf(#o3)` (assuming `#o3` is `v3`).
           - `NegatedAtom unsafepose(v8, #o2)`: We need to ensure that `#o2` for `v8` on `v18` is collision-free with other objects. Since `v18` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, and `v15` is on `v11` which partially overlaps `v18`, we need to find a `#o2` that is collision-free for `v8`. `v15` is at `v16` which is `(4.35, 0.3, 0.8)`. The AABB for `v15` is `((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335))`. `v18` is from `y = -0.6` to `y = 0.0`. So `v15` is not on `v18`. So `v8` can be placed on `v18`.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v8, #o2, #o1)`: Same assumption as pick.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)`: Same assumption as pick.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by `on(v8, v18)`.
           We need to provide a continuous value for `#o2` for `v8` on `v18`. `v18` has AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v8` has AABB `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))`. This bounding box for `v8` cannot be placed on `v18` as the y-range of `v8` is outside of `v18`. However, `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, implying that there exists such a valid pose. The AABB for v8 is given for its initial pose v9. The AABB of objects is usually relative to their origin. Assuming `v8` is a small object, let's place it in the center of `v18` at a z-height of 0.8. Let's use `v8`'s original x-coordinate `4.5` but adjust its y-coordinate to be inside `v18`. Let's pick a y of -0.3 and a z of 0.8.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any object or the robot's grasp. The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `on(?green, v18)`. This means an object needs to be placed on `v18`. Neither `pick` nor `place` actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given available actions.
