           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Object Stacking**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core challenge is to arrange four objects—`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`—on top of object `v18`. I know from the provided axioms that achieving `on(?o, v18)` means ensuring both `atpose(?o, ?p)` and `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` are true for each object.
           
           Currently, these objects are resting on `v11` at various poses. They also all have another supporting pose `#o2` supported by `v18`. From what I can see, I can use a straightforward strategy to achieve the goal state.
           
           Since all the objects already have supported poses on `v18` at pose `#o2`, I'll need to use the robot's arm to manipulate them.
           
           My plan then is to pick each object up from its initial location and place it on top of object `v18` at the target pose `#o2`. The robot has one arm that can pick up objects.
           
           The overall plan structure will involve the following:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I'll begin by moving the robot's base to a strategic location, base conf `#o3` (Since all Pick and Place Actions require `atbconf(#o3)`) to allow access to the objects. This is critical for the `pick` and `place` actions that I'll need.
           
           2.  **Pick:** For each object, I'll use the robot's arm to pick it up from its current pose, supported by `v11`.
           
           3.  **Place:** Then, I'll place each object at its designated target pose at `#o2` over `v18`, ensuring that the `on` predicate is satisfied.
           
           I've ensured to use `move_base` at the start to achieve the correct base configuration and then will `pick` each object one at a time and `place` them where they need to go, with the robot arm. I don't see any need to return the base to its original configuration, as my goal is only object positioning.
           
           Crucially, I'm making a key assumption here: The `unsafe*` predicates are false. The initial state doesn't give any evidence to the contrary. So, that means my pick and place actions, including the trajectories and placements, are all safe.
           
           Based on the information, this sequence of actions should correctly solve the problem by satisfying the goal conditions.
