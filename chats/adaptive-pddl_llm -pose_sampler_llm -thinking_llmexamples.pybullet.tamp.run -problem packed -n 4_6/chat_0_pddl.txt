(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 5 on surface 0. This object is essentially square, with sides of roughly 0.0989 units. Surface 0 is a square centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27, extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  For a placement to be stable, the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must fit entirely within the surface's AABB.
           
           Since the object is almost square, I'll consider two primary orientations: 0 radians (or multiples of pi/2) and pi/4 radians.  For 0 radians, the object's dimensions are simply its side length.  I calculated the valid x and y center ranges to ensure full containment. With the object centered, the calculations indicate for x and y ranges approximately -0.0855 to 0.0855. A 5x5 grid with evenly spaced coordinates will generate 25 placements at 0 radians.
           
           At pi/4 radians, the object's effective AABB is slightly larger, as the corners sweep out a larger area during rotation. I accurately calculated the bounds of the rotated object, which showed a further restriction on x and y centers. I calculated an effective width of about 0.139855 units. With the object centered, that gives us the range approximately -0.06507 to 0.06507 for x and y. Another 5x5 grid here also gives another 25 placements which generates the required 50 total.
           
           So, I'm using two grid-based placement strategies and two orientations to generate a set of placements. I checked my calculations regarding the AABB sizes and bounding calculations for both 0-radian orientation and pi/4-radian orientation.  Because the surface and object's shapes are well-defined, there's a neat geometrical solution here. There were no other constraints specified, so I'm simply ensuring complete containment and a uniform distribution. The calculation makes perfect sense. These grid strategies guarantee stable containment, meeting the given requirements and fulfilling the request. Since this is the first object, I'm confident in the approach.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe and Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break down this placement puzzle. I've successfully placed Object 5, but now Object 4 needs a secure home on Surface 0, avoiding any contact with Object 5.
           
           First, I need to understand Object 5's space. Its current AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is defined by `x` from approximately -0.135 to -0.036 and `y` from -0.135 to -0.036. This creates my initial "no-go zone" for Object 4.
           
           Object 4 has square extents. To ensure it's stable at `theta=0`, its center must sit within a range ensuring it stays on surface 0, which is [-0.085, 0.085] in both x and y.
           
           To prevent collisions, the center can't be where Object 5 is. Thus, the center has to sit where the projection in the x and y axes is not within Object 5's space.
           
           So, I need to compute a set of stable placements for Object 4 with `theta=0` or `theta=pi/4`, but avoiding that specific area occupied by Object 5.
           
           I've thought of some approaches, but I'm going to adopt one that is both diverse and collision free:
           
           1.  **For `theta = 0`:** Generate 25 points. I'll use a 6x6 grid over the valid stable range, ensuring that I don't generate points that may overlap with Object 5.
           2.  **For `theta = pi/4`:** Generate 25 points. I'll use a 8x8 grid over the valid stable range, ensuring that I don't generate points that may overlap with Object 5.
           
           The point filtering process is the crux of the collision avoidance. I check that generated points don't lie within the area defined by Object 5's AABB.
           
           This carefully constructed plan should give me those 50 secure placements I need for Object 4.
