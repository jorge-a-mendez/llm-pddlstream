           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular and has dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0.
           
           A placement is stable if the object is fully contained within the surface. I can rotate the object by any angle. For a 2D object of size (width, height) rotated by an angle theta, its bounding box extents are (width * |cos(theta)| + height * |sin(theta)|) and (width * |sin(theta)| + height * |cos(theta)|). In this case, since width and height are almost equal (0.07 and 0.07), the object's effective dimensions for containment purposes remain almost constant regardless of rotation. The effective size of the object will be approximately 0.07 along both axes.
           
           Surface 0 ranges from x=4.2 to x=4.8 and y=-0.6 to y=0.0.
           The width of surface 0 is 4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6.
           The height of surface 0 is 0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6.
           
           Since the object's dimensions are small (0.07 x 0.07) compared to the surface (0.6 x 0.6), there's a lot of space for placements. I will generate a diverse set of placements by varying x, y, and theta. I'll make sure to keep the object centered within the surface for some placements, and explore edges for others. I'll use a step size for x and y that allows for multiple distinct positions, and explore a few different angles.
           
           For the object to be contained, if its effective width is `W_eff` and effective height is `H_eff` (which are both ~0.07 here), then:
           `lower_x + W_eff / 2 <= x_center <= upper_x - W_eff / 2`
           `lower_y + H_eff / 2 <= y_center <= upper_y - H_eff / 2`
           
           Given the object's dimensions are roughly 0.07, the bounding box for the object when rotated by any angle will have dimensions of approximately 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           The valid range for the center (x, y) would be:
           x: [4.2 + 0.07/2, 4.8 - 0.07/2] = [4.235, 4.765]
           y: [-0.6 + 0.07/2, 0.0 - 0.07/2] = [-0.565, -0.035]
           
           I will generate placements by incrementing x and y within these ranges and using various angles.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 5 at (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565). Now I need to place a new object, object 10, on the same surface. Object 10 has dimensions of approximately 0.098 x 0.098. I need to make sure that object 10 does not collide with object 5.
           
           The dimensions of object 10 are approximately 0.098 along both axes.
           The valid range for the center (x, y) for object 10, considering its dimensions, would be:
           x: [4.2 + 0.098/2, 4.8 - 0.098/2] = [4.249, 4.751]
           y: [-0.6 + 0.098/2, 0.0 - 0.098/2] = [-0.551, -0.049]
           
           Object 5 is at (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565). Its AABB is approximately:
           x_min = 4.235 - 0.07/2 = 4.2
           x_max = 4.235 + 0.07/2 = 4.27
           y_min = -0.565 - 0.07/2 = -0.6
           y_max = -0.565 + 0.07/2 = -0.53
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for object 10 that do not overlap with this area. The previous placements for object 5 that were not explicitly successful are assumed to have failed due to collision with unknown fixed obstacles. Since I am only given a single successful placement for object 5, I will assume it's the only one that worked.
           
           I will prioritize placing object 10 in areas far from object 5. Object 5 is near the lower-left corner of the surface. So, I will explore the upper-right corner and central areas first for object 10.
