           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is a square with dimensions 0.09558x0.09558. Since the object is square, its orientation does not affect its footprint. I will try to place the object in the center of the surface, as well as in other locations within the surface's bounds, ensuring it is fully contained. The object's side length is 0.09558. The surface's side length is 0.27. This means there is a margin of (0.27 - 0.09558) / 2 = 0.08721 for placement in both x and y directions from the center. I will generate a diverse set of placements within this margin.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           Now I need to place object 6 (square, 0.08061x0.08061) on surface 0 (square, 0.27x0.27). I must ensure object 6 does not collide with object 4, which is currently centered on surface 0.
           
           The surface 0 has bounds ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object 4 has a size of 0.09558 x 0.09558. Its current placement is (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 occupies the region from -0.09558/2 to 0.09558/2 in both x and y directions, which is approximately (-0.04779, -0.04779) to (0.04779, 0.04779).
           
           Object 6 has a size of 0.08061 x 0.08061. The maximum displacement from the center of the surface for object 6 without colliding with the edges is (0.27 - 0.08061) / 2 = 0.094695.
           
           I need to find placements for object 6 such that its bounding box does not overlap with object 4's bounding box.
           Object 4's bounding box is roughly (-0.0478, -0.0478) to (0.0478, 0.0478).
           Object 6's half-size is 0.08061 / 2 = 0.040305.
           
           To avoid collision, the center of object 6 must be at least 0.0478 + 0.040305 = 0.088105 away from the center of object 4 in either x or y direction.
           So, valid x and y coordinates for object 6 would be outside the range of approximately [-0.088105, 0.088105]. I also need to make sure it stays within the surface bounds, which means its center must be within [-0.094695, 0.094695].
           
           This means there's a very narrow strip of available space for object 6, between |0.088105| and |0.094695|.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and object 6 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0).
           
           Now I need to place object 5 (square, 0.09704x0.09704) on surface 0 (square, 0.27x0.27). I must ensure object 5 does not collide with object 4 or object 6.
           
           Surface 0 bounds: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Object 4 (0.09558x0.09558) is at (0.0, 0.0). Its bounding box is approx (-0.04779, -0.04779) to (0.04779, 0.04779).
           Object 6 (0.08061x0.08061) is at (0.09, 0.0). Its bounding box is approx (0.09 - 0.040305, -0.040305) to (0.09 + 0.040305, 0.040305), which is (0.049695, -0.040305) to (0.130305, 0.040305).
           
           Object 5 has a size of 0.09704 x 0.09704. Its half-size is 0.04852.
           Maximum displacement for object 5 from the center of the surface without colliding with edges is (0.27 - 0.09704) / 2 = 0.08648.
           
           Let's check for collisions in the x-axis:
           Object 4: x_min = -0.04779, x_max = 0.04779
           Object 6: x_min = 0.049695, x_max = 0.130305
           
           There's a gap between x_max of object 4 (0.04779) and x_min of object 6 (0.049695). This gap is very small.
           
           To avoid collision with object 4:
           Object 5's center x must be outside [-0.04779 - 0.04852, 0.04779 + 0.04852] = [-0.09631, 0.09631].
           
           To avoid collision with object 6:
           Object 5's center x must be outside [0.049695 - 0.04852, 0.130305 + 0.04852] = [0.001175, 0.178825].
           
           This means if I place Object 5 at x=0, it will collide with Object 4.
           If I place Object 5 at x=0.09, it will collide with Object 6.
           
           Let's consider the y-axis. Both objects 4 and 6 are centered at y=0.
           Object 4's y-bounds: [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           Object 6's y-bounds: [-0.040305, 0.040305]
           
           To avoid collision with object 4 in y:
           Object 5's center y must be outside [-0.04779 - 0.04852, 0.04779 + 0.04852] = [-0.09631, 0.09631].
           
           To avoid collision with object 6 in y:
           Object 5's center y must be outside [-0.040305 - 0.04852, 0.040305 + 0.04852] = [-0.088825, 0.088825].
           
           The constraint from object 4 is stronger for y-avoidance.
           This means for object 5 to be placed without collision with either object 4 or 6, its center y must be greater than 0.09631 or less than -0.09631.
           The maximum allowed y for object 5's center is 0.08648.
           This implies that placing object 5 along the y-axis (i.e., with x=0 or small x) will be difficult due to collisions.
           
           However, if object 5's x-coordinate is very far from 0.0, then it might be able to be placed at y=0.
           For example, if object 5's center_x is -0.09, it needs to clear object 4.
           Object 5 center_x = -0.09: x_min = -0.09 - 0.04852 = -0.13852. This is outside surface bounds (-0.135). So -0.09 is too far.
           Max x displacement for object 5 is 0.08648.
           So, if object 5 is placed at x = -0.086, its x-range is [-0.086 - 0.04852, -0.086 + 0.04852] = [-0.13452, -0.03748].
           This x-range does not overlap with object 4's x-range ([-0.04779, 0.04779]). There is a gap between -0.03748 and -0.04779.
           This means placing object 5 at (-0.086, 0.0) could be stable on the surface and not collide with object 4.
           Let's check collision with object 6. Object 6's x-range is [0.049695, 0.130305]. Object 5's x-range [-0.13452, -0.03748] doesn't overlap with it. So, placing at (-0.086, 0.0) is a promising candidate.
           
           Let's consider placement in the top/bottom part of the surface.
           Object 5 center_y must be > 0.09631 or < -0.09631 to avoid object 4. But max_y is 0.08648.
           This is a problem. Let me re-evaluate.
           
           Ah, my collision logic is a bit strict. The object 5's y_extent must not overlap with object 4's y_extent AND object 6's y_extent.
           If I place object 5 far in x (e.g., x=-0.086), then its x-extent is [-0.13452, -0.03748].
           Object 4's x-extent is [-0.04779, 0.04779]. No x-collision.
           Object 6's x-extent is [0.049695, 0.130305]. No x-collision.
           
           So, if x = -0.086, I need to find a y for object 5.
           If y=0 for object 5, its y-extent is [-0.04852, 0.04852].
           Object 4's y-extent is [-0.04779, 0.04779]. This means there *is* a y-collision if x_overlap is not handled.
           Object 6's y-extent is [-0.040305, 0.040305]. This means there *is* a y-collision if x_overlap is not handled.
           
           The correct collision check for AABBs: two AABBs (x1_min, x1_max, y1_min, y1_max) and (x2_min, x2_max, y2_min, y2_max) collide if (x1_max > x2_min and x2_max > x1_min) AND (y1_max > y2_min and y2_max > y1_min).
           
           Let's try a placement for Object 5 at x=-0.08.
           Center_x = -0.08, center_y = 0.0.
           Object 5 BBOX: x_min = -0.08 - 0.04852 = -0.12852, x_max = -0.08 + 0.04852 = -0.03148
           y_min = -0.04852, y_max = 0.04852
           
           Check collision with Object 4:
           Object 4 BBOX: x_min = -0.04779, x_max = 0.04779, y_min = -0.04779, y_max = 0.04779
           X-overlap: (-0.03148 > -0.04779) AND (0.04779 > -0.12852) --> TRUE (overlap from -0.03148 to 0.04779)
           Y-overlap: (0.04852 > -0.04779) AND (0.04779 > -0.04852) --> TRUE (overlap from -0.04779 to 0.04779)
           Since both X and Y overlap, there is a collision.
           
           So, simply offsetting in X (or Y) is not enough if the Y (or X) overlap still exists.
           I need to place object 5 such that its bounding box does not overlap with *either* object 4 or object 6.
           
           Object 4 is in the center. Object 6 is to its right.
           Available space for Object 5 is mainly to the left of Object 4, or far to the top/bottom.
           
           Let's consider placement in the top part of the surface.
           Max center_y for object 5 is 0.08648.
           If center_y = 0.08648, then object 5's y_min = 0.08648 - 0.04852 = 0.03796, y_max = 0.08648 + 0.04852 = 0.135.
           Object 4's y_max = 0.04779.
           Object 6's y_max = 0.040305.
           
           If object 5 is at (0.0, 0.08648):
           Object 5 BBOX: x_min=-0.04852, x_max=0.04852, y_min=0.03796, y_max=0.135
           Collision with Object 4?
           X-overlap: (-0.04852, 0.04852) and (-0.04779, 0.04779) --> TRUE
           Y-overlap: (0.03796, 0.135) and (-0.04779, 0.04779) --> TRUE (overlap from 0.03796 to 0.04779)
           So, (0.0, 0.08648) collides with object 4.
           
           The problem is that the object is relatively large.
           Object 4's half-size: 0.04779
           Object 5's half-size: 0.04852
           Sum of half-sizes in Y: 0.04779 + 0.04852 = 0.09631.
           So, the y-coordinate of object 5 must be further than 0.09631 from object 4's center (y=0).
           But the maximum y-coordinate for object 5 is 0.08648.
           This means there is no way to place object 5 such that it avoids object 4 in the y-dimension if their x-dimensions overlap.
           The only way to avoid collision is if their x-dimensions don't overlap at all.
           
           Let's reconsider the x-dimension.
           Object 4 BBOX: [-0.04779, 0.04779] in X
           Object 6 BBOX: [0.049695, 0.130305] in X
           The space between them is (0.04779, 0.049695). This is very small.
           
           If Object 5 needs to avoid Object 4 in X, its center_x must be < -0.04779 - 0.04852 = -0.09631 OR > 0.04779 + 0.04852 = 0.09631.
           If Object 5 needs to avoid Object 6 in X, its center_x must be < 0.049695 - 0.04852 = 0.001175 OR > 0.130305 + 0.04852 = 0.178825.
           
           Combining these:
           To avoid object 4 and object 6 in X, its center_x must be:
           1. Less than -0.09631 (This would be to the left of object 4)
           2. Between 0.001175 and 0.09631 (This is a complex condition: must be > 0.001175 to avoid object 6, and < 0.09631 to avoid object 4)
           3. Greater than 0.178825 (This would be to the right of object 6, but max x is 0.08648, so this is impossible)
           
           Let's focus on option 1: center_x < -0.09631.
           The max displacement from center for object 5 is 0.08648. This means x cannot be less than -0.08648.
           So, it's impossible to place object 5 to the left of object 4 *without* x-overlap.
           
           Let's focus on option 2: 0.001175 < center_x < 0.09631.
           Wait, my definition for collision is if (x1_max > x2_min and x2_max > x1_min) AND (y1_max > y2_min and y2_max > y1_min).
           So, if the x-ranges don't overlap, there's no collision, regardless of y-overlap.
           
           Let's try to place object 5 far to the left, so its x-range does not overlap with object 4 or 6.
           Maximum left x-center for object 5 is -0.08648.
           If object 5 center_x = -0.08648, its x-range is [-0.08648 - 0.04852, -0.08648 + 0.04852] = [-0.135, -0.03796].
           Object 4's x-range is [-0.04779, 0.04779].
           Does [-0.135, -0.03796] overlap with [-0.04779, 0.04779]?
           Yes, -0.03796 > -0.04779 and 0.04779 > -0.135. They overlap in x. So it can't avoid collision by just shifting left.
           
           The objects are simply too large for the surface given the current placements of 4 and 6.
           Object 4's width = 0.09558. Object 6's width = 0.08061. Object 5's width = 0.09704.
           Total width if placed side by side: 0.09558 + 0.08061 + 0.09704 = 0.27323.
           This is larger than the surface width of 0.27. So, they cannot all be placed side by side horizontally.
           Similarly for vertical placement.
           
           This means object 5 must avoid both 4 and 6 by being placed completely outside their combined footprint.
           Object 4 BBOX: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           Object 6 BBOX: [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305]
           
           Let's find the combined footprint of 4 and 6:
           X_min = -0.04779, X_max = 0.130305 (this spans 4 and 6)
           Y_min = -0.04779, Y_max = 0.04779 (this covers both, as 4's Y range is wider)
           So the combined rectangular region (containing both 4 and 6) is approximately [-0.04779, 0.130305] x [-0.04779, 0.04779].
           
           Now I need to place Object 5 (half-size 0.04852) such that its bounding box does not overlap with this combined region.
           Let Object 5 be (cx, cy). Its BBOX is [cx - 0.04852, cx + 0.04852] x [cy - 0.04852, cy + 0.04852].
           
           Conditions for no overlap:
           1. cx + 0.04852 <= -0.04779 (Object 5 is entirely to the left of combined region)
              cx <= -0.04779 - 0.04852 = -0.09631
           2. cx - 0.04852 >= 0.130305 (Object 5 is entirely to the right of combined region)
              cx >= 0.130305 + 0.04852 = 0.178825
           3. cy + 0.04852 <= -0.04779 (Object 5 is entirely below combined region)
              cy <= -0.04779 - 0.04852 = -0.09631
           4. cy - 0.04852 >= 0.04779 (Object 5 is entirely above combined region)
              cy >= 0.04779 + 0.04852 = 0.09631
           
           Also, object 5 must stay within surface bounds: [-0.08648, 0.08648] for its center_x and center_y.
           
           Checking the conditions:
           1. cx <= -0.09631. This conflicts with cx >= -0.08648 (surface bound). So, no placement is possible to the left of the combined region without x-overlap.
           2. cx >= 0.178825. This conflicts with cx <= 0.08648 (surface bound). So, no placement is possible to the right of the combined region without x-overlap.
           
           This means object 5 MUST overlap in the x-dimension with the combined bounding box of 4 and 6. Therefore, to avoid collision, it *must not* overlap in the y-dimension.
           
           So, object 5 must be entirely above or entirely below the combined region's y-extent.
           3. cy <= -0.09631. This conflicts with cy >= -0.08648 (surface bound). So, no placement is possible entirely below.
           4. cy >= 0.09631. This conflicts with cy <= 0.08648 (surface bound). So, no placement is possible entirely above.
           
           This result implies it is impossible to place object 5 given the current placements of object 4 and 6 and the size of the surface.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. This suggests my geometric reasoning might be too strict or that the problem expects me to find valid placements assuming the previous placements are "stable" in some sense that doesn't imply fixed obstacles but simply that those are available spots.
           
           Let me re-read the prompt: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene."
           And: "The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles."
           
           This means (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) for ID 4 and (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0) for ID 6 are *fixed* obstacles that I need to avoid. My previous analysis about collision is correct.
           
           There is a logical contradiction here if there are no other assumptions to be made.
           The object extents are (ID: 5) -- 0.09704110700854357, 0.09704110700854351.
           Surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) (Side length 0.27)
           Object 5 half-side: 0.04852. Max center_x/y: 0.135 - 0.04852 = 0.08648.
           
           Combined BBOX of 4 and 6.
           Object 4: center (0,0), half-size 0.04779. BBOX [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779].
           Object 6: center (0.09,0), half-size 0.040305. BBOX [0.09-0.040305, 0.09+0.040305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305] = [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305].
           
           Total occupied X space: x_min = -0.04779, x_max = 0.130305.
           Total occupied Y space: y_min = -0.04779, y_max = 0.04779.
           This creates a combined bounding box of approximately [-0.04779, 0.130305] x [-0.04779, 0.04779].
           
           For object 5 (half-size 0.04852) to avoid this:
           Case A: To the left
           Object 5 (cx,cy). cx + 0.04852 <= -0.04779 => cx <= -0.09631.
           But center_x must be >= -0.08648. These are contradictory. No solutions here.
           
           Case B: To the right
           Object 5 (cx,cy). cx - 0.04852 >= 0.130305 => cx >= 0.178825.
           But center_x must be <= 0.08648. These are contradictory. No solutions here.
           
           Case C: Below
           Object 5 (cx,cy). cy + 0.04852 <= -0.04779 => cy <= -0.09631.
           But center_y must be >= -0.08648. These are contradictory. No solutions here.
           
           Case D: Above
           Object 5 (cx,cy). cy - 0.04852 >= 0.04779 => cy >= 0.09631.
           But center_y must be <= 0.08648. These are contradictory. No solutions here.
           
           This implies there are literally no stable placements for object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with either object 4 or 6.
           The problem statement says "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement."
           This indicates I should still provide placements even if my geometric reasoning says it's impossible. This could be due to:
           1. My interpretation of "collision" or "stable" is too strict.
           2. The problem expects me to place it, and then the feedback mechanism will indicate a collision, and I learn from it.
           3. My calculations are wrong. Let's double check values.
           
           Surface side: 0.27
           Object 4 half: 0.09558 / 2 = 0.04779
           Object 6 half: 0.08061 / 2 = 0.040305
           Object 5 half: 0.09704 / 2 = 0.04852
           
           Surface center is (0,0). Surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Max center for any object: 0.135 - object_half_size.
           For Object 5, max center = 0.135 - 0.04852 = 0.08648.
           
           Object 4 BBOX: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           Object 6 BBOX: [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305] (since centered at 0.09,0)
           
           Combined BBOX:
           X: min(-0.04779, 0.049695) = -0.04779
           X: max(0.04779, 0.130305) = 0.130305
           Y: min(-0.04779, -0.040305) = -0.04779
           Y: max(0.04779, 0.040305) = 0.04779
           Combined BBOX: [-0.04779, 0.130305] x [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           
           Object 5 BBOX: [cx-0.04852, cx+0.04852] x [cy-0.04852, cy+0.04852]
           
           Condition for non-collision for Object 5 and the combined BBOX:
           NOT ( (x1_max > x2_min and x2_max > x1_min) AND (y1_max > y2_min and y2_max > y1_min) )
           This means either (no x-overlap) OR (no y-overlap).
           
           No x-overlap:
           (cx + 0.04852 <= -0.04779) OR (cx - 0.04852 >= 0.130305)
           cx <= -0.09631 OR cx >= 0.178825.
           Both of these are outside the valid range for cx, which is [-0.08648, 0.08648].
           So, Object 5 will *always* overlap in x with the combined bounding box.
           
           Therefore, to avoid collision, Object 5 *must not* overlap in y.
           No y-overlap:
           (cy + 0.04852 <= -0.04779) OR (cy - 0.04852 >= 0.04779)
           cy <= -0.09631 OR cy >= 0.09631.
           Both of these are outside the valid range for cy, which is [-0.08648, 0.08648].
           
           So yes, my calculation consistently shows that it is impossible to place object 5 without collision.
           
           Given the prompt "You never give up" and "Please provide 50 stable placements", I will have to assume that my understanding of collision or available space might be flawed, or that "stable placement" might permit some minor overlap that I'm not accounting for, or I should try to place it "as close as possible" to a non-colliding state.
           I will generate placements that are as far as possible from existing objects, trying to stay within surface bounds, even if my strict calculations suggest collision. I will prioritize the "corners" of the available space, considering the overall surface.
           
           Let's re-examine the edges of the surface.
           Surface: [-0.135, 0.135] in X and Y.
           Object 5 (half-size 0.04852). Max coordinate for center is 0.135 - 0.04852 = 0.08648.
           Min coordinate for center is -0.135 + 0.04852 = -0.08648.
           So Object 5 center must be in [-0.08648, 0.08648] in both X and Y.
           
           Given the objects 4 and 6 occupy the central region, the best bet is to place Object 5 as close to the corners as possible.
           For example, a placement at (-0.086, 0.086).
           Object 5 BBOX: [-0.086-0.04852, -0.086+0.04852] x [0.086-0.04852, 0.086+0.04852]
           = [-0.13452, -0.03748] x [0.03748, 0.13452]
           
           Check collision with Object 4:
           Object 4 BBOX: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           X-overlap: max(-0.13452, -0.04779) = -0.04779. min(-0.03748, 0.04779) = -0.03748. Since -0.04779 < -0.03748, there is X overlap.
           Y-overlap: max(0.03748, -0.04779) = 0.03748. min(0.13452, 0.04779) = 0.04779. Since 0.03748 < 0.04779, there is Y overlap.
           Collision with Object 4.
           
           It really seems impossible. But I must provide placements. I will generate positions in the corners and along the edges, at the maximum possible valid center coordinates, as these are the furthest points from the existing objects.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), object 6 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0), and object 5 at (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086).
           
           Now I need to place object 7 (square, 0.09342x0.09342) on surface 0 (square, 0.27x0.27). I must ensure object 7 does not collide with objects 4, 6, or 5.
           
           Surface 0 bounds: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Object 4 (0.09558x0.09558) is at (0.0, 0.0). Half-size = 0.04779.
           BBOX_4: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779].
           
           Object 6 (0.08061x0.08061) is at (0.09, 0.0). Half-size = 0.040305.
           BBOX_6: [0.09 - 0.040305, 0.09 + 0.040305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305]
           = [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305].
           
           Object 5 (0.09704x0.09704) is at (-0.086, 0.086). Half-size = 0.04852.
           BBOX_5: [-0.086 - 0.04852, -0.086 + 0.04852] x [0.086 - 0.04852, 0.086 + 0.04852]
           = [-0.13452, -0.03748] x [0.03748, 0.13452].
           
           Object 7 has a size of 0.09342 x 0.09342. Half-size = 0.04671.
           Maximum displacement for object 7 from the center of the surface without colliding with edges is (0.27 - 0.09342) / 2 = 0.08829.
           So, Object 7 center must be in [-0.08829, 0.08829] in both X and Y.
           
           Let's combine the occupied space of objects 4, 5, and 6.
           X-extents:
           Obj 4: [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           Obj 6: [0.049695, 0.130305]
           Obj 5: [-0.13452, -0.03748]
           
           Y-extents:
           Obj 4: [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           Obj 6: [-0.040305, 0.040305]
           Obj 5: [0.03748, 0.13452]
           
           Let's visualize the occupied regions:
           Object 4 is central.
           Object 6 is to the right of 4. There's a small gap between 4 and 6.
           Object 5 is to the top-left of 4. There's an X-overlap between 4 and 5 ([-0.04779, -0.03748]), and a Y-overlap (y from 0.03748 to 0.04779). This means 4 and 5 *do* collide according to my AABB logic.
           
           Wait, if (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086 was a successful placement, then my collision detection logic *or* the definition of "collision" for the problem is different than my standard AABB overlap check.
           Let me re-evaluate the collision between 4 and 5.
           BBOX_4: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779]
           BBOX_5: [-0.13452, -0.03748] x [0.03748, 0.13452]
           X overlap: (BBOX_5.x_max > BBOX_4.x_min) and (BBOX_4.x_max > BBOX_5.x_min)
           (-0.03748 > -0.04779) and (0.04779 > -0.13452) -> TRUE AND TRUE. So, X overlaps.
           Y overlap: (BBOX_5.y_max > BBOX_4.y_min) and (BBOX_4.y_max > BBOX_5.y_min)
           (0.13452 > -0.04779) and (0.04779 > 0.03748) -> TRUE AND TRUE. So, Y overlaps.
           Since both X and Y overlap, my definition of AABB collision implies a collision between 4 and 5.
           
           This means that the "successful" placement of object 5 at (-0.086, 0.086) either:
           a) Is actually colliding, but the system's "success" means "did not collide with fixed obstacles *not including other placed objects*", which contradicts "avoid collision between objects i and j".
           b) My AABB overlap calculation is wrong.
           c) The problem is using a more lenient definition of "collision" (e.g., only if centers are too close, or if a significant percentage of area overlaps, or perhaps the objects are not perfectly square AABBs and these extents are just for the overall bounding box, and the actual geometry allows for the placement). Given I am asked to generate placements based on AABB descriptions, I should stick to AABB collision.
           
           Let's assume the successful placements are truly non-colliding based on the given extents. This implies that my interpretation of the success for object 5 being at (-0.086, 0.086) must mean that its actual geometry, or the effective "collision footprint", is smaller or differently shaped, or there is an unstated tolerance. However, since the prompt only gives AABB extents, I will continue to use AABB collision.
           
           If the previous placements are valid despite my calculation, it means there is more space than I'm calculating. Or, I need to provide placements that would be valid *if* my AABB calculation *were* wrong in the same way for future objects. This is a difficult situation.
           
           I will proceed by generating placements for object 7 in the "remaining" areas, as far as possible from the reported locations of objects 4, 5, and 6, and within the surface boundaries.
           
           Let's assume the 'success' means that there is *some* interpretation under which they don't collide. I will try to find a placement for object 7 in areas that are as far as possible from the current placed objects.
           
           The overall surface is 0.27 x 0.27.
           Object 7 half-size is 0.04671.
           Max center for Object 7 is 0.135 - 0.04671 = 0.08829.
           Min center for Object 7 is -0.135 + 0.04671 = -0.08829.
           
           Let's list the known objects' centers and half-sizes:
           O4: (0,0), hs=0.04779
           O6: (0.09,0), hs=0.040305
           O5: (-0.086,0.086), hs=0.04852
           
           Consider the empty "quadrants" or "regions":
           1. Bottom-left region: Where x is negative, and y is negative. Furthest from O4, O5, O6.
              Candidate center: (-0.088, -0.088)
              O7 BBOX: [-0.088-0.04671, -0.088+0.04671] x [-0.088-0.04671, -0.088+0.04671]
              = [-0.13471, -0.04129] x [-0.13471, -0.04129]
              This region does not overlap with O4 (y_min -0.04779), O6 (y_min -0.040305), or O5 (y_min 0.03748) in Y. This seems like a strong candidate for non-collision.
           
           2. Bottom-right region: Where x is positive, y is negative.
              Candidate center: (0.088, -0.088)
              O7 BBOX: [0.088-0.04671, 0.088+0.04671] x [-0.088-0.04671, -0.088+0.04671]
              = [0.04129, 0.13471] x [-0.13471, -0.04129]
              This region's y-extent does not overlap with O4, O5, O6.
              Its x-extent overlaps with O6 (x from 0.049695 to 0.130305).
              Specifically, X-overlap: (0.13471 > 0.049695) and (0.130305 > 0.04129) -> TRUE and TRUE. So X overlaps.
              However, since the Y-extents do not overlap, there should be no collision by AABB logic.
              This (0.088, -0.088) is a good candidate.
           
           3. Top-right region: Where x is positive, y is positive.
              Candidate center: (0.088, 0.088)
              O7 BBOX: [0.04129, 0.13471] x [0.04129, 0.13471]
              This region's X-extent overlaps with O6.
              This region's Y-extent overlaps with O5 (y from 0.03748 to 0.13452).
              So this is likely a collision based on my previous reasoning.
              X overlap: O7 [0.04129, 0.13471] with O6 [0.049695, 0.130305] -> TRUE
              Y overlap: O7 [0.04129, 0.13471] with O5 [0.03748, 0.13452] -> TRUE
              This one will collide by my current interpretation.
              Given that a previous placement that *also* looked like a collision was accepted, I will still generate placements in this region, such as (0.086, 0.086) for example, or even (0.0, 0.0).
           
           I will prioritize placements in the corners of the surface that are currently 'empty' according to my best AABB interpretation, and then fill in other spots.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), object 6 at (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0), object 5 at (0, 0.0, -0.086, 0.086), and object 7 at (0, 0.0, -0.088, -0.088).
           
           Now I need to place object 8 (square, 0.09314x0.09314) on surface 0 (square, 0.27x0.27). I must ensure object 8 does not collide with objects 4, 5, 6, or 7.
           
           Surface 0 bounds: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Object 4 (0.09558x0.09558) at (0.0, 0.0). Half-size = 0.04779.
           BBOX_4: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779].
           
           Object 6 (0.08061x0.08061) at (0.09, 0.0). Half-size = 0.040305.
           BBOX_6: [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305].
           
           Object 5 (0.09704x0.09704) at (-0.086, 0.086). Half-size = 0.04852.
           BBOX_5: [-0.13452, -0.03748] x [0.03748, 0.13452].
           
           Object 7 (0.09342x0.09342) at (-0.088, -0.088). Half-size = 0.04671.
           BBOX_7: [-0.13471, -0.04129] x [-0.13471, -0.04129].
           
           Object 8 has a size of 0.09314 x 0.09314. Half-size = 0.04657.
           Maximum displacement for object 8 from the center of the surface without colliding with edges is (0.27 - 0.09314) / 2 = 0.08843.
           So, Object 8 center must be in [-0.08843, 0.08843] in both X and Y.
           
           Given the placements of 4, 5, 6, and 7, let's identify the remaining "empty" space on the surface.
           Object 4: Central.
           Object 6: Right of 4.
           Object 5: Top-left of 4.
           Object 7: Bottom-left of 4.
           
           The main remaining corner is the top-right. Let's try to place object 8 there.
           Candidate center: (0.088, 0.088) - this is within the allowed center range for object 8.
           O8 BBOX (if placed at (0.088, 0.088)):
           [0.088 - 0.04657, 0.088 + 0.04657] x [0.088 - 0.04657, 0.088 + 0.04657]
           = [0.04143, 0.13457] x [0.04143, 0.13457].
           
           Let's check collision with existing objects:
           1. Collision with O4 (BBOX_4: [-0.04779, 0.04779] x [-0.04779, 0.04779])?
              O8 X-range: [0.04143, 0.13457]. O4 X-range: [-0.04779, 0.04779].
              X-overlap: max(0.04143, -0.04779) = 0.04143. min(0.13457, 0.04779) = 0.04779. Since 0.04143 < 0.04779, X-overlap exists.
              O8 Y-range: [0.04143, 0.13457]. O4 Y-range: [-0.04779, 0.04779].
              Y-overlap: max(0.04143, -0.04779) = 0.04143. min(0.13457, 0.04779) = 0.04779. Since 0.04143 < 0.04779, Y-overlap exists.
              According to my strict AABB collision, this collides with O4.
           
           2. Collision with O6 (BBOX_6: [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305])?
              O8 X-range: [0.04143, 0.13457]. O6 X-range: [0.049695, 0.130305]. X-overlap.
              O8 Y-range: [0.04143, 0.13457]. O6 Y-range: [-0.040305, 0.040305].
              Y-overlap: max(0.04143, -0.040305) = 0.04143. min(0.13457, 0.040305) = 0.040305. No Y-overlap (0.04143 is not < 0.040305). So no collision with O6.
           
           3. Collision with O5 (BBOX_5: [-0.13452, -0.03748] x [0.03748, 0.13452])?
              O8 X-range: [0.04143, 0.13457]. O5 X-range: [-0.13452, -0.03748]. No X-overlap. So no collision with O5.
           
           4. Collision with O7 (BBOX_7: [-0.13471, -0.04129] x [-0.13471, -0.04129])?
              O8 X-range: [0.04143, 0.13457]. O7 X-range: [-0.13471, -0.04129]. No X-overlap. So no collision with O7.
           
           So, the placement (0.088, 0.088) for object 8 collides with object 4, but not 5, 6, or 7, based on my strict AABB logic.
           Given that previous such placements (like 5 and 4) were deemed successful, it means the rule for "collision" might be more complex than a simple AABB overlap, or there's a tolerance.
           I'll offer the (0.088, 0.088) placement and other similar corner/edge placements.
           
           Let's also look for remaining space in the center bottom.
           The combined region occupied by existing objects:
           X: min(BBOX_4.x_min, BBOX_5.x_min, BBOX_6.x_min, BBOX_7.x_min) = min(-0.04779, -0.13452, 0.049695, -0.13471) = -0.13471
           X: max(BBOX_4.x_max, BBOX_5.x_max, BBOX_6.x_max, BBOX_7.x_max) = max(0.04779, -0.03748, 0.130305, -0.04129) = 0.130305
           Y: min(BBOX_4.y_min, BBOX_5.y_min, BBOX_6.y_min, BBOX_7.y_min) = min(-0.04779, 0.03748, -0.040305, -0.13471) = -0.13471
           Y: max(BBOX_4.y_max, BBOX_5.y_max, BBOX_6.y_max, BBOX_7.y_max) = max(0.04779, 0.13452, 0.040305, -0.04129) = 0.13452
           
           Combined AABB of all placed objects: [-0.13471, 0.130305] x [-0.13471, 0.13452].
           Object 8 half-size: 0.04657. Max center offset: 0.08843.
           Surface bounds: [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135].
           
           If the combined BBOX of existing objects is considered as a single obstacle, its x-range is nearly the full width (-0.13471 to 0.130305), and its y-range is also nearly the full height (-0.13471 to 0.13452).
           There is very little empty space left. The only way to place a new object is if:
           1. Its x-range is entirely outside [-0.13471, 0.130305].
              cx + 0.04657 <= -0.13471 => cx <= -0.18128 (Too far left: min_cx is -0.08843)
              cx - 0.04657 >= 0.130305 => cx >= 0.176875 (Too far right: max_cx is 0.08843)
              This means x-overlap is unavoidable with the combined BBOX.
           2. Its y-range is entirely outside [-0.13471, 0.13452].
              cy + 0.04657 <= -0.13471 => cy <= -0.18128 (Too far down: min_cy is -0.08843)
              cy - 0.04657 >= 0.13452 => cy >= 0.18109 (Too far up: max_cy is 0.08843)
              This means y-overlap is unavoidable with the combined BBOX.
           
           This again implies it is geometrically impossible to place object 8 without collision, if we consider the union of bounding boxes as a single obstacle.
           However, collision detection works for each pair of AABBs.
           
           Let's try to find an area that is as "clear" as possible.
           The existing objects are mostly in a cross shape, with the center and left/right/top-left/bottom-left covered.
           The most promising area would be the bottom-right corner.
           Object 7 (bottom-left) has BBOX_7: [-0.13471, -0.04129] x [-0.13471, -0.04129].
           Object 6 (right of center) has BBOX_6: [0.049695, 0.130305] x [-0.040305, 0.040305].
           
           Let's test (0.088, -0.088) as a primary candidate.
           O8 BBOX: [0.04143, 0.13457] x [-0.13457, -0.04143]
           - With O4: X-overlap [0.04143, 0.04779], Y-overlap [-0.04779, -0.04143]. Yes, collides.
           - With O5: No X-overlap. No collision.
           - With O6: X-overlap [0.049695, 0.130305], No Y-overlap. No collision.
           - With O7: No X-overlap. No collision.
           
           So (0.088, -0.088) collides with O4, but that was also true for the previous (successful) placement of O5. I will proceed with this strategy.
