           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I've got a goal here, `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which effectively translates to getting an object of a specific type *on* a specific object. Specifically, I need to get an object, let's call it `?green`, of type `v17` onto object `v18`. I've got two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, both of which are of the correct type (`v17`) and supported by `v11` and `v14` respectively.  I see that both `v8` and `v12` are supported at pose `#o2` on `v18`, so getting either of these objects to pose `#o2` will satisfy my goal.
           
           Now, let's formulate my plan:  I'll pick up `v8` from its initial position at `v9` and place it at `#o2`. The problem provides the kinematics to do this, and I can readily see the necessary support relationships.
           
           Here's my detailed plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** The robot's base is currently at `v3`, but the picking/placing actions will be based on the base configuration `#o3`. Thus, I need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`. The relevant action, `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`, is available, and its preconditions are met. After performing this action, the base will be at the correct configuration, and the robot will be able to perform actions.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Now that I've moved the robot to the correct base configuration, it is possible to pick `v8`. The action is `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, where arm `v4` will pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.  The initial conditions check out here too: kinematic information exists (`kin(...)`), the object is at the specified pose, and the arm is empty, as it should be.
           
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll place `v8` at pose `#o2`, using action `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.  I can check that the needed kinematics (`kin(...)`) are present and that I'm holding `v8` in the appropriate grasp. This is all doable.
           
           After the place action, `v8` will be at `#o2`. From initial state knowledge, it is known that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. With `v8` at pose `#o2`, and the fact that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true, I can assert that `on(v8, v18)`. With this, the final goal is met.  The plan has been validated, and the sequence of actions appears consistent with the available PDDL descriptions of these actions. The necessary predicates will be achieved in the correct order to meet the specified `on` axiom.
