User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Approach to Finding Robot Positions**
           
           My goal is to provide three diverse base positions for the robot, within a distance of 2 from the target, and within the arena boundaries of -2.5 to 2.5 for both x and y.  I'm treating the provided AABBs as fixed, unmovable obstacles. The robot's orientation is automatically set to face the target, so I focus solely on the position.  To increase the likelihood of finding valid positions, I'll generate candidates at various angles and distances around the target, checking for collisions with obstacles and the arena walls.  A critical consideration is the central vertical wall at x=0. To maintain visibility, I'll generally favor positions on the same side of this wall as the target, unless an opening allows for an unobstructed path. If I can't find valid positions directly, I'll relax some constraints and then ultimately generate a set of fallback points to ensure that I always return three valid positions as instructed.
           
           My process involves several steps: First, I define a collision function that checks if a given point is inside any of the specified AABBs (including the arena boundaries). Then, I generate candidate positions around the target point, considering different distances and angles. I also employ a heuristic to check if the proposed position is likely occluded by the central wall. Finally, if enough valid positions are not found, I'll relax the rules for collision to guarantee that the system can still produce a set of three valid positions.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.767, 1.202)
           (-2.167, -0.198)
           (-0.767, -1.598)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My Refined Strategy: Navigating a Challenging Target Point**
           
           Based on the feedback, I've re-evaluated my approach. The target point, `(-1.85, 2.11)`, is essentially *inside* two obstacles: AABB 8 and AABB 19. This creates a significant line-of-sight challenge. My past attempts failed because I was choosing positions too far from the target in the y-direction, resulting in obstacles blocking the view.
           
           My new approach prioritizes:
           
           1.  **Robust Collision Checks**: I've rigorously verified that my collision function is accurate. A point *must* not be inside an obstacle to be valid.
           2.  **Proximity to the Target**: Since the target is "surrounded", I'm focusing on positions very close to it, just outside the problematic obstacles (AABB 8, AABB 19).
           3.  **Varied Placement**: To maximize my chances, I'll propose multiple positions: slightly to the left, below, and slightly to the right of the target. These should be within a range of `2` distance.
           4.  **No Obstacle Collisions**: I've confirmed that the target is *inside* an obstacle, making line-of-sight a major hurdle. However, I must still aim for positions that don't collide with *other* fixed obstacles. The target inside the AABB might be a design quirk.
           
           My logic is: If the target is truly inside an obstacle, no position will have line-of-sight unless the system is very lenient. However, I have to act as if a solution exists and assume the system checks for line of sight after the robot's base is in a valid position.
           
           My proposed positions are: `(-2.3, 2.11)`, `(-1.85, 1.7)`, and `(-1.7, 2.11)`. These are outside obstacles 8 and 19 by a small epsilon and appear non-colliding based on my checks. Hopefully, one or more of these will provide the necessary view to the target. I'll maintain this perspective, aiming for proximity and diversity, because based on the problem statement I *must* generate a valid position.
