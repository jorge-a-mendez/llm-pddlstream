           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the new-axiom@0() goal in the rovers domain.**
           
           First, let's establish the initial conditions. Both `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true, along with `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.  The challenge lies in achieving these: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis` for a stone, and `receivedanalysis` for soil.
           
           I'll focus on rover v14. To get the images, I'll need to use `take_image` actions, which require the rover to calibrate its camera and be in a `comvisible` configuration. I'll use location (-1.0,-1.75) for `comvisible`. The imagevisible configurations `#o3` is set to (0.0, 0.5)
           
           Here's the imaging sequence. v14 starts at v15:
           
           1.  Move to (0.0, 0.5) for imaging
           2.  Calibrate for the first objective, image it
           3.  Calibrate for the second, image it
           4.  Move to communication config (-1.0, -1.75)
           5.  Send both images
           
           For `receivedanalysis`, I'll use rover v14, along with the store v16, and the sampling location. The sampling configuration `#o5` I define at (-2.0, 0.0).  Now I plan on sampling the available rocks. The rock types are known, so I can use v1 (stone) and v5 (soil).  The communication configuration `(-1.0, -1.75)` is the lander comm location.
           
           Here's the analysis phase:
           
           1.  Move to sampling configuration.
           2.  Sample a stone `v1`, then sample soil `v5`.
           3.  Move back to `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           4.  Send the analysis
           5.  Move v14 back to the initial configuration.
           
           That covers the axiom. All the needed effects are achieved.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement for Rover Tasks**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan hit a snag because the old configurations for imaging (`#o3`) and sampling (`#o5`) caused collisions or were unreachable. Time to rethink those!
           
           First, the imaging. The goal is to get images of `v17` and `v18`. The old spot for `#o3` was bumping into a wall-like object (`v19`). The new thought? Put `#o3` at `(0.7, 1.0)`. This'll let the rover (`v14`) avoid the wall and still be close enough to grab images of both targets. Fingers crossed that thin wall doesn't completely block the camera's view – we're assuming it's not a full-height barrier, just a short one. The `0.7` value on x and `1.0` value on y for the new position means the camera is positioned more positively to image `v17` and `v18`. It has no collision and is close enough to the objects, so this will be used for both targets.
           
           Next up, sampling (`#o5`). The previous location was apparently unreachable. Now, the idea is to use the rover `v12` for all sampling tasks. I've set `#o5` to `(1.2, -0.6)`. This is "above" the rocks `v4` and `v8`, where `v4` is stone and `v8` is soil. The thought is that since I am using the rover `v12` this can be close to the two targets.
           
           The plan now has the rover `v14` focusing on imaging and transmitting images.  Rover `v12` handles sampling and transmitting analyses. Communication happens at the starting location (`v15`). This way, two rovers are working concurrently. I have determined that both rovers should use the communications location `(-1.0, -1.75)` to upload data to the lander `v9`. Given this breakdown and new configuration values, I should be able to get the required tasks completed without those earlier "unreachable" errors.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this planning puzzle.** The initial feedback that the previous configurations were "not reachable" has thrown a wrench in the works. My primary focus now is ensuring the chosen continuous values for the rovers are *actually* reachable, considering the robot's movement limitations and the environment.
           
           I'm starting by re-evaluating the reachability constraints. I know the starting positions of the rovers (`v15` and `v13`) *are* reachable. So, the strategy is to *minimize* the deviation from these known-good starting poses. I'll stick close to the initial and utilize symbolic configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) to establish communication links, image the scene, and collect samples.
           
           **For `comvisible` (`#o0`):** I need a pose from which the lander (`v9`) can communicate, starting from rover `v14` at `v15` or `v12` at `v13`. I was using `v15` for `#o0` initially, but that's been rejected. So, I am placing `#o0` at `(-1.0, -1.70)`, a slightly shifted position from `v15` but close enough to ensure the communication link. This minimizes movement.
           
           **For `imagevisible` (`#o3`):**  I need a pose to capture images of `v17` and `v18`. I've chosen `(-0.5, 1.0)` for the pose of `v14` to take these images. This is within 2 meters of the objectives and collision-free from `v19` and `v20`. The tricky part here is making sure the rays to `v17` and `v18` are not blocked by `v19` (the thin wall at x=0). While the ray to `v18` is crossing the obstruction at x = 0, my assumption is that the obstacle is so low the camera can see over.
           
           **For `above` (`#o5`):** Rover `v12` needs to get above the stone `v3` and the soil sample `v8`. The ideal coordinates are chosen so rover `v12` starts from the close position `v13` and moves to `(1.0, -0.2)`. This new pose is above the targets and collision free.
           
           **The Plan**
           
           1.  **V14 (Imaging & Send):** Move rover `v14` starting from `v15` to `(-0.5, 1.0)` to image the objectives `v17` and `v18`. After images are captured and sent, it moves back to `v15` from `(-1.0, -1.70)`.
           
           2.  **V12 (Sampling & Send):** Move rover `v12` from `v13` to `(1.0, -0.2)` to pick samples. After analysis and drop, rover goes from `(1.0, -0.2)` to `(-1.0, -1.70)` to pick the other sample, before returning to its start `v13`.
           
           I have confirmed that all motion primitives exist, and the rocks chosen are of the desired types. This plan assumes the low obstruction wall at x=0 is traversable.
