           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable. The core of the problem lies in the constraints imposed by the provided list of "valid action instances." These instances, specifically, the two "move" actions (which are effectively no-ops, staying in the same configuration) and two `drop_rock` actions, are insufficient to meet the prerequisites of achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I would require the actions `take_image` and `send_image`. However, these actions necessitate the rovers to be at configurations like `#o0` or `#o3`, which are not currently their `atconf` positions. The allowed "move" actions do not enable these configuration changes. Without these necessary changes, I can't fulfill those goals.
           
           Furthermore, analyzing the `drop_rock` action shows its preconditions can't be met, as initial facts show that the rover storage is `free` and the action requires `full`.
           
           Given the strict constraint that only the given "action instances" can be used, and the inability to reach the required configurations, it's impossible to achieve the subgoals `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. Consequently, the overarching goal `new-axiom@0()` is deemed unreachable with the provided actions.
