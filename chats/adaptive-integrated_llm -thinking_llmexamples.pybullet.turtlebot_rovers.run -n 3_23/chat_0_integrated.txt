           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unattainable with Given Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom's structure, I see it's a conjunction of several conditions. Some are already true in the initial state, like `atconf` and `free` predicates. However, the crux of the problem lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I need to get images and analyses of specific objects (stones and soil).
           
           The current task seems straightforward: identify the rocks and soil, get their images and analyses, and ensure those actions can be done safely. Looking at the initial state, I can see what I'm dealing with. Then I can make sure the rock and soil samples have what is required to pass the test.
           
           However, here's the snag. The list of allowed actions is incredibly limited: `move` and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` are in the list. This is a significant issue.  The instructions explicitly state that any action not in this list is off-limits. I cannot use any action to take an image and send it, nor sample any rocks. The effect of doing that won't happen.
           
           Given this restriction, I've concluded that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is *unachievable* within the constraints.  The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, essential for satisfying the goal, are only achievable through actions that are *not* permitted.  I need to explain this clearly: the robot *cannot* perform the necessary actions to reach the goal. It needs a tool to take images and analyze rocks, or it will be impossible to reach the target state.
