           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all neatly stacked on surface `v16`.  Here's the plan I've hammered out:
           
           1. **Base Movement:** First, the robot's base (initially at `v3`) needs to move to a configuration, represented by the placeholder `bconf #o3`. The exact location isn't specified, but the `kin` predicates *require* this base configuration for picking and placing, so it's a mandatory first step.
           
           2.  **Pick v8:** The robot arm (`v4`) will grab `v8` from its initial pose `v9`.  The crucial assumption here is that we can safely approach and grasp the object without collisions.
           
           3.  **Place v8:** With `v8` in the robot's grasp, it will be placed onto surface `v16` at a specific location.  The exact pose on `v16` for `v8` is a placeholder, designated as `#o2`, and the plan requires that the location for `v8` is on top of `v16` such that its bottom is exactly at `0.781` along the Z-axis.
           
           4.  **Pick v12:** The arm then goes back and grabs `v12` from its starting position `v13`, again relying on the collision-free assumption.
           
           5.  **Place v12:**  `v12` will then be placed at another, distinct position on `v16`, represented by the same placeholder `#o2`, but it will *now* be defined as a different valid pose on the surface v16, on top of and next to v8, at `Z=0.781`. This is necessary to accommodate for distinct placements on v16 without overlapping geometry.
           
           6.  **Pick v14:**  Now for the final object.  The arm goes to `v14` at pose `v15` and grabs it.
           
           7.  **Place v14:**  Finally,  `v14` will be placed on surface `v16` at yet another new and valid `pose` in relation to the other objects, defined by the placeholder `#o2` again on v16 at Z=0.781.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of the Placement**
           
           Now for the tricky part:  making sure these objects *fit* on `v16`. The plan says the *objects' local* coordinate origin will be at the placement, thus making the bounding box for the object fit the *exact* bounds of the surfaces. I made some inferences.
           
           1.  **Object Dimensions:** From the provided AABB values, I calculated that `v8` is roughly `0.098` meters wide and `0.098` meters high.  `v12` is `0.073` by `0.073` meters, and `v14` is `0.092` by `0.092` meters.
           
           2.  **Surface Space:** The key here is the space on `v16`. It's a square surface of `0.27 x 0.27` centered at (0,0), that will be the global origin.
           
           3.  **Placement Strategy:** Since there are no rotation instructions, I will align the objects with `theta=0`. If I rotate it with some `theta`, this will greatly complicate calculations of positioning with object rotations.
           
           4.  **Spatial Arrangement:** Considering the space on the table, it makes sense to arrange the three objects side by side. It should fit easily within the specified space.
           
           5.  **Placement Coordinates:** This placement assumes that the coordinates are centered in the object, not the origin.
               *   **v8:** I will place its center at `(-0.086, 0.0, 0.781, 0)`.
               *   **v12:** Centered at `(-0.0005, 0.0, 0.781, 0)`.
               *   **v14:** Centered at `(0.082, 0.0, 0.781, 0)`.
           
           **Important Considerations**
           
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** I'm making a critical assumption: that these poses for each object are collision-free.  The plan assumes no unsafe poses and no unsafe trajectories.
           
           *   **Continuous Values:**  The values generated for `#o2` (like `(-0.086, 0.
)
