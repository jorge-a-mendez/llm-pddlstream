           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.512), (0.061, -0.427)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, 0.197), (-0.213, 0.275)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.062, -0.247, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.934, 0.357).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.019, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.117, 0.993).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.664, 0.748).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.112, -0.296), (-0.013, -0.197)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan**
           
           My goal is to move three objects (v8, v12, v14) from their current poses to a single surface (v16), specifically achieving `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. The "on" predicate means the object must be at a certain pose and supported by the surface. The scene is set up so v8, v12, and v14 are on top of `v11`, and all three are also supported by the table, `v16`. Since all the objects are supported, it seems safe to assume I can safely move all three to v16.
           
           Given the constraints, I need to use the robot's arm (v4) to pick each object and place it on v16. I can place all objects at the same symbolic pose, #o2. The problem statement hints that I need to provide different "continuous values" for #o2 for each object, despite sharing a symbolic name, effectively assigning distinct physical placements for each.
           
           The robot starts with an empty hand and is at base configuration v3. The basic actions will be:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I must move to a base configuration represented by #o3 before starting the pick and place cycles.
           2.  **Pick:** For each object, pick it from its initial pose (v9, v13, v15) using the robot's arm v4.
           3.  **Place:** Place each object at the target pose, #o2, on the surface v16.
           
           For the initial pose, I must provide distinct continuous values for the target #o2, considering the physical dimensions and ensuring the poses are within the bounds of the table, `v16`. I have AABB information about both the objects and `v16`. I'm going to position objects in the center, and a bit to the right and left of the table center.
           
           I've determined a series of actions with the costs (place and pick), and assuming an optimized approach, it's:
           
           1.  Move to base conf #o3.
           2.  `pick v8` from v9, then `place v8` onto `v16`.
           3.  `pick v12` from v13, then `place v12` onto `v16`.
           4.  `pick v14` from v15, then `place v14` onto `v16`.
           
           The placements for the objects will be a different instance of the variable #o2:
           
           *   For `v8`: (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           *   For `v12`: (-0.08 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           *   For `v14`: (0.08 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           
           This addresses the "continuous value" prompt and should achieve the desired goal efficiently.
