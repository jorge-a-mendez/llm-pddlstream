User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.512), (0.061, -0.427)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, 0.197), (-0.213, 0.275)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.062, -0.247, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.934, 0.357).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.019, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.117, 0.993).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.664, 0.748).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.112, -0.296), (-0.013, -0.197)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Robot Task**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with devising a plan to move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16 using pick and place actions. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both currently in an empty-handed and at-configuration state. The robot base is at configuration v3.
           
           Here's the situation: each object (v8, v12, and v14) starts at a specific pose (v9, v13, and v15 respectively) and is supported by v11. My ultimate objective is to place each object on the surface v16, and this must be done by the robot's v4 arm. I know I have a `move_base` action, but the instructions clearly state that the base won't move (it stays at v3), so the associated cost will be zero. I'm going to omit the base movement as it is redundant.
           
           The challenge is to figure out the right *sequence* of actions and poses. Since I am given `kin` predicates, I'll assume that the corresponding pick and place actions are available. Each `kin` fact, like `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, essentially encodes a specific "executable" version of pick or place. This gives me a "pre-computed" grasp for each object and the arm trajectory for each object for pick and place. Since I am dealing with distinct objects and placements, I need to plan for each, and the *order* of the pick and place actions will be important.
           
           The plan will look like this: pick each object, and then place it on v16. Simple enough. Since the plan cost per pick and place is 1, and there are three objects, that makes 6 total.
           
           I need to calculate new poses for each object on v16, and the instructions specifically say to assign unique values to each object. Each "#" symbol in `pose` represents a *continuous* variable. I will assign a different, valid location for each object. The goal requires distinct placement, and v16 is large enough to allow that. Since each object has distinct parameters in the *kin* predicates, that should be possible. The trick here will be making sure the new poses won't make the objects collide. The AABBs for the objects are: `((-0.112, -0.296), (-0.013, -0.197))` for v8, `((-0.291, 0.197), (-0.213, 0.275))` for v12, and `((-0.023, -0.512), (0.061, -0.427))` for v14.
           
           I have decided to place the objects in a row on v16, with some spacing so as to avoid overlap.
           
           Here's my calculated plan and the chosen poses:
           
           1.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)** where the plan will need: `atpose(v8, v9)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and the appropriate kin fact.
           
           2.  **(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)** - v8 will be placed at (-0.0855, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) on v16.
           
           3.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)** where the plan will need: `atpose(v12, v13)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and the appropriate kin fact.
           
           4.  **(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)** - v12 will be placed at (0.003, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) on v16.
           
           5.  **(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)** where the plan will need: `atpose(v14, v15)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and the appropriate kin fact.
           
           6.  **(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)** - v14 will be placed at (0.084, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) on v16.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Plan's Impasse**
           
           Okay, so I've hit a wall. The previous plan I was considering is immediately out the window. It involved `pick` and `place` actions, and the problem explicitly states that I can only use actions from the provided list of valid instances.  And that list? It's laughably short: just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, the robot is only allowed to move its base – nothing else.
           
           Now, my objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16) and on(v12, v16) and on(v14, v16)`.  The initial state reveals a bit of information: the objects in question (v8, v12, v14) are each currently *supported* at different poses. To achieve "on," I'd need to manipulate their `atpose` states. The core concept here, and something I could accomplish with an extended action set, is to place these objects onto v16. That requires physically moving them, right? And the current action limitations of the `move_base` action instance don't enable that.
           
           Given that the only permitted action is `move_base`, which is restricted to base movement and has zero impact on the state of the robot's arm or object poses, I've got a fundamental disconnect. My reasoning dictates that the *goal is unreachable*.  It's a classic case of an unsolvable planning problem given the action space constraints.
