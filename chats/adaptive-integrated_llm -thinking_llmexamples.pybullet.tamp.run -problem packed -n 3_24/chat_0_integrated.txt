User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.019, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.117, 0.993).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.512), (0.061, -0.427)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.664, 0.748).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.291, 0.197), (-0.213, 0.275)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.062, -0.247, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.934, 0.357).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.112, -0.296), (-0.013, -0.197)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my plan to get those three objects – v8, v12, and v14 – onto surface v16.** The goal is clear: have each object *on* the surface, and that means they need to be at a specific pose on v16, supported by it.  I'm dealing with a state where these objects are supported by v11, but I need to relocate them. The good news is they're all graspable, the robot has two arms, both empty, and we're starting at base configuration v3.
           
           The strategy is straightforward:  *pick, place, repeat*.  For each object, I'll pick it up from its current location, and then place it on v16. I've got a PDDL-based description with actions such as 'move_base', 'pick', 'place', 'clean', and 'cook', but my gut tells me I won't need to cook or clean here!
           
           Now, the tricky part is those pesky poses.  The problem states that when dealing with placeholder poses (#o2), I must make sure that it's a unique pose for each object on v16. So even though the PDDL says 'pose(v8, #o2)', 'pose(v12, #o2)', and 'pose(v14, #o2)', I'll be defining a different, specific location on v16 for each object. We need to instantiate the poses differently for each object when it's placed.
           
           Here's the detailed plan:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:**  Use arm v4, which is currently empty, from pose v9 and grasp it using a grasp, also starting with '#o1'.  I'll assume that the trajectory '#atraj_pick_v8' is available. I'll need to figure out the exact continuous parameters for '#o1', '#atraj_pick_v8'.
           
           2.  **Place v8:**  With v4 still in hand, I'll place v8 onto v16 at a pose with the continuous parameters, and I'll keep the pose names as "#o2", but the parameter itself, for v8 at least, is unique. This means it must also consider `#atraj_place_v8`.
           
           3.  **Repeat for v12 and v14.**  I'll do the same for the remaining objects: pick them up, and place them on v16 in a specific, unique pose on v16, keeping the overall structure of placeholders for the actions. Each object needs its own distinct place!
           
           I know I will need three values, not just one, for '#o2' that I define: (#o2 v8 v16), (#o2 v12 v16), (#o2 v14 v16). This will ensure no overlapping objects on the surface.
           
           Now, all I need to fill in are the continuous values for those poses and trajectories!  Since the problem tells me these values will come from other algorithms, I'm confident I can make this plan work and get those objects where they need to be.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v14)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, so the user's plan got shot down. Looking at it, I see why. The system's only letting us use `move_base`. That's it. Just `move_base`. And the goal? Well, it's pretty clear: we need to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. Simple enough.
           
           But hold on a second. `move_base` doesn't *do* that. It just moves the robot's base around. It tweaks the `atbconf` and `canmove()` flags, but it has no impact on where objects are located. We need to manipulate the `on` predicate, which is derived from `supported` and `atpose`. Clearly, we need to change the `atpose` of objects v8, v12, and v14 to make them *on* v16.
           
           And how do we change `atpose`? Well, the most obvious approach would be using `pick` and `place` actions. However, those actions aren't allowed here. With just `move_base`, this goal is flat-out *unachievable*. It's a fundamental mismatch between the capabilities we're given and the demands of the problem. Time to tell the user that they're trying to square a circle.
