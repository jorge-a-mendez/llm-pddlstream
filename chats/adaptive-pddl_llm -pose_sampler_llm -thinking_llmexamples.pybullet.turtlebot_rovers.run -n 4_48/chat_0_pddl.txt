           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning for `new-axiom@0()` Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several atomic facts.  The initial state provides some of these (`atconf` and `free` predicates), but others (`receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`) need to be achieved. My approach is to address these unmet conditions systematically.
           
           First, I need to focus on `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20` using mode `v11`. To send these images, the plan involves:
           1.  **Calibration:** Calibrating the camera (`v10`) on rover `v12` to `v17`.
           2.  **Image Capture:** Taking images of `v17` using the calibrated camera.
           3.  **Image Transmission:** Sending the image of `v17` to the lander (`v9`).
           
           This three-step process (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`) will need to be repeated for objectives `v18`, `v19`, and `v20` separately. I assume that the required configurations for `v12` (`v13`) and `v14` (`v15`) are where the rovers will perform these tasks. The configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for rover `v12` are effectively `v13`.
           
           Next, I need to satisfy the `receivedanalysis` predicates for a stone and a soil sample. I select `v4` as the stone (since `type(v4, v2)`) and `v8` as the soil (since `type(v8, v6)`).  Here's how I plan to achieve them:
           1.  **Sample Collection:** `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v4, v16)`
           2.  **Analysis Transmission:** `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           3.  **Store Emptying:** `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (This is crucial, to re-establish `free(v12, v16)`)
           
           I then repeat these three steps for the soil, choosing `v8`.
           
           The combined, complete plan to satisfy all preconditions for `new-axiom@0()` is:
           
           ```
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)
           
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11)
           
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)
           (drop_rock v12 v16)
           
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v8 v16)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)
           (drop_rock v12 v16)
           ```
           
           The key assumptions are that the various configurations and rays for `v12` are equal to the rover's current configuration, which is `v13`, and that there are no blocked actions along the relevant paths. With this plan, I should successfully achieve `new-axiom@0()`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Infeasibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got to completely rethink my approach. The user was right – I completely missed the critical constraint of sticking to only the *provided* action instances. That's a fundamental error.  I've got to work within those boundaries.
           
           So, let's break this down again, with the allowed actions:  `move` actions (for both v12 and v14) and `drop_rock` (for both v12 and v14).  My goal, `new-axiom@0()`, requires a long list of conditions, but the core of them involve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates – meaning I need to take, send images, sample rocks, and send analysis results.
           
           Now, let's see what's true in the initial state. The initial state satisfies the `atconf` and `free` predicates. But crucially, the initial state *does not* satisfy any of the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. They are all initially false.
           
           And now the crux: my allowed actions *cannot* set those predicates to true. The only actions I have are `move` and `drop_rock`, which don't affect anything related to images or analysis. These actions merely reposition rocks, which is irrelevant to the image/analysis requirement.
           
           Looking at the preconditions for `send_image` and `send_analysis`, I see that I'd need `take_image` and `sample_rock` actions, respectively. But these crucial actions are *missing* from the allowed action list. Without them, it's impossible to achieve the goal because they aren't available to trigger the analysis and image receiving preconditions.
           
           Essentially, I'm stuck because I can't generate the necessary data (images and analysis) to fulfill the goal. I can only move and drop rocks, which are irrelevant. So, I must conclude the goal is *unachievable* given the provided allowed action instances. The actions required for the goal simply do not exist in the permissible action set.
