           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to securing images and analyses.  I began by dissecting the `new-axiom@0()` predicate, outlining the conditions I need to make true. Crucially, I identified that several key predicates are initially *false*: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis` for both stone and soil types. These require the actions of `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, respectively.
           
           Next, I looked at the provided list of "valid action instances." This list acts as a constraint, dictating the *only* actions I'm permitted to use. This constraint is critical and, as I read it, absolute.  Unfortunately, the valid actions are strictly limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. No imaging, analysis, or sampling actions are listed.
           
           To achieve my goal, I'd need to use the actions for imaging or analysis. However, as these actions are not available in the given list, I concluded that the goal is currently unreachable. The `move` actions are simple no-ops, and the `drop_rock` action is not possible, as both rovers start free of any rocks. This further solidified the conclusion that no plan could be made to achieve the goal under the given conditions.
