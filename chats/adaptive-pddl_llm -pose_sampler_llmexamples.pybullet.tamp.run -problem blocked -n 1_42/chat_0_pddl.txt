           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is currently at `v9` and supported by `v11`. `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v14`. `v15` is at `v16` and supported by `v11`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty and at their respective arm configurations. The robot's base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be expanded to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The variable `?green` must be one of the objects `v8`, `v12`, or `v15`. Also, `type(?green, v17)` implies that `?green` must be `v12` or `v8`. However, looking at the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, `?green` is `v8`. The initial state has `type(v8, v17)`, which satisfies the `type` condition. So the goal is to have `on(v8, v18)`. `on(v8, v18)` expands to `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. The initial state contains `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. If `atpose(v8, #o2)` can be achieved, the goal is met. However, the current pose of `v8` is `v9` as indicated by `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           
           The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the pose of any object or the robot's grip. Since the goal is about the pose of `v8`, and no pick or place actions are available to move `v8` to `#o2`, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given actions.
           
           The current state `atpose(v8, v9)` and the goal requires `atpose(v8, ?p)` where `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`. We have `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So the goal is `atpose(v8, #o2)`. To change `atpose(v8, v9)` to `atpose(v8, #o2)`, we would need a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. However, no such actions are available in the provided list. The only available action is `move_base`, which does not affect object poses. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
