           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is a square with side length 0.0879, and the surface is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates (the center of the object's bounding box). I need to ensure the object remains entirely within the surface.
           
           Since the object is a square, its bounding box size changes with rotation. To calculate the effective half-width and half-height (hw_eff and hh_eff) of the bounding box, I use the formula: `(s/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where 's' is the side length.
           
           I calculated the hw_eff for a few common angles. When `theta` is 0, pi/2, pi, or 3*pi/2, the AABB extents are just `s/2`. When theta is pi/4, 3pi/4, etc., it's a bit larger.
           
           To ensure the object remains within the surface, x and y must be within specific bounds which depend on the theta, so I can generate placements with different theta and x,y values.
           
           To ensure all 50 placements are distinct, I'll strategically vary theta to change the AABB size, and then I'll generate the x, y positions to create a diverse and broad set of placements.
           
           Since the surface and object are symmetric, some placements may be equivalent, but the goal is to make a set with diverse values and enough coverage.
           
           I'm picking a few angles, `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`, and then, since these define the shape of the object, I'll create a grid of x,y coordinates within the bounds that apply for each angle to generate my set. This allows generating distinct 50 placements as required.
           
           For this set, I'm taking a value of 0.04395 as s/2. I'm choosing a few points, then working out bounds by subtracting hw_eff from the bounds of the surface.
           
           Then I generate the 50 distinct placements and output.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got to place object ID 7 on surface 0, and I need 50 stable placements. I also know where object ID 4 was successfully placed before, and I can use this information to avoid collisions.  My strategy boils down to:
           
           1.  **Understand the Constraints:** Object 7 has a square shape with side length *s\_7*.  I've calculated the half-side, which helps determine the effective dimensions after rotation. Surface 0 is a rectangle with bounds, which limit where I can place the object. The main challenge is avoiding collision with object 4, which is currently centered on surface 0, so any overlap is not possible.
           
           2.  **Angle-Dependent Bounds:** The effective size of object 7 changes with rotation (*theta*).  I need to calculate new bounds on surface 0 based on that rotation. 
           
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I am using AABB collision detection, meaning I compare the bounding boxes of object 7 and 4.  The bounding box of 7 will change with its rotation.  To avoid a collision, the bounding boxes cannot overlap. I have confirmed that for angles like pi/8 or pi/4 the object will, with the AABB collision rule, always result in a collision.
           
           4.  **Limited Options:** The AABB collision rule means I can only place object 7 in very specific spots on the surface that are far from the center of surface 0. My calculations show I only have the option of either zero or pi/2 rotation. This gives me a set of locations for `(x, y)` coordinates to try on the surface.
           
           5.  **Generating Placements:** For `theta = 0` and `pi/2`, I identified a small band of allowable placements to meet the non-collision rule. With such a restricted region, it's difficult to generate distinct and reliable placements. I need at least 50. I’ll generate 25 placements for each theta value, ensuring the x/y values don’t overlap in either axis.
           
           6.  **Edge Cases** I have accounted for a collision range for the outer surface edges with x and y coordinates that have the necessary values.
           
           So, in summary, I'm using the fixed bounding box of object 4 as the basis to place object 7 away from. I hope this generates the requested number of valid placements that avoid collisions.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 new objects (ID 5) on surface 0 while avoiding collisions with two existing objects: ID 4, centered at (0, 0), and ID 7, centered near (0.089, 0.089). Surface 0 is a square region defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The ID 5 object is also a square, with dimensions of about 0.073 units.
           
           The key is to use the geometry of the surface.  Since the object is square, rotations might be beneficial. However, due to the square shape of the objects, rotations other than 0 and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) are likely to create collision issues due to the way the object would intersect with the previous rectangles. So, for simplicity, I’ll place it at rotation theta = 0.0 for now, making the effective area of object 5 as [0.0366, 0.0366]
           
           To find viable locations, I need to account for three considerations:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** The center of the new object must stay within surface 0.
           
           2.  **ID 4 Avoidance:** ID 4 is in the center, and I can't put anything at the center of the surface since it's already occupied.  The formula to avoid collisions is to avoid putting an object in the AABB of the original object, and thus the formula is ` (abs(x) < 0.080597) and (abs(y) < 0.080597) `
           
           3.  **ID 7 Avoidance:** ID 7 is in the upper right. To avoid that overlap is ` x <= 0.007985 ` or ` y <= 0.007985 `
           4.  **Combining:** To place the objects, I must make sure that `X` and `Y` centers are not in the AABB from the other two objects
           
           Based on the calculations, the valid regions can be found, by simply creating a grid and making sure that these conditions are not met.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place a new, rectangular object (ID 6) on Surface 0, which is basically a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I have three existing, fixed objects already in place: ID 4, ID 7, and ID 5. My goal is to find at least 50 *stable* locations for ID 6, but it must not collide with these existing objects. I'll need to carefully consider their positions and dimensions, including rotations, to ensure this.
           
           **Geometric Constraints and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Surface 0 defines the boundaries within which ID 6 must fit. I will create a function to determine if a point belongs to the surface.
           Also I understand that the objects have a rotation of 0.
           
           *   **Surface Containment:** I need to make sure the object remains entirely within the defined surface area. For a rotated object, I'll calculate the "effective" extents (AABB) based on the angle (theta). At theta = 0, the maximum bounds will be `[-0.099, 0.099]` for the center of the object.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:**  This is the tricky part. For each existing object, I need to check if ID 6, placed at different x, y, and theta angles, intersects its AABB. This will involve understanding the bounds for the placement of Object 6, for different ranges of theta. This translates to avoiding collisions in x and y dimensions.
               *   I'll need to define a safe region, by eliminating overlapping areas.
           
           *   ID 4 is centrally located and, at theta=0, blocks a central square region in the surface, as calculated through the AABB.
           *   ID 7 is positioned near the top-right corner. It will block locations near the origin and top-right area of surface 0.
           *   ID 5 is in the bottom-left corner and will block points nearby the x and y axes.
           
           **Placement Strategy and Optimization**
           
           I will consider the following angles:
           
           *   **theta = 0:** I will use most of the space.
           *   **theta = pi/2:** Same as theta 0 in terms of constraints.
           
           I need a systematic approach for finding valid positions. Because ID 6 is essentially a square, rotating it (theta = pi/4) will increase the bounding box size, making collision avoidance *more* difficult because it would cover a larger area in each possible position.
           
           **Refining the Search and Safe Zones**
           
           1.  **Define Blocking Regions:** I'll map out the areas where each existing object prevents the placement of ID 6. By the calculations, a circle that has (0, 0) as its center and 0.079 as its radius is blocked by ID 4. Areas close to (0.09, 0.09) or (-0.09, -0.09) are also blocked.
           
           2.  **Generate Candidate Coordinates:** I'll create a grid of points within the surface bounds, excluding the blocked regions.
           3.  **Test for Collisions:** For each point in the grid, I'll calculate ID 6's AABB and compare it to those of the existing objects.
           4.  **Refine Placement:** I'll identify the safe zones.
           
           I have to carefully evaluate each corner or space that is not occluded by any AABB bounds.
           
           **Generating Valid Placements**
           
           I will start by setting a set of coordinates, such as from `[-0.095, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.095]`.
           I should focus on the Top Left and Bottom Right areas.
           
           **Final Check and Result**
           Then I will check for the collision conditions.
           1. `abs(x) >= 0.079`
           2. `x <= 0.009` or `y <= 0.009`
           3. `x >= -0.022` or `y >= -0.022`
           
           The points will be tested using those 3 conditions.
           
           I will populate an array of valid points, based on those conditions.
           I will pick these locations and then repeat the process with theta = pi/2 and pick different coordinate values.
           This should result in at least 50 valid placements.

           Surface 0 defines the boundaries within which ID 6 must fit. I will create a function to determine if a point belongs to the surface.
           Also I understand that the objects have a rotation of 0.
           
           *   **Surface Containment:** I need to make sure the object remains entirely within the defined surface area. For a rotated object, I'll calculate the "effective" extents (AABB) based on the angle (theta). At theta = 0, the maximum bounds will be `[-0.099, 0.099]` for the center of the object.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:**  This is the tricky part. For each existing object, I need to check if ID 6, placed at different x, y, and theta angles, intersects its AABB. This will involve understanding the bounds for the placement of Object 6, for different ranges of theta. This translates to avoiding collisions in x and y dimensions.
               *   I'll need to define a safe region, by eliminating overlapping areas.
           
           *   ID 4 is centrally located and, at theta=0, blocks a central square region in the surface, as calculated through the AABB.
           *   ID 7 is positioned near the top-right corner. It will block locations near the origin and top-right area of surface 0.
           *   ID 5 is in the bottom-left corner and will block points nearby the x and y axes.
           
           **Placement Strategy and Optimization**
           
           I will consider the following angles:
           
           *   **theta = 0:** I will use most of the space.
           *   **theta = pi/2:** Same as theta 0 in terms of constraints.
           
           I need a systematic approach for finding valid positions. Because ID 6 is essentially a square, rotating it (theta = pi/4) will increase the bounding box size, making collision avoidance *more* difficult because it would cover a larger area in each possible position.
           
           **Refining the Search and Safe Zones**
           
           1.  **Define Blocking Regions:** I'll map out the areas where each existing object prevents the placement of ID 6. By the calculations, a circle that has (0, 0) as its center and 0.079 as its radius is blocked by ID 4. Areas close to (0.09, 0.09) or (-0.09, -0.09) are also blocked.
           
           2.  **Generate Candidate Coordinates:** I'll create a grid of points within the surface bounds, excluding the blocked regions.
           3.  **Test for Collisions:** For each point in the grid, I'll calculate ID 6's AABB and compare it to those of the existing objects.
           4.  **Refine Placement:** I'll identify the safe zones.
           
           I have to carefully evaluate each corner or space that is not occluded by any AABB bounds.
           
           **Generating Valid Placements**
           
           I will start by setting a set of coordinates, such as from `[-0.095, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.095]`.
           I should focus on the Top Left and Bottom Right areas.
           
           **Final Check and Result**
           Then I will check for the collision conditions.
           1. `abs(x) >= 0.079`
           2. `x <= 0.009` or `y <= 0.009`
           3. `x >= -0.022` or `y >= -0.022`
           
           The points will be tested using those 3 conditions.
           
           I will populate an array of valid points, based on those conditions.
           I will pick these locations and then repeat the process with theta = pi/2 and pick different coordinate values.
           This should result in at least 50 valid placements.
