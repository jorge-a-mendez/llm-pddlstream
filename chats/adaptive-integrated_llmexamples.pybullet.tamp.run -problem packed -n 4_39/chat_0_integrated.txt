           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.072, 0.401), (0.143, 0.473)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.251, -0.125, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.985, 0.172).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.067, -0.271, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.015).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.145, 0.548, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.28, 0.96).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.107, 0.437, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.701, 0.713).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.296, -0.17), (-0.207, -0.08)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.103, -0.307), (-0.031, -0.235)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.499), (-0.096, 0.596)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes four graspable objects (v14, v16, v8, v12) that are currently supported by object v11 (a table, given its AABB coordinates). The goal is to place all four objects on object v18. Object v18 is another table-like object (AABB coordinates provided). The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are initially empty. The robot's base is at configuration v3.
           
           The available actions only include a `move_base` action from v3 to v3 with trajectory #o0. This implies that no other actions are available, specifically no `pick` or `place` actions, which are necessary to move the objects. Since the goal requires moving objects, and the available actions do not include any `pick` or `place` actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `on` predicate requires `supported` and `atpose`. Currently, all objects are `supported` on v11, but the goal is to have them `supported` on v18. The initial state already contains facts `supported(vX, #o2, v18)` for all objects vX (v16, v8, v14, v12), indicating potential target poses on v18. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions to change the `atpose` of the objects. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
