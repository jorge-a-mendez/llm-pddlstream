User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.103, -0.307), (-0.031, -0.235)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, 0.499), (-0.096, 0.596)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains four graspable objects: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are currently at poses v9, v13, v15, and v17 respectively, all supported by v11. The goal is to move all four objects onto v18. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are initially handempty. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There are also several continuous parameters that need to be computed, namely poses (represented by #o2) and grasps (represented by #o1), a base trajectory (#o0), a base configuration (#o3) and an arm trajectory (#o4).
           
           The initial state indicates that `kin` relations exist for arm v4 to pick up and place all four objects from their current poses to their goal poses on v18. The base and arm configurations for these `kin` relations are #o3 and #o4 respectively. The only action instance provided is a `move_base` action that moves the robot from v3 to v3 with a trajectory #o0. This implies that the robot does not need to move its base for this task, so #o0 will represent an identity trajectory and #o3 will be equivalent to v3.
           
           The task is to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on the surface v18. All these objects are currently on surface v11. To achieve the goal, the robot needs to pick up each object and place it on v18. Since there's only one arm (v4) for which `kin` actions are provided, the robot will use arm v4 to perform all pick and place operations. Also, since there are no `clean` or `cook` actions in the plan, the object properties like `cleaned` and `cooked` are not relevant for this problem.
           
           Given that the robot doesn't need to move its base, the strategy will be to sequentially pick and place each object. Since the `kin` relations allow placing on #o2, which is supported by v18, we can use #o2 as the target pose for each object. We need to define distinct collision-free poses for each object on v18.
           
           Let's decide on the order of picking and placing. We can go in any order since there are no explicit blocking objects in the initial state. Let's pick and place v8, then v12, then v14, and finally v16.
           
           For each object, we will execute the following sequence of actions:
           1. `pick(v4, <object>, <current_pose>, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Pick the object from its current pose.
           2. `place(v4, <object>, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: Place the object on #o2, which is supported by v18. Note that since we're using the same continuous parameter for the target pose, we will need to specify different x, y, z, theta values for each object in the --Poses-- section.
           
           Since all kinematically feasible pick and place operations involve the robot's base at configuration #o3 and arm at trajectory #o4, we can assume that the `kin` relations provided are all valid and that the specific continuous values for the arm trajectory #o4 will be computed by a lower-level planner. Similarly, the grasp #o1 will be computed.
           
           For the poses on v18, we need to choose coordinates such that the objects are placed stably and are collision-free with each other. Since v18 has AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), we can place them as follows:
           - v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v12: (0.0, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v14: (0.0, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)
           - v16: (0.07, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           This plan ensures all preconditions are met and the goal is achieved. The `move_base` action is included at the beginning of the plan to satisfy the `canmove()` effect, which is negated by `move_base` and set back to `canmove()` by `pick` and `place`. Although the robot doesn't actually move, the `move_base` action is provided and ensures the `canmove()` state for the following pick actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only valid action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow for picking up or placing objects. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving objects onto v18 using only the allowed actions. The goal requires `pick` and `place` actions, which are not available in the provided list of valid action instances.
