           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular, with `size_x = 0.07` and `size_y = 0.07`. I need to find 50 stable placements for the object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface. The object can be rotated.
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           
           Let's denote the object's dimensions as `w = 0.07` and `h = 0.07`.
           
           When the object is placed without rotation (`theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2`), its effective width and height are `w` and `h`.
           When the object is rotated by `theta`, its effective bounding box dimensions are:
           `effective_w = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|`
           `effective_h = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|`
           
           Since `w = h = 0.07`, the effective dimensions are always `0.07 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`. The maximum value for `|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|` is `sqrt(2)` when `theta = pi/4 + k*pi/2`. So the maximum effective dimension is `0.07 * sqrt(2) approx 0.09899`. The minimum effective dimension is `0.07` when `theta` is a multiple of `pi/2`.
           
           For this specific object, since `w = h`, the effective bounding box is a square with side length `s = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This is incorrect. For a square object, the bounding box when rotated by an angle `theta` has side length `max(w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|, w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|)`. Since `w=h=s_obj`, the rotated bounding box is a square with side length `s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. However, this is also not correct. The side length of the bounding box of a square of side `s_obj` rotated by `theta` is `s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` if `theta` is in `[0, pi/2]`. More generally, the side length is `s_obj * max(abs(cos(theta)), abs(sin(theta))) + s_obj * min(abs(cos(theta)), abs(sin(theta)))`. This is only if it is aligned.
           
           The correct bounding box for a square of side `s_obj` rotated by `theta` is a square with side length `s_obj * (cos(theta) + sin(theta))` for `theta in [0, pi/2]`.
           A simpler approach for a square object is to just consider its extent. The largest extent of the object when rotated is `sqrt(w^2 + h^2) = sqrt(0.07^2 + 0.07^2) = 0.07 * sqrt(2) approx 0.09899`. This is the diagonal length. However, the bounding box of a rotated square object will always have side lengths between `w` and `sqrt(2)*w`. More precisely, for a square object of side `s_obj`, its effective width `effective_w` and effective height `effective_h` (which are equal for a square) are `s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` when the angle is `theta` from the axis. This is still incorrect for the bounding box.
           
           Let's assume the given `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of the object's AABB when `theta = 0`.
           When `theta = 0`, `effective_w = 0.07`, `effective_h = 0.07`.
           The surface has `min_x = 4.2`, `max_x = 4.8`, `min_y = -0.6`, `max_y = 0.0`.
           Surface width = `4.8 - 4.2 = 0.6`.
           Surface height = `0.0 - (-0.6) = 0.6`.
           
           The object is very small compared to the surface. Many placements are possible.
           Let's use `effective_w` and `effective_h` to represent the dimensions of the object's AABB for a given rotation `theta`.
           For a square object of side `s`, when rotated by `theta`, the dimensions of its AABB are:
           `bbox_width = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           `bbox_height = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           This would mean `bbox_width = bbox_height` always. Let's verify this.
           If a square of side `s_obj` is rotated, its bounding box is a square with side `s_obj * (cos(theta) + sin(theta))` for `theta` in `[0, pi/2]`.
           No, this is still not right.
           The dimensions of the AABB of a rotated rectangle `(w, h)` are:
           `effective_width = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))`
           `effective_height = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Since `w = h = 0.07`, then `effective_width = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` and `effective_height = 0.07 * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))`. So for a square, `effective_width = effective_height` for any rotation.
           Let `s_obj = 0.07`. Then `effective_dim = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           The maximum value of `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` is `sqrt(2)` (at `theta = pi/4`).
           The minimum value is `1` (at `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`).
           So the effective dimension varies between `0.07` and `0.07 * sqrt(2) approx 0.09899`.
           
           Let's pick a few rotations:
           1. `theta = 0`: `effective_dim = 0.07`.
           2. `theta = pi/4`: `effective_dim = 0.07 * (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) = 0.07 * (2/sqrt(2)) = 0.07 * sqrt(2) approx 0.09899`.
           3. `theta = pi/2`: `effective_dim = 0.07`.
           
           We need to place the center of the object `(x, y)` such that:
           `min_x + effective_dim / 2 <= x <= max_x - effective_dim / 2`
           `min_y + effective_dim / 2 <= y <= max_y - effective_dim / 2`
           
           Let's generate placements with `theta = 0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, `3pi/4`.
           For `theta = 0` or `pi/2` or `pi` or `3pi/2`: `effective_dim = 0.07`.
           `x_range = [4.2 + 0.07/2, 4.8 - 0.07/2] = [4.235, 4.765]`
           `y_range = [-0.6 + 0.07/2, 0.0 - 0.07/2] = [-0.565, -0.035]`
           
           For `theta = pi/4` or `3pi/4`: `effective_dim = 0.07 * sqrt(2) approx 0.09899`.
           `x_range = [4.2 + 0.09899/2, 4.8 - 0.09899/2] = [4.249495, 4.750505]`
           `y_range = [-0.6 + 0.09899/2, 0.0 - 0.09899/2] = [-0.550505, -0.049495]`
           
           I will try to distribute placements by varying `theta` and `x`, `y` coordinates.
           The surface is `0.6` by `0.6`. The object (max extent) is `0.09899` by `0.09899`.
           There's plenty of space.
           I'll try to pick a set of `theta` values and then for each `theta`, pick diverse `(x, y)` values.
           
           Let's use `theta = 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, 5pi/8, 3pi/4, 7pi/8`.
           This will give 8 different effective dimensions for the bounding box.
           For each `theta`, `effective_dim = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           Then the valid `x` range is `[4.2 + effective_dim/2, 4.8 - effective_dim/2]` and `y` range is `[-0.6 + effective_dim/2, 0.0 - effective_dim/2]`.
           
           Let's try to evenly space the `x` and `y` values.
           Since I need 50 placements, I can do 6 different rotations (0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 5pi/6) and for each rotation, I'll pick 8 or 9 distinct (x, y) coordinates.
           
           Let's calculate the bounding box sizes for different rotations.
           `s_obj = 0.07`
           `theta = 0`: `eff_d = 0.07 * (1+0) = 0.07`. `x_min = 4.235, x_max = 4.765`, `y_min = -0.565, y_max = -0.035`.
           `theta = pi/8`: `cos(pi/8) approx 0.9238`, `sin(pi/8) approx 0.3826`. `eff_d = 0.07 * (0.9238 + 0.3826) = 0.07 * 1.3064 = 0.091448`. `x_min = 4.2457, x_max = 4.7543`, `y_min = -0.5543, y_max = -0.0457`.
           `theta = pi/4`: `cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 1/sqrt(2) approx 0.7071`. `eff_d = 0.07 * (0.7071 + 0.7071) = 0.07 * 1.4142 = 0.098994`. `x_min = 4.2495, x_max = 4.7505`, `y_min = -0.5505, y_max = -0.0495`.
           `theta = 3pi/8`: `cos(3pi/8) approx 0.3826`, `sin(3pi/8) approx 0.9238`. `eff_d = 0.07 * (0.3826 + 0.9238) = 0.07 * 1.3064 = 0.091448`. `x_min = 4.2457, x_max = 4.7543`, `y_min = -0.5543, y_max = -0.0457`.
           `theta = pi/2`: `eff_d = 0.07`. `x_min = 4.235, x_max = 4.765`, `y_min = -0.565, y_max = -0.035`.
           The range of valid `x` and `y` coordinates will shrink as `effective_dim` increases.
           
           I will generate placements for different `theta` values, ranging from `0` to `pi`. Due to symmetry, `theta` from `0` to `pi/2` covers all unique effective bounding box sizes for a square. However, the object itself might look different when rotated, so using `theta` up to `pi` gives more unique object orientations.
           
           Let's pick 5 different theta values: `0`, `pi/4`, `pi/2`, `3pi/4`, `pi`.
           For `theta = 0`, `eff_d = 0.07`. `x_range = [4.235, 4.765]`, `y_range = [-0.565, -0.035]`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, `eff_d = 0.098994`. `x_range = [4.2495, 4.7505]`, `y_range = [-0.5505, -0.0495]`.
           For `theta = pi/2`, `eff_d = 0.07`. `x_range = [4.235, 4.765]`, `y_range = [-0.565, -0.035]`.
           For `theta = 3pi/4`, `eff_d = 0.098994`. `x_range = [4.2495, 4.7505]`, `y_range = [-0.5505, -0.0495]`.
           For `theta = pi`, `eff_d = 0.07`. `x_range = [4.235, 4.765]`, `y_range = [-0.565, -0.035]`.
           
           I'll select 10 `(x,y)` points for each `theta`.
           For `theta = 0`, `pi/2`, `pi`: (wider range)
           Let's use `x_coords = [4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65]`
           Let's use `y_coords = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15]`
           This gives 25 points. I need 50. So 10 points per `theta` is good.
           
           Let's use `x_coords = [4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` (6 points)
           Let's use `y_coords = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]` (6 points)
           This gives 36 combinations.
           For `theta = 0`, I can pick 10 combinations.
           For `theta = pi/4`, I can pick 10 combinations. (using the smaller range)
           For `theta = pi/2`, I can pick 10 combinations.
           For `theta = 3pi/4`, I can pick 10 combinations.
           For `theta = pi`, I can pick 10 combinations.
           This gives 50 combinations.
           
           Let's make sure the chosen `x` and `y` coordinates are within the valid range for each `effective_dim`.
           
           For `theta = 0, pi/2, pi` (`eff_d = 0.07`): `x_range = [4.235, 4.765]`, `y_range = [-0.565, -0.035]`.
           My chosen `x_coords = [4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` are all within `[4.235, 4.765]`.
           My chosen `y_coords = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]` are all within `[-0.565, -0.035]`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4` (`eff_d = 0.098994`): `x_range = [4.2495, 4.7505]`, `y_range = [-0.5505, -0.0495]`.
           My chosen `x_coords` are:
           `4.25` is within `[4.2495, 4.7505]`.
           `4.35`, `4.45`, `4.55`, `4.65` are within `[4.2495, 4.7505]`.
           `4.70` is within `[4.2495, 4.7505]`.
           My chosen `y_coords` are:
           `-0.55` is within `[-0.5505, -0.0495]`.
           `-0.45`, `-0.35`, `-0.25`, `-0.15` are within `[-0.5505, -0.0495]`.
           `-0.05` is within `[-0.5505, -0.0495]`.
           
           So all the selected coordinates will work for all selected rotations.
           I will generate 10 placements for `theta = 0`, then `pi/4`, `pi/2`, `3pi/4`, `pi`.
           This ensures a good spread across the surface and various orientations.
           I will iterate through the `x_coords` and `y_coords` to create unique pairs.
           For 10 pairs, I can take `(x_coords[i], y_coords[i])` for `i = 0..5` and then `(x_coords[i+1], y_coords[i])` for `i = 0..3`. This gives 6+4=10.
           Or simpler: 5 `x` values, 2 `y` values. Or 2 `x` values, 5 `y` values.
           
           Let's create a more systematic set of points.
           `x_grid = [4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]`
           `y_grid = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]`
           
           I will use `(x_grid[i], y_grid[j])` combinations.
           For `theta = 0`, I'll use `(x_grid[0], y_grid[0..4])` and `(x_grid[1], y_grid[0..4])`. (5+5 = 10 placements).
           For `theta = pi/4`, I'll use `(x_grid[2], y_grid[0..4])` and `(x_grid[3], y_grid[0..4])`. (5+5 = 10 placements).
           For `theta = pi/2`, I'll use `(x_grid[4], y_grid[0..4])` and `(x_grid[5], y_grid[0..4])`. (5+5 = 10 placements).
           For `theta = 3pi/4`, I'll use `(x_grid[0], y_grid[0..4])` and `(x_grid[1], y_grid[0..4])` (again, reusing the coordinates).
           For `theta = pi`, I'll use `(x_grid[2], y_grid[0..4])` and `(x_grid[3], y_grid[0..4])` (again, reusing the coordinates).
           This will give 50 distinct (surf_idx, theta, x, y) combinations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular, with `size_x = 0.09196` and `size_y = 0.09196`. This is a square object. I need to find 50 stable placements for the object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface. The object can be rotated. I also need to consider the previously placed object (ID 5) and avoid collisions with it.
           
           The previous successful placements for object ID 5 were all with `theta = 0` and `x` values of `4.25` and `4.35`, and various `y` values. This suggests there might be an obstacle preventing placements at other `x` coordinates or `theta` values, or the system only validated a subset of the provided placements. Since I'm not explicitly told about obstacles, I will continue to assume the surface is clear, but keep in mind that other areas *might* be blocked. However, since the prompt states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of", and I haven't received *failures* for the other placements, I should prioritize diversity.
           
           Let's denote the object's dimensions as `s_obj = 0.09196`.
           
           When the object is rotated by `theta`, its effective bounding box dimensions are:
           `effective_dim = s_obj * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Surface width = `0.6`. Surface height = `0.6`.
           
           Let's calculate the effective dimensions for some `theta` values for this new object (ID 10):
           `s_obj = 0.09196`
           1. `theta = 0`: `effective_dim = 0.09196`.
           2. `theta = pi/4`: `effective_dim = 0.09196 * sqrt(2) approx 0.13005`.
           3. `theta = pi/2`: `effective_dim = 0.09196`.
           
           Now, let's calculate the valid ranges for `x` and `y` for object ID 10:
           
           For `theta = 0` or `pi/2` or `pi` or `3pi/2`: `effective_dim = 0.09196`.
           `x_range = [4.2 + 0.09196/2, 4.8 - 0.09196/2] = [4.24598, 4.75402]`
           `y_range = [-0.6 + 0.09196/2, 0.0 - 0.09196/2] = [-0.55402, -0.04598]`
           
           For `theta = pi/4` or `3pi/4`: `effective_dim = 0.13005`.
           `x_range = [4.2 + 0.13005/2, 4.8 - 0.13005/2] = [4.265025, 4.734975]`
           `y_range = [-0.6 + 0.13005/2, 0.0 - 0.13005/2] = [-0.534975, -0.065025]`
           
           The previously placed object (ID 5) has `size_x = 0.07`, `size_y = 0.07`.
           The successful placements for ID 5 were:
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.55)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.45)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.35)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.25)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.15)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.55)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.45)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.35)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.25)`
           `ID 5: (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.15)`
           
           For ID 5 with `theta = 0`, its effective dimensions are `0.07`.
           The bounding box for an object at `(x,y)` with dimensions `(w,h)` is `(x - w/2, y - h/2)` to `(x + w/2, y + h/2)`.
           For ID 5 at `(4.25, -0.55)`: `(4.25 - 0.035, -0.55 - 0.035)` to `(4.25 + 0.035, -0.55 + 0.035)`
           `=(4.215, -0.585)` to `(4.285, -0.515)`
           
           For ID 5 at `(4.35, -0.55)`: `(4.35 - 0.035, -0.55 - 0.035)` to `(4.35 + 0.035, -0.55 + 0.035)`
           `=(4.315, -0.585)` to `(4.385, -0.515)`
           
           We need to avoid these regions for the new object ID 10.
           The previous placements occupied `x` ranges around `4.215` to `4.285` and `4.315` to `4.385`.
           The total width occupied by the two columns of objects is `(4.385 - 4.215) = 0.17`.
           
           I will try to place object ID 10 in the available space. The `x_range` for ID 10 is `[4.24598, 4.75402]` for `theta=0`.
           The `x` coordinates `4.25` and `4.35` are currently occupied by object 5.
           I should try to place object 10 at `x` coordinates where object 5 is not, e.g., `4.45`, `4.55`, `4.65`, `4.70`.
           The object 5 occupies the `x` ranges `[4.215, 4.285]` and `[4.315, 4.385]`.
           The new object ID 10 has an effective width of `0.09196` (for `theta=0`).
           If I place ID 10 with center `x = 4.25`, its range would be `[4.25 - 0.09196/2, 4.25 + 0.09196/2] = [4.20402, 4.29598]`. This would collide with object 5 at `x=4.25`.
           If I place ID 10 with center `x = 4.35`, its range would be `[4.30402, 4.39598]`. This would collide with object 5 at `x=4.35`.
           
           So I need to choose `x` values that avoid `[4.20402, 4.29598]` and `[4.30402, 4.39598]`.
           The object 5 is effectively a rectangle from `4.215` to `4.385` in x, and from `-0.585` to `-0.115` in y.
           The available `x` space for object 10 is:
           `[4.24598, 4.75402]` for `theta=0`.
           Let's try to place it starting from `x = 4.45`.
           If `x = 4.45`, range `[4.45 - 0.09196/2, 4.45 + 0.09196/2] = [4.40402, 4.49598]`. This does not collide with object 5.
           If `x = 4.55`, range `[4.50402, 4.59598]`. No collision.
           If `x = 4.65`, range `[4.60402, 4.69598]`. No collision.
           If `x = 4.70`, range `[4.65402, 4.74598]`. No collision.
           
           I will use `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` and `y_coords = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]`.
           These `y_coords` are mostly outside the `y` range of object 5, which goes from `-0.585` to `-0.115`.
           A `y` coord of `-0.05` for object 10 (`eff_d = 0.09196`) would mean `[-0.05 - 0.04598, -0.05 + 0.04598] = [-0.09598, -0.00402]`. This is completely outside the y-range of object 5.
           A `y` coord of `-0.15` for object 10 (`eff_d = 0.09196`) would mean `[-0.15 - 0.04598, -0.15 + 0.04598] = [-0.19598, -0.10402]`. This overlaps with the y-range of object 5 (`-0.115` to `-0.035`). Specifically, `[-0.19598, -0.10402]` and `[-0.585, -0.115]`. There is no overlap here.
           
           So the `y` coordinates I chose (`-0.55`, `-0.45`, `-0.35`, `-0.25`, `-0.15`, `-0.05`) for object ID 5 did not cover the full available space in the previous request.
           The previous placements for object 5 were `y = -0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15`.
           The bounding boxes for object 5 for these y-coords are:
           `y=-0.55`: `[-0.585, -0.515]`
           `y=-0.45`: `[-0.485, -0.415]`
           `y=-0.35`: `[-0.385, -0.315]`
           `y=-0.25`: `[-0.285, -0.215]`
           `y=-0.15`: `[-0.185, -0.115]`
           
           So, for object ID 10 with `eff_d = 0.09196` (meaning `y_extent = 0.09196/2 = 0.04598`).
           If I choose `y = -0.05`, its range is `[-0.09598, -0.00402]`. This does not collide with object 5.
           If I choose `y = -0.15`, its range is `[-0.19598, -0.10402]`. This does not collide with object 5.
           If I choose `y = -0.25`, its range is `[-0.29598, -0.20402]`. This collides with `[-0.285, -0.215]` from object 5.
           
           So I need to be careful with `y` coordinates.
           A better strategy is to simply fill the surface, avoiding the known occupied areas.
           The occupied areas by object 5 are:
           For `x = 4.25`: `[4.215, 4.285]` x `[-0.585, -0.515]`, `[-0.485, -0.415]`, `[-0.385, -0.315]`, `[-0.285, -0.215]`, `[-0.185, -0.115]`.
           For `x = 4.35`: `[4.315, 4.385]` x `[-0.585, -0.515]`, `[-0.485, -0.415]`, `[-0.385, -0.315]`, `[-0.285, -0.215]`, `[-0.185, -0.115]`.
           
           Let's stick to `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` which are clear of previous object 5.
           For these `x_coords`, all `y_coords` in `[-0.55402, -0.04598]` for `theta=0` or `pi/2` or `pi` should be valid.
           And all `y_coords` in `[-0.534975, -0.065025]` for `theta=pi/4` or `3pi/4` should be valid.
           I will use the full `y_coords` list `[-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]`.
           All these `y` coordinates for object 10 will avoid object 5 because they are placed at different `x` columns, which means the `x` bounding boxes do not overlap.
           
           I'll proceed with the same general strategy as before, distributing `theta` values.
           `theta = 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi`.
           For each `theta`, I need 10 placements.
           I'll use `x_grid = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` and `y_grid = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]`.
           I will make sure to select `x` values that are clear of the previously placed objects.
           Since object 5 was placed only at `x=4.25` and `x=4.35`, the `x_grid` values I'm using `[4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` are all clear.
           
           Let's generate the 50 placements.
           For `theta = 0`, `eff_d = 0.09196`. `x_range = [4.24598, 4.75402]`, `y_range = [-0.55402, -0.04598]`.
           My selected `x` and `y` values `x_grid = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` and `y_grid = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]` are all within these bounds.
           For `theta = pi/4`, `eff_d = 0.13005`. `x_range = [4.265025, 4.734975]`, `y_range = [-0.534975, -0.065025]`.
           `x_grid`: `4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70` are within `[4.265025, 4.734975]`.
           `y_grid`: `[-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]`.
           `-0.55` is outside `[-0.534975, -0.065025]`. It's too low.
           `-0.05` is outside `[-0.534975, -0.065025]`. It's too high.
           So for `theta = pi/4` and `3pi/4`, I must adjust my `y_grid`.
           Let's use a dynamic `y_grid` based on `eff_d`.
           
           For `theta = 0, pi/2, pi` (effective_dim = 0.09196):
           `x_start = 4.2 + 0.09196/2 = 4.24598`
           `x_end = 4.8 - 0.09196/2 = 4.75402`
           `y_start = -0.6 + 0.09196/2 = -0.55402`
           `y_end = 0.0 - 0.09196/2 = -0.04598`
           
           `x_coords_narrow = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.70]` (all valid within `[4.24598, 4.75402]`)
           `y_coords_narrow = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]` (all valid within `[-0.55402, -0.04598]`)
           
           For `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4` (effective_dim = 0.13005):
           `x_start_wide = 4.2 + 0.13005/2 = 4.265025`
           `x_end_wide = 4.8 - 0.13005/2 = 4.734975`
           `y_start_wide = -0.6 + 0.13005/2 = -0.534975`
           `y_end_wide = 0.0 - 0.13005/2 = -0.065025`
           
           `x_coords_wide = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65]` (all valid within `[4.265025, 4.734975]`. `4.70` is still valid here, but it's close to the boundary. Let's make sure `4.70 - 0.13005/2 = 4.70 - 0.065025 = 4.634975`, `4.70 + 0.065025 = 4.765025`. The max is `4.734975`. So `4.70` is actually too large. I need to recalculate `x_coords_wide` slightly.
           Let `x_coords_wide = [4.30, 4.40, 4.50, 4.60, 4.70]`. Let's check these.
           `4.30`: `[4.30 - 0.065, 4.30 + 0.065] = [4.235, 4.365]`. This would collide with object 5 if it was placed at `x=4.25` or `x=4.35` for `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2`.
           Object 5 is at `[4.215, 4.285]` and `[4.315, 4.385]`.
           New object 10 at `x=4.30` (eff_d=0.13005) is `[4.235, 4.365]`. This would definitely collide with object 5 at `x=4.25` and `x=4.35`.
           
           So, for object 10, the `x` coordinates should be `x >= 4.385 + 0.13005/2` which is `4.385 + 0.065025 = 4.450025`.
           So `x_coords_wide` should start from `4.45` or `4.5`. Let's use `x_coords_wide = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65]`. These are valid within `[4.265025, 4.734975]`.
           For `y_coords_wide`, let's use `[-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]`. These are within `[-0.534975, -0.065025]`.
           Also for these `y` values, if `x` overlaps with object 5, there would be a collision. Since my selected `x` values `[4.45, 4.55, 4.65]` do not overlap in `x` with object 5, there is no collision.
           
           So, 3 different `x` values for `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4`.
           I need 10 placements per theta.
           Let's use more `theta` values to get 50 placements with enough diversity.
           Let's use 8 `theta` values: `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, 5pi/8, 3pi/4, 7pi/8`.
           This is 8 `theta` values. I need about 6 placements per `theta`.
           `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65]` (3 points)
           `y_coords = [-0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05]` (6 points)
           This gives 18 possible points for `theta=0`.
           `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65]` (3 points)
           `y_coords = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]` (5 points)
           This gives 15 possible points for `theta=pi/4`.
           
           Let's generate the `effective_dim` for all 8 `theta` values:
           `s_obj = 0.09196`
           `theta = 0`: `eff_d = 0.09196`. `x_range = [4.24598, 4.75402]`, `y_range = [-0.55402, -0.04598]`.
           `theta = pi/8`: `cos(pi/8) approx 0.9238`, `sin(pi/8) approx 0.3826`. `eff_d = 0.09196 * (0.9238 + 0.3826) = 0.09196 * 1.3064 = 0.12015`. `x_range = [4.26007, 4.73993]`, `y_range = [-0.53993, -0.06007]`.
           `theta = pi/4`: `eff_d = 0.13005`. `x_range = [4.265025, 4.734975]`, `y_range = [-0.534975, -0.065025]`.
           `theta = 3pi/8`: `eff_d = 0.12015`. `x_range = [4.26007, 4.73993]`, `y_range = [-0.53993, -0.06007]`.
           `theta = pi/2`: `eff_d = 0.09196`. `x_range = [4.24598, 4.75402]`, `y_range = [-0.55402, -0.04598]`.
           `theta = 5pi/8`: `eff_d = 0.12015`. `x_range = [4.26007, 4.73993]`, `y_range = [-0.53993, -0.06007]`.
           `theta = 3pi/4`: `eff_d = 0.13005`. `x_range = [4.265025, 4.734975]`, `y_range = [-0.534975, -0.065025]`.
           `theta = 7pi/8`: `eff_d = 0.12015`. `x_range = [4.26007, 4.73993]`, `y_range = [-0.53993, -0.06007]`.
           
           For all rotations, the minimum `x` value must be at least `4.450025` to avoid collision with object 5.
           So the `x_coords` should all start from `4.45`.
           Let's use `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65]`.
           Let's define `y_coords_general = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]`.
           These `y` values are all valid for all `eff_d` values.
           For example, for `theta=pi/4`, `y_range = [-0.534975, -0.065025]`. My `y_coords_general` are all within this range.
           For `theta=0`, `y_range = [-0.55402, -0.04598]`. My `y_coords_general` are all within this range.
           
           Using `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55, 4.65]` (3 values) and `y_coords = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]` (5 values).
           This gives `3 * 5 = 15` unique `(x, y)` combinations.
           Since I have 8 distinct `theta` values, `15 * 8 = 120` placements, which is more than 50.
           So I can take `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55]` (2 values) and `y_coords = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]` (5 values).
           This gives `2 * 5 = 10` unique `(x, y)` combinations.
           For `theta = 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`. This gives `5 * 10 = 50` placements.
           This set of rotations will give enough diversity and valid placements.
           
           Final check for collision with object 5 for the new object ID 10 placements.
           Object 5 bounding boxes for `theta=0`:
           `x = 4.25`: `[4.215, 4.285]`
           `x = 4.35`: `[4.315, 4.385]`
           The new object ID 10 `x` centers are `4.45` and `4.55`.
           For `effective_dim = 0.09196` (e.g., `theta=0`), ranges are `[4.40402, 4.49598]` and `[4.50402, 4.59598]`. No overlap with ID 5.
           For `effective_dim = 0.13005` (e.g., `theta=pi/4`), ranges are `[4.384975, 4.515025]` and `[4.484975, 4.615025]`.
           `x=4.45` (ID 10): `[4.384975, 4.515025]`. This overlaps with `[4.315, 4.385]` (ID 5 at `x=4.35`). Specifically, the overlap is `[4.315, 4.385]` and `[4.384975, 4.515025]`. No, the overlap range is empty. `max(4.315, 4.384975)` to `min(4.385, 4.515025)`. `max_start = 4.384975`. `min_end = 4.385`. The overlap is `[4.384975, 4.385]`. This is an extremely tiny overlap (0.000025 wide).
           This small overlap could be problematic. I should adjust the x-coordinates for the wider bounding boxes to avoid this.
           The right edge of ID 5 at `x=4.35` is `4.35 + 0.035 = 4.385`.
           The left edge of ID 10 at `x=4.45` with `effective_dim = 0.13005` is `4.45 - 0.13005/2 = 4.45 - 0.065025 = 4.384975`.
           So the left edge of object 10 `x_start = 4.384975` and the right edge of object 5 `x_end = 4.385`.
           These are almost touching but they technically don't collide if my math is right. `x_start` is smaller than `x_end`. So, `max(x_start1, x_start2)` < `min(x_end1, x_end2)`.
           `max(4.315, 4.384975) = 4.384975`. `min(4.385, 4.515025) = 4.385`.
           Since `4.384975 < 4.385`, there is a very small overlap: `[4.384975, 4.385]`. This is a collision.
           
           So I must adjust the `x_coords` for the objects with larger `effective_dim`.
           For `effective_dim = 0.13005`:
           The `x` must be `x_center >= 4.385 + 0.13005/2 = 4.385 + 0.065025 = 4.450025`.
           So, for `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4`, my `x_coords` should be `x >= 4.450025`.
           Let's use `x = 4.46` and `x = 4.56` to be safe.
           These are also within `[4.265025, 4.734975]`.
           
           So for `theta = 0, pi/2`: `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55]` and `y_coords = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]` (10 placements each).
           For `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4`: `x_coords = [4.46, 4.56]` and `y_coords = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]` (10 placements each).
           I need 50, so I need 10 more placements.
           I can use `theta = pi/8` (or `3pi/8`, etc.).
           For `theta = pi/8`, `eff_d = 0.12015`.
           `x_center >= 4.385 + 0.12015/2 = 4.385 + 0.060075 = 4.445075`.
           So for `theta = pi/8`, I can use `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55]` as well.
           This will give `5 * 10 = 50` placements.
           
           Let's use `theta` values: `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`. (5 rotations)
           `pi = 3.141592653589793`
           `pi/8 = 0.39269908169872414`
           `pi/4 = 0.7853981633974483`
           `3pi/8 = 1.1780972450961724`
           `pi/2 = 1.5707963267948966`
           
           For `theta = 0, pi/8, 3pi/8, pi/2`: `x_coords = [4.45, 4.55]`.
           For `theta = pi/4`: `x_coords = [4.46, 4.56]`.
           
           Let `y_coords_for_all_thetas = [-0.50, -0.40, -0.30, -0.20, -0.10]`.
           All these `y` values are fine, as the `y` ranges for all effective dimensions are wide enough and the `x` coordinates are chosen to avoid collision.
           e.g. For `theta = pi/4`, `y_range = [-0.534975, -0.065025]`. My `y_coords` are `[-0.5, -0.4, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1]`, which are all within this range.
           
           Total 50 placements:
           10 placements for `theta = 0` (using `x=4.45, 4.55`)
           10 placements for `theta = pi/8` (using `x=4.45, 4.55`)
           10 placements for `theta = pi/4` (using `x=4.46, 4.56`)
           10 placements for `theta = 3pi/8` (using `x=4.45, 4.55`)
           10 placements for `theta = pi/2` (using `x=4.45, 4.55`)
           This combination seems solid and avoids overlap with ID 5.
