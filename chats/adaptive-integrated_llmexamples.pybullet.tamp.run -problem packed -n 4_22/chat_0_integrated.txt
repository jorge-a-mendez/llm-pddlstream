           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.195, -0.332), (-0.098, -0.234)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.029, 0.408), (0.123, 0.501)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.289, 0.493), (-0.218, 0.564)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.213, 0.174), (-0.116, 0.271)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.147, -0.283, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.308, 0.951).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.076, 0.455, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.227, 0.974).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.254, 0.529, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.712, 0.702).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.164, 0.222, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.879, 0.478).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on the surface v18. Currently, all objects are on surface v11. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are empty. The only available action is `move_base` from configuration v3 to v3 with a trajectory #o0. This implies the robot is already at the correct base configuration and does not need to move. Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions provided in the `action instances` list, it is impossible to pick up or place any objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
