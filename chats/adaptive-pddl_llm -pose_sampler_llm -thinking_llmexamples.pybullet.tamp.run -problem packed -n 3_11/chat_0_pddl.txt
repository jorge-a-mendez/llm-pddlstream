           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process for generating 50 stable placements for the object:**
           
           I need to find a way to place object ID 4 stably on surface 0. The object is almost square (0.071m x 0.071m), and surface 0 is a square region centered at (0, 0) with extents of +/-0.135m in both x and y.
           
           My core strategy will be to place the object at different orientations, then calculate the allowable region for its center so it remains fully within the surface bounds.
           
           I'll start by looking at rotations. Given the object's square-like shape, the *effective* rectangular area (AABB) of the object will be somewhat similar regardless of rotation.  I will calculate the valid x, y center for a few different rotations. I'm going to vary the rotation (`theta`) across 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2 to try different orientations.
           
           For each rotation I calculate the dimensions of the bounding rectangle. Using those dimensions, and the geometry of the available space, I then determine the allowed center coordinates, x and y.
           
           For each rotation, I'll place the object on a systematic grid inside the allowable region. I plan to use a 4x3 grid for all but the last angle, and a 2x1 grid for the last angle, to keep close to the target 50 placements. That will generate a total of 50 placements.
           
           The resulting set of locations will be the output.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable, Non-Colliding Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, I've got the feedback, and it's time to refine the object placement algorithm. I need to strategically find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, ensuring that each placement avoids collisions with the already-placed object (ID: 4) at its current location: `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.09952036488212331, -0.09952036488212334`. Remember, object 4 is at surface 0, rotation 0, with x = -0.0995 and y = -0.0995. I know it takes up a specific space with `size_x_4` and `size_y_4` (around 0.07). The new object (ID: 5) has `size_x_5` and `size_y_5` around 0.09.
           
           First, I need to define the surface. The surface is `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` which means it extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           Object 4 is located in the bottom-left corner of the surface with an AABB of `[-0.135, -0.06404] x [-0.135, -0.06404]`. I need to avoid this space when positioning object 5.
           
           Given it is a square, its rotation does not change the size of its AABB. However, when finding a non-overlapping space, I need to account for this change of position with respect to a rotation. I have to rotate this square in different orientations to find valid spaces within the surface. For a stable placement I am looking at rotations of `0, pi/8, pi/4` to make sure the placements are well distributed.
           
           To get the placements, I'll define a grid of candidate points and make sure each is valid. The `x` coordinate of any placement has to be greater than or equal to `max_x = obj4_max_x + half_curr_sx` or the `y` coordinate has to be greater than or equal to `obj4_max_y + half_curr_sy`. Then I need the first 50 stable placements and will iterate to fill the list.

(Thoughts: **Placing a New Object on a Surface, Avoiding Collisions**
           
           My primary objective is to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for a new object (ID: 6) on surface 0.  This surface is a square region centered at the origin, with dimensions  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I have to take into account the existing placements of two other objects (ID: 4 and ID: 5) and ensure the new object doesn't overlap with them.
           
           **Understanding the Scene:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:**  Defined as the square region `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Object 4:**  This object is a rectangle located in the bottom-left corner of the surface. Its dimensions are `(0.07095927023575338, 0.07095927023575332)` and its center is at `(-0.09952036488212331, -0.09952036488212334)`. It's AABB is  `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.06404072976424662, -0.06404072976424668)]`.
           *   **Object 5:** Another rectangle positioned to the right of object 4, also near the bottom edge.  Its dimensions are `(0.09317447310107596, 0.09317447310107596)`, and its center is at `(-0.010, -0.08841276344946202)`. Its AABB is `[(-0.05658723655053798, -0.135), (0.03658723655053798, -0.04182552689892404)]`.
           *   **New Object (ID 6):** Its dimensions are `(0.08673872522623954, 0.08673872522623952)`.  I'll refer to these dimensions as `sx` and `sy` for brevity.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           The basic strategy is to generate a set of potential placements, and then systematically check each for collisions. The high-level approach is:
           
           1.  **Rotation:** Test a few different rotation angles for object 6: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2.
           2.  **AABB calculation:**  For each rotation angle, compute the dimensions of the rotated object's bounding box (AABB).
           3.  **Valid Center Range:** Determine the x and y ranges for the object's center that keep it inside the surface's boundaries, given its rotated AABB dimensions.
           4.  **Grid Generation:**  Create a grid of potential center coordinates within the allowed x and y ranges.
           5.  **Collision Check:** For each point in the grid, calculate the AABB of object 6 *at that position* and check for intersection with the AABB of objects 4 and 5.
           6.  **Valid Placement Collection:**  If a placement is collision-free, I'll add it to the final list. I'll continue until I have 50.
           
           **Collision Detection:**
           
           To test for collisions, I'm using a standard AABB intersection check. Two AABBs intersect if:
           
           `Ax_min < Bx_max` AND `Ax_max > Bx_min` AND `Ay_min < By_max` AND `Ay_max > By_min`
           
           To simplify the process, I will use helper functions for getting the dimensions of the rotated object, getting the AABB based on center coordinates and for doing collision checks.
           
           **Detailed Calculations:**
           
           I began with  `theta = 0.0` (no rotation). With this rotation, the valid ranges are calculated for the object's center coordinates based on its size, `sx`
