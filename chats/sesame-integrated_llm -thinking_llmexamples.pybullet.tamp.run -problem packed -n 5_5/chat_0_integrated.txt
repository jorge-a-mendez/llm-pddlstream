           Object v21 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).

           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.025, -0.38, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.74, 0.673).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Object Relocation**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial positions, currently supported by v11 and v10, to a new location on object v20. The robot, equipped with two arms, is restricted to using arm v4 for pick-and-place actions as indicated by the available "kin" predicates. The robot begins at base configuration v3, with arm v4 in configuration v5. The objective is for all five objects to be located "on" v20.
           
           Based on the axioms, the condition "on(?o, ?r)" implies that an object must be supported by a pose that is on the target surface, v20, and the object must also be at that pose. This means I need to execute a series of actions that involve picking each object from its starting position and placing it on a designated pose supported by v20. The initial state shows the five objects supported by v11 and v10 at their respective poses. The goal requires all five objects to be supported by v20 at some target pose. Crucially, the initial state *already* contains `supported` facts for each object *and a placeholder pose*,  "#o2", on v20. I will interpret this as the *target pose* where each object should be placed. Therefore, the plan's high-level structure will be:
           
           1.  Pick up each object from its initial pose.
           2.  Place each object at a collision-free location at target pose `#o2` on v20.
           
           Now, let's address the specifics. Objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 have initial poses v9, v13, v15, v17, and v19, respectively. All these objects should be moved to `#o2`.
           
           The robot's base currently is at configuration v3. The *pick* and *place* actions, according to the `kin` predicates, require the base to be at a configuration represented by `#o3`. The initial state provides the actions to move the base between v3 and #o3, meaning the robot can reach the required location. As well, all pick and place actions require `#o1` as a grasp. Trajectories are represented as `#o4`. Crucially, collision checks are handled implicitly, as the given actions are already valid from the information provided.
           
           Based on the AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes), the objects are relatively small. I need to define poses on v20 that do not cause collisions between the objects.
           
           The placement algorithm involves a structured set of placements that uses distinct `#o2` values for each object, even though all target the surface v20. I will generate distinct locations on `v20` for each object to satisfy the requirements for multiple object placement at the target pose.
           
           **Here's the planned sequence:**
           
           1.  **Move the robot base from v3 to #o3.**
           2.  **For v8:** Pick from v9, place at `#o2`.
           3.  **For v12:** Pick from v13, place at `#o2`.
           4.  **For v14:** Pick from v15, place at `#o2`.
           5.  **For v16:** Pick from v17, place at `#o2`.
           6.  **For v18:** Pick from v19, place at `#o2`.
           
           Given that the target is v20 which has dimensions of approximately 0.27m x 0.27m. I have chosen these pose values based on a conservative separation requirement:
           
           (#o2 v8 v20): (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v12 v20): (0.0 0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v14 v20): (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v16 v20): (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v18 v20): (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)
           
           These positions are collision free and will achieve the specified goal, moving each object to target location on v20.
