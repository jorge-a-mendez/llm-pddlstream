           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Plan: A Rover's Journey**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get this new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, to work. Basically, I need to get pictures and analyses back to base. Sounds straightforward, but there are a few twists.  First off, the conditions are already mostly true at the start – `atconf`, `free` are good to go. The challenge is in the *pictures* and *analyses* and making sure they get to the right place.
           
           I’ve got two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both can do the same tasks. `v12` is assigned to grab images, and `v14` will analyze rocks and send those results. The lander, `v9`, is where everything goes. The *main constraints are the limited movement I've been given*, and that I'm only supposed to use actions in my plan if they're given to me. No extra moves!
           
           Here's the plan, and *crucially*, it's built on a major assumption: I am assuming that when a *predicate* tells me to be at a specific *configuration* `#oX` (like `#o3`, `#o0` or `#o5`), it means the robot is in a `pose` at that configuration. It's an implicit move into a *local configuration* to perform an action. This is the only way this plan *can* work given the restrictions on moving rovers.
           
           **First Rover (`v12`, imaging):**
           
           1.  **Calibration:** `v12` will calibrate the camera `v10` using objectives `v17, v18, v19`, each time.
           2.  **Image:** Then, at a series of poses (`#o3_v12_v17`, `#o3_v12_v18`, `#o3_v12_v19`), `v12` takes the pictures of objectives `v17, v18, and v19`.
           3.  **Transmission:** `v12` sends those images to the lander `v9` while located at pose `#o0`.
           
           **Second Rover (`v14`, rock analysis and send):**
           
           1.  **Analyze Stone:** `v14` will sample a stone rock `v3`. It also needs to be in `pose #o5` at this time.
           2.  **Send Analysis:** `v14` will then send this analysis to the lander. The rover will be positioned at `#o0` when this is done.
           3.  **Analysis Soil:** Next, to a soil rock `v5`. Same routine.
           4.  **Send analysis of the sample of the soil:** The position of the rover is at `#o0`
           
           **Important Poses (Configurations):**
           
           *   **`#o3 v12 v17`**: (0.6, 0.0) - Configuration where `v12` can see `v17`
           *   **`#o3 v12 v18`**: (-0.3, 0.5) - Configuration where `v12` can see `v18`
           *   **`#o3 v12 v19`**: (-2.0, 0.5) - Configuration where `v12` can see `v19`
           *   **`#o0`**: (-0.5, -2.0) - `v12` and `v14`'s communication spot for the lander, `v9`
           
           All right, so the rovers will do their assigned tasks in stages. First, imaging. Then, the analysis and sending analysis in the final stages.  I have listed the critical positions where each robot should be positioned. Done! Let's get these results back.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan and told it's not valid. I see what's wrong now: the *allowed* action instances are far more limited than I initially considered. The previous plan included actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, which aren't in the provided list.  This list only contains `move` actions that don't actually change anything, and `drop_rock` actions.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()`. We need to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To get these, we need the actions `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, these actions *are not* permitted. Furthermore, we can only `drop_rock` if the rover storage is full, but the initial state shows both rovers have *free* compartments, meaning their storage is empty, so we cannot `drop_rock` immediately.
           
           The initial state, by the definition of the problem, is the only possible starting point. The actions permitted have no ability to change the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates from false to true. The conditions that we're given, `atconf` and `free`, are already true in the initial state. The `move` actions are no-ops that reassert facts, and `drop_rock` cannot be used.
           
           Given the available and valid actions, the goal is unreachable.
