           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so the goal is `new-axiom@0()`, and I need to come up with a plan to make that true. Seems simple enough... or not.  I've broken it down, and it's basically a checklist of things that need to be in place.  First off, the rovers need to be where they started, so that's easy enough. Now, there are a few things the rovers need to do:  take pictures of specific targets, analyze some rocks, and send the results to the lander. I've been given some assumptions at the start of the plan (atconf).
           
           First, let's talk about the rovers. I've got two, `v12` and `v14`. They both have cameras that can take images with a specific mode (`v11`). Both also have stores. There are also specific rocks and rock types (v2 is stone, v6 is soil) that need to be analyzed.
           
           I see that I need to get images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I also need to get some rocks analyzed: one stone of type `v2` and one soil of type `v6`.  I've decided to analyze `v3` for the stone (type v2) and `v8` for the soil (type v6).
           
           Now, the steps:
           
           *   **For `v12`, the analysis:**
               *   Move to the correct place to sample.
               *   Sample the stone (`v3`), and remember the store is now full.
               *   Move to the communication spot and send the analysis.
               *   Drop the rock, which frees up the rover to take another.
               *   Go back to the correct spot, sample the soil (`v8`).
               *   Go to the communication spot.
               *   Send the analysis.
               *   Drop the rock.
               *   Go back home.
           *   **For `v14`, the imaging:**
               *   Move to the right spot.
               *   Calibrate the camera for the objectives.
               *   Take a picture of `v17`, then calibrate, and take again.
               *   Do the same, taking pictures of both `v18` and `v19`.
               *   Move to the communication spot.
               *   Send the pictures for all the objectives.
               *   Return to the starting point.
           
           So, both are now done. Both are in the correct place, and the photos and analyses have been sent. I need to make sure I am providing the right coordinates for some things, and make sure that no actions are being blocked.
           
           The final checklist is:
           
           *   For imaging, I'll provide an *x* and *y* for `-1.0, 1.8` (`#o3 v14 #o4 v17`), to provide a location and ray for camera imaging.
           *   For the rover comms, I'll provide an *x* and *y* of `-1.0, -1.8` (`#o0 v12 #o1 v9`) for *x* and *y* of the `v12` configuration, and `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14`.
           
           The plan looks like it will work, and all the conditions for the `new-axiom@0()` should now be met.

               *   Move to the correct place to sample.
               *   Sample the stone (`v3`), and remember the store is now full.
               *   Move to the communication spot and send the analysis.
               *   Drop the rock, which frees up the rover to take another.
               *   Go back to the correct spot, sample the soil (`v8`).
               *   Go to the communication spot.
               *   Send the analysis.
               *   Drop the rock.
               *   Go back home.
           *   **For `v14`, the imaging:**
               *   Move to the right spot.
               *   Calibrate the camera for the objectives.
               *   Take a picture of `v17`, then calibrate, and take again.
               *   Do the same, taking pictures of both `v18` and `v19`.
               *   Move to the communication spot.
               *   Send the pictures for all the objectives.
               *   Return to the starting point.
           
           So, both are now done. Both are in the correct place, and the photos and analyses have been sent. I need to make sure I am providing the right coordinates for some things, and make sure that no actions are being blocked.
           
           The final checklist is:
           
           *   For imaging, I'll provide an *x* and *y* for `-1.0, 1.8` (`#o3 v14 #o4 v17`), to provide a location and ray for camera imaging.
           *   For the rover comms, I'll provide an *x* and *y* of `-1.0, -1.8` (`#o0 v12 #o1 v9`) for *x* and *y* of the `v12` configuration, and `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14`.
           
           The plan looks like it will work, and all the conditions for the `new-axiom@0()` should now be met.

(Thoughts: **Revisiting Configurations for a Valid Plan**
           
           Okay, so I need to go back and fix these configuration errors. It looks like the system didn't like some of the positions I suggested earlier. Specifically, the imaging objective (`#o3`) for Rover `v14` and the communication positions (`#o0`) for both rovers are causing problems.
           
           Let's break this down. Rover `v12` is tasked with sampling and analysis. I've got a config (`#o5`) to put it "above" the sampling locations (`v3` and `v8`).  The previous attempts at sampling were with `(1.0, -0.7)` which may be valid and don't need to be specified unless they are used in image or communication, which they aren't. For sending the results of the analysis, `v12` needs a good communication spot, which I call `#o0`, to reach the base station `v9`. I'll want to choose a position, `(0.0, -1.9)` closer to the destination, which is about (1.9 units).
           
           Now, `v14` is our imaging rover. It has a tough job, needing to take pictures of those three objectives. The issue here is the `#o3` configuration, which was hitting an obstacle `v20`. The old value of `(-1.0, 1.8)` was definitely in the wrong spot, right on top of it.  I need to move that significantly. After some back-and-forth, I decided that an appropriate position for `#o3` is `(-0.9, 1.8)`. It avoids `v20` and should allow it to image all the objectives.
           
           For communication with the base, again that `#o0` for `v14` wasn't working. It needs to send those images to `v9` too. I had a position of `(-1.0, -1.75)` which seems like the current position and not really movable. So I will change it to `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           
           Here's the new setup:
           
           *   **`#o3` (imaging for `v14`)**: `(-0.9, 1.8)`
           *   **`#o0` (communication for `v12`)**: `(0.0, -1.9)`
           *   **`#o0` (communication for `v14`)**: `(-1.5, -2.0)`
           
           I'm confident these changes will allow the plan to run smoothly and satisfy all those pesky goal conditions, like getting all the images received and the analysis back at base. My plan should execute and still be valid, since all the tasks are there in the initial state.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem remains to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which means both rovers (`v12`, `v14`) must return to their initial configurations (`v13`, `v15`), their rock stores (`v16`) must be free, images for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` must be received (with mode `v11`), and analysis for a type `v2` rock (`v3`) and a type `v6` rock (`v8`) must be received.
           
           I will continue with the same task allocation:
           *   **Rover `v12`**: Samples and analyzes rocks `v3` and `v8`, then returns to `v13`.
           *   **Rover `v14`**: Takes and sends images for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, then returns to `v15`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the continuous parameters based on the new collision feedback:
           
           1.  **Configuration `#o3` for `v14` (imaging `v17`, `v18`, `v19`)**:
               *   Previous attempt `(-0.9, 1.8)` collided with `v21` (AABB from x=-0.75 to -0.25, y=1.75 to 2.25).
               *   Objectives: `v17` (0.59, 1.95), `v18` (-0.31, 2.17), `v19` (-2.08, 1.84).
               *   To avoid `v21` (which is in the range of `v18`) and be within 2 units of all objectives, I need to shift.
               *   Let's try a point that moves `v14` further from `v21`'s x-range, while keeping `v19` in view.
               *   New attempt: `(-0.1, 1.8)`.
                   *   Distance from `(-0.1, 1.8)` to `v17` (0.59, 1.95): `sqrt((0.59 - (-0.1))^2 + (1.95 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt(0.69^2 + 0.15^2) = 0.706`. (Within 2 units)
                   *   Distance from `(-0.1, 1.8)` to `v18` (-0.31, 2.17): `sqrt((-0.31 - (-0.1))^2 + (2.17 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((-0.21)^2 + 0.37^2) = 0.425`. (Within 2 units)
                   *   Distance from `(-0.1, 1.8)` to `v19` (-2.08, 1.84): `sqrt((-2.08 - (-0.1))^2 + (1.84 - 1.8)^2) = sqrt((-1.98)^2 + 0.04^2) = 1.98`. (Within 2 units)
               This `(-0.1, 1.8)` seems to work for distances and avoids `v21`.
           
           2.  **Configuration `#o0` for `v12` (communicating with `v9`)**:
               *   Previous attempt `(0.0, -1.9)` collided with `v22` (AABB from x=-0.05 to 0.05, y=-2.5 to 2.5). This means `x=0.0` is blocked.
               *   `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). Max communication distance is 4.
               *   New attempt: `(0.5, -2.0)`.
                   *   Distance from `(0.5, -2.0)` to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): `sqrt((-1.9 - 0.5)^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-2.4)^2 + 0^2) = 2.4`. (Within 4 units)
               This `(0.5, -2.0)` avoids `v22` and is within communication range.
           
           3.  **Configuration `#o0` for `v14` (communicating with `v9`)**:
               *   Previous attempt `(-1.5, -2.0)` collided with `v9` (the lander itself, which is not an obstacle, but the rover cannot be *inside* the lander).
               *   `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0).
               *   New attempt: `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This position is close to `v15` but outside `v9`'s bounding box.
                   *   Distance from `(-1.0, -2.0)` to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + 0^2) = 0.9`. (Within 4 units)
               This `(-1.0, -2.0)` should be good.
           
           The plan structure remains the same:
           *   `v12` moves to `#o5` for sampling, samples `v3`, moves to `#o0` to `send_analysis`, `drop_rock`, moves back to `#o5` to sample `v8`, moves to `#o0` to `send_analysis`, `drop_rock`, and returns to `v13`.
           *   `v14` moves to `#o3` for imaging, `calibrate` and `take_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. Then moves to `#o0` to `send_image` for all three, and returns to `v15`.

(Thoughts: **My Revised Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the user wants me to adjust the plan based on the collision data. Right, I've got it. We need to get `v12` back at `v13`, `v14` back at `v15`, have the rovers free, and the images and analyses delivered. I remember, the plan logic is pretty sound, I just need to finetune the rover positions to avoid the collisions they previously faced and still complete their objectives.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Imaging)**
           
           My main focus is avoiding collisions for `v14` while taking the images. Previously `(-0.1, 1.8)` collided with objects. I need to get images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I looked at their approximate positions: `v17` is around (0.59, 1.95), `v18` is near (-0.31, 2.17), and `v19` is around (-2.08, 1.84). The collision data indicates issues near x=0 and -0.75, and between 1.75 and 2.25 on the y-axis.
           
           I'll try setting the configuration for imaging `#o3` to `(-1.0, 2.0)` to avoid collisions and balance distances. Distance to `v17` is `1.59`, to `v18` is `0.71`, and `v19` is `1.09`. Then I checked the collision zones for the selected position `(-1.0, 2.0)`.
           
           That's outside all the collision x ranges and y range. No collision.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Sampling & Analysis)**
           
           `v12` has to sample the rocks and send the analysis. For the `v12` communication position `#o0`, my old position of `(0.5, -2.0)` was unreachable, so I tried `(0.1, -1.9)`. The only concern is avoiding `v22` (x range between -0.05 and 0.05). `0.1` is slightly outside of that range and the position is only `2.002` units away from the lander `v9`.
           
           For `#o0` for `v14`, previously it collided at `(-1.0, -2.0)`. I can use the same logic here to keep `v14` away from the collision zone. My thought is `(-0.9, -1.9)`. That way I avoid `v23` and the communication distance stays within the maximum of 4 units.
           
           **Plan Logic**
           
           The plan logic itself seems fine. It's the robot positions I have to refine, and these seem okay now. I need to make sure `v12` gets rocks, sends the analysis, and gets back to the base, and `v14` does the same with images. The logic flow is simple enough. I will keep checking each step to ensure all goals are achieved. I'm confident that the revised configurations will allow me to meet all constraints: avoiding collisions, staying within the communication ranges, and completing the rover tasks successfully.

           I'll try setting the configuration for imaging `#o3` to `(-1.0, 2.0)` to avoid collisions and balance distances. Distance to `v17` is `1.59`, to `v18` is `0.71`, and `v19` is `1.09`. Then I checked the collision zones for the selected position `(-1.0, 2.0)`.
           
           That's outside all the collision x ranges and y range. No collision.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Sampling & Analysis)**
           
           `v12` has to sample the rocks and send the analysis. For the `v12` communication position `#o0`, my old position of `(0.5, -2.0)` was unreachable, so I tried `(0.1, -1.9)`. The only concern is avoiding `v22` (x range between -0.05 and 0.05). `0.1` is slightly outside of that range and the position is only `2.002` units away from the lander `v9`.
           
           For `#o0` for `v14`, previously it collided at `(-1.0, -2.0)`. I can use the same logic here to keep `v14` away from the collision zone. My thought is `(-0.9, -1.9)`. That way I avoid `v23` and the communication distance stays within the maximum of 4 units.
           
           **Plan Logic**
           
           The plan logic itself seems fine. It's the robot positions I have to refine, and these seem okay now. I need to make sure `v12` gets rocks, sends the analysis, and gets back to the base, and `v14` does the same with images. The logic flow is simple enough. I will keep checking each step to ensure all goals are achieved. I'm confident that the revised configurations will allow me to meet all constraints: avoiding collisions, staying within the communication ranges, and completing the rover tasks successfully.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement: Navigating Obstacles and Reachability Constraints**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan had some issues. My job is to find valid configurations, and I need to make these three specific fixes:
           
           1.  **Reaching the Viewing Point:** The problem is that the rover `v14` couldn't get to `(-1.0, 2.0)` to image those objectives. It told me the rover couldn't reach that spot. I need to make sure the rover can get there, and that location might have been blocked or too far. I went with `(-1.0, 1.9)` as a new spot, aiming to stay within reach and avoid obstacles `v20, v21`. I recalculated distances and confirmed that the objects are in the right position to be imaged at this y-coordinate. I think the key was lowering the `y`-coordinate slightly. I'm hoping that avoids the "not reachable" issue.
           
           2.  **Avoiding a Collision:** Rover `v12` was running into `v22` when it tried to communicate with the lander. So I moved the x-coordinate to be slightly further away. I'm now setting it to `(0.7, -1.9)` which *should* avoid `v22`.
           
           3.  **Another Collision Fix:** Rover `v14` was colliding with `v23`. The current position, `(-0.5, -1.5)`, *should* avoid `v23` and be within the visible range of the lander. The idea is to move further north (higher y) and slightly east (higher x).
           
           All of these new points have also been checked to make sure they're within the necessary distances for communication/imaging. Now, it's a matter of seeing how well these changes fit into the overall plan.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Continuous Configurations for Rover Movements**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new plan to work with, but some of the continuous configurations still aren't quite right. I need to make sure these rovers can do what they need to without crashing into things or being stuck in unreachable spots.
           
           First, let's tackle rover `v14` (imaging). The problem before was it was hitting `v20` when trying to image `v17`. My initial thought was to find an `x` coordinate that puts it *clearly* outside `v20`'s x-range. After playing around with the numbers and balancing distance requirements for imaging, I settled on `(-0.6, 1.9)`. This seems promising; it's outside `v20` and `v21`'s ranges and is also working for imaging.
           
           Next is rover `v12` (communicating). Its earlier plan, `#o0 = (0.7 -1.9)` isn't reachable. I need to get it closer to its target `v9` while staying clear of `v22` and keeping reachability from the starting position `v13`. I figured `(0.9, -1.9)` should work. It's close to `v13`, within the communication range and the x value keeps it out of collision.
           
           Finally, rover `v14` (also communicating) was also having trouble. Its original plan, `#o0 = (-0.5 -1.5)`, was unreachable. The idea is to find a place near `v15` where I can still see `v9`, while avoiding `v23`. Looking at the obstacles' coordinates, I'm thinking I'll try `(-0.7, -1.7)`. This is relatively close to `v15` and I can see that collision is avoided here as well. 
           
           With those fixed, I think the plan for both rovers is sound. It should work because it moves from the initial to the working, and then to the communicative, and ends with the return to initial. Both plans achieve the final goal: getting the data analyzed and sent back. I'm satisfied.
