           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I'm facing a classic planning problem. The objective is clear: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto `v20`.  My immediate thought is to decompose this into pick-and-place actions. The initial state is nicely defined: I know the current supports for the objects, and their poses. I've got a grasp on the `on` predicates based on the `supported` and `atpose` facts.
           
           My expert intuition screams "pick and place," right? But here's the kicker: the *only* action I'm *allowed* to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does absolutely *nothing* relevant to changing the `on` predicates, as it's a self-loop. I checked the preconditions for `pick` and `place` – they require various `kin` facts, grasps, poses, handemptiness, etc. I *could* verify those preconditions, but it's irrelevant, because *no instances* of those actions are in my allowed action list.
           
           Therefore, given *only* the single move_base action provided, this plan is *fundamentally* unsolvable. I can't pick up the objects, I can't put them down, I can't do anything to change the `on` predicate from its initial state to the target goal state. It's a constraint problem, and this constraint makes the goal impossible.
