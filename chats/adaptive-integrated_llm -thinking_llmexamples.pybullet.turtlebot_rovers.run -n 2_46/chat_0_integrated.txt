           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: A Deep Dive into Immobile Rovers**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions.  Initially, several conditions are already true, but the crux of the problem lies in the remaining ones: receiving images of objectives and analyzing samples of rocks and soil.  To accomplish this, I must take images, send them, sample materials, and send the analyses.
           
           My plan involves two rovers, v12 and v14, each with specific configurations, cameras, and store locations. The core of the problem stems from the extremely restricted allowed actions.  The rovers can only perform actions from their initial configuration. The actions permitted are effectively static.
           
           I see that achieving the goal hinges on the rovers' ability to be at *specific* configurations to take photos of objectives. These configurations are not the rovers' starting locations, and they are unreachable based on what I have available.  This means that `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are impossible due to the `atconf` precondition. Given the restricted `move` actions, I cannot meet the precondition of being at the right locations.
           
           Since I cannot take the images or the samples, I cannot receive them, rendering the rest of the process impossible.  Therefore, I conclude that, given these constraints, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It is vital to note that even though I can analyze the problem, the solution space is closed.
