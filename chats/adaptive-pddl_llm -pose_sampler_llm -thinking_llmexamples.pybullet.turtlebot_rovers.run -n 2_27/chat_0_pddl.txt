User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's get this done. My task is to generate 25 unique base positions for a robot, all aiming at a specific target point.** I've got a couple of key constraints: the robot needs to be within a distance of 4 from the target, and it must stay within the overall environment bounds of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].  There's a catch, though – I need to avoid collisions with some fixed obstacles and ensure the robot has a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           **I've been given some important information about the environment.**  There's an outer boundary, and a few internal walls, including a big vertical one at x = 0.  That's going to be a key player. Also, I know that if I send a position and it fails, I need to remember that. If I see the same target point later, I should skip that failed position.
           
           **Here's the plan:**
           
           1.  **Figure out the lay of the land.**  I'm calculating the effective space the robot can move in. I know the target is at *(-0.176, 0.450)*.  I need to keep the robot on the left of the x = 0 pillar.
           2.  **Generate a bunch of possible locations.** The key is to pick spots *around* the target, forming circles (or arcs), at different distances (within the max range).  I want a wide variety of angles, too, so I'm not just picking spots right in front of the target.
           3.  **Collision and visibility checks.** Since I don't have a perfect collision checker, I'll rely on the system's feedback. I'm going to focus on staying clear of the prominent obstacles like the x=0 pillar, but I will receive feedback on collisions and occlusions.  So, I will generate a diverse set of initial candidates, and I'll avoid positions that fail the first time.
           
           **Now, about that big vertical obstacle (the x=0 wall).** Since the target point is on the left side of this wall, I should keep the robot's base to the left, too. I'll make sure to prioritize positions where the *x* coordinate is less than `-0.05` to avoid collisions.
           
           **Here's how I'm handling the logic:**
           
           1.  **I will build candidates by:**
               *   Pick a radius (`r`) that is valid (up to the max range of 4).
               *   Iterate with angles from 80 degrees to 280 degrees, sweeping over the left semicircle.
               *   The formula will be `px = tx + r * cos(angle)`
               *   And `py = ty + r * sin(angle)`
           2.  **I will generate positions based on this idea, using different radii (`r_vals = [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.9]`).** Then, for each radius, I'll go through 15 different angles (spaced out evenly), making sure to skip the angles which are on the right side of the pillar. The final selection from all 105 candidates will be the first 25 within range.
           3.  **My strategy will be to:**
               *   Make sure generated candidate positions do not violate the overall environment boundaries.
               *   Make sure `px <= -0.05` to avoid occlusions.
           4.  **Finally, I'll return the first 25 valid positions.**
           
           **After these steps, I should have a good set of starting locations for the robot, respecting the environment, and providing line of sight.**  I'll be ready for feedback and adjustments as needed!
