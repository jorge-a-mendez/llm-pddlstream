           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.  Currently, they're all on `v11`.  My immediate thought is, "Simple: pick them up, put them down."  Breaking that down logically, for each object `o`, I need to satisfy `on(o, v18)`. This implies, based on my understanding of the axioms, that I need to ensure they are *supported* by `v18` at a valid pose and are at that pose. The initial state tells me there is a pose (#o2) suitable on `v18`.
           
           So, the plan *should* be:
           1.  Pick up each object `o` from `v11`.
           2.  Place each object `o` on `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Then I look at the available actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Obviously, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant here.  `move_base` doesn't change anything about the objects. That leaves `pick` and `place`.  I know these require conditions to be met, like `kin`, `handempty`, etc., but I have the knowledge and tools to deal with those.
           
           Here's the problem. I have to stick to the *valid* action instances I'm given. The list of allowed actions only has: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's it. *No* instances of `pick` or `place` are included.  This is a huge constraint!  The problem statement is clear: if an action isn't listed, I can't use it.
           
           Given that I **cannot** use `pick` or `place`, I am effectively unable to move the objects from `v11` to `v18`.  The robot is stuck. Therefore, considering the constraints, the goal is *unachievable*. I am forced to conclude that, based on the provided actions, this situation is unsolvable.
