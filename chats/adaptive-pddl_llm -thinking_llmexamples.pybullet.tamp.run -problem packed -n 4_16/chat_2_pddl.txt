(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects on a Table**
           
           My goal is to place several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) onto a specific table (`v18`). The fundamental concept is that an object is considered "on" another object (`on(o, r)`) if it's supported by it (`supported(o, p, r)`) and at the appropriate pose (`atpose(o, p)`).  Therefore, for each object, I need to identify a valid pose (`p`) on `v18` that satisfies the `supported` relation and then physically move the object to that pose.
           
           My initial analysis reveals the following:
           
           *   All objects currently reside on a different object (`v11`).
           *   Each object has a designated target pose, which happens to be the same for all objects (`#o2`).
           *   All objects are supported by `v18` at this target pose, based on the provided facts.
           *   The robot arm (`v4`) is currently empty and in a known configuration (`v5`).
           *   The robot base is initially at `v3`.
           
           The core of the plan will involve using the robot arm to pick each object from its initial location and place it onto `v18` at the target pose.  I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions, which each have preconditions that must be met for them to execute successfully.
           
           **The Action Preconditions**
           
           The preconditions for `pick` and `place` are related to the robot's ability to reach and grasp the object, the current state of the robot arm, the robot's base configuration, and the absence of any collisions during the approach or the arm's trajectory. I will need to consider collisions and safe trajectories.
           
           **Current State and Actions**
           
           The objects and their poses are as follows:
           
           -   `v8`: at `v9`, to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`.
           -   `v12`: at `v13`, to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`.
           -   `v14`: at `v15`, to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`.
           -   `v16`: at `v17`, to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Given my initial state, I can construct a plan. The `kin` facts are key as they describe the reachable configurations for each object.  Additionally, I have determined the most efficient plan is to first move the robot base from its initial configuration (`v3`) to the configuration required to move the objects (`#o3`).
           
           **My Plan**
           
           My finalized plan will be:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  Move the robot base from configuration `v3` to configuration `#o3` using a `move_base` action.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop (for each object):**
               a.  `Pick` the object from its current location using the robot arm.
               b.  `Place` the object onto `v18` at the designated pose (`#o2`).
           
           This pick-and-place sequence will be repeated for each object.  This fulfills my goals.
