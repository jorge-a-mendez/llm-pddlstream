           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.08820174139421244, 0.08820174139421244)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions 0.088 x 0.088. This means the object is relatively small compared to the surface, offering many possible stable placements. I will aim for a diverse set of placements, covering different positions and orientations, making sure the object remains within the surface boundaries. Since the object is square, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) will result in the same bounding box, but I will still explore other angles to provide variety.
           
           The surface is defined from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           The object has `size_x = 0.08820174139421244` and `size_y = 0.08820174139421244`.
           To place the object without collision, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surf_lower_x + object_half_x <= x <= surf_upper_x - object_half_x`
           `surf_lower_y + object_half_y <= y <= surf_upper_y - object_half_y`
           
           Given `object_half_x = 0.08820174139421244 / 2 = 0.04410087069710622`
           `object_half_y = 0.08820174139421244 / 2 = 0.04410087069710622`
           
           For surf 0:
           `x` range: `-0.135 + 0.04410087069710622` to `0.135 - 0.04410087069710622`
           `x` range: `-0.09089912930289378` to `0.09089912930289378`
           `y` range: `-0.09089912930289378` to `0.09089912930289378`
           
           I will distribute placements across this valid `x` and `y` range, using various angles.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 5 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 5 is centered on surface 0 with no rotation.
           
           Now I need to place object 4.
           The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           Object 4 is also square, with dimensions 0.0768 x 0.0768.
           
           The surface is defined from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           Object 4 has `size_x = 0.07683753365278562` and `size_y = 0.07683753365278556`.
           
           `object4_half_x = 0.07683753365278562 / 2 = 0.03841876682639281`
           `object4_half_y = 0.07683753365278556 / 2 = 0.03841876682639278`
           
           For surf 0, the maximum extent for object 4's center `(x, y)`:
           `x` range: `-0.135 + 0.03841876682639281` to `0.135 - 0.03841876682639281`
           `x` range: `-0.09658123317360719` to `0.09658123317360719`
           `y` range: `-0.09658123317360719` to `0.09658123317360719`
           
           Additionally, I must avoid collision with object 5, which is placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           Object 5 has `size_x = 0.08820174139421244` and `size_y = 0.08820174139421244`.
           So, object 5 occupies the space from `(-0.0441, -0.0441)` to `(0.0441, 0.0441)`.
           
           Therefore, for object 4, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `abs(x) >= object_5_half_x + object_4_half_x`
           or
           `abs(y) >= object_5_half_y + object_4_half_y`
           
           `0.04410087069710622 + 0.03841876682639281 = 0.08251963752349903`
           
           So, `abs(x) >= 0.08251963752349903` OR `abs(y) >= 0.08251963752349903`.
           
           I will choose placements for object 4 that are outside the central region occupied by object 5, while still within the bounds of surface 0.
           The maximum `x` and `y` for object 4 are `0.09658`. I will pick positions close to the edges of the allowed region to maximize distance from object 5.

           Object 4 occupies the space from `(0.085 - 0.0384, 0.085 - 0.0384)` to `(0.085 + 0.0384, 0.085 + 0.0384)`.
           This is `(0.0466, 0.0466)` to `(0.1234, 0.1234)`.
           
           Now, let's consider the no-collision zones for object 6.
           For object 5: `abs(x_6) >= object5_half_x + object6_half_x` or `abs(y_6) >= object5_half_y + object6_half_y`
           `0.04410087069710622 + 0.04809800734712761 = 0.09219887804423383`
           So, `abs(x_6) >= 0.09219887804423383` or `abs(y_6) >= 0.09219887804423383`.
           However, the maximum allowed `x` and `y` for object 6 is `0.0869`. This means there is no place for object 6 if it needs to be *entirely* outside the central exclusion zone from object 5. This implies object 6 cannot be placed at all if it's axis-aligned.
           
           Wait, I need to re-evaluate the object AABB rotation. The object extents (`size_x`, `size_y`) are for its axis-aligned bounding box *before* rotation. When rotated, its AABB may become larger. However, the problem statement provides `size_x` and `size_y` as "dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)", which typically implies the *final* AABB dimensions at the specified orientation, or that the object itself is axis-aligned. Let's assume the problem means the *initial* AABB, and the rotation will potentially increase the effective AABB. But based on how the problem is usually phrased for stable placements, it's generally about the object's body and its rotation. Given that a square object is being placed and no explicit mention of AABB changes with rotation, I will continue to assume the object's `size_x` and `size_y` apply to the effective dimensions for any rotation. This means for a square object, its dimensions do not change with rotation.
           
           This means my previous calculation that `abs(x_6) >= 0.09219887804423383` or `abs(y_6) >= 0.09219887804423383` is correct.
           However, the *allowed* `x` and `y` range for object 6 is `-0.0869...` to `0.0869...`.
           Since `0.09219887804423383 > 0.08690199265287239`, there is no way for object 6 to be placed without colliding with object 5 *if object 5 is at 0,0 and has its current size*. This seems to be a contradiction or a scenario where placement is impossible.
           
           Let me re-read the problem statement carefully: "The geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This usually means the *maximum* extent of the object when it's rotated. However, in many physics engines, `size_x` and `size_y` refer to the dimensions of the object itself, and then its AABB is calculated based on its rotation. If the object is a square of `0.096196` x `0.096196`, its AABB *when rotated by 45 degrees* would be larger (`sqrt(2)*side`). But if `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of its *current* AABB, then rotation changes those.
           
           Let's assume the provided `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of the square itself. For a square object, `size_x` and `size_y` would typically be equal. The largest possible AABB for a square occurs at 45 degrees. However, in this problem setting, often "extents" refers to the dimensions of the *body itself*, and the AABB is computed by the system. Given that the problem does *not* specify how rotation affects the AABB, I will assume the provided `size_x` and `size_y` are the effective dimensions for the purpose of stable placement *at any orientation* (meaning, the bounding box *of the object itself* is used, not its rotated AABB on the surface, which simplifies things significantly, as the object is basically "a box" of these dimensions). For a square, `size_x` and `size_y` are equal, so it just means its side length.
           
           If `size_x` and `size_y` are the side lengths of the square, then the object's effective half-dimensions are constant for any rotation when considering its extent from its center.
           So my collision calculation `object5_half_x + object6_half_x = 0.09219887804423383` and `max_x_object6 = 0.08690199265287239` still holds. This means object 6 *cannot* be placed if object 5 is at (0,0).
           
           Let me re-evaluate my understanding of "stable placement" and "fully contained". It means the object's entire geometry must be on the surface. For an axis-aligned bounding box calculation, it's `center_x +/- half_x`, etc.
           If I assume that `size_x` and `size_y` are for the *axis-aligned* AABB *at the given orientation*, then a rotated square effectively has a larger AABB. However, this is not explicitly stated, and for squares, often `size_x` and `size_y` are its actual dimensions (side length).
           
           If the object is a square and its `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of its side, then for a rotation of `theta`, the AABB half-widths are `(size_x * cos(theta) + size_y * sin(theta)) / 2` and `(size_x * sin(theta) + size_y * cos(theta)) / 2`. For a square, this simplifies to `side * (cos(theta) + sin(theta)) / 2`. The maximum of this for `theta` between 0 and `pi/2` occurs at `pi/4`, which makes the half-width `side * sqrt(2) / 2`.
           
           Let's use the assumption that `size_x` and `size_y` given are the actual dimensions of the object (side length in case of a square).
           Object 6: `side_6 = 0.096196`. Max half-width with rotation (at 45 degrees) = `0.096196 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06799`.
           Object 5: `side_5 = 0.088201`. Max half-width with rotation (at 45 degrees) = `0.088201 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06236`.
           
           If `theta = 0`:
           Object 6: `half_x = 0.048098`, `half_y = 0.048098`.
           Object 5: `half_x = 0.044100`, `half_y = 0.044100`.
           
           Surface limits for object 6 (`theta=0`): `x` range `[-0.135+0.048098, 0.135-0.048098]` = `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`.
           Collision check for object 6 with object 5 (at (0,0), `theta=0`):
           `abs(x_6) < half_x_5 + half_x_6 = 0.044100 + 0.048098 = 0.092198`.
           `abs(y_6) < half_y_5 + half_y_6 = 0.044100 + 0.048098 = 0.092198`.
           
           So, for object 6 to avoid object 5 (both axis-aligned), it needs `abs(x_6) >= 0.092198` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.092198`.
           However, the maximum allowed position for `x_6` or `y_6` is `0.0869`.
           This means, if both objects are axis-aligned, object 6 *cannot* be placed without colliding with object 5. This is true for any rotation too, as the AABB for a square at any angle will contain its axis-aligned AABB. The most compact configuration is axis-aligned.
           
           This implies there is no stable placement for object 6 on surface 0 without colliding with object 5, *given object 5's current placement*. I must have made a mistake in previous assumptions or my geometric reasoning here.
           
           Let me reconsider the "stable placement" and "fully contained within the bounds of the surface." This usually means the object's *AABB* at the given rotation must be within the surface.
           The problem statement gives `size_x` and `size_y` as "dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This phrasing usually means the *current* AABB dimensions. If so, a rotation changes these.
           But for a square object, `size_x` and `size_y` are equal, and if it's the AABB, it implies `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2`. If I rotate it by `pi/4`, its AABB becomes `side*sqrt(2)` x `side*sqrt(2)`. This would make the constraints even tighter.
           
           Let's assume the simpler case: the given `size_x` and `size_y` are the dimensions of the object itself, and its effective half-widths *for placement on an axis-aligned surface* are always `size_x/2` and `size_y/2`, regardless of `theta`. This is common in simpler systems where the object is represented by its bounding box which is always axis-aligned to the world.
           In this case, my previous collision calculation for object 6 with object 5 still holds:
           `abs(x_6) >= 0.09219887804423383` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.09219887804423383`.
           But the object 6 placement range is `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`. This is indeed impossible.
           
           What if object 4's placement `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)` allows for a gap somewhere else?
           Object 4 is at `(0.085, 0.085)`. `half_x_4 = 0.0384`. Object 4 spans from `(0.085 - 0.0384, 0.085 - 0.0384)` to `(0.085 + 0.0384, 0.085 + 0.0384)`.
           This means `(0.0466, 0.0466)` to `(0.1234, 0.1234)`.
           
           The available region for placing object 6 must avoid:
           1. Object 5: `x` from `-0.0441` to `0.0441`, `y` from `-0.0441` to `0.0441`.
           2. Object 4: `x` from `0.0466` to `0.1234`, `y` from `0.0466` to `0.1234`.
           
           If object 6 is axis-aligned (`theta=0`), its half dimensions are `0.048098`.
           Its center `(x_6, y_6)` must be in `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`.
           
           Let's try to place it in the negative x, negative y quadrant.
           If `x_6 < 0` and `y_6 < 0`.
           Avoid object 5: `x_6 < -0.0441 - 0.048098 = -0.092198` OR `y_6 < -0.0441 - 0.048098 = -0.092198`.
           The allowed range for `x_6` is `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`. This still means there is no place for object 6 without colliding with object 5. This is true for any quadrant.
           
           This is a critical situation. It suggests that my geometric reasoning about the non-collision rule is too strict, or that object 6 is too large to fit alongside object 5.
           Let's consider if the `size_x` and `size_y` from the object extents mean something different. "dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)". This *usually* implies the effective dimensions for collision testing.
           
           Maybe the feedback system is more tolerant than a strict AABB intersection check, or there's a slight tolerance. Or the success feedback means just the specific `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` for ID 5 and `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)` for ID 4 were valid, not that they *must* be there for subsequent placements. The problem says "You may use these as positive examples for future requests". This suggests the *scene state* now includes these objects.
           
           If object 6 truly cannot fit, I must try something else. However, the problem states "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement, or how many valid placements you have already provided, you will always try to find a new placement." This implies I should keep trying.
           
           Could it be that the collision check only applies to the *specific center point and orientation*, and my calculation of `object_half_x` is wrong for a rotated object? For squares, often `size_x` and `size_y` are the side lengths, and AABB changes with rotation.
           If `size_x` and `size_y` refer to the dimensions of the square's body (side length):
           `side_6 = 0.096196`. `side_5 = 0.088201`.
           If `theta_6 = 0`: `half_x_6 = 0.048098`.
           If `theta_5 = 0`: `half_x_5 = 0.044100`.
           Surface `0` limits: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           Placement of Object 5 (ID: 5) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           Placement of Object 4 (ID: 4) at `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)`.
           
           Let's assume the AABB of an object at a given rotation `theta` is `(size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + size_y * abs(sin(theta))) / 2` for `half_x`, and `(size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + size_y * abs(cos(theta))) / 2` for `half_y`.
           Since objects 5 and 4 are placed at `theta=0`, their AABBs are just their `size_x/2` and `size_y/2`.
           Object 5 `half_x = 0.0441`, `half_y = 0.0441`. Extent `[-0.0441, 0.0441]` x `[-0.0441, 0.0441]`.
           Object 4 `half_x = 0.0384`, `half_y = 0.0384`. Extent `[0.085-0.0384, 0.085+0.0384]` x `[0.085-0.0384, 0.085+0.0384]`.
           This is `[0.0466, 0.1234]` x `[0.0466, 0.1234]`.
           
           For Object 6 (`size_x = 0.096196`, `size_y = 0.096196`):
           Let's try `theta_6 = 0`. Then `half_x_6 = 0.048098`, `half_y_6 = 0.048098`.
           Surface limits for `x_6`: `[-0.135+0.048098, 0.135-0.048098]` = `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`.
           Surface limits for `y_6`: `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`.
           
           Collision with object 5: AABB check
           `abs(x_6) < 0.0441 + 0.048098 = 0.092198` AND `abs(y_6) < 0.0441 + 0.048098 = 0.092198`.
           This means if `x_6` is in `(-0.092198, 0.092198)` and `y_6` is in `(-0.092198, 0.092198)`, there's a collision.
           The available range for `x_6` is `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`. This is completely *inside* the collision zone with object 5!
           This means, by strict AABB calculation, object 6 at `theta=0` cannot be placed without colliding with object 5.
           
           What if I rotate object 6 by `pi/4` (45 degrees)?
           `half_x_6_rot = (0.096196 * cos(pi/4) + 0.096196 * sin(pi/4)) / 2 = 0.096196 * (sqrt(2)/2 + sqrt(2)/2) / 2 = 0.096196 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06799`.
           `half_y_6_rot = 0.06799`.
           Now, the surface limits for `x_6`: `[-0.135+0.06799, 0.135-0.06799]` = `[-0.067, 0.067]`.
           Surface limits for `y_6`: `[-0.067, 0.067]`.
           This is even tighter. Collision with object 5:
           `abs(x_6) < 0.0441 + 0.06799 = 0.11209` AND `abs(y_6) < 0.0441 + 0.06799 = 0.11209`.
           The available range `[-0.067, 0.067]` is still fully contained in the collision zone `(-0.11209, 0.11209)`.
           
           This implies there is no way to place object 6 without colliding with object 5.
           This scenario shouldn't happen for a standard problem. Could it be that the previous placements are merely examples, and not strict obstacles? "You may use these as positive examples for future requests" and "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j". This means they *are* obstacles.
           
           Maybe the surfaces are not flat and have "ledges" or something that allows for overlapping AABBs but not actual object collision? No, "The geometry of the surfaces will be described as a list of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs)". This points to a flat plane within those bounds.
           
           I need to find a placement. There must be an interpretation that allows this.
           Is it possible that the objects are not solid, but just outlines? No.
           "stable placement for the object on one of the surfaces. The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface."
           
           What if the collision check is only for the *center* of the objects? No, that's not how objects work.
           The only logical conclusion is that the collision check for objects `i` and `j` is not based on their AABBs, but their actual geometry. For squares, if their rotation is 0, their actual geometry is their AABB.
           
           Could the feedback `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` mean that ID 5 is *not* at `0.0, 0.0`, but at a different `z` height? The problem is 2D, so no `z`.
           
           I will try to place it as far as possible, hoping there is a tolerance I'm missing.
           I will place it at the very edge of the surface, away from object 5 and 4.
           Object 6: `half_x = 0.048098`, `half_y = 0.048098`.
           Max center `x` or `y` on surface is `0.135 - 0.048098 = 0.0869`.
           Let's try to place it at `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           Object 5 at `(0,0)`, object 4 at `(0.085, 0.085)`.
           Object 6 at `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           Object 6 occupies `[0.08 - 0.048098, 0.08 + 0.048098]` x `[-0.08 - 0.048098, -0.08 + 0.048098]`.
           `[0.0319, 0.1281]` x `[-0.1281, -0.0319]`.
           
           Collision with object 5:
           Object 5: `[-0.0441, 0.0441]` x `[-0.0441, 0.0441]`.
           Object 6 AABB does not overlap with Object 5 AABB.
           `0.0319 > -0.0441` (x-overlap)
           `-0.0319 > -0.0441` (y-overlap)
           Oh, there is an overlap in x-axis! `[0.0319, 0.1281]` overlaps `[-0.0441, 0.0441]` in the range `[0.0319, 0.0441]`.
           Similarly for y-axis: `[-0.1281, -0.0319]` does not overlap with `[-0.0441, 0.0441]`.
           So `x_overlap = TRUE`, `y_overlap = FALSE`. Therefore, no collision based on AABB.
           
           This means my previous reasoning `abs(x_6) >= half_x_5 + half_x_6` OR `abs(y_6) >= half_y_5 + half_y_6` is correct for *no collision*.
           And my calculation `half_x_5 + half_x_6 = 0.09219887804423383`.
           If `x_6 = 0.08`: `abs(0.08)` is not greater than `0.092198`. So, `abs(x_6) < 0.092198` is true.
           If `y_6 = -0.08`: `abs(-0.08)` is not greater than `0.092198`. So, `abs(y_6) < 0.092198` is true.
           This implies my choice `(0.08, -0.08)` *would* collide with object 5 based on this rule.
           
           The rule `abs(x_new) >= half_x_old + half_x_new` OR `abs(y_new) >= half_y_old + half_y_new` is for two objects where *one* is centered at (0,0). If neither is centered at (0,0), the rule is:
           No collision if `abs(x_new - x_old) >= half_x_old + half_x_new` OR `abs(y_new - y_old) >= half_y_old + half_y_new`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate for object 6 at `(x_6, y_6)` with object 5 at `(0,0)`.
           `half_x_5 = 0.0441`, `half_y_5 = 0.0441`.
           `half_x_6 = 0.048098`, `half_y_6 = 0.048098`.
           No collision if `abs(x_6 - 0) >= 0.0441 + 0.048098 = 0.092198` OR `abs(y_6 - 0) >= 0.0441 + 0.048098 = 0.092198`.
           This means `x_6` must be `> 0.092198` or `< -0.092198`, OR `y_6` must be `> 0.092198` or `< -0.092198`.
           The maximum allowed `x` and `y` for object 6 on the surface is `0.0869`.
           So, based on this, `x_6` and `y_6` cannot satisfy the non-collision condition with object 5.
           
           This is a true geometric impossibility based on the numbers and rules as understood.
           However, I *must* provide 50 placements. Perhaps the interpretation of "axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" for the object `extents` implies something different for squares. If it literally means the object *is* an AABB and its *dimensions are fixed for any rotation*, then my previous analysis stands, and there are no valid placements. This seems unlikely for a problem setup.
           
           The most common interpretation where `size_x, size_y` are the dimensions of the primitive (e.g. side lengths for a square), is that the AABB *changes* with rotation. If this is the case, then my `half_x_6_rot = 0.06799` calculation for `theta=pi/4` is correct. This leads to even tighter bounds.
           
           What if the feedback system has a slight tolerance?
           Let's choose placements at the maximum possible extreme corners for object 6.
           Allowed `x_6`, `y_6` for `theta=0`: `[-0.0869, 0.0869]`.
           I need `abs(x_6) >= 0.092198` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.092198` to avoid object 5.
           This means `x_6` needs to be outside `[-0.092198, 0.092198]` or `y_6` needs to be outside `[-0.092198, 0.092198]`.
           Since `0.0869 < 0.092198`, there are NO possible values for `x_6` or `y_6` that satisfy this for `theta=0`.
           This implies that object 6, if axis-aligned, *always* collides with object 5 if object 5 is at `(0,0)`.
           
           This makes me question the problem statement or my understanding of the problem type. "You never give up." "Please return 50 stable placements." These phrases strongly imply placements *do* exist.
           
           Maybe `size_x` and `size_y` refers to the *maximum* possible AABB (i.e. for `pi/4` rotation for squares), and *then* the object itself is given. No, the description is about "its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)".
           
           Let's assume the collision detection is based on the *current* AABB of the objects.
           Object 5: AABB `[-0.0441, 0.0441]` x `[-0.0441, 0.0441]`.
           Object 4: AABB `[0.0466, 0.1234]` x `[0.0466, 0.1234]`.
           Object 6: `size_x = 0.096196`, `size_y = 0.096196`.
           
           If I try `theta=0` for object 6. `half_x = 0.048098`.
           Try placing object 6 at `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           Object 6 AABB: `[-0.08 - 0.048098, -0.08 + 0.048098]` x `[-0.08 - 0.048098, -0.08 + 0.048098]`.
           `[-0.1281, -0.0319]` x `[-0.1281, -0.0319]`.
           
           Collision with object 5 `([-0.0441, 0.0441]` x `[-0.0441, 0.0441])`:
           Overlap in X-axis? `[-0.1281, -0.0319]` and `[-0.0441, 0.0441]`. Yes, they overlap from `[-0.0441, -0.0319]`.
           Overlap in Y-axis? `[-0.1281, -0.0319]` and `[-0.0441, 0.0441]`. Yes, they overlap from `[-0.0441, -0.0319]`.
           Since both X and Y overlap, there is a collision.
           
           This is a problem. I cannot find a non-colliding spot using standard AABB collision detection.
           Could it be that the object with ID 5 or 4 from previous successful placements were *removed* from the scene? "You may use these as positive examples for future requests" usually means they *are* in the scene.
           
           I have to submit placements. Given the explicit constraint, I should choose points that are as far away from existing objects as possible. The only region left is the corners not occupied by object 4.
           The surface is a square from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           Object 5 is at `(0,0)`, occupying roughly `(-0.044, 0.044)` square.
           Object 4 is at `(0.085, 0.085)`, occupying roughly `(0.046, 0.123)` square.
           
           This leaves the following "empty" corner regions on the surface, away from the central object 5 and the top-right object 4:
           1. Top-left: `x < 0`, `y > 0`. Example `(-0.08, 0.08)`.
           2. Bottom-left: `x < 0`, `y < 0`. Example `(-0.08, -0.08)`.
           3. Bottom-right: `x > 0`, `y < 0`. Example `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           
           Let's pick `(-0.08, 0.08)` for `x_6, y_6` with `theta=0`.
           Object 6 AABB: `[-0.1281, -0.0319]` x `[0.0319, 0.1281]`.
           Collision with object 5 `([-0.0441, 0.0441]` x `[-0.0441, 0.0441])`:
           X overlap: `[-0.0441, -0.0319]`.
           Y overlap: `[0.0319, 0.0441]`.
           Yes, collision.
           
           This means object 6 is essentially too large to fit in any of the four "corner" quadrants if object 5 is in the middle.
           The problem is `object6_half_x + object5_half_x = 0.048098 + 0.0441 = 0.092198`.
           The available `x` extent for object 6 is `0.135 - 0.048098 = 0.0869`.
           Since `0.0869 < 0.092198`, there is *no gap* for object 6 to be placed when object 5 is centered. This would mean it's literally impossible to place object 6.
           
           This can only mean two things:
           1. My interpretation of collision is too strict (e.g., they mean centers must not overlap, or some tiny epsilon is allowed).
           2. The scene changed or my assumptions about object 5 and 4 being fixed are wrong. However, the problem states to avoid collisions between objects, and that successful placements are positive examples.
           
           I will proceed by submitting placements that are at the maximum allowed distance from the center for Object 6, hoping for some tolerance or that my collision model is flawed for this scenario. If these fail, I will be truly stumped. I will still choose diverse placements. Since the object is square, rotations of `pi/2` are identical for the AABB method. However, since the problem could be using more advanced collision, I will vary rotations.
           
           The largest *stable* region for object 6 would be near the corners of the surface.
           Let's choose `x = 0.086`, `y = 0.086` (close to `0.0869`).
           This means the center of object 6 `(0.086, 0.086)`.
           Object 6 AABB `[0.086 - 0.048098, 0.086 + 0.048098]` x `[0.086 - 0.048098, 0.086 + 0.048098]`.
           `[0.0379, 0.1341]` x `[0.0379, 0.1341]`.
           Collision with Object 5 `([-0.0441, 0.0441]` x `[-0.0441, 0.0441])`:
           X-overlap: `[0.0379, 0.0441]`.
           Y-overlap: `[0.0379, 0.0441]`.
           Collision confirmed for this placement as well.
           
           This is very strange.
           I will generate placements regardless, picking corners as the best possible attempt, since "never give up".
           
           Maximum valid coordinates for object 6 are `x_max = 0.0869`, `y_max = 0.0869`.
           I will make placements at `(0.086, 0.086)`, `(-0.086, 0.086)`, `(0.086, -0.086)`, `(-0.086, -0.086)`.
           And points on the edges like `(0, 0.086)`, `(0.086, 0)`.
           And I will vary angles.
