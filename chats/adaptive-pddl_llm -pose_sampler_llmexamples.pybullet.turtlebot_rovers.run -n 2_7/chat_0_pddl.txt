User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene consists of a central square area defined by obstacles 0-4, which form the outer walls. Obstacle 5 is a vertical wall through the center, effectively dividing the space into two halves. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout, including rectangular blocks like 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and some smaller, irregularly placed blocks.
           
           Given the target point {target_point}, I need to find 3 base positions within a radius of 2. Since the robot's orientation is automatically handled, I just need to focus on (x, y).
           
           My strategy is to:
           1. Prioritize positions that are not directly behind any known obstacles relative to the target.
           2. Consider positions on different sides of the target to offer diversity.
           3. Be mindful of the large central vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0. If the target is on one side, I should generally look for base positions on the same side.
           4. Try to avoid placing the robot too close to any obstacles.
           
           Let's break down the target point's location: {target_point}. This point is in the {target_point[0] > 0 ? "right" : "left"} half of the main area, and {target_point[1] > 0 ? "upper" : "lower"} half.
           
           I will try to place positions that are:
           - Directly in front/back/side of the target, but away from obstacles.
           - Slightly offset to avoid potential occlusions by small objects.
           - Within the allowed x and y ranges [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 1.5})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] + 1.5} {target_point[1]})
