           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down my thought process step-by-step:**
           
           First, I expanded the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, identifying the key conditions I needed to satisfy.  I quickly recognized that four of these conditions were already met given the initial state.  This left me with four critical tasks: getting two images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) and obtaining and analyzing samples of a stone and soil (`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` with the correct types).
           
           I dove into how to get these images, which involved using the `send_image`, `take_image`, and `calibrate` actions.  The key here was understanding the preconditions of each action, especially `atconf` (being at a particular configuration).  I realized I needed to "calibrate" the camera (`v10`) on the rover (`v12`) to be able to "take" images of `v17` and `v18`, then send them to the lander (`v9`). The problem is "I" cannot move and am always at configuration v13 (conf(v12,v13) and atconf(v12,v13) are true).
           
           This is where the continuous parameters (like `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o1`, etc.) became tricky.  The rules stated they are "placeholders" that a separate algorithm would compute later.  However, the goal requires *specific* object substitution, meaning I needed to use those `#o` for now.  The core of the issue: if I calibrate at `#o3` (imagevisible(v12,#o3,#o4, v17)) and am *at* v13 (atconf(v12,v13)), then v13 must be able to satisfy the visible state. The implication is, these `#o` and `v13` values must be related.
           
           Since no movement action exists and it is already stated that `atconf` holds, *I must assume that the `#o` configurations in the preconditions (like `imagevisible`) essentially *map* to the current configuration, which is `v13`.*  This is the only reasonable way to proceed.  If they weren't compatible, it's an unachievable state (or the problem's implicit rule). Since I cannot *move*, I will use `v13` to replace all parameters to satisfy `atconf` (rover at v13) preconditions.
           
           So, I formulated the plan:
           
           1.  **Calibrate:** `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)` (Using the initial `imagevisible` statement). This allows me to see the object at current location (v13).
           2.  **Take Image:** `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`. (Again, the assumption about `v13`.)
           3.  **Send Image:** `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`.
           
           I repeated these steps for `v18`. I had the images, so I was partway there.
           
           Next, I needed to get the sample analyses.  I identified `v1` as a stone to be sampled and `v5` as a soil sample.  The `sample_rock` action would do the trick, but first, I needed to drop a previous rock sample to free up space in the store.  I assumed `v16` to be the store.
           
           4.  **Sample:** `sample_rock(v12, v13, v1, v16)`
           5.  **Send analysis:** `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v1)`
           6.  **Drop Rock:** `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           7.  **Sample:** `sample_rock(v12, v13, v5, v16)`
           8.  **Send analysis:** `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           That's it!  I've got the images and analyses I needed.  I am assuming that the `atconf` state remains the same for the execution of this problem.
           
           In summary, the key insight in this problem was the *interpretation of the continuous parameters* relative to the robot's current location (`v13`).

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v12 v13 v5 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback is clear: the previous plan's actions were invalid. I need to work only with the provided actions in the "valid action instances" list. Let's re-examine the situation.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, a pretty complex beast. It demands that I have a bunch of preconditions satisfied: `atconf`, `free`, and then a series of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. The critical part is that I need to receive images and analyses of certain stones and soils.
           
           The only tools I have to work with are two `move` actions – which, frankly, are pointless since they move the rovers to the same location – and two `drop_rock` actions. But here's the kicker: the initial state explicitly states that the rovers' stores are *free*, not *full*. And the `drop_rock` actions have a precondition that the stores *must* be full to execute.
           
           Looking at the problem, none of these actions can achieve my ultimate goal. I can't receive those images and analyses, so the required goals can't be reached. I've hit a dead end, given the constraints of the action space and the initial state. The plan is unreachable as stated.
