           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.058, 0.397, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.262, 0.965).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.2, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.817, 0.577).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.089, -0.409, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.832, 0.555).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.186, -0.275), (0.263, -0.198)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.043, 0.467), (0.053, 0.563)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.105, 0.349), (-0.01, 0.445)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.245, -0.281), (-0.156, -0.191)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.454), (-0.043, -0.363)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.224, -0.237, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.052).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.005, 0.515, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.965, -0.262).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis: The Goal is Unattainable**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to get a handful of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto v20. It's clear that to achieve this, I need to manipulate these objects using the robot's arms, v4 and v6. Currently, they're all resting on v11 at specific poses, and the robot starts at configuration v3.
           
           The central problem stems from the constraints. The definition of "on" requires an object to be *supported* by a surface at a specific *pose*. My strategy would be to execute the following for each object: pick it up from v11, move it, and then place it onto v20 at a suitable new pose.
           
           Now, consider the details: I can represent this operation with the `kin` predicate which implies the robot can pick a target object using its kinematically valid arm and trajectory for grasp. However, the system imposes a critical constraint: only actions *explicitly* provided in the action instance list are permissible. This list only includes a `move_base` action, which doesn't alter any object's poses. It doesn't include any `pick` or `place` actions, which are *essential* to shift objects to the desired poses on v20. 
           
           I've got a grasp of all the parameters I'd need for the picking and placing actions: robot arm, target object, grasp, pose, and trajectory, but they're *unavailable*. I need a `place` action to reposition each object and a `pick` action to move each object to a valid pose, yet, the permissible action list lacks them. To make `on(object, v20)` true, I need to ensure an object is both supported by v20 and at a desired pose. The initial state gives me that the objects are not supported by v20. The only way to achieve the goal is to use the `place` action, which is to say I must reposition the pose of the object to a target pose on v20. I cannot achieve the pose repositioning with only a `move_base` action.
           
           Ultimately, this goal is unattainable. I am constrained by the system's explicit action allowances, lacking pick-and-place actions, a requisite for manipulating the target objects as desired. I cannot change the "atpose" predicate of objects to the supported "on" predicates, so no plan is possible.
