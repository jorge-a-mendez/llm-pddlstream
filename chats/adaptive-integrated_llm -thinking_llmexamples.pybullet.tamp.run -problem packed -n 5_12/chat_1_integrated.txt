           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.058, 0.397, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.262, 0.965).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.2, -0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.817, 0.577).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.089, -0.409, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.832, 0.555).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.186, -0.275), (0.263, -0.198)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.043, 0.467), (0.053, 0.563)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.105, 0.349), (-0.01, 0.445)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.245, -0.281), (-0.156, -0.191)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.454), (-0.043, -0.363)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.224, -0.237, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.052).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.005, 0.515, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.965, -0.262).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a surface, v20.  All these objects currently rest on a larger surface, v11, supported by the pose values v9, v13, v15, v17, and v19 respectively. Object v20, the target, appears to be a smaller surface, with an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           The goal is `on(?o, v20)` for each object. This translates to supporting the object and having it at a specific pose on v20.  The main strategy is:
           1.  Pick up each object from its current location.
           2.  Place each object onto v20 at a specific new pose.
           
           The robot has two arms but the robot base cannot move to other configurations. This means the pick/place locations must be reachable from the fixed base configuration `v3`. The only available action, in addition to pick/place, is `move_base`. Given the base configuration, this is not needed and will not be included.
           
           The `kin` facts and initial facts inform me of the robot's capabilities and the starting positions.  All pick and place operations use arm `v4`, a grasp `#o1`, base conf `v3`, arm trajectory `#o4`. The robot *can* move and the base configuration is a no-op. The base position is `(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           A key challenge is the precise placement of the objects on v20 and ensuring these poses are collision-free.  I need to consider the constraints defined by the AABB of v20 and the size of the objects. Since multiple objects must be placed on v20, I need to define a unique pose for each of them.  They will not be placed at exactly the same pose. The plan needs to ensure the picked objects, and trajectories, do not collide with their initial placement (on v11), or with each other on the destination.
           
           Based on the provided information (that no *negative* cfree facts exist in the initial state), I'm assuming that all actions are feasible, if I provide valid positions on v20 for each object.
           
           I've decided on the placement poses as follows, all on v20 at a height of 0.781:
           -   `v12`: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v14`: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v8`: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v16`: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           -   `v18`: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           Using these poses, my plan consists of a sequence of picking and placing each object in this order.
           1. Pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `(-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)` on v20.
           2. Pick `v14` from `v15` and place it at `(0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)` on v20.
           3. Pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)` on v20.
           4. Pick `v16` from `v17` and place it at `(0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)` on v20.
           5. Pick `v18` from `v19` and place it at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` on v20.
           
           I must use `#o2` for each target pose to place the objects according to the rules of how poses are defined for this environment.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a problem, and frankly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher given the constraints.  My initial instinct was to map out a standard pick-and-place sequence to get those five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`) from surface `v11` to the desired surface `v20`.  But then I saw the allowed actions... and things went south quickly.
           
           The core issue is this: the *only* action I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Basically, I can tell the robot to... *not* move.  I can't pick up objects, I can't put them down, nothing. My entire toolkit, as it were, has been reduced to a single, utterly useless, do-nothing command.
           
           Given this severe limitation – a fixed robot pose with absolutely no manipulation capabilities – the goal is fundamentally unreachable.  I can't move the objects.  I can't interact with them in any way.  It's like asking me to build a house with only a stapler. I'm going to have to report that the plan is unachievable, based on these parameters.
