           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Solution for Object Placement on a Constrained Surface**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current locations to be supported by object v20. I’ll be using arm v4, as it's the only one listed in the `kin` predicates.  The core challenge lies in the spatial constraints: I must place five objects, each of a certain size, onto a table-like surface (v20) that has a defined AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The key constraint here is that the objects must be "fully contained within the bounds of the surface" and not overlap.
           
           My immediate thought is to consider a non-overlapping configuration. However, the dimensions of v20 (0.27 x 0.27) and the approximate dimensions of the objects suggest that it might not be possible to place all objects within the constraints of the provided geometry. I need to make sure that the arrangement is collision-free (meaning the AABBs don't intersect).
           
           I've examined the objects’ AABBs and concluded that a strict interpretation of "fully contained" and "non-overlapping" makes the goal unachievable.
           
           *   **Surface Dimensions**: v20 is 0.27 x 0.27.
           *   **Object Dimensions**: are roughly 0.09 x 0.09 (v8) or slightly larger.
           *   **Problem**: placing five objects of this size in a non-overlapping arrangement is geometrically impossible. If all five objects must have their full AABBs within that surface area, it's impossible.
           
           If I rigidly interpret the requirement that objects be fully contained within the boundary, and do not overlap, then I must conclude that this goal state is not achievable, or will have to provide a solution that does not meet the specified criteria (non overlapping and full containment). The standard constraints and collision checks, if correct, preclude any solution within the given context.
           
           If it were possible to have slight overlaps (or if collision tolerances are more lenient than the AABB-based checks), I could find a valid plan. Given the geometric constraints, the solution requires a more nuanced approach. The goal demands I provide five distinct values for the `#o2` pose, one for each object.
           
           I propose a solution based on the assumption that collision-checks are *strict* and the objects must be placed side-by-side, but it might exceed the constraints, as a demonstration that the solution is not achievable:
           
           I will place them into specific locations, based on:
           
           1.  Move the base to a central base configuration `#o3` (which I set to (0,0,0)).
           2.  v12 placed at (-0.089, 0.0895, 0.781)
           3.  v14 placed at (0.0905, 0.090, 0.781)
           4.  v16 placed at (-0.0875, -0.087, 0.781)
           5.  v18 placed at (0.087, -0.087, 0.781)
           6.  v8 placed at (0, 0, 0.781)
           
           Although I have found positions, according to the strict collision and "fully contained" rules, it is not possible to place the objects in a collision-free placement. This plan violates the constraints, according to the geometric constraints.
