User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding 25 Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of how I'm going to find 25 valid positions for the robot's base, given a target point and some constraints.  I need to generate a list of 25 (x, y) coordinates for the robot, ensuring they meet the requirements.
           
           First, I need to understand the scene. I have a set of obstacles defined as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).  These include the environment boundaries (which are also AABBs) and some internal obstacles. The robot's base must be within the overall environment limits: x from -2.5 to 2.5 and y from -2.5 to 2.5.  My understanding is that the robot's center must be within or on these boundaries for it to be inside the scene. Also, the robot needs to avoid collision with these fixed obstacles and the environment walls. These wall AABBs effectively limit the robot center from going *inside* them.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate positions in a way that inherently respects the constraints. I'm going to use a combination of two methods.
           
           The first method uses polar coordinates, where I'll position candidates at varying distances (radius) and angles around the *target_point*. I'll start the radius at a small value to keep from being too close, all the way up to 4. I will then pick enough angles to cover the 360-degree circle and combine these radial distances to create a rich and diverse set of points.
           
           My second method will be a grid search. This helps to cover all the gaps between the obstacles, and ensure a diversity of points within the total playable range.
           
           For each candidate position, I will check several conditions:
           
           1.  **Environment Bounds:** The (x, y) coordinates must be within the scene boundaries.
           2.  **Max Range:** The distance from the target point can't exceed 4.
           3.  **Collision Check:** I will use the set of fixed obstacles and a helper function that determines when a candidate collides with any of them. I'm assuming the robot acts as a point. This will eliminate positions inside the obstacles and along the walls. The helper function accounts for precision errors and boundary checks with the *strict* inside check.
           
           I'll use these checks to filter and store only valid positions, and I'll keep generating and checking positions until I have at least 25 that meet all the conditions. I will remove duplicates since my methods combine, and the use of floating-point arithmetic can leave to close points. Then I'll shuffle the points to avoid any kind of order. If I am unlucky, I'll return fewer, but my logic should yield sufficient unique positions.
           
           **Positions:**
           (-1.1895 -0.6865)
           (-0.7651 -0.5841)
           (-2.4496 -0.9996)
           (-1.3289 -2.5000)
           (-2.2359 -0.6384)
           (-0.4721 -0.4285)

           (-0.6409 -2.1370)
           (-1.5959 1.1444)
           (0.4072 -0.8710)
           (-1.0180 -2.4862)
           (-0.9634 -1.7214)
           (2.3333 -1.0267)
           (-1.4237 0.9026)
           (-1.2619 -1.9427)
           (-1.9791 -2.0722)
           (1.9715 -1.5422)

           (-0.5540 -1.2268)
           (-2.5000 -1.1345)
           (0.4392 -0.1764)
           (-1.7483 -1.1843)
