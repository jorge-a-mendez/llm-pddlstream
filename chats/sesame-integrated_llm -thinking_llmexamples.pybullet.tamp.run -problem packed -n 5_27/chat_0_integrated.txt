           Object v21 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.151, 0.456), (0.237, 0.541)).

           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.016, 0.413), (0.079, 0.508)).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.194, 0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.79, 0.613).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Planning Process**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking about:  I've got this task to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a target surface (v20).  The initial state says they're all currently sitting on a support surface (v11) and in specific poses. The goal is to get all of them "on" v20, which means they need to be placed in specific locations relative to v20, supported by it.
           
           Breaking this down, it means I need to plan a "pick" action for each object, from its starting pose, and a "place" action, onto v20 at the new target pose. Each "place" target needs to be a continuous value I assign and it must result in a collision-free and stable configuration.  The challenge is that the instructions are very specific.  Each placement on v20 must be *collision-free* and *stable*. That means they can't overlap, and each object must be entirely within v20's boundaries.
           
           I'm starting with a base configuration to get into the plan.
           
           I need a base move to get the robot to the pick pose, and then each pick/place cycle.  My checks for the `pick` and `place` actions are standard (kinematics, atpose, handempty, base configuration).  Since the problem's about multiple objects on one surface, there's a requirement to set up a pose and location that is "stable," and that each object gets its *own* pose on that surface. That means I need to generate unique continuous parameter for each object that is placed.
           
           Next, I have to figure out where to place these objects on v20. I've got the bounding box information for v20, which is a square with side lengths 0.27m. I have the dimensions of each object, and the poses of objects need to ensure that the objects are all within the bounds, and that they are all stable. Then the values are set to 0.781 for the z value since all of the poses are set to 0.781. This ensures that their placements are supported and can be grabbed.
           
           The initial approach involves placing them in a grid, and then linearly and in a cross. However, after careful calculations of the geometry and the required center-to-center distances, I've concluded that it's physically impossible to arrange five objects of this size (roughly 0.1m x 0.1m) on a surface of this size (0.27m x 0.27m) in a way that satisfies the "collision-free" and "stable" requirements.  There's simply not enough space.  This has to be pointed out as a constraint to the plan.
           
           So, the conclusion is that, given the strict geometric constraints and the definition of a stable placement, this particular goal is currently unachievable.
