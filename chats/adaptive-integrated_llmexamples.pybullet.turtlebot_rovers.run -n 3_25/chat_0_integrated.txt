           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` (already satisfied by initial state facts `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`)
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (meaning `receivedanalysis(v4)` or `receivedanalysis(v3)` or `receivedanalysis(v1)`)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` (already satisfied by initial state facts `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`)
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (meaning `receivedanalysis(v7)` or `receivedanalysis(v8)` or `receivedanalysis(v5)`)
           
           Let's break down the current state and what needs to be done:
           
           **Initial State Analysis:**
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           *   `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           *   `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)` are true, so there are stones.
           *   `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)` are true, so there is soil.
           *   `v10` is a camera, onboard `v12` and `v14`, and supports `v11` (mode).
           *   There are many `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates involving `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o0`, `#o1`, and `#o5`. These are continuous parameters that need to be instantiated.
           
           **Goals to achieve:**
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v1)` or `receivedanalysis(v3)` or `receivedanalysis(v4)`)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `receivedanalysis(v5)` or `receivedanalysis(v7)` or `receivedanalysis(v8)`)
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Image Reception:** To receive images, a rover needs to:
               *   `calibrate` its camera.
               *   `take_image` of the objective.
               *   `send_image` to the lander.
               We need to do this for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` with mode `v11`.
               Since `v12` and `v14` both have `v10` onboard and `v10` supports `v11`, either rover can be used. The initial state shows `imagevisible` predicates for both `v12` and `v14` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`. Let's use `v12` for `v19` and `v14` for `v17` and `v18` to distribute the tasks (though one rover could do all).
           
           2.  **Analysis Reception:** To receive analysis for a rock, a rover needs to:
               *   `sample_rock`.
               *   `send_analysis` to the lander.
               We need one stone (`v1`, `v3`, or `v4`) and one soil (`v5`, `v7`, or `v8`) analyzed and sent.
               `above(v12, #o5, v8)` (soil), `above(v14, #o5, v8)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v3)` (stone), `above(v14, #o5, v3)` (stone), `above(v12, #o5, v1)` (stone), `above(v14, #o5, v1)` (stone), `above(v14, #o5, v5)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v5)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v4)` (stone), `above(v14, #o5, v4)` (stone), `above(v14, #o5, v7)` (soil), `above(v12, #o5, v7)` (soil).
               All rocks are available for sampling at configuration `#o5` for both rovers. Let's pick `v12` to sample `v3` (stone) and `v14` to sample `v5` (soil).
           
           **Detailed Plan Steps:**
           
           *   **For `v19` (image):**
               *   `v12` is at `v13`. It needs to move to `#o3` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`. However, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` implies `v12` can only move from `v13` to `v13`. This is a problem. Let's assume the continuous parameter `#o2` can be adjusted such that `v13` is indeed `#o3`. This seems unlikely based on the `motion` predicate.
               *   Let's check the available actions again. The only `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. This means the rovers are stuck at their initial configurations `v13` and `v15` unless `#o2` can represent a move to `#o3` or `#o5`. This is a crucial point. Given the `motion` predicate's structure, `#o2` acts as a trajectory between two configurations, `q1` and `q2`. Here `q1` and `q2` are the same, suggesting no movement.
               *   However, if `atconf(v12, #o3)` or `atconf(v12, #o5)` are required, but `v13` and `v15` are the only current positions for `v12` and `v14` respectively, and no valid movement to `#o3` or `#o5` is explicitly allowed by the `motion` predicate with distinct `q1` and `q2`, then the goal is unreachable IF `#o3` or `#o5` are different from `v13` and `v15`.
               *   The problem statement says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
               *   This implies that `#o3` and `#o5` are indeed *different* configurations that the rover needs to reach.
               *   Since the only `move` actions allowed are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, these actions effectively keep the rovers at their initial positions. There are no available `move` actions that allow `v12` to move from `v13` to `#o3` or `#o5`, or `v14` to move from `v15` to `#o3` or `#o5`.
               *   If the rovers cannot move to `#o3` or `#o5`, then `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions that require the rover to be at `#o3` or `#o5` cannot be performed.
               *   Thus, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of `#o3` and `#o5`. They are *configurations* for `v12` and `v14`.
           The initial state explicitly states `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`.
           However, `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are the *current* locations.
           The available `move` actions:
           `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Moves `v12` from `v13` to `v13`. Does not change `atconf`.
           `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Moves `v14` from `v15` to `v15`. Does not change `atconf`.
           
           If there were `motion(v12, v13, trajectory_to_o3, #o3)` available, then we could move the rover. But these are not in the initial state or available actions list.
           
           Therefore, the rovers are currently `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           To execute `take_image` at `#o3`, or `sample_rock` at `#o5`, the rover must be `atconf(rover, #o3)` or `atconf(rover, #o5)` respectively.
           Since there are no actions to move the rovers to these configurations, the actions that require being at `#o3` or `#o5` cannot be performed. This makes the goal unreachable.
           
           The only scenario where the goal would be reachable is if `#o3` and `#o5` were identical to `v13` or `v15` respectively for the relevant rover. But given that they are represented by distinct object names (`#o3`, `#o5` vs `v13`, `v15`), and the problem explicitly asks for values for `#o3` and `#o5` if used, it strongly implies they are distinct from `v13` and `v15`.
           
           Conclusion: The necessary actions (`take_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, `send_analysis`) require the rovers to be at specific configurations (`#o3` for images, `#o5` for sampling/analysis via `comvisible`). However, the only available `move` actions do not allow the rovers to change their configurations from `v13` and `v15`. Therefore, the required preconditions for these actions cannot be met, and the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's re-read the problem statement carefully: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This confirms that only the two `move` actions listed are allowed, which don't actually change the robot's configuration.
           
           The only way the actions involving `#o3` or `#o5` would be executable is if `v13` was `atconf(v12, #o3)` or `v15` was `atconf(v14, #o3)`, etc. But the initial state explicitly gives `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. If, for example, `v13` was in the `imagevisible` predicate, it would be `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v19)`. Instead, it's `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`. This confirms that `#o3` is a different configuration from `v13`.
           
           Given the provided actions, the rovers are effectively immobile. Without the ability to move to the configurations where images can be taken or rocks sampled, the goal of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved.
