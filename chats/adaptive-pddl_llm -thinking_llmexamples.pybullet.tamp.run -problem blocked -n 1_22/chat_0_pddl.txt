           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. Straightforward enough, right?  The catch lies in the initial state and the allowable actions.
           
           I can identify potential candidates for `?green`—`v8` and `v12`—both possessing the requisite `type(v17)`. The core of the problem, however, is establishing `on(?green, v18)`. This hinges on satisfying the `on` axiom: `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` AND `atpose(?green, ?p)`.
           
           Initially, I looked for ways to reposition either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. I initially assumed I could employ `pick` and `place` actions; both are common strategies for such a task. The initial state strongly suggested this approach. For both `v8` and `v12`, I noted the supporting facts required to get those objects 'on v18'.
           
           However, this is where the constraints bite. I'm limited to a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a significant restriction. The `move_base` action, as defined, manipulates the robot's base configuration rather than allowing for object manipulation, i.e., pickup and placement. It could only do trivial movements.
           
           Examining the initial state, neither `v8` nor `v12` are already satisfying the `on(...,v18)` condition. Given this, and the single and, from a planning standpoint, useless `move_base` allowed, it's clear the goal is simply unattainable with the restrictions in place. There's no way to modify object positions with these parameters. It's an interesting puzzle, but ultimately, it's a dead end—the plan is infeasible.
