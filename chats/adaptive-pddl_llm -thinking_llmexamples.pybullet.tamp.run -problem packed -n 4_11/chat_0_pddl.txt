           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all stacked on `v18`.  Currently, they're all sitting on `v11`.  My expertise tells me this requires a pick-and-place strategy. I'd need to pick each object from `v11` and then place it onto `v18`. Simple in principle, right?
           
           Now, let's look at the available actions.  I see only one: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is a null operation.  It's essentially doing nothing.  I need actions like `pick` and `place` to manipulate the objects.  Those actions need several preconditions, like being at the right position and having an empty hand.
           
           Here's the problem: *there are no instances of `pick` or `place` provided*.  The task constraints are explicit: I can only use the actions explicitly listed. This means I'm stuck. I can't move anything.  I checked and double-checked the initial state and the available actions. There's simply no way to execute the necessary operations to achieve the goal state.  Without `pick` and `place` instances, the plan is impossible. My conclusion: the goal is *unachievable* given the current action set. This is a classic example of planning with insufficient operators. I need those critical `pick` and `place` actions to make any progress.
