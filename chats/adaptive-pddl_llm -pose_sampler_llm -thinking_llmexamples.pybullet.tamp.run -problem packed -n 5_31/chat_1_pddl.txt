(Thoughts: **The Plan for Object Stacking**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is to stack five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`) on `v20`.  Each object needs to be both `supported` by `v20` and in the pose `#o2`. Fortunately, the `supported` facts are already in place, meaning my focus needs to be on getting each object to the correct pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, each object is currently resting on `v11` at a unique pose (e.g., `v8` at `v9`, `v12` at `v13`, etc.). All are graspable and have appropriate `kin` facts indicating a graspable pose in the initial state and the target pose `#o2`.  The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`, but the problem is a basic object manipulation problem, so only `pick` and `place` are relevant here.  The `move_base` action available is a no-op that re-asserts the `atbconf` facts. It's safe to disregard it to minimize the cost.
           
           Given that the robot arm, `v4`, is `handempty` and `controllable`, and all necessary kinematic facts are available, the plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  **Pick** each object from its initial pose.
           2.  **Place** each object at pose `#o2` on `v20`.
           
           The key is to perform these actions sequentially for each object. Since the robot can only hold one object at a time. The order in which I pick and place the objects doesn't change the outcome. However, I will adopt the following structure.
           
           Here's the planned sequence:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           7.  `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           8.  `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           9.  `pick(v4, v18, v19, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           10. `place(v4, v18, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           This plan satisfies all preconditions for each action, achieves the goal, and is cost-effective by avoiding unnecessary actions. It should be a direct route to stacking the objects as required.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem's Unreachability**
           
           Okay, I've got it. The user rightly pointed out the constraint: I'm limited to only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a serious problem.  My initial assessment is this plan is doomed.
           
           Let me break down why.  The goal is to get several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) *on* `v20`.  By my understanding of the `on` axiom, this means I need two things:  `supported` and `atpose`.  In the initial state, the objects are already supported by `v20` *at* `#o2`.
           
           The problem is, the current `atpose` of these objects are all different (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`, `v19`).  I need to somehow move them to `#o2`.  This usually is done with `pick` and `place`, which will change `atpose`.
           
           But `move_base`? It does not affect `atpose`. The only thing `move_base` cares about is `atbconf` and `canmove`. Therefore, there is no way for me to get these objects to the right pose to be on v20. The `move_base` action is completely irrelevant to the goal. It seems this problem is inherently *unsolvable* within the constraints given. I'm stuck, it's impossible.
