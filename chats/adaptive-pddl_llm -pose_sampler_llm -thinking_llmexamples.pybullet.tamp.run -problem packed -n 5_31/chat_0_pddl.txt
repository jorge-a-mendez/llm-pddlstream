           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking: The objective is to place five specific objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) on `v20`.  My expert understanding tells me that this translates into ensuring each object is *both* at a specific pose (`#o2`) and supported by `v20`.  Initially, all these objects are resting on `v11` at their current poses.
           
           My goal decomposition shows I need to achieve the "on" relation for each of these objects with respect to v20, which is basically the pose and support facts.
           
           The state of affairs is simple. `v8, v12, v14, v16` and `v18` need to transition from their initial `atpose` and `supported` positions on `v11` to the desired state.  This means I must somehow get them to pose `#o2` and have them supported by `v20`.
           
           The only actions at my disposal are picking and placing the objects. I have two robot arms that are currently empty. It seems straightforward, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions for each of the target objects. However, there's a serious constraint.
           
           Here is the crux of the problem: I'm only allowed to use the `move_base` action instance provided.  This means the robot can *only* move its base, staying at the initial configuration.  I lack the crucial ability to pick up or place any of the objects, because there are no available `pick` or `place` action instances.
           
           Essentially, there's no way to perform the necessary manipulations.  Since the available action instance is useless for achieving the desired `on` predicates, the goal is definitively unreachable with the given constraints.
