(Thoughts: **Analysis and Planning for Rover Task**
           
           Okay, here's my current thinking on this complex task. I'm aiming to achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which I've broken down. It requires a lot of things to be true, and I've carefully considered each of them. My primary challenge is coordinating the rovers' actions, especially with the limited mobility and the need to interact with objects at specific configurations (#o0, #o3, #o5).
           
           Initially, I see that I have `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` as true and I need to gather image and analysis data. I can observe some initial conditions like both rovers, v12, and v14, are free, where `free` means their internal stores have nothing in them. I can also observe the types of rock and soil that are available for analysis.
           
           My initial assumption here is that I need to send images from rover v12. I'll need to calibrate v12 and v10 and then send images. Given that the rover's positions cannot change, I'm stuck, and this doesn't help me meet the goal, so I need to explore different parameters.
           
           I need to calibrate the rover's camera, take images, and send them to the lander. The rovers are able to talk to the lander from configuration #o0 which helps. I also need to collect rock and soil samples, analyze them, and send those analyses to the lander. The key here is the assumption that I can use the continuous values provided for #o0, #o3 and #o5 without explicitly moving to those configurations as long as `conf(rover, #config)` and the related visibility/above conditions are also true.
           
           I have decided to focus on v12 as it will be the most useful rover for the operations I want. I have to calibrate the camera and have to take and send images.
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:**
           
           I see that `v12` is in communication range with `v9` in configuration `#o0` and image range with objectives `v17, v18, v19, and v20` in configuration `#o3`.
           
           I will need to run the following sequence:
           
           *   **Calibrate at #o3:** Run `calibrate` to enable image taking.
           *   **Image the targets:** Run `take_image` repeatedly for the four objectives.
           *   **Send images to the lander:** Then `send_image`.
               I have `v12` and its camera and the ability to send images to the lander.
           
           For `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, I need to:
           1.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           I then repeat those steps for all the other objectives: v17, v18, and v20.
           
           2.  **Sample Collection and Analysis:**
           
           I observe that v4 (stone) and v5 (soil) are available, and I can have it "above" the objects.
           I will have v12 sample both v4 and v5.
           
           *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v4, v16)`
           *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
           *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           
           The final `drop_rock` makes sure that the `free` goal parameter is met.
           
           3.  **Key Assumptions:**
           
           I am making the critical assumption that if a configuration is given in `conf` and is then used in `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, or `above`, I can "enter" that configuration to run the action.
           
           4.  **Continuous Parameters and Constraints:**
           
           Here's how I'm addressing the continuous parameter requirement:
           
           *   **#o3 (Image Visibility):** I have chosen `(0.0, 1.9)` for `#o3

           *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v4, v16)`
           *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`

           *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`

           *   **#o3 (Image Visibility):** I have chosen `(0.0, 1.9)` for `#o3

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: A Consequence of Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the previous plan and, as expected, it's hitting a major roadblock. The user pointed out the obvious: the plan tries to use actions that just aren't in the allowed list. This allowed action list is incredibly limited, practically useless for achieving anything substantial.
           
           Basically, all I'm permitted to do is move the rovers to their *current* positions (which is pointless unless there's some hidden time component or state change not explicitly modeled) or drop rocks. Everything else, the core actions I need, like calibrating, taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and analyzing samples, are explicitly excluded!
           
           Let's re-examine that `new-axiom@0()` goal in this light. I mean, the initial state *does* satisfy the "atconf" predicates. The "free" store conditions are initially met, and dropping rocks could potentially maintain those. But then we hit a brick wall. The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are impossible to achieve! They *require* `send_image` and `send_analysis`, respectively, and those are simply forbidden.
           
           Since `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these goals, if even *one* part is unachievable, the whole thing fails. And with this action restriction, those analysis and image receipt parts are completely out of reach.
           
           So, the conclusion is clear. With this laughably restrictive set of actions, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is utterly, undeniably *unreachable*. We're stuck.

The user pointed out the obvious: the plan tries to use actions that just aren't in the allowed list. This allowed action list is incredibly limited, practically useless for achieving anything substantial.
           
           Basically, all I'm permitted to do is move the rovers to their *current* positions (which is pointless unless there's some hidden time component or state change not explicitly modeled) or drop rocks. Everything else, the core actions I need, like calibrating, taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and analyzing samples, are explicitly excluded!
           
           Let's re-examine that `new-axiom@0()` goal in this light. I mean, the initial state *does* satisfy the "atconf" predicates. The "free" store conditions are initially met, and dropping rocks could potentially maintain those. But then we hit a brick wall. The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are impossible to achieve! They *require* `send_image` and `send_analysis`, respectively, and those are simply forbidden.
           
           Since `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these goals, if even *one* part is unachievable, the whole thing fails. And with this action restriction, those analysis and image receipt parts are completely out of reach.
           
           So, the conclusion is clear. With this laughably restrictive set of actions, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is utterly, undeniably *unreachable*. We're stuck.
