           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is `new-axiom@0()`, a pretty specific goal in the `rovers` domain. The initial state analysis reveals that the core problem lies in achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. While the rovers are initially in a good state (at the right `atconf` positions and `free`), getting those images and analyses is proving tricky.
           
           Specifically, the rovers are at *specific* configurations (`v13` and `v15`) – and crucially, *cannot* move.  The problem is that the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates, which are crucial for taking images, sending them, analyzing samples, and sending those analyses,  are *only* satisfied *at different configurations* (`#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`). The `take_image`, `send_image`, and `sample_rock` actions all require that the rover's current configuration (`atconf`) matches the `q` parameter in those visibility/proximity predicates. Since the rovers are *stuck* at their current configurations (the `move` actions simply loop),  this connection is impossible. They can "see" and "sample" *from other locations*, but can't *actually* get there to perform those actions. Therefore, these image and analysis goals are unreachable given the constraints.  The system is built in such a way that the rovers are only capable of taking the images *if* they were already at those other locations. The plan is fundamentally flawed since the only actions available to the rovers allow them to remain in the same position, and not visit the other necessary locations. Consequently,  *no* rover can actually *do* what's required to achieve this goal.
