           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.105, 0.503), (0.179, 0.577)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.171, 0.498), (-0.072, 0.597)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.02, -0.497), (0.079, -0.398)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.142, 0.54, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.726, 0.687).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.122, 0.548, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.413, 0.911).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.029, -0.447, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.935, 0.354).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan to Arrange Objects on Surface v16**
           
           My goal is to position objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16, starting from their initial location on surface v11.  This necessitates a "pick and place" approach for each object: I'll pick each one up and put it on v16.  Since these are three separate objects, I must assign different continuous values, denoted here by `#o2`, to each object when they are placed on v16.
           
           **Initial Considerations:**
           *   Each object (v8, v12, v14) currently sits on surface v11.
           *   My available actions are `pick` and `place` using robot arm v4.
           *   I will use the pose `#o2` for placement on surface v16.
           
           **Breaking Down the Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must move the robot base from its initial configuration (v3) to a base configuration suited for picking and placing (represented by `#o3`). This initial move is required because the `pick` and `place` actions assume a specific base configuration. The costs associated with base motion will be accounted for in the initial move. This move sets the scene.
           
           2.  **Move v8:**
               *   **Pick:** Pick up object v8 using robot arm v4 from pose v9.
               *   **Place:** Place object v8 onto surface v16 at the assigned pose `#o2` (`#o2 v8 v16`).
           
           3.  **Move v12:**
               *   **Pick:** Pick up object v12 using robot arm v4 from pose v13.
               *   **Place:** Place object v12 onto surface v16 at the assigned pose `#o2` (`#o2 v12 v16`).
           
           4.  **Move v14:**
               *   **Pick:** Pick up object v14 using robot arm v4 from pose v15.
               *   **Place:** Place object v14 onto surface v16 at the assigned pose `#o2` (`#o2 v14 v16`).
           
           I must make sure to verify the poses are collision free. Given the relative sizes, choosing reasonable poses would achieve this.
           
           **Implementation Details:**
           
           *   I need to provide *specific continuous values* for the target poses. I'll use values based on the known bounding box constraints of v16, and the known object properties. For a detailed verification that my poses are collision free, a detailed geometric reasoning must take place that uses the exact bounding box or shape information of the object.
           *   I will provide an x, y, z and theta pose for `v8` at `#o2` on `v16`. Then `v12`, then `v14` on `v16`.
           
           The total cost will be the movement cost to the base config (`distance(v3, #o3)`) plus the costs of the pick and place actions performed.
