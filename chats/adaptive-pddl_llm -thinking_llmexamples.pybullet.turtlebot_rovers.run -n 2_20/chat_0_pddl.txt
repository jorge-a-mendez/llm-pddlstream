           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with figuring out how to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at it, this boils down to getting images and analysis reports. Specifically, I need two images (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) and analyses for both a rock of type `v2` and a soil of type `v6`. That's the core.
           
           Now, my initial state already gives me some things: rover locations, free stores, and the fact that I have rocks and soil. However, it doesn't have the *crucial* pieces: the images and the analyses. My immediate thought is, "I need to take and send these things!" But a closer inspection of the allowed actions throws a wrench in this plan.
           
           The allowed actions are incredibly limited: essentially, moving rovers in place (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`) and dropping rocks ( `drop_rock v12 v16`, `drop_rock v14 v16`). The moves are essentially useless as they don't change the rover's location. Critically, I don't see any actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, which are *essential* to fulfilling the preconditions for any `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can see all the preconditions needed for these actions are met. Rover can see, communicate, and is above all the objects, but cannot do anything without the action itself.
           
           Furthermore, my initial analysis shows that I'm starting in an okay state (`atconf`, stores are free etc.). But, the "move" action is in-place, and the "drop_rock" action is not usable, because the stores are currently free. I need to get things INTO the rovers before I can take them out, and this is where I get stuck.
           
           I’ve gone over it again. All the conditions look good, *except* the allowed actions. Since I’m *explicitly* told that I can't use any actions not on the list, it's clear the plan is impossible. I can't get the needed data with the given actions. The only path to satisfying my goal involves actions I'm not allowed to use. It seems this goal, given the constraints, just can't be reached.
