           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal to stack several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) onto `v20`. The initial state, however, shows these objects are currently supported by `v11`.  To achieve the goal, I need to get each object at a pose where they are supported by `v20`. The key to this is manipulating the `atpose` predicate using the `pick` and `place` actions, which change the `atpose` predicate.  I would normally approach this by picking up each object and then placing it at the correct pose on top of `v20`.
           
           The problem? I'm only allowed to use the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *do* anything useful. It moves the base from `v3` to itself, effectively a no-op that toggles `canmove`.  I'm constrained by the rule that only explicitly provided action instances can be used.  And there's no way to reach the desired `atpose` states needed for the goal using only a `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the goal is unreachable.  I can't manipulate the object positions as needed with the available actions. No matter how I try to reframe it, I'm stuck because I need `pick` and `place` which are not allowed. It's a fundamental mismatch between the required actions and the permitted action instances.  I'm effectively blocked from making any meaningful progress. The goal is impossible to satisfy under the given conditions.
