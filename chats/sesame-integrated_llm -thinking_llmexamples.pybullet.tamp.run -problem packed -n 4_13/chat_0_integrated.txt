           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.004, 0.398), (0.086, 0.488)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.17, -0.264), (0.266, -0.168)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.038, -0.471), (0.054, -0.379)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.102, 0.202), (0.19, 0.29)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.041, 0.443, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.823, 0.568).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.218, -0.216, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.483, 0.876).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.008, -0.425, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.2).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.146, 0.246, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.147).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a scenario where I need to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current positions on object v11 and place them "on" object v18. The "on" relation is defined using a combination of the "supported" and "atpose" predicates. This means I need to find a suitable location (pose) on v18 for each object, making sure it's supported at that location. Fortunately, the initial state shows that the objects are already supported by v18 - the placement step is straightforward.
           
           My robot has one arm, v4, initially at a base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. It's handempty (good, no pre-existing cargo!).  The available actions are pick and place. Both are key here: for each object, I need to pick it from its initial pose on v11 and place it on v18.
           
           Here's my general plan:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** The pick and place operations all use a shared base configuration, which I will call #o3. I first need to move the robot's base from its current configuration v3 to #o3.
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:** For each of the four objects, I need to:
               *   **Pick:** Use the pick action to grasp the object from its initial pose (v9, v13, v15, v17 - and associated with the initial object positions).
               *   **Place:** Use the place action to release the object onto v18 at its target position, denoted as #o2.
           
           Since all the `pick` and `place` actions will share the same `bconf` (#o3), I can do a move-base action just once, and then use the base position to repeat the pick and place actions until all objects are placed.
           
           Now, for placing the objects on `v18`. I need to define the poses, which are expressed by the continuous parameters of #o2, in the form of `pose(?o, #o2)` such that the objects rest within v18's region.
           
           I'll arrange the objects in a 2x2 grid in order to place them on v18:
           
           *   v8: (0.06, 0.06, 0.831, 0.0)
           *   v12: (-0.06, 0.06, 0.831, 0.0)
           *   v14: (-0.06, -0.06, 0.831, 0.0)
           *   v16: (0.06, -0.06, 0.831, 0.0)
           
           So, here's my full plan:
           
           1.  move_base v3 #o3
           2.  pick v4 v8 v9
           3.  place v4 v8 #o2
           4.  pick v4 v12 v13
           5.  place v4 v12 #o2
           6.  pick v4 v14 v15
           7.  place v4 v14 #o2
           8.  pick v4 v16 v17
           9.  place v4 v16 #o2
           
           The cost will be the distance it takes for move_base and the cost of the pick/place actions. The move_base is only needed once, which is a big gain! So total cost = distance(v3, #o3) + 8.
