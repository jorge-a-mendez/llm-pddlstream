           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.488, 1.798), (0.58, 1.891)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.095, 0.391), (-1.989, 0.497)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My primary concern, as an expert in this domain, is the strictness of the action instances provided. The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is clearly defined and requires achieving both `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions.  To meet the `receivedimage` predicates, I'd need to leverage `send_image`. Likewise, `receivedanalysis` demands the use of `send_analysis`.**
           
           **However, my analysis reveals a critical constraint: I'm explicitly limited to using only the four specific action instances listed: two "no-op" moves for the rovers and two attempts to drop rocks that cannot be done due to their current state.**
           
           **The rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are each constrained to remain at their initial configurations (v13 and v15, respectively) due to the nature of the *move* actions. This rigid limitation immediately blocks my ability to fulfill the preconditions of critical actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These operations fundamentally require the rovers to interact with *different* configurations (#o3, #o0, #o5, etc.).**
           
           **Given this inflexible set of action instances, the objective becomes unachievable. The available actions do not lead to any change in the problem state that advances me towards the goal. The drop actions are blocked due to precondition failure.  The move actions don't change any of the necessary conditions for success.**
           
           **The problem statement's strict wording, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," leaves me with no means to meet the requirements of my goal. Consequently, the conclusion is straightforward: the target state is unreachable within the stated parameters.**
