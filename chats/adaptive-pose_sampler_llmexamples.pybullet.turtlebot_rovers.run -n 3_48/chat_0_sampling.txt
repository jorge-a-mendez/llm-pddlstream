User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall along x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment. Some of these obstacles appear to be in clusters or forming small rooms/corridors.
           
           I'll start by generating a few positions around the target point. I'll prioritize positions that are directly to the left, right, top, and bottom of the target, and then move to diagonals if these are not valid or if I need more options. I'll also consider the bounding box of the environment to avoid proposing positions outside the allowed range. I will avoid placing the robot on top of the known obstacles.
           
           Target point: (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664)
           
           Max range: 2
           
           Candidate positions will be within x: [-2.5, 0.05] and y: [-2.5, 0.027647972106933594] approximately, respecting the 2 unit distance constraint.
           
           Let's check some simple positions first:
           1. Directly to the right of the target (x increases): (-0.975471019744873 + 1, -1.9723520278930664) = (0.02452898025512702, -1.9723520278930664) This is very close to the x=0 wall (obstacle 5). It might be too close.
           2. Directly to the left of the target (x decreases): (-0.975471019744873 - 1, -1.9723520278930664) = (-1.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664) This looks promising, as it's not near any visible obstacles.
           3. Directly above the target (y increases): (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664 + 1) = (-0.975471019744873, -0.9723520278930664) This also looks promising.
           4. Directly below the target (y decreases): (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664 - 1) = (-0.975471019744873, -2.9723520278930664) This is out of bounds for y (below -2.5). I need to be careful with the bounds.
           
           Let's refine the first set of positions, ensuring they are within the environment bounds and not obviously colliding with fixed obstacles.
           Obstacles: 0-4 are the bounding walls. 5 is the central vertical wall.
           Target: (-0.975, -1.972)
           
           Position 1: (x slightly positive, y around target)
           Let's try (0.02, -1.9)
           This is close to the vertical wall at x=0 but might be valid. It's also within 2 units of the target. dist = sqrt((0.02 - (-0.975))^2 + (-1.9 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt(0.995^2 + 0.072^2) = sqrt(0.990025 + 0.005184) = sqrt(0.995209) approx 0.997, so it's good.
           
           Position 2: (x more negative, y around target)
           Let's try (-1.9, -1.9)
           dist = sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.975))^2 + (-1.9 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt((-0.925)^2 + (0.072)^2) = sqrt(0.855625 + 0.005184) = sqrt(0.860809) approx 0.927, so it's good. This is also far from any obstacles.
           
           Position 3: (x around target, y more positive)
           Let's try (-0.9, -0.9)
           dist = sqrt((-0.9 - (-0.975))^2 + (-0.9 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt(0.075^2 + 1.072^2) = sqrt(0.005625 + 1.149184) = sqrt(1.154809) approx 1.074, so it's good. This is also far from any obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (0.02 -1.9)
           (-1.9 -1.9)
           (-0.9 -0.9)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts were for a different target point, which is why the proposed positions were invalid for the current target. I need to be careful and always use the current target point for calculations.
           
           The new target point is (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664). I made a mistake in the previous response and the target point provided for the previous attempts (1.9647337198257446, 2.0372800827026367) was not used in my reasoning. I should have used the target point stated in the prompt, which is `(-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664)`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate for the correct target point: (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664).
           Max range: 2.
           
           Previous failures reported for target (1.9647, 2.037):
           (0.02, -1.9) collided with obstacle 5 (the central wall). This makes sense.
           (-1.9, -1.9) collided with obstacle 6.
           (-0.9, -0.9) had no line of sight.
           
           Now for the *correct* target point: (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664)
           
           Let's retry finding positions, considering the obstacles.
           Obstacles:
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - central vertical wall
           6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693)) - small box in bottom-left
           
           The target point (-0.975, -1.972) is in the bottom-left quadrant.
           Obstacle 6: x range is approx [-2.4, -1.4], y range is approx [-2.35, -1.65].
           The target point is within the x-range of obstacle 6, but its y-coordinate (-1.972) is within obstacle 6's y-range. This means the target point itself is *inside* obstacle 6. This is a crucial observation.
           
           If the target point is *inside* obstacle 6, then any position that attempts to view it will likely have occlusion unless the position is also inside obstacle 6, or very close to its edge. However, the robot cannot be placed inside an obstacle.
           
           This implies that finding a line-of-sight to this target might be very difficult, or perhaps impossible if the target is fully enclosed. Let me check the coordinates carefully.
           Target x: -0.975471019744873
           Target y: -1.9723520278930664
           
           Obstacle 6:
           x_min: -2.4047
           x_max: -1.3952999999999998
           y_min: -2.3455502384913305
           y_max: -1.6544497615086693
           
           Comparing the target with obstacle 6:
           Target x (-0.975) is *not* between x_min (-2.4047) and x_max (-1.3953). So the target is *not* inside obstacle 6 along the x-axis. It is to the right of obstacle 6.
           
           My previous assessment that the target is inside obstacle 6 was incorrect. The target is to the right of obstacle 6.
           
           Let's re-strategize with the correct target point and obstacle information.
           Target: (-0.975, -1.972)
           Obstacle 6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3953, -1.6544))
           The target is to the right of obstacle 6. Its y-coordinate (-1.972) is within the y-range of obstacle 6.
           
           Let's consider positions around the target.
           Distance from target must be <= 2.
           Robot x range: [-2.5, 2.5], y range: [-2.5, 2.5]
           
           1. Position to the right (x increases):
              Target x + some_dist: -0.975 + 1.0 = 0.025. This is right on the central wall x=0. Avoid.
              Let's try (0.07, -1.972). This is just to the right of the central wall.
              dist = sqrt((0.07 - (-0.975))^2 + (-1.972 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt(1.045^2 + 0^2) = 1.045. Valid distance.
              This might be valid.
           
           2. Position to the left (x decreases):
              Target x - some_dist: -0.975 - 1.0 = -1.975.
              Let's try (-1.975, -1.972).
              Check for collision with obstacle 6: x: [-2.4047, -1.3953], y: [-2.3455, -1.6544].
              Our proposed x (-1.975) is within obstacle 6's x-range. Our proposed y (-1.972) is within obstacle 6's y-range.
              So, (-1.975, -1.972) would collide with obstacle 6. This explains the failure of (-1.9, -1.9) from the previous (incorrect) reasoning.
           
              So, I need to choose a position to the left that avoids obstacle 6.
              To avoid obstacle 6, x must be less than -2.4047 or greater than -1.3953 (but that's moving right).
              If I go further left, e.g., (-2.45, -1.972).
              dist = sqrt((-2.45 - (-0.975))^2 + (-1.972 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt((-1.475)^2) = 1.475. Valid distance.
              This is within the bounds and outside obstacle 6.
           
           3. Position above (y increases):
              Target y + some_dist: -1.972 + 1.0 = -0.972.
              Let's try (-0.975, -0.972).
              dist = sqrt((-0.975 - (-0.975))^2 + (-0.972 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 1.0^2) = 1.0. Valid distance.
              This seems like a good candidate as it is far from obstacle 6 and the central wall.
           
           4. Position below (y decreases):
              Target y - some_dist: -1.972 - 0.5 = -2.472.
              Let's try (-0.975, -2.472).
              dist = sqrt((-0.975 - (-0.975))^2 + (-2.472 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.5)^2) = 0.5. Valid distance.
              This is very close to the bottom wall (y=-2.5), but should be valid. It's below obstacle 6.
           
           Let's try these three positions:
           1. (0.07, -1.972) - right of central wall
           2. (-2.45, -1.972) - left of obstacle 6
           3. (-0.975, -0.972) - above target
           
           Positions:
           (0.07 -1.972)
           (-2.45 -1.972)
           (-0.975 -0.972)

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     I apologize for the repeated error in handling the target point. I must strictly use the *current* target point provided in the *new request*. The previous failure logs consistently show a different target point than the one I thought I was using. This is a critical mistake.
           
           The *current* target point is: (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664). This is the *same* target point from the previous request, so my geometric reasoning should be valid now, and the reported failures should be taken into account against this target point.
           
           Let's re-analyze the failures from the *previous* request for *this specific target point*.
           Wait, the provided failure logs are for a *different* target point: (-0.5030459761619568, 1.8628636598587036, 0.20100000500679016).
           This is very confusing. It seems the system is using a different target point for evaluating my proposals than the one provided in the `New request` prompt. I need to clarify what target point I should be using.
           
           Given the prompt "New request: Target point: {target_point}", I must assume `{target_point}` is the actual current target point. I will ignore the target point from the failure logs.
           
           So, for `Target point: (-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664)`:
           
           My proposed positions from last round were:
           1. (0.07, -1.972) - I said this was "right of central wall".
              Failure log for this specific position for target (-0.503, 1.863) (which is not my current target) was `collides with: 0: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. This obstacle 0 is the central wall. My reasoning was correct that it's close to the wall, but it was a collision. So I need to move it further away from the central wall.
           
           2. (-2.45, -1.972) - I said this was "left of obstacle 6".
              Failure log for this specific position for target (-0.503, 1.863) was `collides with: 0: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))`, which is the left bounding wall, AND `1: ((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693))` which is obstacle 6.
              My position (-2.45, -1.972) has x=-2.45. The left bounding wall is x_min = -2.55, x_max = -2.45. So it's colliding with the left bounding wall. Also, its x-coordinate is within obstacle 6's x-range ([-2.4047, -1.3953]) - *no, it is not*. -2.45 is *less than* -2.4047. So it should not collide with obstacle 6. The failure log says it collided with obstacle 6. This implies the collision logic for the robot might be using a slightly larger bounding box for the robot itself, or my interpretation of the AABBs is too precise. I need to be more conservative.
           
           3. (-0.975, -0.972) - I said "above target".
              Failure log for this specific position for target (-0.503, 1.863) was `no line of sight to target`.
           
           Given this, I must work under the assumption that the `Target point: {target_point}` in the `New request` is the one to use, and I must re-interpret the failure logs for *that* target point.
           
           So, for target `(-0.975471019744873, -1.9723520278930664)`:
           
           Obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - central vertical wall
           Obstacle 6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693)) - box in bottom-left
           Obstacle 4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) - left bounding wall
           
           My new strategy:
           The target is at (-0.975, -1.972). It's in the bottom-left quadrant.
           
           1.  **Avoid central wall (obstacle 5)**: Positions to the right of the target should have x > 0.05 (or maybe even further right, like x > 0.1).
               Let's try (0.15, -1.972).
               Distance from target: sqrt((0.15 - (-0.975))^2 + (-1.972 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt(1.125^2) = 1.125. Valid.
               This is away from the central wall.
           
           2.  **Avoid obstacle 6 and left wall (obstacle 4)**: Positions to the left of the target are tricky. Obstacle 6 is x: [-2.4047, -1.3953]. The left wall is x: [-2.55, -2.45].
               Since (-2.45, -1.972) collided with *both* left wall and obstacle 6, it means the robot's bounding box is larger than a single point.
               To be safe, I need x < -2.55 (out of bounds) or x between -1.3953 and -2.4047 (collides with obstacle 6).
               The region x < -2.55 is out of bounds. The only way to the left of obstacle 6 without colliding with it seems difficult.
               What about moving far above or below obstacle 6?
               If I choose a position like (-1.0, -1.0) (above target, not near walls). Let's check distance: sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.975))^2 + (-1.0 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt((-0.025)^2 + (0.972)^2) = sqrt(0.000625 + 0.944784) = sqrt(0.945409) approx 0.972. Valid.
               This looks promising. It's not near obstacle 6, central wall or bounding walls.
           
           3.  **Position below the target, avoiding obstacle 6 and bottom wall**:
               Target y: -1.972. Obstacle 6 y-range: [-2.3455, -1.6544]. Bottom wall y-range: [-2.55, -2.45].
               A position like (-0.975, -2.472) was proposed, which is close to the bottom wall.
               To avoid the bottom wall, y must be > -2.45.
               To avoid obstacle 6, y must be < -2.3455 or y > -1.6544.
               Let's try a position just below obstacle 6, but above the bottom wall.
               How about (-0.975, -2.4)?
               Distance: sqrt((0)^2 + (-2.4 - (-1.972))^2) = sqrt((-0.428)^2) = 0.428. Valid.
               This is above the bottom wall (-2.45) and below obstacle 6 (-2.3455).
           
           So, the new set of positions:
           
           1.  (0.15, -1.972) - Right of the central wall.
           2.  (-1.0, -1.0) - Above and slightly left of the target, clear of all major obstacles.
           3.  (-0.975, -2.4) - Below the target, clear of obstacle 6 and the very bottom of the map.
           
           Positions:
           (0.15 -1.972)
           (-1.0 -1.0)
           (-0.975 -2.4)
