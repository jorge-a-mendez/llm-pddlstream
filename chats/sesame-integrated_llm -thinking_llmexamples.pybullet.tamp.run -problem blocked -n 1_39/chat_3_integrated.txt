           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.288, -0.438), (4.604, 0.474)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.695, -0.405), (-4.617, -0.327)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.656, -0.366, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.749, 0.663).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to making `on(?green, v18)` true and, with `?green` being `v12`, that means getting `v12` on `v18`. From my perspective, this translates to placing object `v12` onto the surface `v18`. Since I'm already given that `v12` is supported by `v18`, it means that my focus narrows to positioning `v12` on `#o2`, which in turn needs an "atpose" predicate.
           
           Based on the current state, `v12` starts at position `v13`. It is being supported at `v13, v14`. `v4` (the robot arm) is currently `handempty`. My plan hinges on two core actions: Picking up `v12` from its present pose (`v13`) and placing it on `v18` at `#o2`. To make things easier, there's `kin` fact in the initial state, so I know I must move to `#o3`.
           
           Let's begin with the first act, "pick" I need to prepare the base by moving it to the correct base configuration `#o3` (which is needed because of the pre-conditions, particularly the  `kin` predicate). Given that I want to use `pick` action to manipulate `v12`, I will start by executing `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to move the base (the robot's base configuration) to `#o3` where all the initial configurations are defined and where `kin` value is defined, making sure I satisfy the required `atbconf(#o3)` pre-condition.
           
           Then, to successfully "pick" the object `v12`, I need to meet the conditions for the `pick` action. Specifically, I need `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atpose(v12, v13)` and `handempty(v4)`. All of which are true or can be achieved. I know the base is now at `#o3`. So, I execute `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`, which results in these changes: `v12` is now grasped by `v4`, so there's `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` in the effects.
           
           After that, I move to placing `v12` on `#o2` on surface `v18`. My next action should be `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`, since this action has preconditions `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`, and  `atbconf(#o3)`. With the `place` action, after this will result in the effects that `atpose(v12, #o2)` is true.
           
           The key to the continuous parameters is defining a suitable pose for `#o2` on `v18`. I've determined that this placement is feasible within the given constraints. I must provide a pose that will have v12 located at 4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0, the `z` value of 0.8 ensuring it rests on top of `v18`. This z coordinate will assure that the object will "rest" on the surface. These coordinates ensure that the object lies within the dimensions of `v18`  and does not create a conflict with other objects in the environment.
           
           With this sequence of actions: 1. `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`, 2. `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` and 3. `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` I should achieve the desired goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which I've checked at various levels of assumptions and knowledge about the problem.
