           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.288, -0.438), (4.604, 0.474)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.695, -0.405), (-4.617, -0.327)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.656, -0.366, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.749, 0.663).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **High-Level Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get object `v12` to be *on* object `v18` and maintain its type, which we know is `v17`.  Essentially, that means placing `v12` onto `v18`.  Here's how I'm thinking to tackle this, breaking it down step-by-step:
           
           1.  **Preparation and Goal Expansion:**  I've unpacked `new-axiom@0()` and figured out that it translates to *on* `v12` `v18`. From the initial state and axioms, `v12` has to be moved from its current location, `v13`, to a new pose on `v18` that I'll call `#p0`.
           2.  **Obstacle Detection:** Since `unsafe` predicates determine if collision-free, I'll need to check if the current setup creates an environment in which objects will collide during pick and place. There is an other object `v15` at position `v16` on top of support `v11` that must be considered.
           3.  **Action Planning:**  To do this, I will move the robot's base.  The actions are given `move_base`.  I will `pick` the object from its initial configuration and `place` it in the final configuration.
           
               *   **Move Base to `#q3`:** First, I need to move the robot's base to a configuration `#q3`, which corresponds to a good position for picking up `v12` from where it currently resides, `v13`.
               *   **Pick Up the Object:** I'll then issue a `pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q3 #t6` command, using `v4` for robot arm, `#g1` for the gripper, and a particular `trajectory(#t6)` to avoid collision. This uses the correct base configuration, `#q3`, and picks up `v12` from `v13`.
               *   **Move Base to `#q2`:** Next, the robot's base has to be moved to `#q2`, where it can move and place the item.
               *   **Place the Object:** I'll use `place v4 v12 #p0 #g1 #q2 #t5` which puts the object at pose `#p0` on surface `v18` using the same gripper, `#g1`, base configuration, `#q2`, and trajectory (#t5), as given from initial state.
           4.  **Checking for Collisions:**  I've noticed potential collision issues that are prevented by `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v12, v13, #g1)` and `NegatedAtom unsafepose(v12, #p0)`. I can verify that based on the scene's geometry, there are no collisions.
           
               *   **Unsafe Analysis (Simplified):** By carefully considering the relative positions, it's safe to assume that there will be no collisions.
           
           5.  **Plan Review:** With all of that thought out, all the preconditions for the actions are met, and this is how I will achieve the objective:  First move the base, then pick the block, then move the base again, then place the block.
           6.  **Continuous Parameters and Plan Verification:**
               *   To be more precise, `#p0` coordinates can be approximately calculated from the coordinates of the target surface `v18`, so that it is placed in the center.
           
           Now it is a case of running it and seeing if it all works!
