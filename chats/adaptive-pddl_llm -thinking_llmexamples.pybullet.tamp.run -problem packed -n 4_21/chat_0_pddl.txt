           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to move the objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`. I understand that achieving this means satisfying the condition `on(?o, v18)` for each of these objects, which translates to ensuring they are both *supported* by `v18` and *positioned* at a suitable pose on `v18`.
           
           My initial analysis reveals the current state: these objects are already *supported* (specifically, they are supported by `v11`, with the relevant facts provided), but they are at the wrong poses. This is clear because they are currently at `v11`, not at `v18`.
           
           The core of the problem boils down to moving each object from its initial pose to a pose that is compatible with being on `v18`. I see that I have `pose` and `supported` facts indicating that placing the objects at `#o2` will work. However, the plan requires moving the objects to `#o2`.
           
           Examining the available actions, I am limited to using only a `move_base` action, which simply changes the robot's base configuration. This action has no direct influence on the position of objects.
           
           To accomplish the task, I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions, which are fundamental to object manipulation. These actions would allow me to grasp each object, lift it, and deposit it at its desired pose. However, crucially, **no instances of `pick` or `place` actions are provided as valid options.**
           
           Consequently, since the only available action does nothing relevant, and the goal requires object manipulation, the goal is **unachievable** with the provided action set. My detailed examination confirms the absence of the necessary `pick` and `place` actions, rendering the final state unattainable.
