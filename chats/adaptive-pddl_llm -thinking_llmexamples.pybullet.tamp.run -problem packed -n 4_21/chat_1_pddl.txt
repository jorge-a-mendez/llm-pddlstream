           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           Alright, the goal is clear: get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) all *on* v18. Breaking it down, that means each needs to be *supported* by v18 and at the right *pose* on v18. I've got the initial state and can see where these objects currently are. They're all on v11, which isn't the final destination.
           
           My initial thought is to go for the obvious: pick them up one at a time and put them down where they need to go. Luckily, I've got facts showing v18 *can* support them at a common pose (#o2), and it looks like that's the *target* pose.
           
           I've checked my action library. Looks like I have to pick and place to move things around, which makes sense. I can ignore cleaning and cooking actions, as they don't apply here. I see a `move_base` action, but it's a null motion (v3 to v3), which is very weird. Looks like base configurations don't matter much here.
           
           I have two arms (v4 and v6), but only one appears to be relevant. Both start with empty hands, which is convenient. Also, both arms start at base config `v3`.
           
           **Detailed Action Planning**
           
           Let's start with v8. It's currently at v9, and the target is #o2 on v18.
           
           Here's my plan:
           1.  **Pick v8 from v9.**
           2.  **Place v8 at #o2 on v18.**
           
           I reviewed the preconditions for picking. All the necessary facts are present initially: the right *kin* configuration, the object is at the correct *pose*, the arm is *empty*, and the base is in the right configuration. No `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj` issues.
           
           The `pick` action will have these effects:
           - *Grasped* the object.
           - `canmove()` flag is set to true.
           - Removes the object's old *pose*.
           - The arm is *no longer* empty.
           
           Next, I reviewed the preconditions for placing. Again, all preconditions are present: the right *kin* configuration for the place action, the object is *grasped*, base is in the right configuration. No `unsafepose` or `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj` problems.
           
           The `place` action will have these effects:
           - The object now has the *target pose* at #o2.
           - The arm is empty *again*.
           - The `canmove()` flag is set to true.
           - The object is no longer *grasped*.
           
           **Sequence and Validation**
           
           It's clear that this process repeats for the other three objects, *v12*, *v14*, and *v16*. I need to pick and place each one.
           
           For validation, I ensured each `kin` relation is satisfied:
           -   v8, v12, v14, v16 can all be picked with `v4` and placed with `v4` in a single base configuration.
           -   No `move_base` is needed since everything is assumed to be within reach from the initial base configuration (`v3`). This is very convenient.
           
           I confirmed that `canmove()` acts as a gating signal for picks and places. The null `move_base` makes this assumption likely. Since `pick` and `place` re-enable the flag, I can sequence them freely, assuming the hand stays empty after each `place`. So, the following should work:
           1. Pick `v8` then Place `v8`.
           2. Pick `v12` then Place `v12`.
           3. Pick `v14` then Place `v14`.
           4. Pick `v16` then Place `v16`.
           
           The actions are confirmed valid. This straightforward sequence should get the objects where they need to be.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user has pointed out a critical issue: my initial plan was invalid because it relied on `pick` and `place` actions, which aren't in the allowed actions list. The only tool I have is `move_base`. The goal is to get several objects "on" a specific object, `v18`. 
           
           Let's break it down: To get something "on" another thing (`on(?o, ?r)`), I need the object to be supported and *also* "atpose" on the target.  Looking at the initial state, none of the goal objects are currently "on" `v18`.  They're all "on" `v11`.  But crucially, to achieve the goal, I need to make sure the object to be placed on the target `v18` is `atpose` on the target.
           
           Now, the only action I can use is `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)`. The action definition states that it can change `atbconf` and `canmove`. The specific action instance that is allowed will delete `canmove` and `atbconf(v3)`. So, the robot will be unable to make any further moves after this particular move. More importantly, this specific move is a no-op that deletes `atbconf` and `canmove`.
           
           The problem is clear: the *only* way to manipulate "atpose" is through `pick` and `place`, which are explicitly excluded.  Since the only available action doesn't affect the necessary "atpose" predicates, the goal is unreachable. Using `move_base` here does nothing to satisfy the goals. I need `pick` and `place`.
