               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all "on" object `v20`.  "On" is defined by the axioms: an object `o` is "on" object `r` if it's supported by `r` *and* at the correct pose.  I need a plan.
           
           My first thought is to analyze the initial state.  Each goal object is currently at a specific pose and supported by `v11`.  Crucially, they are also all *already* supported by `#o2`, which is supported by `v20`.  This means the key is simply getting each object to be `atpose(#o2)`.  My plan would be straightforward: pick each object from its current pose and place it at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, here's the rub: I'm only allowed to use a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move action does absolutely nothing useful!  It merely moves the base from one configuration to the same configuration. It is a no-op! It doesn't allow me to change an object's `atpose` fact.
           
           My analysis of the `pick` and `place` preconditions confirms my suspicion. These standard actions are required to manipulate object poses, but they are not among the allowed action instances. With the provided action alone, I cannot modify the world state in any way to achieve the required `atpose(#o2)` for each goal object.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of the provided action instance, the goal is **unachievable**. There is no way to alter the initial state to satisfy the "on" condition for the target objects. I have to explain why the goal is unreachable.
