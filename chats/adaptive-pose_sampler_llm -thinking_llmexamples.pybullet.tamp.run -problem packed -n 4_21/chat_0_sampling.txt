(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 7 on Surface 0**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 7, side 0.0904) on a square surface (Surface 0, side 0.27). To ensure containment, the object's center must lie within a specific region defined by the surface dimensions and the object's size.  I calculated the valid region: x and y must each be between -0.08979 and 0.08979.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll create a 7x7 grid of center positions, covering the valid (x,y) range. For these placements, the object will have `theta = 0`.  Then, I will add an additional placement (or two) with a different angle, for diversity.  Since the object is a square, the effective bounding box does not change with rotation, so this will be for demonstrating an understanding of how angles relate to containment.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 5: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, making sure they don't collide with the previously placed object 7. I know object 7's exact position and dimensions: it's a square centered at (-0.0898, -0.0898) with sides of approximately 0.0904.
           
           First, I need to define the valid area for object 5 on surface 0, ignoring object 7 for now. Surface 0 is bounded by -0.135 and 0.135 on both x and y. Object 5 is also a square with sides of 0.0713, so I calculate the edges of its bounding box. I know that I have to place it within the bounds, considering its half-size, but not colliding with object 7.
           
           Now, the tricky part: avoiding collisions. Object 7 has a bounding box that takes up a small area in the lower-left corner.  To guarantee no collision, I'll identify a "forbidden" zone around object 7. I'll use the combined half-sizes (Object 5's half-size + Object 7's half-size) to create this collision zone. For object 5's center, I'll calculate it, and it will be around the current object 7's center: roughly (-0.0898, -0.0898). The exclusion zone is within `x in (-0.17067, -0.0089)` and `y in (-0.17067, -0.0089)`. I also calculate the valid placement range on surface 0 for object 5.
           
           So, for object 5's center (x, y), I calculate the grid of (x, y) coordinates for possible placement. Then I will calculate whether or not object 5's placement collides with object 7 for each location.
           
           I will use this logic: Object 5's location is valid if neither the x and y coordinate are within a range where a collision occurs.
           
           I also generate more potential locations for the remaining spots by applying a 45-degree rotation to some of the original valid locations. Finally, I confirm the number of spots.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got the task: place object 4, a small square, on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 7 and 5. I need to find 50 stable placements. I'll break this down methodically.
           
           First, I'll define the valid area where object 4 can be placed on surface 0, ensuring its edges stay within the surface's boundaries. Since it's a square, I just need to consider the half-size along x and y to calculate the maximum and minimum valid coordinates for the object's center.  I've got those bounds, they are easy enough to calculate.
           
           Next, I have to account for those fixed obstacles. I need to create the AABB for each of those so I can quickly perform checks. I have to perform the necessary calculations for the AABB of object 7 and 5. Then I will calculate the range where object 4 collides with object 7 and 5. That will then give me the bounds where object 4 *must not* be placed.
           
           Now, combining the valid placement area with the collision conditions is the crucial step. I'll need to calculate the safe zones. Essentially, this involves checking if the object's center falls outside the collision ranges for each obstacle, while still remaining within the surface's boundaries. I'll use a bounding box approach for simplicity, knowing that a box-box intersection test is computationally inexpensive.
           
           I know I can't generate the full 50 by just placing the object directly without colliding with anything else. The surface area is small, so the valid placement space is limited. I'll need some level of creativity to get all 50. I'll be creating a grid, or a discretized list of points, and test if each point is valid.
           
           I'm discretizing the space into grid points, and I'll carefully check the points within valid range and calculate if any point from the grid collides. I will use the the `x_coords`, `y_coords`.
           
           I'll calculate the collision points, then calculate the Valid points. After that, I will then add some variety by adding some rotation (`pi/4`) for some of the valid points and re-use points that might otherwise not be selected. This will ensure I get 50 valid placements.
           
           Sounds like a solid plan. Let's get to it!

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to place this new object, ID 6, which is a square with side length about 0.0985, fifty times on Surface 0. Surface 0 has these bounds: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The important thing is, I've got to avoid bumping into the objects already there: 7, 5, and 4.  I've got the dimensions and half-sizes all calculated, so that's good.
           
           First step is to figure out where I *can* place the new object. I calculated the valid range on the surface, just considering the surface bounds: that's about from -0.0857 to 0.0857 in both the x and y directions.
           
           Now, for those fixed objects. I'll make sure to double-check my calculations for their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).  Object 7 is centered at roughly (-0.0898, -0.0898), which I use to determine an AABB that extends from -0.135 to -0.0446. The collision check is straightforward: I need to make sure the distance between object centers is greater than the sum of the half-sizes of the objects. I pre-calculate sum of object half sizes for object 6 and 7. The y range looks the same, so there are some areas where 6 could collide with 7.
           
           Object 5 is a bit more complicated. I have to avoid two placements. For 5a, it's roughly (-0.0331, -0.0993) and for 5b it's (0, -0.0993).  Again, I need to compute the valid ranges based on these two placed objects.
           
           Object 4 has two placements as well, at (0.0579, -0.0869) and (0.0869, -0.0869).  I'll get my collision range calculations ready for those.
           
           Next, I'll calculate the collision ranges for each fixed object to object 6. Then I will combine them to ensure I don't pick a center coordinate that could overlap with any of them. Then I can find the valid range for the center of the new object on the surface.
           
           To make things more efficient, I have implemented a grid-based approach. I will iterate over a 7x7 grid of x and y coordinates within the valid placement range. For each grid point, I check if it collides with any of the previously placed objects. This should let me find 35 locations.

Model:     **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to place this new object, ID 6, which is a square with side length about 0.0985, fifty times on Surface 0. Surface 0 has these bounds: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The important thing is, I've got to avoid bumping into the objects already there: 7, 5, and 4.  I've got the dimensions and half-sizes all calculated, so that's good.
           
           First step is to figure out where I *can* place the new object. I calculated the valid range on the surface, just considering the surface bounds: that's about from -0.0857 to 0.0857 in both the x and y directions.
           
           Now, for those fixed objects. I'll make sure to double-check my calculations for their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).  Object 7 is centered at roughly (-0.0898, -0.0898), which I use to determine an AABB that extends from -0.135 to -0.0446. The collision check is straightforward: I need to make sure the distance between object centers is greater than the sum of the half-sizes of the objects. I pre-calculate sum of object half sizes for object 6 and 7. The y range looks the same, so there are some areas where 6 could collide with 7.
           
           Object 5 is a bit more complicated. I have to avoid two placements. For 5a, it's roughly (-0.0331, -0.0993) and for 5b it's (0, -0.0993).  Again, I need to compute the valid ranges based on these two placed objects.
           
           Object 4 has two placements as well, at (0.0579, -0.0869) and (0.0869, -0.0869).  I'll get my collision range calculations ready for those.
           
           Next, I'll calculate the collision ranges for each fixed object to object 6. Then I will combine them to ensure I don't pick a center coordinate that could overlap with any of them. Then I can find the valid range for the center of the new object on the surface.
           
           To make things more efficient, I have implemented a grid-based approach. I will iterate over a 7x7 grid of x and y coordinates within the valid placement range. For each grid point, I check if it collides with any of the previously placed objects. This should let me find 35 locations.
           
           Let's test grid points (x_6, y_6)
           If they don't collide, I'll set theta=0. Then if I still need to get 50 different locations, I can set theta = pi/4 for 15 additional objects.
