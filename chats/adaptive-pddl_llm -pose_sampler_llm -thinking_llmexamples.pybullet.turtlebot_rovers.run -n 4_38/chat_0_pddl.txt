           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: New-Axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This involves several conditions: being "at configuration" (already satisfied), and receiving images and analyses.
           
           I quickly identified a problem. To receive images, I need to *take* them, and then *send* them. That's a two-step process.  To *take* the images, the rover has to be at a specific configuration, like `#o3`.  To *send* the image for analysis, it needs to be at `#o0`.  I have two rovers at my disposal: `v12` and `v14`.  Currently, `v12` is at `v13`, and `v14` is at `v15`.
           
           The key is the `move` action. I need to use it to get my rovers into the right configurations (`#o3`, `#o0`). But here's the kicker: The only available `move` actions are essentially no-ops! They move the rovers from their current location *back to* the same location.  There is simply no way to change the configuration of the rovers from `v13` to `#o3` or `#o0`, or `v15` to those configurations.
           
           Now, if I can't be *at* the right configurations (`atconf`), I can't take images (`take_image`), I can't send images (`send_image`), and I can't satisfy that part of the axiom. It's a dead end.
           
           And the issue doesn't stop there. I also need to send rock and soil analyses. To *do that*, I need to *sample* the rock and soil. But *sampling* also requires the rover to be at a specific configuration (#o5), which, again, is unreachable due to the lack of appropriate move actions.
           
           Since I can't satisfy either the image or the analysis requirements, I'm forced to conclude that this entire goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is simply *unachievable* given the current state and available actions. The lack of configuration changes cripples the plan.
