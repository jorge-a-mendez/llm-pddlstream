(Thoughts: **My Approach to Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, which is a square.  The object is nearly square with dimensions (0.08884937676309176, 0.08884937676309179), and the surface has a width and height of 0.27.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB when rotated must fit entirely within the surface's AABB.  Given the surface dimensions, the object's small size allows for various rotations. The widest the object will appear is about 0.1256.  Since this is less than the surface size, all orientations are valid.
           
           Therefore, for each of the 50 placements, I'll place the object at the surface's center (0, 0), and vary the rotation angle (`theta`) from 0 to 2*pi, creating a diverse set of orientations. This provides a guaranteed stable placement in each case because of the size difference. The surface index will always be 0.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've received the green light on placing object ID 5.  Object 4 is securely placed at (0, 0) with zero rotation, and I need to avoid any collisions.  I've got the dimensions for object 5 (about 0.072x0.072), its AABB is calculated, and the allowable surface area is known.  Object 4's AABB is also known.  
           
           Given the constraints, I'm going to stick with the safest option: zero rotation for object 5 across all 50 placements.  The object is nearly square and any rotations quickly lead to AABB overlap with object 4 in this confined space.  Based on my calculations, the allowable placements can mostly be along the edges or corners of the surface.  Specifically:
           
           1.  **Corner Placements (36 Placements):** I will generate a grid of positions, with both X and Y coordinates carefully chosen to stay within surface bounds *and* outside the collision "buffer" zone around object 4. The buffer is related to object 4's size plus the half-dimensions of the rotating object 5.
           2.  **Edge Placements (12 Placements):** I'll place the object along the x and y axes, making sure one coordinate is zero and the other is valid.
           3.  **Additional Placements (2 Placements):** Finally, I will choose to have placements at the edge of the allowed collision-free area, but still inside the surface: `(0.081, 0.09)` and `(-0.081, -0.09)`.
           
           These placement values for x and y are the results of calculating that object 5's minimum distance from object 4 to avoid overlap and the surface bounds.  These will guarantee collision-free and fully contained placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with existing objects ID 4 and ID 5.
           
           **Scene Overview:**
           
           -   Surface 0: Defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` with a side length of 0.27, and center at (0,0).
           
           **Obstacles:**
           
           -   **Object 4 (ID 4):** Located at (0, 0, 0.0) with dimensions (0.08884937676309176, 0.08884937676309179).
               -   Half-dimensions are `0.044424688`, AABB spans `[-0.044424688, 0.044424688] x [-0.044424688, 0.044424688]`.
           -   **Object 5 (ID 5):** Located at (-0.098, -0.098, -0.098) with dimensions (0.07225430019670437, 0.07225430019670442).
               -   Half-dimensions are `0.03612715`, AABB spans `[-0.13412715, -0.06187285] x [-0.13412715, -0.06187285]`.
           
           **Object to Place (ID 6):**
           
           -   Object 6 has dimensions `(0.09038047117808491, 0.0903804711780849)`, with half-dimensions of `0.045190235`.
               -   I will fix the rotation angle `theta` at 0.0 to simplify calculations.
           
           **Placement Constraints:**
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** To remain within the surface boundaries, the center coordinates `(xc, yc)` of object 6 must satisfy:
               -   `|xc| <= 0.089809765`
               -   `|yc| <= 0.089809765`
           2.  **Obstacle 4 Avoidance:** To prevent collisions with object 4, the center coordinates must meet this condition:
               -   `|xc| >= 0.089614923` OR `|yc| >= 0.089614923`
           3.  **Obstacle 5 Avoidance:** To prevent collisions with object 5, the following must be true:
               -   `xc >= -0.016682615` OR `yc >= -0.016682615`
           
           **Strategy:**
           
           Given these constraints, I devised a method to generate valid placement coordinates for object 6.
           
           1.  I established coordinate ranges, dividing placement points into "outer" bands, regions near the surface boundary, and "inner" spaces between, to effectively cover the surface and avoid collision with object 4.
           2.  I then carefully consider each possible coordinate pair generated and eliminated any non-valid positions based on the described criteria.
           3.  After iterating over all coordinates, I obtained a set of 50 or more unique valid placement points.
