               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all `on(v16)`.  Currently, they're sitting on `v11`.  The key here is understanding the *supported* relation – that's how things are "on" something.  Initially, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are supported by `v11`, so they are on `v11`.  We're given that they can be supported by `v16` too.
           
           The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. `move_base` is useless here; it just keeps the base at its current position, which is `v3`. `pick` changes something from *atpose* to *atgrasp*, and `place` does the reverse.
           
           **The Strategy (and the Roadblock)**
           
           My initial thought is simple:  Pick up each object (like `v8`) from `v11`, and then place them all on `v16`. But there is a crucial `atbconf(?q)` precondition for pick and place, which needs the base configuration to be `#o3`. However, my initial state only has `atbconf(v3)`, and the only `move_base` action available is effectively a no-op that just makes the base stay where it is. It's clear that it isn't possible to move the base and make `#o3` true!
           
           So, the plan would be: 
           1. Pick `v8` from pose `v9`.
           2. Place `v8` on `v16` at pose `#o2`.
           3. Repeat for `v12` and `v14`.
           
           The problem is the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition.
           The key to getting these objects to the right place is to "pick" them up and place them. But to pick them up, the base configuration *must* be `#o3`. This means the robot's base configuration *must* become `#o3` to pick an object and put it to `v16`, which isn't possible given the existing actions and the initial state. The initial state doesn't have `atbconf(#o3)` and the robot can only `move_base` to itself, so I'm essentially stuck. The `move_base` action that is given is useless.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           I am now certain: Given the constraints, the goal is *unachievable*.  I cannot move the robot to the appropriate base configuration to pick and place. There is no plan because I cannot satisfy a key precondition for the core actions.
