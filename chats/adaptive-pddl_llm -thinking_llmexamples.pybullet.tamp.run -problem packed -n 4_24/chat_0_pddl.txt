           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse**
           
           Okay, the goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`. I know from my background that `on(?o, ?r)` is equivalent to `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` AND `atpose(?o, ?p)`. Let's break this down.
           
           First, I examined the initial state.  None of the desired `on` conditions are true right away. Each of those target objects, `v8` through `v16`, is currently `on v11` in a specific pose.  The axioms dictate that in order to achieve the goal, I need to maneuver each object to the correct pose (`#o2`) on `v18` such that the corresponding `supported` predicate is true.
           
           The available actions are: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. However, the problem explicitly restricts the plan to *only* using the single instance of `move_base`. Given my understanding of STRIPS planning, I can see the problem immediately:  I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects' positions, i.e., to change the `atpose` facts. These actions are fundamental to this kind of task.
           
           The constraint that only `move_base` is allowed is a major blocker.  No amount of clever reasoning can circumvent the need for a `pick` followed by a `place` action. These actions are the only way to effectively alter the `atpose` facts and make the desired `on` conditions true. I have to change `atpose(v8, v9)` to `atpose(v8, #o2)`, etc. This kind of state transition is impossible without `pick` and `place`, and since they are prohibited, the goal is unachievable given the constraints.
