           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing several conditions: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `type(?soil, v6)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Let's break down the goal conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has free storage `v16`. This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has free storage `v16`. This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective `v17` has been received in mode `v11`.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective `v18` has been received in mode `v11`.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition and is true based on `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`. So, we need to achieve `receivedanalysis` for `v4`, `v3`, or `v1`. Let's pick `v4`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a stone (e.g., `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`) has been received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition and is true based on `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`. So, we need to achieve `receivedanalysis` for `v8`, `v5`, or `v7`. Let's pick `v8`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of soil (e.g., `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`) has been received.
           
           The current state already satisfies the `atconf` and `free` conditions for both rovers.
           The remaining goals are to:
           - Take and send an image of `v17` (objective).
           - Take and send an image of `v18` (objective).
           - Analyze a rock of type `v2` (e.g., `v4`) and send the analysis.
           - Analyze a rock of type `v6` (e.g., `v8`) and send the analysis.
           
           We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both equipped with camera `v10` which supports mode `v11`. Both rovers have free storage `v16`. Both rovers are at their home configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           Let's plan to satisfy the remaining goals.
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           Both rovers can see `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           We need to:
           1. Calibrate camera `v10` for rover `v12` (or `v14`) at `#o3` to image `v17`.
           2. Take an image of `v17` with `v12` (or `v14`) at `#o3`.
           3. Send the image of `v17` from `v12` (or `v14`) at `#o0` to `v9` (lander).
           
           Let's use `v12` for `v17` and `v14` for `v18`.
           For `v17`:
           - `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3` (move to a pose where `v17` is visible)
           - `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
           - `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
           - `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0` (move to a pose where `v9` is visible for communication)
           - `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`
           
           For `v18`:
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 #o3`
           - `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`
           - `take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`
           - `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0`
           - `send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`
           
           **For `receivedanalysis(v4)` (stone) and `receivedanalysis(v8)` (soil):**
           Both rovers are above `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` at configuration `#o5`.
           We need to:
           1. Sample rock `v4` (type `v2`) with rover `v12` (or `v14`) at `#o5`.
           2. Sample rock `v8` (type `v6`) with rover `v14` (or `v12`) at `#o5`.
           3. Send analysis of `v4` from `v12` (or `v14`) at `#o0` to `v9`.
           4. Send analysis of `v8` from `v14` (or `v12`) at `#o0` to `v9`.
           
           Let's use `v12` for `v4` and `v14` for `v8`.
           For `v4`:
           - `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5` (assuming `v12` is at `#o0` after sending image for `v17`)
           - `sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16`
           - `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0` (move to a pose where `v9` is visible for communication)
           - `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4`
           
           For `v8`:
           - `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5` (assuming `v14` is at `#o0` after sending image for `v18`)
           - `sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16`
           - `move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0`
           - `send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8`
           
           Let's put it all together.
           
           Initial State:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `onboard(v10, v12)`
           - `onboard(v10, v14)`
           - `supports(v10, v11)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`
           
           Let's use `v12` to handle `v17` and `v4`, and `v14` to handle `v18` and `v8`.
           
           **Plan for v12:**
           1. Move `v12` to `#o3` for imaging.
           2. Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication.
           5. Send image of `v17`.
           6. Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling.
           7. Sample rock `v4`.
           8. Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication.
           9. Send analysis of `v4`.
           
           **Plan for v14:**
           1. Move `v14` to `#o3` for imaging.
           2. Calibrate `v10` on `v14` for `v18`.
           3. Take image of `v18`.
           4. Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication.
           5. Send image of `v18`.
           6. Move `v14` to `#o5` for sampling.
           7. Sample rock `v8`.
           8. Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication.
           9. Send analysis of `v8`.
           
           All actions listed in the valid action instances will be used.
           
           The configurations to provide continuous values for are:
           - `#o0` for `comvisible` with `v12` and `v9`.
           - `#o0` for `comvisible` with `v14` and `v9`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible` with `v12` and `v17`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible` with `v12` and `v18`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible` with `v14` and `v17`.
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible` with `v14` and `v18`.
           - `#o5` for `above` with `v12` and `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - `#o5` for `above` with `v14` and `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Given the objects and their bounding boxes:
           - `v7` ((2.012, -1.144), (2.141, -1.015))
           - `v1` ((-0.509, 0.033), (-0.407, 0.136))
           - `v5` ((1.822, -2.029), (1.955, -1.896))
           - `v14` ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)) - Rover 2 (current pos `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75))
           - `v12` ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)) - Rover 1 (current pos `v13` = (1.0, -1.75))
           - `v8` ((2.096, -0.693), (2.214, -0.575))
           - `v17` ((-0.702, 2.007), (-0.603, 2.105)) - Objective 1
           - `v3` ((-2.131, 0.113), (-2.025, 0.219))
           - `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0) - Rover 2 initial conf
           - `v9` ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - Lander
           - `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) - Rover 1 initial conf
           - `v18` ((1.872, 1.917), (1.96, 2.005)) - Objective 2
           - `v4` ((1.951, -1.527), (2.047, -1.43))
           
           **Estimating continuous values:**
           - **#o3 (Image configurations):** These should be positions from which the rovers can see `v17` and `v18`.
               - For `v12` and `v17`: `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. A good viewing position would be roughly halfway, perhaps slightly shifted to get a better angle. Let's try `(0.0, 0.0)` or `(0.5, 0.0)`.
               - For `v14` and `v18`: `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)`. A viewing position for `v14` could be `(0.0, 0.0)` or `(-0.5, 0.0)`.
               - To simplify, let's use a common `#o3` for imaging, e.g., `(0.0, 0.0)`. This would be within the 2 unit range. Let's refine. For `v12` to `v17`, `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. Distance ~ sqrt((1 - -0.65)^2 + (-1.75 - 2.05)^2) = sqrt(1.65^2 + (-3.8)^2) = sqrt(2.72 + 14.44) = sqrt(17.16) ~ 4.14 (too far for direct image from v13). So, `v12` needs to move. A point like `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` might work for both `v17` and `v18` with both rovers.
                   - Distance from `v12` at `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)`: `sqrt((-0.65)^2 + (2.05)^2)` = `sqrt(0.42 + 4.2) = sqrt(4.62)` ~ 2.15 (just outside 2, maybe `(0.2, 0.2)` or `(0.0, 0.0)` is not ideal for `v17` for `v12`).
                   - Let's try `#o3` for `v12` for `v17` at `(0.5, 0.5)`. `dist( (0.5, 0.5), (-0.65, 2.05) ) = sqrt( (-1.15)^2 + (1.55)^2 ) = sqrt(1.32 + 2.4) = sqrt(3.72)` ~ 1.93. This is good.
                   - Let's try `#o3` for `v14` for `v18` at `(0.5, 0.5)`. `dist( (0.5, 0.5), (1.9, 1.95) ) = sqrt( (1.4)^2 + (1.45)^2 ) = sqrt(1.96 + 2.1) = sqrt(4.06)` ~ 2.01. This is also barely out of range.
                   - Let's use `(-0.5, 0.5)` for `v12` to image `v17`. `dist((-0.5, 0.5), (-0.65, 2.05)) = sqrt((-0.15)^2 + (1.55)^2) = sqrt(0.0225 + 2.4025) = sqrt(2.425)` ~ 1.55. This is good.
                   - Let's use `(1.0, 0.5)` for `v14` to image `v18`. `dist((1.0, 0.5), (1.9, 1.95)) = sqrt((0.9)^2 + (1.45)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 2.1025) = sqrt(2.9125)` ~ 1.70. This is good.
                   - So, let's use different `#o3` for each rover-target pair: `#o3_v12_v17` at `(-0.5, 0.5)` and `#o3_v14_v18` at `(1.0, 0.5)`. But the problem states `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`, which implies a single `#o3` parameter. This implies we need a position that works for both. Let's reconsider `(0.0, 0.0)`.
                       - `v12` at `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)` is `sqrt(0.65^2 + 2.05^2)` ~ 2.15, which is out of range.
                       - `v12` at `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)` is `sqrt(1.9^2 + 1.95^2)` ~ 2.72, which is out of range.
                       - `v14` at `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)` is `sqrt(0.65^2 + 2.05^2)` ~ 2.15, out of range.
                       - `v14` at `(0.0, 0.0)` to `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)` is `sqrt(1.9^2 + 1.95^2)` ~ 2.72, out of range.
                   - This means `#o3` is not a good single point to image both `v17` and `v18` for both rovers within the 2m range. However, the `imagevisible` predicates are given, so these configurations must exist. Let's assume there is a `#o3` that works for all and pick a central point, for example `(0.0, 0.0)`. Or maybe it implies that `v12` will image from `(0.0, 0.0)` if `(0.0, 0.0)` works for `v17` and `v18`.
                   - The `imagevisible` predicates are `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. This implies that *the same* `#o3` configuration is used for *all* imaging tasks for both rovers. Given the 2m range, this is challenging.
                   - Let's try picking a configuration like `(0.5, 1.0)`.
                       - `v12` at `(0.5, 1.0)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)`: `sqrt((-0.65-0.5)^2 + (2.05-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.15)^2 + (1.05)^2)` = `sqrt(1.32 + 1.1) = sqrt(2.42)` ~ 1.55. (GOOD)
                       - `v14` at `(0.5, 1.0)` to `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)`: `sqrt((1.9-0.5)^2 + (1.95-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((1.4)^2 + (0.95)^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 0.9) = sqrt(2.86)` ~ 1.69. (GOOD)
                   - So, for `#o3`, we can use `(0.5, 1.0)`. This point is reachable from both `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`).
           
           - **#o0 (Communication configurations):** These should be positions from which the rovers can see `v9` (lander).
               - `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`. Approx center `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
               - `v12` current `(1.0, -1.75)`, `v14` current `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               - For `v12` to `v9`: `dist((1.0, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((1 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.75 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(2.9^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(8.47)` ~ 2.91. (GOOD, within 4m for `comvisible`).
               - For `v14` to `v9`: `dist((-1.0, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((-1 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.75 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.87)` ~ 0.93. (GOOD, within 4m for `comvisible`).
               - Both `v13` and `v15` are suitable for communication, so we can use them or any other point. Since `#o0` is a single configuration, it should work for both. `v15` is already near `v9`. `v13` is a bit further. Let's try `#o0` at `(0.0, -1.75)`.
                   - `dist((0.0, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0)) = sqrt((-1.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 0.0625) = sqrt(3.67)` ~ 1.91. (GOOD)
                   - So, for `#o0`, we can use `(0.0, -1.75)`.
           
           - **#o5 (Sampling configurations):** These should be positions from which the rovers are `above` the rocks.
               - Rocks `v1` ((-0.509, 0.033)), `v3` ((-2.131, 0.113)), `v4` ((1.951, -1.527)), `v5` ((1.822, -2.029)), `v7` ((2.012, -1.144)), `v8` ((2.096, -0.693)).
               - Rover `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`. Rover `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               - Let's find a position `#o5` that can be above rocks for both rovers.
               - Rocks are widely distributed. It's impossible for one configuration `#o5` to be above *all* rocks for *both* rovers. The problem states `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, etc. This implies that `#o5` is a generic "sampling" configuration which is then specialized depending on which rock is being sampled. Given that a single `#o5` is given, it must be general enough that it can be applied to many rock-rover pairs. Let's assume it means a "region" or that the action `sample_rock` moves the robot slightly to be above the rock. For the purpose of providing a single coordinate, let's pick a central point for where sampling might occur, or a point near the rocks we plan to sample.
               - We need to sample `v4` (type `v2`) and `v8` (type `v6`).
               - `v4` is at `(1.951, -1.527)`. `v8` is at `(2.096, -0.693)`. These are relatively close.
               - For `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) to sample `v4`: a position like `(1.9, -1.5)` would work.
               - For `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) to sample `v8`: a position like `(2.1, -0.7)` would work.
               - Since `#o5` is a single configuration for all `above` predicates involving `v12` and `v14` and all rocks, this suggests it might be a general sampling pose rather than specific to each rock. Let's use `(1.5, -1.0)` as `#o5`. This is reachable from `#o0` (0.0, -1.75) for both rovers and would be a good candidate for sampling rocks in the positive x, negative y quadrant.
           
           Let's refine the plan based on these continuous values and ensure no redundant moves.
           
           **Rover v12 plan:**
           Start at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           1. Move to `#o3` (0.5, 1.0) for imaging `v17`.
              `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2. Calibrate camera for `v17`.
              `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3. Take image of `v17`.
              `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4. Move to `#o0` (0.0, -1.75) for communication.
              `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. Send image of `v17`.
              `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           6. Move to `#o5` (1.5, -1.0) for sampling `v4`.
              `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. Sample rock `v4`.
              `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16)`
           8. Move back to `#o0` for sending analysis.
              `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. Send analysis of `v4`.
              `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`
           
           **Rover v14 plan:**
           Start at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           1. Move to `#o3` (0.5, 1.0) for imaging `v18`.
              `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2. Calibrate camera for `v18`.
              `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           3. Take image of `v18`.
              `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           4. Move to `#o0` (0.0, -1.75) for communication.
              `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. Send image of `v18`.
              `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           6. Move to `#o5` (1.5, -1.0) for sampling `v8`.
              `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. Sample rock `v8`.
              `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16)`
           8. Move back to `#o0` for sending analysis.
              `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. Send analysis of `v8`.
              `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`
           
           The plan seems viable. The order of actions between rovers doesn't matter as they operate independently.
           
           Final check on goal conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: No, it ends at `#o0`. This is OK since the axiom just requires `atconf` at some point for the variables it refers to in the initial state, not at the end of the plan. The initial `atconf(v12, v13)` satisfies this.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: No, it ends at `#o0`. Same as above.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has free storage `v16` after dropping the rock. No, the plan samples rocks and does not drop them. The initial state already has `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. Sampling one rock makes it `full(v12, v16)` and `full(v14, v16)`. The axiom is just `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`, which might be satisfied by the initial state. If `free` means "at some point free" or that it needs to be free at the end, then we need `drop_rock`. But the axiom does not imply that the final state should contain this. It's simply a part of the axiom, which is a conjunction of facts. The initial state *has* `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. If the goal refers to this specific `free` in the initial state, it's already true. If it implies it must be true at the *end*, then it needs a `drop_rock`. Let's assume it refers to the existence of these facts at some point. The problem is a plan to "achieve the goal", meaning the goal predicate must be true in the final state. If `analyzed` means the storage is consumed, then `free` would be false. The action `sample_rock` makes `full` true and `free` false. So, if we sample rocks, `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` will become false. We *must* use `drop_rock` to satisfy the `free` condition for the axiom.
           
           Let's modify the plan to include `drop_rock`.
           The `drop_rock` action can be used after `send_analysis`.
           
           **Revised Rover v12 plan:**
           Start at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2. `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4. `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           6. `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16)`
           8. `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`
           10. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           
           **Revised Rover v14 plan:**
           Start at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           1. `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2. `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           3. `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           4. `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           6. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16)`
           8. `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`
           10. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           This ensures `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true at the end.
           The `atconf` predicates in the axiom (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`) are facts from the initial state, they are not required to be true in the final state. They are simply part of the overall conjunction that forms `new-axiom@0()`, which checks if the preconditions for the task were met.
           
           Let's list the configurations.
           - `#o0` (comvisible for both rovers to lander `v9`)
           - `#o3` (imagevisible for both rovers to `v17` and `v18`)
           - `#o5` (above for both rovers to multiple rocks including `v4` and `v8`)
           
           Lander `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Objective `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. Objective `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)`.
           Rock `v4` is at `(1.951, -1.527)`. Rock `v8` is at `(2.096, -0.693)`.
           
           `#o0` (for communication with `v9`): A point `(0.0, -1.75)` seems reasonable.
           `#o3` (for imaging `v17` and `v18`): A point `(0.5, 1.0)` seems reasonable.
           `#o5` (for sampling `v4` and `v8`): A point `(1.5, -1.0)` seems reasonable.
           
           It is important that `cfreerayconf` is not blocked. For these, we should pick clear-line-of-sight positions. Given no other obstacles are listed, we assume these chosen positions are clear. The ray for `#o1` goes from the rover at `#o0` to `v9`. The ray for `#o4` goes from the rover at `#o3` to `v17` or `v18`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to collision with `v19` for configuration `#o0` and reachability issues for `#o3` and `#o5`. The obstacle `v19` is a thin wall at `x=0`. This means `x=0` is blocked.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` considering the new obstacle `v19`.
           
           **Obstacle `v19`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This is a vertical plane at x=0.**
           
           **Revisiting #o0 (Communication configurations):**
           - `v9` (lander) is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           - `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Previous `#o0` was `(0.0, -1.75)`, which lies on the `x=0` plane and collides with `v19`. We need to move away from `x=0`.
           - For `v12` to communicate with `v9` (approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`), `v12` needs to be on the right side of `v19` (x > 0.05) or `v12` needs to move to the left side (x < -0.05). Since `v12` starts at `x=1.0`, staying on the right seems more efficient. A position like `(0.1, -1.75)` might work.
               - `dist((0.1, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((0.1 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.75 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(2.0^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(4.0 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(4.0625)` ~ 2.01. This is good (within 4m).
           - For `v14` to communicate with `v9`, `v14` is at `x=-1.0`. `v9` is at `x=-1.9`. Staying on the left side (x < -0.05) is natural for `v14`. A position like `(-0.1, -1.75)` might work.
               - `dist((-0.1, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((-0.1 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.75 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.8^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(3.24 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(3.3025)` ~ 1.82. This is good.
           
           The problem states `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`, implying a *single* `#o0` configuration. This means a single `#o0` that allows both `v12` and `v14` to communicate with `v9` while avoiding `v19`. This is problematic. If `v12` is at `(0.1, -1.75)` and `v14` is at `(-0.1, -1.75)`, they are on opposite sides of `v19`.
           The predicate `comvisible(v, q, y, l)` means the rover `v` at `q` can see `l` with ray `y`. If `v12` is at `(0.1, -1.75)` and `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`, the ray `y` crosses `x=0`, which would be blocked by `v19`. Therefore, `v12` must be on the same side of `v19` as `v9`. This means `v12` must move to `x < -0.05`.
           
           Let's pick a single `#o0` to the left of `v19`, for example, `(-0.5, -1.75)`.
           - `v12` at `(-0.5, -1.75)` to `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `dist((-0.5, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((-0.5 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.75 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.4^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(2.0225)` ~ 1.42. (GOOD, and on the correct side of `v19`).
           - `v14` at `(-0.5, -1.75)` to `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `dist((-0.5, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = `sqrt((-0.5 - -1.9)^2 + (-1.75 - -2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1.4^2 + 0.25^2)` = `sqrt(2.0225)` ~ 1.42. (GOOD, and on the correct side of `v19`).
           So, let's use `(-0.5, -1.75)` for `#o0`. This requires `v12` to cross `v19` to get there.
           
           **Revisiting #o3 (Image configurations):**
           - `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)`.
           - Previous `#o3` was `(0.5, 1.0)`, which is in collision with `v19` because its x-coordinate is between -0.05 and 0.05 (no, (0.5, 1.0) is not in collision, `x=0.5` is outside `[-0.05, 0.05]`). The error message was "not reachable for robot base."
           
           Let's re-evaluate reachability for `#o3`.
           - `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Target `#o3` is `(0.5, 1.0)`. Distance = `sqrt((1.0-0.5)^2 + (-1.75-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(0.5^2 + (-2.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 7.56)` = `sqrt(7.81)` ~ 2.79. This is a long move but should be reachable if path is clear.
           - `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Target `#o3` is `(0.5, 1.0)`. Distance = `sqrt((-1.0-0.5)^2 + (-1.75-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-2.75)^2)` = `sqrt(2.25 + 7.56)` = `sqrt(9.81)` ~ 3.13. This is also a long move.
           
           The issue could be the path crossing `v19` or the configuration itself for some reason.
           If `v12` needs to image `v17` (left of `v19`) from `x=0.5`, the ray would cross `v19`.
           If `v14` needs to image `v18` (right of `v19`) from `x=0.5`, the ray would cross `v19`.
           So `#o3` must be on the same side of `v19` as the target objective. This suggests `v12` needs a different `#o3` for `v17` than `v14` for `v18`. But the problem states a single `#o3`. This means that `#o3` can't be chosen such that the ray to targets `v17` and `v18` is blocked by `v19`. This means `#o3` must be on the left side of `v19` to see `v17`, and on the right side of `v19` to see `v18`. Since `#o3` is singular, this means it's impossible for a single `#o3` to image both `v17` and `v18` if they are on opposite sides of `v19`.
           `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)` (left of `v19`).
           `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)` (right of `v19`).
           This implies that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` cannot use the same `#o3` if that `#o3` implies a ray that crosses `v19`. The current initial state implies such a `#o3` exists. This is a contradiction.
           
           Let's assume the problem means that `#o3` is such that the robot is on the correct side of `v19` to image the target and the ray is not blocked.
           For `v12` to image `v17`: `v12` at `#o3` (x < -0.05). Let `#o3` = `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
               - `dist((-0.5, 1.0), (-0.65, 2.05))` = `sqrt((-0.15)^2 + (1.05)^2)` = `sqrt(0.0225 + 1.1025)` = `sqrt(1.125)` ~ 1.06 (GOOD, within 2m).
           For `v14` to image `v18`: `v14` at `#o3` (x > 0.05). Let `#o3` = `(0.5, 1.0)`.
               - `dist((0.5, 1.0), (1.9, 1.95))` = `sqrt((1.4)^2 + (0.95)^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 0.9025)` = `sqrt(2.8625)` ~ 1.69 (GOOD, within 2m).
           
           The problem explicitly states `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`, meaning there is one value for `#o3`. This means my assumption of different `#o3` values is incorrect. If the problem definition is strict, then such a `#o3` cannot exist.
           However, since the action instances `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` are given, it means such a configuration `#o3` must be possible without `v19` blocking the line of sight for both. This means that either the `blocked` axiom does not apply to `v19` in this case (unlikely, as `blocked` is a general axiom derived from `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative`), or the interpretation of `imagevisible` needs to allow for the ray not crossing `x=0`.
           
           Let's re-read the `blocked` axiom:
           `Axiom blocked(?y: object)`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom ray(?y)`
               `Atom conf(?v, ?q)`
               `Atom ~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`
               `Atom atconf(?v, ?q)`
           This axiom is about whether a ray is blocked, not necessarily the robot's pose.
           The initial `imagevisible` predicates already tell us these are valid ray-target connections. The problem states that `imagevisible` is true. The `take_image` and `calibrate` actions have `NegatedAtom blocked(?y)` as a precondition. This means we *must* ensure the ray is not blocked.
           
           This implies that the chosen coordinates for `#o3` and `#o0` must avoid collision of the *robot* with `v19` and avoid collision of the *ray* with `v19`.
           If the robot's x-coordinate is `x_r` and the target's x-coordinate is `x_t`:
           - If `x_r > 0.05` and `x_t < -0.05`, the ray crosses `v19`.
           - If `x_r < -0.05` and `x_t > 0.05`, the ray crosses `v19`.
           
           Given `v17` is left (`x < -0.05`) and `v18` is right (`x > 0.05`), a single `#o3` can only image one of them. This suggests an unresolvable contradiction in the initial problem setup *if* `v19` blocks rays. However, the `imagevisible` predicates are given as true in the initial state, implying `blocked` is false for those initial conditions.
           
           Let's assume the previous `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates given in the initial state mean that valid rays exist, and we just need to ensure the *rover's configuration* doesn't collide.
           If `#o3` exists and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is true, then `v12` must be on the left side of `v19` (to image `v17`).
           If `#o3` exists and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true, then `v14` must be on the right side of `v19` (to image `v18`).
           This forces `#o3` to be on both sides of `v19` simultaneously, which is impossible.
           There must be two different configurations for imaging `v17` and `v18`. But the problem provides only one `#o3`.
           
           Let's check the rules again: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..."
           
           The objects `v17` and `v18` are objectives. Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           Given the conflicting nature of a single `#o3` for imaging targets on opposite sides of `v19` (assuming `v19` blocks rays), it might be that `v19` does not block rays, only robot movement. Let's assume that the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates mean that the line of sight is inherently clear. If that's the case, we only need to pick collision-free and reachable robot base configurations.
           
           Let's retry:
           **#o0 (Communication with `v9`):**
           - Lander `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - We need `x < -0.05` to avoid `v19`.
           - A good spot for `v12` (from `(1.0, -1.75)`) and `v14` (from `(-1.0, -1.75)`) to reach is `(-0.5, -1.75)`.
               - `v12` moving from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, -1.75)` crosses `v19`. This means we need to plan the movement through the available `motion` predicates to ensure collision avoidance. The problem states `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, etc., exist. We just need to give `(x, y)` for `#o0`. The motion planner should handle the path.
               - So, let's stick with `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.75)`. This is clear of `v19` in its x-coordinate, and should be reachable.
           
           **#o3 (Imaging `v17` and `v18`):**
           - `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)`.
           - A single `#o3` for both. This means its x-coordinate cannot be close to `0`. If we choose `x < -0.05` (e.g., `(-0.5, 1.0)`), it works for `v17` for both rovers but not for `v18` (ray blocked by `v19`). If we choose `x > 0.05` (e.g., `(0.5, 1.0)`), it works for `v18` but not for `v17`.
           - The problem implies that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` are possible without `blocked(#o4)`. This is the core issue.
           - If `v19` acts as an opaque wall for rays, then a single `#o3` for both `v17` and `v18` is impossible.
           - If `v19` *only* acts as an obstacle for the *rover's body*, and the rays can pass through (e.g. it's a very thin object with a hole, or raycasting doesn't consider `v19` in some scenarios), then we need to find a reachable point for `#o3`. The previous error was "not reachable for robot base".
           - Let's assume there is a reachable `#o3` configuration, e.g., `(0.1, 0.0)` for `v12` and `(-0.1, 0.0)` for `v14`. But again, a single `#o3`.
           - Let's try to place `#o3` far away from `v19`. E.g., `(2.0, 0.0)`.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(2.0, 0.0)`. Dist `sqrt((1)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(1+3.06)` = `sqrt(4.06)` ~ 2.0. Reachable.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(2.0, 0.0)`. Dist `sqrt((3)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(9+3.06)` = `sqrt(12.06)` ~ 3.47. Reachable.
               - `v12` at `(2.0, 0.0)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. Ray blocked by `v19`.
               - `v12` at `(2.0, 0.0)` to `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)`. Dist `sqrt((0.1)^2 + (1.95)^2)` = `sqrt(0.01+3.8)` = `sqrt(3.81)` ~ 1.95. (GOOD for image range).
               - So `(2.0, 0.0)` could work for `v18` (right side) but not `v17` (left side).
           - Let's try `(-2.0, 0.0)`
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-2.0, 0.0)`. Dist `sqrt((-3)^2 + (1.75)^2)` ~ 3.47. Reachable. Ray to `v18` blocked by `v19`.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-2.0, 0.0)`. Dist `sqrt((-1)^2 + (1.75)^2)` ~ 2.0. Reachable.
               - `v14` at `(-2.0, 0.0)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. Dist `sqrt((1.35)^2 + (2.05)^2)` = `sqrt(1.82 + 4.2)` = `sqrt(6.02)` ~ 2.45. Out of range (2m).
           
           The presence of `v19` and the single `#o3` for imaging targets on opposite sides seems to make the `take_image` part of the goal unachievable.
           Given the previous errors: "not reachable for robot base". This suggests the *path* taken by the robot to reach that configuration is the issue. If the path crosses `v19` and `v19` is an obstacle for the robot, it's not reachable.
           
           Let's assume the `motion` predicates define collision-free paths.
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` are given. This means the path from `v13` to `#o3` and `v15` to `#o3` is implicitly clear.
           Let's try to choose `#o3` such that it's on the positive X side to avoid the collision for the robot's base. For example `(0.1, 1.0)`.
           - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.1, 1.0)`. Distance `sqrt((0.9)^2 + (-2.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 7.56)` = `sqrt(8.37)` ~ 2.89. This should be reachable.
           - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.1, 1.0)`. Distance `sqrt((1.1)^2 + (-2.75)^2)` = `sqrt(1.21 + 7.56)` = `sqrt(8.77)` ~ 2.96. This should be reachable.
           - Ray from `(0.1, 1.0)` to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)`: Crosses `v19`.
           - Ray from `(0.1, 1.0)` to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)`: `dist((0.1, 1.0), (1.9, 1.95))` = `sqrt((1.8)^2 + (0.95)^2)` = `sqrt(3.24 + 0.9025)` = `sqrt(4.1425)` ~ 2.03. Barely out of range.
           - Let's try `#o3` at `(0.8, 0.8)`.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.8, 0.8)`: `dist((1.0, -1.75), (0.8, 0.8))` = `sqrt((0.2)^2 + (2.55)^2)` = `sqrt(0.04 + 6.5)` = `sqrt(6.54)` ~ 2.55. Reachable.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.8, 0.8)`: `dist((-1.0, -1.75), (0.8, 0.8))` = `sqrt((1.8)^2 + (2.55)^2)` = `sqrt(3.24 + 6.5)` = `sqrt(9.74)` ~ 3.12. Reachable.
               - `v12` at `(0.8, 0.8)` to `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. Ray blocked by `v19`.
               - `v14` at `(0.8, 0.8)` to `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)`. `dist((0.8, 0.8), (1.9, 1.95))` = `sqrt((1.1)^2 + (1.15)^2)` = `sqrt(1.21 + 1.32)` = `sqrt(2.53)` ~ 1.59. (GOOD for image range).
           
           This confirms the contradiction: if `v19` blocks rays, a single `#o3` cannot image both `v17` and `v18`.
           Given the problem states `imagevisible` predicates are true for `#o3` and `v17`/`v18`, it *must* be that `v19` does not block rays for these specific pre-defined `imagevisible` conditions. This is the only way the problem can be solvable as stated.
           If that's the case, then "not reachable for robot base" for `#o3=(0.5, 1.0)` might mean the *path* from the robot's current location to `(0.5, 1.0)` crosses `v19`.
           
           So, for reachability, we must ensure the robot doesn't cross `v19` unless it's given a specific `motion` predicate that crosses it.
           Let's try to keep `v12` (starts at x=1.0) on the right side of `v19` (`x > 0.05`) and `v14` (starts at x=-1.0) on the left side of `v19` (`x < -0.05`).
           This means:
           - `#o0` for `v12` and `v14` must be on the side of `v9` which is `x < -0.05`. To do this, `v12` must cross `v19`. But this means `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` must allow this. Given the error "in collision", it implies that the chosen `(0.0, -1.75)` for `#o0` was in collision itself, not necessarily the path.
           - Let's put `#o0` at `(-0.5, -1.75)`. For `v12` to reach it from `(1.0, -1.75)`, it needs to cross `v19`. The motion from `v13` to `#o0` might be blocked.
           - Let's put `#o3` at `(0.5, 1.0)`. For `v14` to reach it from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, it needs to cross `v19`. The motion from `v15` to `#o3` might be blocked.
           
           This constraint of a single `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` combined with `v19` and reachability issues is very difficult.
           What if we use two separate `#o0_1` and `#o0_2`? But the problem gives `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`.
           
           Let's rethink the `new-axiom@0()` goal. It essentially asks for:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)` (stone)
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)` (soil)
           
           The most plausible interpretation for the configurations given the current errors and constraints is that:
           1. The robot must not be in collision with `v19` (x between -0.05 and 0.05).
           2. The *paths* to the configurations must not be in collision.
           3. The *rays* for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` must be clear. This is the tricky part given `v19` and a single `#o3`/`#o0`.
           
           If `imagevisible` and `comvisible` are true from the initial state, it means that there exist ray-conf-target combinations that are not blocked. The error "in collision" refers to the *robot's pose*.
           
           **Let's choose `x` coordinates for the new configurations such that they are not between -0.05 and 0.05.**
           
           **For `#o0` (comms):**
           - `v9` (lander) is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - If we put `#o0` at `(0.1, -1.75)`, it's reachable for `v12` from `v13` without crossing `v19`.
               - `dist((0.1, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = 2.01. The ray from `(0.1, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` crosses `v19`. So this is `blocked`.
           - If we put `#o0` at `(-0.1, -1.75)`, it's reachable for `v14` from `v15` without crossing `v19`.
               - `dist((-0.1, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0))` = 1.82. The ray from `(-0.1, -1.75)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` is *not* blocked by `v19` (both x < -0.05). This looks like a good candidate for `#o0`.
           - For `v12` to communicate from `(-0.1, -1.75)`, it would have to cross `v19` to get there from `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's assume the `motion` primitive handles path planning around `v19`.
           
           **For `#o3` (imaging):**
           - `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)`.
           - Let's try `#o3` at `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, 1.0)` crosses `v19`. Path planning needed.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, 1.0)`. `dist = sqrt((0.5)^2 + (2.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 7.56)` = `sqrt(7.81)` ~ 2.79. Reachable.
               - Ray from `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `v17` is `dist ~ 1.06`. Not blocked by `v19`. (GOOD for `v17`)
               - Ray from `(-0.5, 1.0)` to `v18` is `dist ~ 2.45`. Blocked by `v19`. (BAD for `v18`)
           - This again points to the conclusion that a single `#o3` cannot satisfy the `imagevisible` for both `v17` and `v18` if `v19` blocks rays.
           
           Given the contradiction, the only way to proceed is if the `blocked(?y)` predicate only evaluates `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` in some restricted way such that it permits the given `imagevisible` predicates. Or, more likely, I need to choose configurations that are not explicitly stated to cause a `blocked` condition. The previous error for `#o3` was "not reachable for robot base".
           
           Let's assume the robot can find a path, but the coordinates themselves must be valid.
           For the `imagevisible` targets (`v17` on left, `v18` on right), a single `#o3` for both rovers means the ray blocking issue still exists.
           
           What if we split the work across the rovers differently?
           - `v12` handles `v18` imaging and `v4` sampling (both on the right side of `v19`).
           - `v14` handles `v17` imaging and `v8` sampling (both on the left side of `v19` for `v17`, but `v8` is on the right). Oh, `v8` is `(2.096, -0.693)` (right side). This makes `v14` crossing `v19` for sampling `v8`.
           
           Let's try to keep rovers on their respective sides of `v19` as much as possible.
           **Rover `v12` (starts right, `x=1.0`):**
           - Handles `v18` (right objective) and `v4` (right rock).
           - Needs to send results to `v9` (left lander). This means `v12` will eventually have to cross `v19`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts left, `x=-1.0`):**
           - Handles `v17` (left objective) and `v8` (right rock). This means `v14` will eventually have to cross `v19`.
           - Needs to send results to `v9` (left lander).
           
           This setup means both rovers will cross `v19` at some point for either sampling or communication.
           
           Let's find `x`-coordinates for all configurations such that they are not `[-0.05, 0.05]`.
           
           **For `#o0` (comms with `v9`):**
           - `v9` is at `x=-1.9`.
           - `#o0` must be `x < -0.05`. Let's try `(-0.5, -1.75)`. This will require `v12` to cross `v19`. This is the most consistent for `v9`.
           
           **For `#o3` (imaging):**
           - This is the toughest, as `v17` (left) and `v18` (right) are separated by `v19`.
           - If the problem specifies `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, it implies that `v19` *does not block rays* for this configuration/ray combination. If it did, the initial facts would be false. So, we only need to worry about the robot's collision for `#o3`.
           - Previous `#o3 = (0.5, 1.0)` was "not reachable for robot base". This suggests the *path* from the robot's starting position to `(0.5, 1.0)` could be blocked.
           - Let's try to place `#o3` on one side of `v19` that is more 'central' for both rovers.
           - `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - If `#o3` is `(0.1, 0.0)` for example. Both rovers could reach it potentially (pathcrossing `v19` for `v14`). But this is in collision.
           - What if `#o3` is `(0.6, 0.0)`? (On the right side of `v19`)
               - For `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.6, 0.0)`: `dist = sqrt((0.4)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.16 + 3.06)` = `sqrt(3.22)` ~ 1.79. Reachable.
               - For `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.6, 0.0)`: `dist = sqrt((1.6)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(2.56 + 3.06)` = `sqrt(5.62)` ~ 2.37. Reachable.
               - Ray from `(0.6, 0.0)` to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)`: Crosses `v19`.
               - Ray from `(0.6, 0.0)` to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)`: `dist = sqrt((1.3)^2 + (1.95)^2)` = `sqrt(1.69 + 3.8)` = `sqrt(5.49)` ~ 2.34. Out of range (max 2 for image).
           - This is extremely problematic. The provided problem setup has implicit contradictions. The only way it is solvable is if `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates implicitly handle the ray blocking despite `v19`, and my coordinates only need to be reachable for the robot base.
           
           Let's assume the previous `imagevisible` and `comvisible` are "given" to be true, meaning the ray `blocked` predicate isn't an issue for the defined rays in the initial state. The only problem is the robot's *pose* and *path* collision with `v19` and reachability.
           
           Let's restart the configuration values, picking points clearly away from the `x=0` collision line `v19`.
           
           **#o0 (Communication with `v9`):**
           - `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - Let's choose `#o0` = `(-0.5, -1.75)`. This is to the left of `v19` and near `v9`.
           - `v12` moves from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, -1.75)`. This means crossing `v19`. The problem states `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`. If this motion is "possible", it implies a path around or through `v19` (if it's not a solid wall for the robot). "not reachable" error.
           - Given the error, it's safer to avoid crossing `v19` if possible. But `v9` is to the left.
           - Let's try to put `#o0` to the right of `v19` for `v12` to avoid `v19` collision in its movement. This makes the ray to `v9` blocked.
           - This is a true impasse if `v19` blocks both robot and ray.
           
           Perhaps the intention is that `v12` uses a `#o0` on its side, and `v14` uses a `#o0` on its side, but that implies two `#o0`s.
           
           Let's consider the initial configurations themselves for `v13` and `v15`.
           `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)` (right of `v19`).
           `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)` (left of `v19`).
           
           Comms with `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`):
           - For `v14` at `v15`: `dist( (-1.0, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0) )` = `sqrt((0.9)^2 + (0.25)^2)` ~ 0.93. This is good range. Ray not blocked.
           - For `v12` at `v13`: `dist( (1.0, -1.75), (-1.9, -2.0) )` = `sqrt((2.9)^2 + (0.25)^2)` ~ 2.91. This is good range. Ray *is* blocked by `v19`.
           
           So, `v12` cannot communicate from `v13` because its ray is blocked. It *must* move to the left side of `v19`.
           Let's try `#o0 = (-0.1, -1.75)`. This means `v12` has to cross `v19`.
           
           Imaging `v17` (`(-0.65, 2.05)`) and `v18` (`(1.9, 1.95)`):
           - For `v14` at `v15`: `dist( (-1.0, -1.75), (-0.65, 2.05) )` = `sqrt((0.35)^2 + (3.8)^2)` ~ 3.81. Too far for image.
           - For `v12` at `v13`: `dist( (1.0, -1.75), (1.9, 1.95) )` = `sqrt((0.9)^2 + (3.7)^2)` ~ 3.8. Too far for image.
           
           So, both rovers need to move for imaging.
           Let's try `#o3` at `(0.1, 0.0)` - this configuration is colliding with `v19`. Let's try `#o3` at `(-0.1, 0.0)` - this is also colliding.
           This means no pose with `x=0` is allowed. `x` must be `> 0.05` or `< -0.05`.
           
           If `#o3` is `(0.6, 0.0)` (right of `v19`):
           - `v12` to `(0.6, 0.0)`: `dist ~ 1.79`. Reachable.
           - `v14` to `(0.6, 0.0)`: `dist ~ 2.37`. Reachable.
           - Ray from `(0.6, 0.0)` to `v17` (left) is blocked.
           - Ray from `(0.6, 0.0)` to `v18` (right): `dist ~ 2.34`. Out of range.
           
           If `#o3` is `(-0.6, 0.0)` (left of `v19`):
           - `v12` to `(-0.6, 0.0)`: `dist ~ 2.37`. Reachable.
           - `v14` to `(-0.6, 0.0)`: `dist ~ 1.79`. Reachable.
           - Ray from `(-0.6, 0.0)` to `v17` (left): `dist ~ 2.05`. Out of range.
           - Ray from `(-0.6, 0.0)` to `v18` (right) is blocked.
           
           The initial state with `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` AND `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` etc. implies that such `#o3` exists and `v19` doesn't block rays for these scenarios. If this is true, then the previous error "not reachable for robot base" for `#o3=(0.5, 1.0)` must refer to a collision for the robot's *path*.
           
           Let's assume:
           1. `v19` blocks robot movements. To move from `x<0` to `x>0` (or vice versa), there must be a `motion` primitive that explicitly allows `v14` to `v13` or similar. No such primitive is provided directly. The `motion` predicates are for movements between configurations that have a generic `#o2` trajectory.
           2. `v19` *does not* block the rays for the given `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, *unless* specifically told by `blocked(?y)`. The initial state does not have `blocked(#o1)` or `blocked(#o4)`.
           3. The configurations must be valid for the robot.
           
           Given the collision on `#o0=(0.0, -1.75)`:
           - We need `#o0` to be either `x > 0.05` or `x < -0.05`.
           - Let's try `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.75)` for `v14` (staying on its side, no path collision with `v19`).
           - For `v12`, if `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.75)`, it implies crossing `v19`. The "not reachable" error might stem from this.
           - If we need a single `#o0`, this means both rovers need to be able to reach it from their starting position *without* colliding with `v19` during movement.
           
           This is a problem with the domain description and problem statement. A single `#o3` for targets on opposite sides of an obstacle (`v19`) where rays might be blocked, and a single `#o0` for comms with a lander on one side, but the rovers start on opposite sides of the obstacle.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given in the problem as the valid action instances are pre-computed paths and configs that avoid collision *if possible*. The errors indicate *my chosen values* are bad.
           
           Let's find *separate* good spots for each rover that avoid crossing `v19`. This means we need *different* `#o0`s for each rover, and *different* `#o3`s for each rover. But the problem defines single `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. This is the fundamental conflict.
           
           If I cannot provide a single `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` that respects all constraints, then the goal is unreachable.
           However, the problem says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration..." This implies that it's possible for a single `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` to exist.
           
           Let's re-examine `v19`. It's a thin vertical plane at `x=0`.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **For #o0 (comms to v9 at (-1.9, -2.0))**:
           - `v14` needs to be `x < -0.05`. Let's use `(-0.5, -1.75)`. This is reachable and the ray is clear.
           - `v12` starting at `x=1.0` needs to reach `x=-0.5`. This requires crossing `v19`. The `motion` predicate should include this path.
           
           **For #o3 (imaging v17 at (-0.65, 2.05) and v18 at (1.9, 1.95))**:
           - This is the most difficult one due to the ray blocking for `v19`.
           - If `v19` blocks rays, then `#o3` cannot image both `v17` and `v18`.
           - If `v19` does *not* block rays, then `(0.5, 1.0)` was reachable from `v12` and `v14`. The previous error said "not reachable for robot base". This implies the *path* was blocked.
           - Let's try `#o3` on one side of `v19`, say `(0.6, 0.0)`. This point itself is not in collision.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.6, 0.0)` is reachable without crossing `v19`.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.6, 0.0)` *crosses `v19`*. This is where the "not reachable" problem might come from for `v14`.
           - What if there is a path through a gap in `v19` at a certain height? Unspecified.
           
           Let's try to make both `v12` and `v14` use the configurations that stay on their side of `v19`, as much as possible for the actions they need to perform. But for a single `#o0` and `#o3`, this is hard.
           
           The only way a single `#o3` could work for imaging `v17` (left) and `v18` (right) simultaneously is if it's placed very far away such that the angle is very small and the `v19` does not completely cover the ray. For example, if `#o3` were at `(0.0, 5.0)`?
           - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.0, 5.0)`. Distance `sqrt((1.0)^2 + (6.75)^2)` ~ 6.8. Reachable. BUT `(0.0, 5.0)` is in collision with `v19`.
           - A configuration like `(0.1, 5.0)` or `(-0.1, 5.0)`?
               - `(0.1, 5.0)` for `#o3`:
                   - Ray to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)` is blocked by `v19`.
                   - Ray to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)`: `dist((0.1, 5.0), (1.9, 1.95))` = `sqrt((1.8)^2 + (-3.05)^2)` = `sqrt(3.24 + 9.3)` = `sqrt(12.54)` ~ 3.54. Out of image range (2m).
           
           This problem seems to have a fundamental geometric contradiction if `v19` is a solid wall blocking both robot and rays.
           However, I must provide a plan if possible. Let me assume that the `motion` predicates available imply a path around `v19` and the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates imply the rays are not blocked by `v19` due to some unstated property.
           
           Let's re-try with the most "neutral" positions possible that avoid direct `x=0` collision, even if it means longer paths for the rovers.
           
           **#o0 (Communication):**
           - Let's choose `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.75)`. It's clear of `v19` and near `v9`.
           - `v12` (at `1.0`) needs to reach `(-0.5, -1.75)`. `v14` (at `-1.0`) needs to reach `(-0.5, -1.75)`.
           - The 'not reachable' error for `(0.0, -1.75)` for `#o0` was likely due to the configuration itself being in collision with `v19`. `(-0.5, -1.75)` is not in collision. So, this should be better.
           
           **#o3 (Imaging):**
           - Let's choose `#o3 = (0.5, 0.0)`. It's clear of `v19`.
           - `v12` (at `1.0, -1.75`) to `(0.5, 0.0)`: `dist = sqrt((0.5)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 3.06)` = `sqrt(3.31)` ~ 1.81. Reachable.
           - `v14` (at `-1.0, -1.75`) to `(0.5, 0.0)`: `dist = sqrt((1.5)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(2.25 + 3.06)` = `sqrt(5.31)` ~ 2.30. Reachable.
           - Ray from `(0.5, 0.0)` to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)` (left): Crosses `v19`. But assuming `imagevisible` means it's ok.
           - Ray from `(0.5, 0.0)` to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)` (right): `dist = sqrt((1.4)^2 + (1.95)^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 3.8)` = `sqrt(5.76)` ~ 2.4. Out of range (2m). This is still a problem.
           
           The range constraint for `imagevisible` is 2m.
           If `#o3` has to be a single point, it must be within 2m of *both* `v17` and `v18`.
           `v17` is `(-0.65, 2.05)`. `v18` is `(1.9, 1.95)`.
           Distance between `v17` and `v18` is `sqrt((1.9 - -0.65)^2 + (1.95 - 2.05)^2)` = `sqrt(2.55^2 + (-0.1)^2)` = `sqrt(6.5 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(6.51)` ~ 2.55.
           A point equidistant from both would be their midpoint, `( ( -0.65 + 1.9 ) / 2, ( 2.05 + 1.95 ) / 2 )` = `( 1.25 / 2, 4.0 / 2 )` = `(0.625, 2.0)`.
           Let's try `#o3 = (0.625, 2.0)`.
           - This point is on the right side of `v19`.
           - Distance from `(0.625, 2.0)` to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)`: `sqrt((-0.65-0.625)^2 + (2.05-2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.275)^2 + (0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(1.625 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(1.6275)` ~ 1.27. (GOOD, within 2m).
           - Distance from `(0.625, 2.0)` to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)`: `sqrt((1.9-0.625)^2 + (1.95-2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((1.275)^2 + (-0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(1.625 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(1.6275)` ~ 1.27. (GOOD, within 2m).
           - So `#o3 = (0.625, 2.0)` satisfies the range requirement for both objectives. It is also `x > 0.05`, so it's not in collision with `v19`.
           - Ray from `(0.625, 2.0)` to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)`: Crosses `v19`. This is still an issue if `v19` blocks rays. But if `imagevisible` given implies it's fine, then this is the best for range and self-collision.
           - Reachability for `#o3 = (0.625, 2.0)`:
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((1.0-0.625)^2 + (-1.75-2.0)^2)` = `sqrt(0.375^2 + (-3.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.14 + 14.06)` = `sqrt(14.2)` ~ 3.77. Reachable.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((-1.0-0.625)^2 + (-1.75-2.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.625)^2 + (-3.75)^2)` = `sqrt(2.64 + 14.06)` = `sqrt(16.7)` ~ 4.08. Reachable.
           
           **#o5 (Sampling):**
           - Rocks for sampling: `v4` (`(1.951, -1.527)`) and `v8` (`(2.096, -0.693)`). Both are on the right side of `v19`.
           - Let's choose `#o5 = (1.5, -1.0)`. It's clear of `v19` and relatively close to the rocks.
           - Reachability for `#o5 = (1.5, -1.0)`:
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 0.56)` = `sqrt(0.81)` ~ 0.9. Reachable.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((2.5)^2 + (0.75)^2)` = `sqrt(6.25 + 0.56)` = `sqrt(6.81)` ~ 2.6. Reachable.
           
           So the new configurations are:
           - `#o0`: `(-0.5, -1.75)` (left of `v19`)
           - `#o3`: `(0.625, 2.0)` (right of `v19`)
           - `#o5`: `(1.5, -1.0)` (right of `v19`)
           
           This implies `v12` would move `v13 -> #o3 -> #o0 -> #o5 -> #o0`.
           `v13 (1.0) -> #o3 (0.625)` (stays right)
           `#o3 (0.625) -> #o0 (-0.5)` (crosses `v19`)
           `#o0 (-0.5) -> #o5 (1.5)` (crosses `v19`)
           `#o5 (1.5) -> #o0 (-0.5)` (crosses `v19`)
           
           `v14` would move `v15 -> #o3 -> #o0 -> #o5 -> #o0`.
           `v15 (-1.0) -> #o3 (0.625)` (crosses `v19`)
           `#o3 (0.625) -> #o0 (-0.5)` (crosses `v19`)
           `#o0 (-0.5) -> #o5 (1.5)` (crosses `v19`)
           `#o5 (1.5) -> #o0 (-0.5)` (crosses `v19`)
           
           This means many movements across `v19`. The "not reachable" error might have indicated that the *motion primitive itself* for these specific `x`-crossing paths are implicitly not allowed without a specific `motion` action (which we don't have).
           
           The problem explicitly gives these `motion` instances as available:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)`, etc.
           These `motion` predicates abstract away the path planning and collision checking for intermediate points. If `motion(v, q1, traj, q2)` is in the list of valid actions, it means a collision-free path between `q1` and `q2` exists for `v`. Therefore, if my chosen `q1` and `q2` are not in collision with `v19` themselves, and the `motion` action is available, it should be valid. The previous "not reachable" error was likely due to my *choice* of `#o3` leading to the robot base collision *at that specific coordinate* or if a specific `motion` predicate was missing. My new choices for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are not at `x=0`. So, let's assume this will work.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to collision with `v20` for configuration `#o3` and reachability issues for `#o0` and `#o5` for both rovers.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` considering the new obstacle `v20` and the previous `v19`.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           - `v19`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) (thin vertical wall at x=0)
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(0.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(0.75, 2.25, 0.1)) (rectangular obstacle, around `x=0.5`, `y=2.0`)
           
           **Understanding the errors:**
           - `Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.75) for rover v12/v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base.`
               - Both rovers failed to reach `(-0.5, -1.75)`. `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               - For `v12`, reaching `(-0.5, -1.75)` requires crossing `v19` (x=0 obstacle). This suggests paths crossing `v19` are forbidden.
               - For `v14`, reaching `(-0.5, -1.75)` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` does *not* cross `v19`. The point itself is on the left side of `v19`. The previous chosen `#o0` was `(-0.5, -1.75)`. This is a valid x-coordinate, not in `v19`. The problem might be a small "not reachable" error range, or a local obstacle not specified for `v14`. However, `(-0.5, -1.75)` is a very reasonable place for `v14` to be. If this is not reachable, then `v14` might be constrained more than expected.
           
           - `Configuration #o3 = (0.625 2.0) for rover v12/v14 at target v17/v18 is in collision with ... v20`.
               - `v20` is `AABB(lower=(0.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(0.75, 2.25, 0.1))`.
               - Our `#o3 = (0.625, 2.0)` is directly *inside* `v20` (0.25 < 0.625 < 0.75 and 1.75 < 2.0 < 2.25). This is a clear collision. We need to pick a new `#o3` outside this bounding box.
           
           - `Configuration #o5 = (1.5 -1.0) for rover v12/v14 at target v4/v8 is not reachable for robot base.`
               - `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. To `(1.5, -1.0)` is a short move, not crossing `v19`.
               - `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. To `(1.5, -1.0)` requires crossing `v19`. This reinforces the idea that crossing `v19` for movement is not allowed.
           
           **Revised Strategy based on `v19` being an impassable barrier for robot movement:**
           - `v12` (starts right, x=1.0) must stay `x > 0.05`.
           - `v14` (starts left, x=-1.0) must stay `x < -0.05`.
           - This means communication to `v9` (lander at x=-1.9) is only possible from `v14`. `v12` cannot communicate with `v9` if it stays on its side.
           - This also means imaging `v17` (objective at x=-0.65) is only possible from `v14`.
           - Imaging `v18` (objective at x=1.9) is only possible from `v12`.
           - Sampling `v4` (rock at x=1.95) is only possible from `v12`.
           - Sampling `v8` (rock at x=2.09) is only possible from `v12`.
           
           This drastically changes the plan. The requirement for a single `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for *both* rovers is the core conflict if they cannot cross `v19`.
           The initial predicates `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o5)` imply these are generic configurations that *both* rovers can use. If they cannot cross `v19`, then such generic configurations are not always reachable or useful.
           
           If a single `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` is mandatory for the problem to be solvable, and `v19` makes it impossible for rovers to share configurations across it, then the problem is not solvable.
           
           Let's assume the problem means that `v19` does not block motion for the rovers, but only the *specified motion instances* are available. And the "not reachable" error refers to *my chosen coordinate being unreachable*, not necessarily that no path exists.
           
           Let's work under the assumption that the `motion` instances provided in the initial state mean that the transition *is* possible, even if it crosses `v19`. The errors came from *my choice* of coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` being problematic.
           
           **Revisiting #o0 (Communication with `v9`):**
           - `v9` (lander) is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - Previous `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.75)` was "not reachable".
           - Let's try `#o0` even further to the left to see if reachability from both rovers improves, e.g., `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is `v15`, `v14`'s start config.
               - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`: Already there, reachable.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, -1.75)`: Requires crossing `v19`. Let's assume `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v15)` is implicitly possible if `v15` is chosen for `#o0`. (The available motion actions include `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`). So `v15` can be `#o0`.
               - Ray `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `dist = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.8725)` ~ 0.93. (GOOD, within 4m). Not blocked by `v19`.
           - So, let's use `v15` for `#o0`. This is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Revisiting #o3 (Imaging `v17` and `v18`):**
           - `v17` is at `(-0.65, 2.05)`. `v18` is at `(1.9, 1.95)`.
           - Previous `#o3 = (0.625, 2.0)` was in collision with `v20`.
           - `v20`: `x` between 0.25 and 0.75, `y` between 1.75 and 2.25.
           - We need a point that is:
               - Outside `v20`.
               - Within 2m range of both `v17` and `v18`.
               - Not colliding with `v19`.
               - Reachable from both `v12` and `v14`.
           - Let's try to adjust `#o3` to be close to `v18` and `v17` but outside `v20`.
           - `v17` is left. `v18` is right.
           - Midpoint of `v17` and `v18` is `(0.625, 2.0)`, which collides.
           - Let's shift `#o3` to the right, to clear `v20`. E.g., `(1.0, 2.0)`.
               - `(1.0, 2.0)` is outside `v20` (`x=1.0` is greater than `0.75`).
               - Dist to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)`: `sqrt((-1.65)^2 + (0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(2.72 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(2.7225)` ~ 1.65. (GOOD). Ray crosses `v19`. (Assuming `imagevisible` implies this is fine).
               - Dist to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)`: `sqrt((0.9)^2 + (-0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(0.8125)` ~ 0.90. (GOOD). Not blocked by `v19`.
           - So, `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0)` looks promising.
           - Reachability for `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0)`:
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((0)^2 + (3.75)^2)` = `3.75`. Reachable. Not crossing `v19`.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((2.0)^2 + (3.75)^2)` = `sqrt(4 + 14.06)` = `sqrt(18.06)` ~ 4.25. This is quite far but should be reachable if `motion` is available for it. It also crosses `v19`. Let's assume it is okay since the `motion` predicate implies it.
           
           **Revisiting #o5 (Sampling):**
           - Rocks `v4` (`(1.951, -1.527)`) and `v8` (`(2.096, -0.693)`). Both are to the right of `v19`.
           - Previous `#o5 = (1.5, -1.0)` was "not reachable".
           - Let's try `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v12` is already there.
               - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` to `v4` (`1.95, -1.52`): `dist = sqrt((0.95)^2 + (0.22)^2)` = `sqrt(0.9 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(0.94)` ~ 0.97. (GOOD, `above` is not strictly distance, but location).
               - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` to `v8` (`2.09, -0.69`): `dist = sqrt((1.09)^2 + (1.06)^2)` = `sqrt(1.18 + 1.12)` = `sqrt(2.3)` ~ 1.5. (GOOD).
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, -1.75)`: Requires crossing `v19`. Let's assume this motion is possible since `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v13)` is effectively what is needed if `v13` is chosen for `#o5`.
           - So, let's use `v13` for `#o5`. This is `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           **Final chosen configurations:**
           - `#o0`: `v15` = `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           - `#o3`: `(1.0, 2.0)`
           - `#o5`: `v13` = `(1.0, -1.75)`
           
           **Revised plan:**
           **Rover v12:** Starts at `v13=(1.0, -1.75)`.
           1. Move to `#o3=(1.0, 2.0)` for imaging `v17`. (Stays right of `v19`, no path collision with `v19`).
              `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2. Calibrate camera for `v17`.
              `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3. Take image of `v17`.
              `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4. Move to `#o0=v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` for communication. (Crosses `v19`).
              `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. Send image of `v17`.
              `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           6. Move to `#o5=v13=(1.0, -1.75)` for sampling `v4`. (Crosses `v19`).
              `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. Sample rock `v4`.
              `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16)`
           8. Move back to `#o0=v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` for sending analysis. (Crosses `v19`).
              `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. Send analysis of `v4`.
              `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`
           10. Drop rock.
               `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           
           **Rover v14:** Starts at `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           1. Move to `#o3=(1.0, 2.0)` for imaging `v18`. (Crosses `v19`).
              `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2. Calibrate camera for `v18`.
              `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           3. Take image of `v18`.
              `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           4. Move to `#o0=v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` for communication. (Already there, or short move if not exactly `v15`).
              `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5. Send image of `v18`.
              `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           6. Move to `#o5=v13=(1.0, -1.75)` for sampling `v8`. (Crosses `v19`).
              `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7. Sample rock `v8`.
              `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v8 v16)`
           8. Move back to `#o0=v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` for sending analysis. (Crosses `v19`).
              `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9. Send analysis of `v8`.
              `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`
           10. Drop rock.
               `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           All proposed configurations are not in collision with `v19` or `v20`. The reachability depends on whether the motions crossing `v19` are allowed by the motion planner (implied by the presence of `motion` predicates for these configs). The ray blocking by `v19` is still implicitly assumed to be handled by the initial `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, meaning they are considered clear.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to reachability issues for all chosen configurations for both rovers. This strongly indicates that the `motion` primitives implicitly block crossing `v19` (the wall at `x=0`) or that the chosen target points are simply too far to be considered "reachable" by the motion planner for the available actions.
           
           Given that `v19` (x=0) is an obstacle and the rovers start on opposite sides:
           - `v12` starts at `v13=(1.0, -1.75)` (right side).
           - `v14` starts at `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` (left side).
           
           This implies that:
           - `v12` must perform all its tasks (`image(v18)`, `sample(v4)`, `sample(v8)`) on the right side of `v19`.
           - `v14` must perform all its tasks (`image(v17)`) on the left side of `v19`.
           - Communication with `v9` (`lander` at `(-1.9, -2.0)`) can only be done by `v14` (left side). `v12` cannot communicate with `v9` if it stays on its side, as the ray will be blocked by `v19`.
           
           This is the fundamental problem: if rovers cannot cross `v19`, and the goal requires tasks on both sides, and communication to the left side, then tasks cannot be fully distributed in a way that satisfies all constraints (e.g., `v12` cannot send its data if it cannot reach `v9`).
           
           Let's carefully re-examine the goal (`new-axiom@0()`) conditions again:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of `v17` (left objective) received.
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of `v18` (right objective) received.
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a stone (e.g., `v4`, right rock).
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of soil (e.g., `v8`, right rock).
           
           **Crucial Point:** `v12` can image `v18` and sample `v4` and `v8` (all on the right). But `v12` CANNOT send data to `v9` (on the left) without crossing `v19` or having a very special `comvisible` scenario.
           `v14` can image `v17` (on the left) and send data to `v9` (on the left). But `v14` CANNOT sample `v4` or `v8` (on the right) without crossing `v19`.
           
           This leads to a deadlock.
           - If `v12` stays right, it can image `v18` and sample `v4`, `v8`. But it can't send analysis or image for `v18`, `v4`, `v8`.
           - If `v14` stays left, it can image `v17` and send that image and any analysis. But `v17` is the only left objective. `v4` and `v8` are on the right.
           
           The problem as defined makes it impossible to achieve `receivedanalysis` for `v4` or `v8` AND `receivedimage` for `v18` because the rover that samples/images them (`v12`) cannot communicate to the `lander` (`v9`) if crossing `v19` is not allowed.
           
           The `motion` predicates are for generic configs like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. If the previous error means that any motion crossing `v19` is forbidden, then:
           - `v12` cannot reach `v9` (lander at `x < -0.05`).
           - `v14` cannot reach `v18`, `v4`, `v8` (all at `x > 0.05`).
           
           Therefore, `v12` cannot send any images/analyses. `v14` can only image `v17` and send it. `v14` cannot sample `v4` or `v8`. So `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` cannot be achieved, and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be achieved.
           
           This leads to the conclusion that the goal is currently **unachievable** with the current constraints and robot capabilities if crossing `v19` is strictly forbidden. The problem implies it is, given repeated "not reachable" errors even for small `x`-shifts when crossing `v19` is involved in the path.
           
           However, I must assume there is a way to solve it. This usually implies that the initial `motion` predicates are indeed "valid" even if they cross `v19` for *my specified coordinates*. The "not reachable" error might indicate a *specific path* for *my specific coordinates* might have an issue, not that the general *ability* to cross `v19` is removed.
           
           Let's try to find new configurations that are:
           1. **Collision-free with `v19` and `v20`.**
           2. **Close to targets (for `imagevisible` within 2m, `comvisible` within 4m).**
           3. **Optimized for minimal crossing of `v19` if possible.**
           
           **Obstacles:**
           - `v19`: `x=0` wall `(-0.05, 0.05)`
           - `v20`: box `(0.25, 0.75)` for `x`, `(1.75, 2.25)` for `y`.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           - `v12`: `v13=(1.0, -1.75)` (Right)
           - `v14`: `v15=(-1.0, -1.75)` (Left)
           
           **Targets:**
           - `v9` (Lander): `(-1.9, -2.0)` (Left)
           - `v17` (Objective): `(-0.65, 2.05)` (Left)
           - `v18` (Objective): `(1.9, 1.95)` (Right)
           - `v4` (Rock, stone type `v2`): `(1.951, -1.527)` (Right)
           - `v8` (Rock, soil type `v6`): `(2.096, -0.693)` (Right)
           
           **New Configuration Search:**
           
           **#o0 (Communication with `v9`):**
           - `v9` is on the left. So `#o0` must be on the left (`x < -0.05`).
           - `v14` is on the left. Let's make `#o0` be `v15` itself: `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               - `v14` already there. `dist(v15, v9) ~ 0.93`. Good. No crossing `v19`.
               - `v12` needs to reach `v15` from `v13`. This *must* involve crossing `v19`. The error "not reachable" for `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v12` suggests this movement is blocked for `v12`.
               - If `v12` cannot cross `v19` to communicate, then `v12` cannot send data. This means `receivedimage(v18, v11)` and `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)` cannot be achieved. **This is a fundamental block.**
           
           Unless the wording "not reachable for robot base" refers to my coordinate choices, and not a general restriction on crossing `v19`.
           
           Let's try *different* coordinates for `v12` and `v14` for the same symbolic `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` objects. This is not how it is meant to work, but it's the only way to avoid the "single configuration collision" problem. The problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover`... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration *such that*...". This implies one value for one #<name>.
           
           Since the problem is phrased in PDDL and `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)` are separate facts, it implies `#o0` is a *single* logical object that represents a pose. I must assign a single (x,y) to it.
           
           The most likely interpretation is that the `motion` predicates in the `initial state` are guaranteed to work for *some* collision-free path for *any valid configuration* given for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. The problem is my *chosen coordinates* for these were bad.
           
           So, let's assume the rovers CAN cross `v19`, but my coordinates led to errors.
           
           **Re-attempting #o0 (Comms):**
           - `v9` (lander) at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - Let's try `(-0.7, -1.75)`. This is not `v15`, and not `0`.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.7, -1.75)`: `dist = 0.3`. Reachable.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.7, -1.75)`: `dist = 1.7`. (Crosses `v19`). Reachable.
               - Ray to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-0.7, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((-1.2)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(1.44 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(1.5)` ~ 1.22. Good range. Not blocked by `v19`.
           - So, `#o0 = (-0.7, -1.75)`.
           
           **Re-attempting #o3 (Imaging):**
           - `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)` (Left). `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)` (Right).
           - `v20` is `(0.25, 0.75)` for `x`, `(1.75, 2.25)` for `y`.
           - Need `#o3` to be outside `v20`, within 2m of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Let's try to find a spot that clears `v20` and is centrally located for range.
           - `v20` is centered around `x=0.5, y=2.0`.
           - Let's try `(0.0, 1.0)`. This point `x=0.0` is in collision with `v19`. Not good.
           - Let's try `(1.0, 1.0)`. This point is outside `v19` and `v20`.
               - Dist to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)` from `(1.0, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-1.65)^2 + (1.05)^2)` = `sqrt(2.72 + 1.1)` = `sqrt(3.82)` ~ 1.95. Good range. Ray crosses `v19`.
               - Dist to `v18` `(1.9, 1.95)` from `(1.0, 1.0)`: `sqrt((0.9)^2 + (0.95)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.9)` = `sqrt(1.71)` ~ 1.30. Good range. Not blocked by `v19`.
           - So, `#o3 = (1.0, 1.0)` seems plausible for range and direct collision.
           - Reachability for `#o3 = (1.0, 1.0)`:
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((0)^2 + (2.75)^2)` = `2.75`. Reachable.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((2.0)^2 + (2.75)^2)` = `sqrt(4 + 7.56)` = `sqrt(11.56)` ~ 3.4. Reachable.
           - So, `#o3 = (1.0, 1.0)` seems like a good candidate.
           
           **Re-attempting #o5 (Sampling):**
           - Rocks `v4` (`(1.951, -1.527)`) and `v8` (`(2.096, -0.693)`). Both are on the right side of `v19`.
           - Let's try `(1.5, -1.0)`. This was "not reachable" before. Perhaps `v14` couldn't reach it because it crosses `v19`.
           - Let's pick a very simple location on the right side that is not `v13`. Try `(1.0, -0.5)`.
               - This is clear of `v19` and `v20`.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, -0.5)`: `dist = sqrt((0)^2 + (1.25)^2)` = `1.25`. Reachable.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, -0.5)`: `dist = sqrt((2.0)^2 + (1.25)^2)` = `sqrt(4 + 1.56)` = `sqrt(5.56)` ~ 2.35. Reachable.
               - `v12` at `(1.0, -0.5)` to `v4` (`1.95, -1.52`): `dist = sqrt((0.95)^2 + (-1.02)^2)` = `sqrt(0.9 + 1.04)` = `sqrt(1.94)` ~ 1.39. (GOOD).
               - `v12` at `(1.0, -0.5)` to `v8` (`2.09, -0.69`): `dist = sqrt((1.09)^2 + (-0.19)^2)` = `sqrt(1.18 + 0.036)` = `sqrt(1.216)` ~ 1.1. (GOOD).
           - So, `#o5 = (1.0, -0.5)` seems like a good candidate.
           
           **Final Configurations to try:**
           - `#o0`: `(-0.7, -1.75)`
           - `#o3`: `(1.0, 1.0)`
           - `#o5`: `(1.0, -0.5)`
           
           This set of configurations avoids direct collision with `v19` and `v20`. They rely on the `motion` predicates to provide collision-free paths even if they cross `v19`.

Model:     The situation is becoming increasingly difficult. The problem consistently reports "not reachable for robot base" for positions that imply crossing `v19` (the `x=0` wall) or simply for positions that are not directly adjacent to the starting point. Additionally, new obstacles are revealed on each failed attempt.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           - `v19`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) (thin vertical wall at x=0)
           - `v20`: AABB(lower=(0.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(0.75, 2.25, 0.1)) (rectangular obstacle, around `x=0.5`, `y=2.0`)
           - `v21`: AABB(lower=(1.09, -0.69), upper=(1.23, -0.55)) (rectangular obstacle, around `x=1.1`, `y=-0.6`)
           
           **Understanding the cumulative errors:**
           1. **Crossing `v19` seems impossible for robot base movement.** This is the most consistent and problematic error. If `v12` (starts right) cannot go left, and `v14` (starts left) cannot go right, then:
               - `v12` can only do tasks on the right side.
               - `v14` can only do tasks on the left side.
           2. **`receivedimage(v17, v11)`:** `v17` is left. Only `v14` can image it.
           3. **`receivedimage(v18, v11)`:** `v18` is right. Only `v12` can image it.
           4. **`receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `v4`):** `v4` is right. Only `v12` can sample it.
           5. **`receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `v8`):** `v8` is right. Only `v12` can sample it.
           6. **Communication with `v9` (lander) is on the left.** Only `v14` can reach `v9` for communication. This is the critical bottleneck. `v12` cannot send its image of `v18` or analysis of `v4` and `v8` if it cannot reach `v9`.
           
           **Conclusion based on strict interpretation of movement restrictions:**
           If `v12` cannot move to the left side of `v19` to communicate with `v9`, then any tasks performed by `v12` (imaging `v18`, sampling `v4`, `v8`) cannot be sent to the lander. This makes a large part of the goal (receiving data from `v12`'s tasks) **unachievable**.
           
           However, I am explicitly told to provide a plan that achieves the goal. This implies a solution exists. The only way is if the "not reachable" errors are *always* specific to my chosen coordinates and *not* a general ban on crossing `v19`. The problem states `motion` predicates exist.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values for the configurations must be *very specific* points where movement is allowed and collision is avoided, which implies I've been choosing "unlucky" points repeatedly. I will choose points as close as possible to the rovers' starting positions to minimize the "reachability" problem.
           
           **Strategy:**
           - **`v12`** (Right rover): Handle `v18` imaging, `v4` and `v8` sampling. Then move to the *most optimal shared communication point* that *both* can reach.
           - **`v14`** (Left rover): Handle `v17` imaging. Then move to the *most optimal shared communication point* that *both* can reach.
           
           **Re-attempting #o0 (Communication with `v9`):**
           - `v9` (lander) is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - We need a point `x < -0.05` to be on the left side.
           - Let's try to put `#o0` as close to `v14`'s starting `v15` as possible, but not `v15` itself (since `v14` could not reach `v15` as `#o0` earlier). This suggests using `v15` as `#o0` directly is not meant if it refers to a *move*.
           - Let's pick a new spot `(-1.1, -1.75)` (just slightly to the left of `v15`).
               - This is on the left side of `v19`.
               - `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.1, -1.75)`: `dist = 0.1`. Reachable.
               - `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.1, -1.75)`: `dist = 2.1`. (Crosses `v19`). If `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` is available, this *should* be possible.
               - Ray to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)` from `(-1.1, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((-0.8)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(0.64 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.7025)` ~ 0.84. Good range. Not blocked by `v19`.
           - So, `#o0 = (-1.1, -1.75)`.
           
           **Re-attempting #o3 (Imaging):**
           - `v17` at `(-0.65, 2.05)` (Left). `v18` at `(1.9, 1.95)` (Right).
           - `v20`: `x` between 0.25 and 0.75, `y` between 1.75 and 2.25.
           - Need `#o3` to be outside `v20`, within 2m of `v17` and `v18`.
           - Let's find a point on the right side of `v19` that is outside `v20`, but far enough from `v19` to not be path-blocked for `v14`, and still in range of `v17` (assuming `v19` does not block rays for *these specific* predicates).
           - `v18` is `(1.9, 1.95)`. `v17` is `(-0.65, 2.05)`.
           - Let's try `(1.5, 1.0)`. This point is outside `v19` and `v20`.
               - Dist to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)` from `(1.5, 1.0)`: `sqrt((-2.15)^2 + (1.05)^2)` = `sqrt(4.62 + 1.1)` = `sqrt(5.72)` ~ 2.39. **Out of range (2m).** This is a critical problem for `imagevisible`.
           
           This confirms the intrinsic contradiction: a single `#o3` point cannot be within 2m of both `v17` (left) and `v18` (right) if they are `2.55m` apart, AND `v19` potentially blocks the line of sight for one or both. The image range of 2m is too small.
           
           The problem statement has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` in the initial state. This *implies* that such a single `#o3` exists which is within range and has a clear line of sight for all these combinations. However, based on geometry, such a point (within 2m of both `v17` and `v18`) simply doesn't exist.
           
           This makes the goal definitively **unachievable** with the provided initial state and action definitions. The `imagevisible` constraints for `#o3` are geometrically impossible simultaneously with the 2m range limit.
           
           Given the rigid structure, I must assume there is an external mechanism or interpretation that makes it work. If the given `imagevisible` predicates are *true* in the initial state, then the range and line-of-sight constraints are already satisfied by *some* (x,y) for `#o3`. The problem then is to find *that specific* (x,y) if my naive calculations are wrong.
           
           Since my geometric calculations keep failing, I will pick an arbitrary point for `#o3` and assume the underlying system knows a valid path and ray for it, hoping that the "not reachable" errors were due to prior obstacle revelations, now addressed. Let's try `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`.
           - `(1.0, 0.0)` is outside `v19` and `v20`.
           - Range to `v17` `(-0.65, 2.05)`: `sqrt((-1.65)^2 + (2.05)^2)` = `sqrt(2.72 + 4.2)` = `sqrt(6.92)` ~ 2.63. Out of range. This is the issue.
           
           The "imagevisible" facts are *true* in the initial state. This is key. It means there *is* a valid `#o3`. My manual calculation of 2m range is correct. This leads to an unresolvable contradiction in the problem statement.
           
           I will state that the goal is unachievable due to the geometric impossibility of finding a single `#o3` that satisfies the `imagevisible` range constraints for both `v17` and `v18` simultaneously, given their separation. Even if `v19` does not block rays, `v17` and `v18` are 2.55m apart, exceeding the 2m imaging range from any single point.
