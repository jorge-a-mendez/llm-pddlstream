           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, which is a rectangle defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I know the object's dimensions are 0.07 x 0.07, and a placement is defined as (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate of center, y-coordinate of center). Stability means the object is fully contained within the surface and doesn't collide with anything else, though no obstacles or other objects are specified for checking yet.
           
           The key is that the object's bounding box changes depending on the rotation. I know the max bounding box extension will occur at pi/4 radians. Because the object is a square and is small compared to surface 0 (0.6 x 0.6), I think a simple grid approach should work fine. I'm going to start by assuming the object isn't rotated (theta=0), and calculate the allowable space on the surface. Then I'll plan for varying `theta` later.
           
           I've calculated the available x range for the initial state (`theta = 0`) to be `4.235` to `4.765`, and the y range to be `-0.565` to `-0.035`. Since I'm aiming for 50 placements, I'll start with a grid of values for theta, where the maximum angle `theta` is set to `pi/2`.
           
           For each `theta`, I need to calculate the *actual* effective boundary extent of the object, because rotating the square changes its bounding box. So, the new half width/height rotation is computed as (0.07/2)*`abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` for each rotation `theta`. I selected a grid for angle and used 5 initial theta values, calculating the x/y ranges.
           I then realized I needed 50 points total, so I added the object center point for another 5 angles.
           These new theta values are used for a last 5 points.
           
           The plan is to generate points to populate the range. The formula for point containment:
           `surf0_lx + extent <= x <= surf0_ux - extent`
           `surf0_ly + extent <= y <= surf0_uy - extent`
           
           After calculating all the placement points, I got the necessary 50 stable object placements for `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           Based on the feedback, it seems my previous containment checks for object placement were too strict, likely due to floating-point precision issues. To address this, I've revised my strategy for generating stable placements for object ID 10, which is essentially a square of side ~0.0856.
           
           The core idea is to account for the object's rotation and ensure its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains entirely within the surface AABB.  I've adjusted the calculations to be more conservative.
           
           I'm starting with surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The key is calculating the `extent`, which is half the rotated object's width (or height, since it's a square). For a square of side `s`, the extent is `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / 2`. To make the placement calculations robust against minor floating-point errors, I'm introducing a small `epsilon` (set to `1e-7`) and adjusting the valid `(x, y)` ranges:  `x_min_valid = surf_lx + extent + epsilon`, `x_max_valid = surf_ux - extent - epsilon`, and similarly for `y`.
           
           The strategy involves a systematic approach to explore various placements. For the 5 main angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2), I'll generate a 3x3 grid of `(x, y)` points within the valid ranges, totaling 45 placements.  Additionally, for 5 more angles (pi/16, 3*pi/16, 5*pi/16, 7*pi/16, 9*pi/16), I will place each object's center at the middle of the valid placement range. All of them will be placed on surface 0.
           
           The key adjustments in this revised approach are: 1) the use of a small `epsilon` in determining `x_min_valid`, `x_max_valid`, `y_min_valid`, and `y_max_valid`; 2) the systematic placement generation. These steps together will generate 50 stable placements. I will generate a list of the 50 placements. Each placement will look like: `(0, theta, x, y)`. The 0 indicates the placement is on surface 0.
