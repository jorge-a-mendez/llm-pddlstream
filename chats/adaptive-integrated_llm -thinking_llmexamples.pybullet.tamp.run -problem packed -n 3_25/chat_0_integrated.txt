User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.003, -0.287, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.495, 0.869).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.003, -0.461, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.032, 0.999).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, -0.335), (0.045, -0.239)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.152, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.679, 0.734).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.19, -0.458), (-0.115, -0.383)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.04, -0.498), (0.034, -0.424)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: I need to devise a plan to get objects v8, v12, and v14 onto v16. Simple enough, but the devil's in the details, as always. The key here is that the system provides me with a *very* restrictive set of actions.
           
           First, I digested the initial state. I see the objects, their current poses, graspable properties, stackable properties, and so on. The goal predicates define my target state: all three objects must be "on" v16. This translates into those objects being supported by v16 and at their corresponding poses on v16.
           
           Looking at the tools at my disposal, I have the usual suspects: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, etc. But here's the kicker – I'm explicitly told that only the *instances* of actions that are *given* are valid. In this case, I only have `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means the base configuration *doesn't change*, which seems immediately problematic given the need for object manipulation.
           
           I analyzed the initial state and the necessary preconditions for picking and placing objects (e.g., handempty, atpose, graspable). These actions are required to reach the goal. However, these `pick` and `place` instances aren't provided. 
           
           So the fundamental problem is that to physically move the objects, I *need* `pick` and `place` actions. However, the plan only allows me to execute *one* action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           That's the crux of the matter: The constraints on action instances are too tight. I can't build a valid plan to pick up and place the objects using the provided tools. Therefore, the goal is unreachable from the given initial state.
