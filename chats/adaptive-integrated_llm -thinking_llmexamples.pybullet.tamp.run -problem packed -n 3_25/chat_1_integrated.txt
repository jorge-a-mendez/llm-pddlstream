User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.003, -0.287, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.495, 0.869).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.19, -0.458), (-0.115, -0.383)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.04, -0.498), (0.034, -0.424)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, -0.335), (0.045, -0.239)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.152, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.679, 0.734).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.003, -0.461, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.032, 0.999).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that achieves the goal state: `on(v8, v16) and on(v12, v16) and on(v14, v16)`.  This necessitates moving three objects—v8, v12, and v14—from their initial positions on v11 to a defined location on v16.  Essentially, I need to ensure that each object is `supported` by a specific pose on v16 and occupies that pose (`atpose`).
           
           My starting point reveals several crucial aspects.  The robot has two arms, but only one, v4, is immediately relevant. Both arms start as `handempty`.  The robot's base configuration is fixed at v3.  The critical insight here is that the base cannot move, as the only available `move_base` action instance doesn't actually change the base configuration and thus is not cost effective.
           
           The problem requires moving the objects, and the provided `kin` facts for arm v4 are my roadmap. I will use the `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate each object. Specifically, the challenge lies in defining the target pose on v16 (`#o2`). The PDDL description uses `#o2` for all three objects. Still, I need to specify *different* continuous values for `#o2` for *each* object to meet the problem constraints.
           
           My strategy is as follows: For each object, I will pick it up from its initial pose and then place it onto a new pose on v16. I am assuming the negative atoms are true and will not consider the effect of collision. I will also assume that the objects will not collide with each other when placing.
           
           To define collision-free poses on v16, I've calculated a feasible arrangement using object AABB dimensions. Object sizes are roughly known:
           *   v12: ~0.1 x 0.1
           *   v14: ~0.07 x 0.07
           *   v8: ~0.07 x 0.07
           
           I will place the three objects side by side on v16 (size ~0.27x0.27). I plan to set the poses, and each x-coordinate is relative to the center of v16, and y-coordinates will be 0:
           *   v12: x = -0.08, y = 0
           *   v14: x = 0, y = 0
           *   v8: x = 0.08, y = 0
           The z-coordinate for all objects will be 0.781 since the objects start there, and the goal is to have the objects "on" v16, which I will accomplish by assuming they are the same level. Rotation will be 0 (quaternion (0,0,0,1)).
           
           The sequence of actions will be:
           1.  Pick v8.
           2.  Place v8.
           3.  Pick v12.
           4.  Place v12.
           5.  Pick v14.
           6.  Place v14.
           
           This sequence guarantees `handempty(v4)` before each pick and ensures that `atgrasp(v4, obj, #o1)` is true before placing.
           
           This action plan adheres to the problem statement by ensuring all objects are in the desired final state and by assigning specific poses on v16 for each of the objects. The total cost of the solution is 6.  I assume `canmove()` is always true and maintain a static base configuration.  Given the constraints, this plan appears optimal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal with Current Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the plan, and it's immediately clear we have a problem. The plan relies entirely on `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects. But the only valid action instance I see is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a no-op, basically just the robot moving itself from and to the exact same position. Useless!
           
           The goal is to get those objects – v8, v12, and v14 – *onto* v16.  We have them starting on v11, supported by their respective poses.  So, to get them where they need to be, we would need to pick them up from v11 and put them down on v16.  That implies *exactly* the kind of actions we don't have.
           
           Because `pick` and `place` aren't defined as valid actions within this context, the entire plan is a non-starter.  The robot is stuck; there's no way to reach the desired state using the available actions.  The goal is currently unachievable, given the constraints.  We'll need to modify the action list, or rethink the approach entirely.
