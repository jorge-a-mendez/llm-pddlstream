           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to determine a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` that is both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified potential candidates for `?green` as `v8` and `v12` based on their `type` properties in the initial state.
           
           To fulfill `on(?green, v18)`, I need to ensure that the object is supported by `v18` and that its pose matches the pose supporting `v18`.  For instance, `on(v8, v18)` would require `atpose(v8, ?p)` and `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`.  Similar conditions apply to `v12`.
           
           Upon examining the initial state, I see that both `v8` and `v12` are supported at different poses. `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`, but both are supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Crucially, the available action is limited to `move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not alter the pose of any object. The `pick` and `place` actions would be necessary to move objects to poses, and they require satisfying preconditions based on available kinesthetic information (kin, grasp, handempty, and unsafe conditions).  However, I don't have instances of the `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           Since the goal requires changing the pose of either `v8` or `v12` to `pose #o2`, and the only permissible action does not affect object poses, I've concluded that the goal cannot be achieved.  The only action instance I'm given is `move_base`.
           
           My analysis indicates that no solution exists.
