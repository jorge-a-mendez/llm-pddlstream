           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Conclusion for Unachievable Goal**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on object `v18`. I identified that both `v8` and `v12` are `type v17`.  Initially, `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. To place either object on `v18`, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions. However, the available action instances only include a `move_base` action, which simply moves the base from `v3` to `v3` without changing object positions. Since only `move_base` actions are available, I conclude that it's impossible to manipulate any objects or satisfy the `on` predicate. I am constrained by only being able to use the available action instances, making it impossible to achieve the target. Therefore, I will not include a plan because the goal is unreachable given the restrictions.
