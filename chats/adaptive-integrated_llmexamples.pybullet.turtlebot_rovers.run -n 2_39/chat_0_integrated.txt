           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.657, -0.417), (0.796, -0.278)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex set of conditions that need to be met. Let's break down the `new-axiom@0()` definition:
           
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is stone)
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is stone)
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is stone)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is soil)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is soil)
           
           The remaining sub-goals are:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for at least one object of type `v2`)
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for at least one object of type `v6`)
           
           Let's analyze how to achieve these:
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           This requires:
           - `take_image` (to get `haveimage(rover, objective, mode)`)
           - `send_image` (to get `receivedimage(objective, mode)`)
           
           To take an image, we need `calibrated(camera, rover)`. So, the sequence would be:
           1. `calibrate(rover, conf, ray, objective, camera)`
           2. `take_image(rover, conf, ray, objective, camera, mode)`
           3. `send_image(rover, conf, ray, lander, objective, mode)`
           
           We have two rovers (v12, v14) and one camera (v10) which is onboard both. We need images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`. There are `imagevisible` predicates for both rovers, configurations, rays, and objectives v17 and v18.
           
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`.
           Rover v14 has `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`.
           Using `#o3` and `#o4` for `v12` or `v14` for both `v17` and `v18` means we might be able to satisfy both `receivedimage` goals with a single rover at a specific configuration.
           
           **For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           This requires:
           - `sample_rock` (to get `analyzed(rover, rock)`)
           - `send_analysis` (to get `receivedanalysis(rock)`)
           
           To sample a rock, we need `above(rover, conf, rock)` and `free(rover, store)`.
           To send analysis, we need `comvisible(rover, conf, ray, lander)`.
           
           We have `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           We have multiple rocks of type `v2` (stone): `v3`, `v1`, `v4`.
           We have multiple rocks of type `v6` (soil): `v7`, `v5`, `v8`.
           
           There are `above` predicates for both rovers and multiple rocks using `#o5`.
           For `v12`: `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`.
           For `v14`: `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`.
           
           Also, both rovers have `comvisible` predicates using `#o0` and `#o1` to lander `v9`.
           
           A possible plan would be:
           1. Have `v12` calibrate its camera to view `v17`.
           2. Have `v12` take an image of `v17`.
           3. Have `v12` send the image of `v17`.
           4. Have `v12` calibrate its camera to view `v18`.
           5. Have `v12` take an image of `v18`.
           6. Have `v12` send the image of `v18`.
           7. Have `v12` sample a stone (`v1` or `v3` or `v4`).
           8. Have `v12` send the analysis of the stone.
           9. Have `v14` sample a soil (`v7` or `v5` or `v8`).
           10. Have `v14` send the analysis of the soil.
           
           Let's check the available actions: only `move` and `drop_rock` are explicitly listed. This indicates that the problem might be designed such that *all other actions' preconditions must be met by the initial state using the available continuous configurations* (those starting with '#').
           
           If we can't use `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions because they are not in the explicit list of allowed actions, then the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) is not achievable. This seems to be a common pitfall in these problems where the "available action instances" might be just a subset of all possible actions, and imply that the goal is achievable only if the initial state directly satisfies the goal or through actions that transform the state and are *not* listed in "available action instances".
           
           However, the problem statement says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This implies that the only actions allowed are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Therefore, based on the provided "list of valid action instances", the goal is unachievable.
           
           Let me re-read the problem statement carefully: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This is a strict constraint. The provided list of allowed actions is:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           None of these actions can generate `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. The initial state does not have these predicates. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
           
           I will state that the goal is not achievable given the constraints.
           The goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions can produce `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. Since these predicates are not present in the initial state, the goal cannot be achieved.
