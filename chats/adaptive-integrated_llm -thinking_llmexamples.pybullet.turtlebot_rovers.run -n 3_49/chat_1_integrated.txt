           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the new axiom goal, breaking it down step by step and taking on a significant amount of the computational burden involved:**
           
           First, I need to focus on moving the rover `v12` around to take images, sample rocks, and send data. I have to make sure to meet all the preconditions for each action, and manage the rover's configuration at all times. I will need to use a camera `v10` on the rover for taking images and analyzing rocks. I will also make sure to use valid configurations for each action (e.g., `#o3` for image taking). The robot needs to be calibrated at the beginning of each image-capture action.
           
           1.  **Preparation**
               *   Move the rover to position for image taking: `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`.
               *   Calibrate camera: `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`.
           
           2.  **Image Capture**
               *   Take the image: `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`.
               *   Re-calibrate for the second picture: `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`.
               *   Take the second image: `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`.
               *   Re-calibrate for the third picture: `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10`.
               *   Take the third image: `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11`.
           3.  **Communication**
               *   Move the rover to a communication position: `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0`.
               *   Send the images: `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`, `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`, `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11`.
           4.  **Sampling Rocks**
               *   Move rover to a position for sampling: `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5`.
               *   Sample stone: `sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16`.
               *   Drop sampled rock from store to free up: `drop_rock v12 v16`.
               *   Sample soil: `sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16`.
           5.  **Data Transmission**
               *   Move the rover to a communication position: `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`.
               *   Send analysis for the stone: `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3`.
               *   Send analysis for the soil: `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5`.
           6.  **Finalize**
               *   Free the store: `drop_rock v12 v16`.
               *   Move back to initial configuration: `move v12 #o0 #o2 v13`.
           
           I have used configuration values for `#o3` (1.0, 1.0), `#o0` (-1.0, -1.75), and `#o5` (-0.7, -0.5). These should satisfy the constraints given in the problem and meet all the preconditions.
           
           This plan will allow the rover to meet the requirements of the goal state.

               *   Drop sampled rock from store to free up: `drop_rock v12 v16`.

               *   Move back to initial configuration: `move v12 #o0 #o2 v13`.
           
           I have used configuration values for `#o3` (1.0, 1.0), `#o0` (-1.0, -1.75), and `#o5` (-0.7, -0.5). These should satisfy the constraints given in the problem and meet all the preconditions.
           
           This plan will allow the rover to meet the requirements of the goal state.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.0 1.0) for rover v12 at target v19 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.75) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan and Refining Configurations**
           
           Okay, so the last attempt failed. Let's get this right. It seems like the core of the problem lies in those configurations, `#o3` and `#o0`, for rover `v12`. I need to re-evaluate them considering the objectives, the communication target (`v9`), and the sampling requirements, while keeping an eye on reachability and occlusion.
           
           First, I need to choose a new location for `#o3`. The goal is to get a good image of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` with a single config. A good location for this rover should be elevated and central to all these objectives. The initial value, (1.0, 1.0) didn't work. The objectives are generally high on the Y-axis. After the initial assessment of the AABBs, (0.8, 0.8) seemed like a good starting point. Let's try that value.
           *   Checking the distances, (0.8, 0.8) should be good for each objective.
           *   The path from `v12`'s initial position at `(1.0, -1.75)` to the new configuration is clear, and is a safe distance.
           
           Next, I need to address the communication issue with `#o0`. The lander, `v9`, is around (-1.9, -2.0) and my rover starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. The previous configuration, `(-1.0, -1.75)`, was deemed unreachable, which doesn't quite make sense given the other rules, so that must be a collision issue. Since that didn't work, maybe moving `#o0` slightly north will solve this.
           *   Let's check `(-1.0, -1.0)`. Distance-wise, this should work.
           *   The configuration also seems like it will be better at avoiding collisions with the other rovers.
           
           Finally, there is the sampling configuration, `#o5`, to consider. This gets tricky. I had to assume that the `above` predicate, given the spatial distribution of the objects to sample, means within reach, not necessarily directly above. After a careful assessment, to get soil and stone, I need a configuration where `v12` can sample `v3` and `v5`.
           *   A good choice for `#o5` might be `(-0.8, -0.4)`.
           *   This is the best that it can be, so, I will proceed to this configuration.
           
           With these configurations in place, I am sure the plan should work! Here is my refined plan:
           
           1.  **Move to `#o3`:** Rover `v12` moves from its initial position at (1.0, -1.75) to (0.8, 0.8) to take pictures.
           2.  **Take Pictures:** Rover takes pictures of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`.
           3.  **Move to `#o0`:** Rover `v12` then moves to `(-1.0, -1.0)` to communicate.
           4.  **Send Images:** Rover `v12` sends images of the three objectives.
           5.  **Move to `#o5`:** Rover moves to `(-0.8, -0.4)` to sample.
           6.  **Sample Rocks:** Rover `v12` samples rock `v3` and `v5`.
           7.  **Return to `#o0`:** Rover moves to `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           8.  **Send Analysis:** Rover communicates the analysis of rock `v3` and `v5`.
           9.  **Return to initial position:** Rover `v12` goes back to its initial position.
           
           This updated plan addresses all constraints. It should ensure the rover successfully completes its mission while adhering to all reachability, visibility, and communication requirements, meeting all the final goal states. Let's run this.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Refined Rover Plan: Achieving the new-axiom@0 Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the current plan I've landed on, based on analyzing the goal's components and past failures due to occlusion and reachability. I'm focusing on the rover, specifically `v12`.  The crux of this is finding viable configurations for the rover to achieve the "new-axiom" which is a fairly complex objective.
           
           Firstly, the objective requires gathering information and analyzing two specific rock types, `stone` and `soil`.  This means image captures and rock analysis are key. The goal necessitates the rover to be at specific locations and configurations such as `(atconf(v12, v13)` which is an initial location of `(1.0, -1.75)` and a few intermediate ones, `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           To achieve `imagevisible` of the three targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), I decided to put the rover at `#o3` at `(0.6, 1.0)`. This allows me to be within the 2-unit range and hopefully provide a clear line of sight.
           
           Next, for `comvisible` of the lander (`v9`), I'm aiming for `#o0` at `(-0.5, -0.5)`. This is a compromise position, closer to the lander and hopefully, avoiding previous occlusion issues.
           
           Finally, the `above` predicate, related to sampling rocks, caused the biggest headache.  It seems to imply that there is some configuration that is *above* all the targets. The problem here is that the positions are far spread out. I have to find a single location `#o5` which allows sampling of one stone and one soil. I determined that an appropriate location for `#o5` is `(-1.35, -0.9)`.  This puts rover `v12` close to the stone rock `v4` and the soil rock `v8`, from which a manipulator action can occur.
           
           I'm making a calculated guess here about the range of "above." I'm working under the assumption that the `above` position doesn't have to be *directly* above the rock, but close enough for the rover's manipulator arm to reach.
           
           The movements are:
           1.  **Move to Image Configuration:** Move from `v13 (1.0, -1.75)` to `#o3 (0.6, 1.0)`.
           2.  **Take and Send Images:**
               *   `calibrate`, `take_image` for `v17`.
               *   `calibrate`, `take_image` for `v18`.
               *   `calibrate`, `take_image` for `v19`.
               *   `move` to `v12` from `#o3` to `#o0 (-0.5, -0.5)`.
               *   `send_image` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           3.  **Sample and Send Analysis:**
               *   `move` `v12` from `#o0` to `#o5 (-1.35, -0.9)`.
               *   `sample_rock` `v4` (stone).
               *   `drop_rock`.
               *   `sample_rock` `v8` (soil).
               *   `move` `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0 (-0.5, -0.5)`.
               *   `send_analysis` for `v4`, `v8`.
           4.  **Finalize:**
               *   `drop_rock` (to free store).
               *   `move` `v12` from `#o0` to `v13` (original position).
           
           I have cross-checked for potential collisions with static objects in all these configurations using AABB. The static obstructions don't seem like they should pose a problem given the above locations. I'm relying heavily on the pre-defined motion and other predicates such as `imagevisible` and `comvisible` to be valid for these specified coordinates.  I am hoping that the choice of those intermediate locations (#o3, #o0, and #o5) avoids any further ray-casting issues. I have a lot riding on this final plan!

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Rover Configurations**
           
           I've been going over the feedback, and it looks like some of the proposed rover configurations were causing collisions or weren't reachable. I need to take another look at the AABBs for all the objects, as well as the 'imagevisible' (max distance 2) and 'comvisible' (max distance 4) requirements to make sure everything lines up.
           
           Here's the breakdown of what I'm dealing with:
           
           I've got a list of objects with their AABBs, which are key for checking collisions and visibility. These include two rovers, rocks, obstacles, and objectives. There are also specific configurations for the rovers, like the starting positions for v12 and v14.
           
           I need to make sure the goals are met. Rover v12 needs to end up at v13, and v14 needs to end at v15. I need to make sure the stores for v12 and v14 will be free. The plan includes taking and sending images, and then sampling and sending analyses of specific stone and soil types.
           
           The current plan has rover v12 as the active agent, and it involves a series of steps: moving to an imaging configuration to take images of the objectives, then moving to a communication config to send the images, then moving to a sampling config to sample and drop a stone and soil, and then communicating again to send the analysis. And finally, returning to the start.
           
           **Re-evaluating the configurations:**
           
           First, the imaging configuration, where I need to take pictures of three objectives, each with coordinates. Each imaging configuration has to be within a 2-meter distance. The challenge here is the close proximity of one of the objectives to an obstacle, which I have to avoid. I am proposing (0.5, 1.5) as the configuration, I’ve checked distances, and it appears to work in that the maximum distance is about 1.44 and the closest target is 0.44.
           
           Next, I have the communication configuration. I have a lander which I need to have a distance to the lander of under 4 meters and avoiding the other rover which acts as an obstacle. After some experimentation, I believe that (-1.5, -1.5) will be a solid solution as it appears to satisfy the distance requirement while avoiding the other rover and the obstacles.
           
           Finally, the sampling configuration needs to be near two different rocks to sample. I can’t have these be too far apart and I need to avoid collisions with the other rover. Using the average between each target, I will use (-1.36, -0.93) to achieve this requirement.
           
           These new configurations should resolve the issues of collision, occlusion, and reachability. I'm confident that the new plan will work well and the revised configurations will take into account the environment in the plan.

           I've got a list of objects with their AABBs, which are key for checking collisions and visibility. These include two rovers, rocks, obstacles, and objectives. There are also specific configurations for the rovers, like the starting positions for v12 and v14.
           
           I need to make sure the goals are met. Rover v12 needs to end up at v13, and v14 needs to end at v15. I need to make sure the stores for v12 and v14 will be free. The plan includes taking and sending images, and then sampling and sending analyses of specific stone and soil types.
           
           The current plan has rover v12 as the active agent, and it involves a series of steps: moving to an imaging configuration to take images of the objectives, then moving to a communication config to send the images, then moving to a sampling config to sample and drop a stone and soil, and then communicating again to send the analysis. And finally, returning to the start.
           
           **Re-evaluating the configurations:**
           
           First, the imaging configuration, where I need to take pictures of three objectives, each with coordinates. Each imaging configuration has to be within a 2-meter distance. The challenge here is the close proximity of one of the objectives to an obstacle, which I have to avoid. I am proposing (0.5, 1.5) as the configuration, I’ve checked distances, and it appears to work in that the maximum distance is about 1.44 and the closest target is 0.44.
           
           Next, I have the communication configuration. I have a lander which I need to have a distance to the lander of under 4 meters and avoiding the other rover which acts as an obstacle. After some experimentation, I believe that (-1.5, -1.5) will be a solid solution as it appears to satisfy the distance requirement while avoiding the other rover and the obstacles.
           
           Finally, the sampling configuration needs to be near two different rocks to sample. I can’t have these be too far apart and I need to avoid collisions with the other rover. Using the average between each target, I will use (-1.36, -0.93) to achieve this requirement.
           
           These new configurations should resolve the issues of collision, occlusion, and reachability. I'm confident that the new plan will work well and the revised configurations will take into account the environment in the plan.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Rover Action**
           
           I'm facing feedback about potential reachability or collision issues for the planned rover movements. My immediate task is to refine the configuration parameters of `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` to meet the geometric and kinematic constraints.  The core of the problem lies in satisfying the plan's goals while adhering to crucial constraints:
           
           1.  **Reachability**: The `move` action depends on existing `motion` predicates. For my custom configurations (`#oX`), I must ensure a `motion` path exists or can be constructed. The given `motion` facts strongly suggest specific `#oX` configs are designed to be reachable.
           
           2.  **Collision-Free**: No part of the rover or its ray should intersect any static obstacles (AABBs).
           
           3.  **Occlusion-Free**: Rays must have an unobstructed path to targets for `imagevisible` and `comvisible`.
           
           4.  **Distance**: Max distance of 2 for image and 4 for com is a critical constraint.
           
           The specific "not reachable" error message suggests I'm picking coordinates that, while technically linked by a `motion` fact, are practically unachievable by the rover.  The key realization here is that `#oX` are flexible configs, requiring me to provide coordinates for them.  And crucially: the problem requires me to give *distinct* coordinates for each (rover, target) pair. This means I can have several *named* `#o3` values (e.g., `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, `#o3_v19`), and they will be substituted for `?q` in `take_image` in the planner.
           
           Based on these realizations, I need to:
           
           *   Re-interpret `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements to support the creation of a suitable set of individual configuration values for the rover for each target.
           *   Pick the value for the continuous parameters (#o3, #o0, #o5). The constraints are collision-free and reachability.
           
           The plan I am currently proposing involves:
           1.  Using two rovers to achieve all imaging goals (v12 and v14) to better manage reachability.
           2.  Ensuring each (rover, target) combination has an individual coordinate and movement.
           
           I plan to use multiple `#o3`, one for each target (`v17, v18, v19`), and `#o0` for all communication purposes, and `#o5` to handle rock sampling activities. Given the `motion` facts, the configurations are now proposed:
           
           *   **Imaging Configs (`#o3`)**
               *   For `v12` to image `v17`: `(0.6, 0.5)`
               *   For `v12` to image `v18`: `(1.8, 0.5)`
               *   For `v14` to image `v19`: `(-0.5, 0.5)`
               These should all be within the distance range.
           *   **Communication Config (`#o0`)**: `(-0.5, -1.5)`. This is a general communication point for both rovers to receive images and send analysis to the base.
           *   **Sampling Config (`#o5`)**: `(-1.3, -1.0)`.
           
           This approach ensures a higher degree of feasibility and accounts for the specific constraints. The key constraint that the plan faces is reachability for all the given continuous configurations.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Strategy Refinement:**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this new `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. It requires a lot of image data and rock analysis.  My initial assessment is this: We need to coordinate the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, efficiently.  I've got some configurations in mind based on prior attempts and domain knowledge. I'll need to double check the motion models and any obstacles that might cause trouble along the way.  
           
           My prior efforts have taught me the key is splitting the imaging tasks, this time I plan to have `v14` get images from two objectives, while `v12` captures the remaining one. I'll also try to combine the rock analysis and image-communication tasks for `v12` to be even more efficient.
           
           **Refined Plan and Configuration Selection:**
           
           For imaging, I need to ensure a collision-free and occlusion-free strategy. The key to the configuration selections are, again, based on imaging range and proximity to objectives.
           
           *   `v14` goes to `(-0.75, 0.2)` to get the image from `v19`, then to `(0.5, 0.2)` to capture `v17`.
           *   `v12` is assigned to grab the `v18` image at `(1.7, 0.2)`.
           
           For communication and rock analysis, I've got a configuration for both rovers to head for `(-0.9, -1.2)`. I'll have `v12` be the rock sampling rover, so that rover can also complete some rock analysis. It'll move to `(-1.3, -0.9)` above the rock.
           
           **Motion and Communication Validation:**
           
           The most important step is validating movement paths with the motion model, and avoiding any new obstacles. I need to ensure that the movements are all within the motion range, and that the communication range is enough to cover sending the images to `v9` the lander.  I need to make sure the robot can return to their respective original configurations (`v13` and `v15`), and that `v12` has an open store after the plan concludes.
           
           **Plan Execution:**
           
           The plan is divided into motion, image acquisition, rock analysis and image and analysis sending:
           
           1.  `v14` images `v19`.
           2.  `v14` images `v17`.
           3.  `v12` images `v18`.
           4.  `v14` moves to comm config.
           5.  `v14` sends images.
           6.  `v12` moves to comm config.
           7.  `v12` sends image.
           8.  `v12` moves to sampling location.
           9.  `v12` samples rocks.
           10. `v12` sends analyses.
           11. `v12` and `v14` return to their starting points.
           
           I'll proceed to define the individual plan steps now, double checking all configuration selections. This refined plan should achieve the goal successfully.
