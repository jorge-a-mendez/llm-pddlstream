           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal `new-axiom@0()` that boils down to getting some images and analyses, all of which depend on getting rovers into specific configurations. I've broken down the goal into its components and matched those components with the available actions.  It looks like I need to get images of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` (using mode `v11` and camera `v10`), and then get analyses of some rock and soil.
           
           The problem lies with the "move" actions.  The rovers `v12` and `v14` are initially at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. The action instances for `move` just move them from their current configuration to their current configuration - essentially a no-op! However, all the actions to take images or to sample rocks or to send analyses require the rover to be at specific locations, namely `#o3` (for image taking) and `#o0` (for image sending) and `#o5` (for sampling).  These configurations are *not* the same as the rover's starting positions.
           
           I'm required to compute these configuration values. The initial state gives me `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, implying these other configurations exist.  There's no way to *get* to `#o3`, `#o0` or `#o5` because the `move` actions are limited to staying at `v13` or `v15`.  The implication is that the rovers are fixed in position.
           
           The rules are very clear: if a predicate requires `atconf(?v, ?q)` to be true, and `?q` is not the current configuration, then I have to move the rover to that configuration. Here, I'm stuck: the only available moves keep the rover where it is.  And the `#o` configurations are explicitly *not* the starting locations.
           
           This means I can't calibrate, take images, sample rocks, or communicate - the preconditions for these actions are not met. Therefore, the overall goal is simply *unreachable* with the given actions and initial state.  No matter how I look at it, unless the rovers can magically teleport, this axiom is impossible to fulfill.
