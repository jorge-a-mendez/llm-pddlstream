           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Deep Dive into an Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a scenario where I need to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all "on" `v18`.  "On" means the object is at a specific pose and supported by the target object.  Right now, these objects are all sitting on `v11`. No problem, right? Easy peasy... except...
           
           I start dissecting the initial state. I see the usual suspects: arms (`v4`, `v6`), base (`v3`), objects (`v8` through `v16`), and some continuous parameters (`#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`). I have their poses, grasps, and support relationships defined. I see `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all graspable, stackable, and supported by both `v11` and `v18`. Seems I should be able to get them on `v18`, right?
           
           Looking at the goal, my instinct is to use `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects to their new positions. The goal's predicates, `supported` and `atpose`, are familiar. It appears as if all I need to do is change their pose and support. I already know that I'm not allowed to move the base because `move_base` action is restricted to `v3` to `v3`.
           
           But here's the rub, and it's a big one. I carefully reread the instructions, as I always do. The provided actions are extremely limited. I check the list of available actions again. It only includes: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Basically, *I can't move the base*.  *I can't pick or place*.
           
           Now, the problem crystallizes: my goal *requires* moving these objects, which necessitates a `pick` and `place` action. I cannot manipulate the objects' `atpose` with `move_base`.
           
           It's clear. I'm up against a wall. It is *impossible* to achieve the goal with the given set of *available* actions. I need to explicitly state this conclusion. No matter how clever my planning, with only a "no-op" base movement, I can't shift these objects. My plan should inform that no further actions are achievable.
