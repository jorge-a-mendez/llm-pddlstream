User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find three valid base positions for a robot, given a target point and a set of fixed obstacles. The key constraints are: a maximum distance of 2 from the target, a workspace within a 2.5 x 2.5 area (with the center at the origin), and no collisions or blocked lines of sight (LOS) to the target. There's also the element of "memory" or "persistent state" of the history of past collisions, that will guide in avoiding those areas in future calls for similar points.
           
           **Understanding the Environment**
           
           First, I need to understand the layout. I'm given a set of AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) that represent the fixed obstacles. These include the workspace boundaries (which act more as a constraint), a central dividing wall at x=0, and several smaller blocks scattered around the room. The central wall is crucial because it can easily block the line of sight if the target and the robot base are on opposite sides. There is also no explicit size for the robot, I should assume its dimensions are point-like for line-of-sight analysis and apply a radius to represent it for collision checks.
           
           **Defining "Valid"**
           
           A "valid" position means it must:
           1.  Be within the distance limit (max\_range).
           2.  Be within the workspace boundaries.
           3.  Not collide with any fixed obstacles.
           4.  Have a clear line of sight to the target (no obstacles in between).
           5.  Not be a position that has failed in the past.
           
           **Implementation Plan**
           
           My approach will involve a multi-step process:
           
           1.  **Iterative Search**: I'll generate candidate positions around the target, starting at various angles and radii and using different search radii, and gradually decreasing the search radius. I'll search across different angles in prioritized and broad sweeps around the target, and then I can add random searches to get the required number of positions, if necessary.
           2.  **Validation Check**: For each candidate, I'll perform the following checks:
               *   Boundary check: Is it within the working limits?
               *   Collision detection: Does the point, or an expanded point (accounting for the robot's radius), collide with any obstacles?
               *   LOS check: Does a direct line between the robot position and the target intersect any obstacles?
           3.  **Iteration**: I'll repeat the position generation and validation until I find three valid positions.
           
           **Detailed Check Methods and Formulas**
           
           *   **Point-in-AABB**: A point (x, y) is in an AABB ((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) if x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2. I'll need a radius (robot radius) to see if the robot's dimensions are considered for the collision detection.
           *   **Collision Detection**: I will use a helper function to check collision and apply the robot's radius to the bounds, to see if the base's position falls within any obstacle, expanding the obstacle's radius by the robot's radius.
           *   **LOS Check (Line-Segment-AABB Intersection)**: This is crucial, so I'll utilize a robust line-segment-AABB intersection algorithm. I will expand all obstacles, by the robot radius, and then I would use the Liang-Barsky algorithm for a proper determination.
           *   **Avoiding Previous Failures**: For this, since the user calls the API, a simple memory of failed targets, their positions, and reasons (collision, LOS failure), would suffice. I would need to keep track of this on my side.
           
           In summary, I'm setting up a robust framework to systematically search, validate, and return the three best positions that meet all the specified criteria.
