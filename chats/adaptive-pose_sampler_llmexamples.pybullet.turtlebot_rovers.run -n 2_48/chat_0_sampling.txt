User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at the origin. There are several rectangular obstacles within this room.
           
           Based on the target point (1.68 -1.22), I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point, while avoiding the known obstacles and the walls of the room. I will try to space out the positions to increase the chance of finding an un-occluded spot.
           
           Obstacle 13: ((1.887, -0.981), (2.008, -0.859)) is very close to the target, so I need to avoid placing the robot there.
           Obstacle 15: ((1.701, -1.729), (1.825, -1.605)) is also very close to the target.
           
           I will prioritize placing the robot on either side of the target, or slightly further away from the obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 -2.0)
           (2.0 -0.5)
           (0.5 -1.5)
