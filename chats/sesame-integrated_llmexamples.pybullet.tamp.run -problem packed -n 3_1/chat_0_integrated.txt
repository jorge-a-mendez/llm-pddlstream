           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.119, -0.559), (-0.041, -0.481)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.15, -0.519), (0.241, -0.427)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.099, -0.3), (-0.028, -0.229)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.08, -0.52, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.66, 0.751).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.196, -0.473, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.554, 0.832).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.063, -0.265, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.009, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on object v16. All three objects are initially supported by v11, and v8 is at pose v9, v12 at pose v13, and v14 at pose v15. The robot arm v4 is currently at configuration v5 and the base at v3, both with an empty hand. There are poses available on v16 for all three objects. We need to pick each object from its initial pose and place it on v16. Since multiple objects need to be placed on v16, we need to carefully choose the placement poses such that they don't collide with each other.
           
           The initial state contains the following facts for object v8:
           `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. The goal is `on(v8, v16)`. This means we need to pick v8 from v9 and place it at a new pose, say #o2, on v16.
           Similarly for v12: `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v11)`. Goal: `on(v12, v16)`.
           And for v14: `atpose(v14, v15)` and `supported(v14, v15, v11)`. Goal: `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           The available actions are pick and place actions for each object and a move_base action.
           We also need to specify the continuous values for the new poses and any other unspecified continuous objects (like #o1 for grasp, #o3 for bconf and #o4 for atraj).
           For the grasp, #o1, we can use a standard top grasp.
           For the base configuration #o3, we can use the current base configuration v3, since there is a `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` action, meaning the robot won't move its base while picking and placing.
           For the arm trajectory #o4, we can let the system find a valid trajectory for the pick and place.
           The new pose #o2 needs to be specified for v8, v12, and v14 on v16. Since v16 is described as ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), we can place the objects within these bounds.
           We need to make sure that the placements on v16 are collision-free. The objects have the following AABB dimensions:
           v8: ((-0.119, -0.559), (-0.041, -0.481)) - width: 0.078, height: 0.078
           v12: ((-0.099, -0.3), (-0.028, -0.229)) - width: 0.071, height: 0.071
           v14: ((0.15, -0.519), (0.241, -0.427)) - width: 0.091, height: 0.092
           We can stack them in a row on v16.
           
           Let's plan the placements on v16 (AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))):
           We can place v8 at (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781), v12 at (0, 0, 0.781) and v14 at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781), or similarly spaced.
           Let's make sure the robot can reach these. The current robot base is at (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0). The initial objects are around y=-0.5. The target object v16 is centered at (0,0). So the robot will need to move. However, no move_base action is available to reach new base configuration #o3 for arm v4 to pick/place object. The only available basemotion actions involve v3, and #o3. As `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is given, it implies that the robot base remains at v3. And there are also actions `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`. We also have `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, where #o3 is the base configuration at which the object is to be placed. So, we have to pick and place all objects at the current base configuration v3, and therefore, #o3 must be v3.
           
           Let's assume the robot is positioned such that it can reach all objects from v3.
           We will use the same pose #o2 for all objects, but provide different continuous values for them to ensure they are collision-free on v16. The prompt states "If the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all), specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name."
           
           Plan:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 on v16 at #o2.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 on v16 at #o2.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 on v16 at #o2.
           
           Since there is only one arm (v4), we must pick and place each object sequentially.

Model:     The problem asks to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on object v16. All three objects are initially supported by v11, and v8 is at pose v9, v12 at pose v13, and v14 at pose v15. The robot arm v4 is currently at configuration v5 and the base at v3, both with an empty hand. There are poses available on v16 for all three objects. We need to pick each object from its initial pose and place it on v16. Since multiple objects need to be placed on v16, we need to carefully choose the placement poses such that they don't collide with each other.
           
           The initial state contains the following facts for object v8:
           `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. The goal is `on(v8, v16)`. This means we need to pick v8 from v9 and place it at a new pose, say #o2, on v16.
           Similarly for v12: `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v11)`. Goal: `on(v12, v16)`.
           And for v14: `atpose(v14, v15)` and `supported(v14, v15, v11)`. Goal: `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           The available actions are pick and place actions for each object and a move_base action.
           We also need to specify the continuous values for the new poses and any other unspecified continuous objects (like #o1 for grasp, #o3 for bconf and #o4 for atraj).
           For the grasp, #o1, we can use a standard top grasp.
           For the base configuration #o3, we need to look at the available actions. The available pick and place actions use #o3 as the base configuration. The initial state shows `atbconf(v3)`. There are `basemotion` actions involving v3 and #o3, but for `kin` actions, it appears #o3 is intended to be the base configuration for picking/placing, which means the robot must be at #o3. Since we start at v3 and there are no valid `move_base` actions to change to #o3, #o3 must be v3 for the plan to be executable. Thus, we will substitute `v3` for `#o3`.
           
           For the arm trajectory #o4, we can let the system find a valid trajectory for the pick and place.
           The new pose #o2 needs to be specified for v8, v12, and v14 on v16. Since v16 is described as ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), we can place the objects within these bounds.
           We need to make sure that the placements on v16 are collision-free. The objects have the following AABB dimensions:
           v8: ((-0.119, -0.559), (-0.041, -0.481)) - width: 0.078, height: 0.078
           v12: ((-0.099, -0.3), (-0.028, -0.229)) - width: 0.071, height: 0.071
           v14: ((0.15, -0.519), (0.241, -0.427)) - width: 0.091, height: 0.092
           We can stack them in a row on v16.
           
           The previous plan used `#o3` and `v3` interchangeably, which was incorrect as the provided actions specified `#o3`. However, given the initial state `atbconf(v3)` and the fact that the pick/place actions use `#o3`, and there are no `move_base` actions that would set `atbconf(#o3)` when `#o3` is different from `v3`, it implies that `#o3` must resolve to `v3` for the actions to be executable.
           
           Plan:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 on v16 at #o2.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 on v16 at #o2.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 on v16 at #o2.
           
           Since there is only one arm (v4), we must pick and place each object sequentially. All pick and place actions use `#o3` for the base configuration, which we assume is `v3`.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf(v35)` was not satisfied. This means that `#o3` (which was implicitly set to v3 in the previous response's reasoning) should not be `v35`. Looking at the initial state, `atbconf(v3)` is true. All `kin` actions for pick and place use `#o3` as the base configuration. Therefore, `#o3` must be `v3` for these actions to be executable without explicitly moving the base. The error message `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!` indicates that `#o3` was somehow resolved to `v35` instead of `v3`. This is likely an internal representation issue where `#o3` was given a unique placeholder name. My previous understanding that `#o3` should be `v3` to satisfy the `atbconf` precondition is still correct.
           
           Let's re-examine the available actions. All pick and place actions take `#o3` as the base configuration. The initial state is `atbconf(v3)`. There are also `move_base` actions that involve `v3` and `#o3`.
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` implies a possible move from `v3` to `#o3`.
           `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` implies a possible move from `#o3` to `v3`.
           `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` implies a possible move from `#o3` to `#o3`.
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` implies a possible move from `v3` to `v3` (i.e., no actual movement, but a base motion primitive).
           
           Since the goal is just to place objects on v16, and the robot is at `v3`, the simplest path is to assume that `#o3` in the pick/place actions refers to `v3`. If `#o3` is a different base configuration, we would need a `move_base` action to get there, but the available `move_base` actions are `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` and `(move_base #o3 v3 #o0)`. If we use `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`, then we would need to provide a value for `#o3`. However, we have `atbconf(v3)` and need to satisfy `atbconf(#o3)` for pick/place. The only way to satisfy `atbconf(#o3)` without a `move_base` action is if `#o3` is `v3`.
           If the system internally assigned `v35` to `#o3`, then this suggests that `#o3` is indeed a *new* base configuration that needs to be specified, and the robot needs to move to it. However, the problem statement says "if your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose". `#o3` is a `bconf`, not a `pose`, so we don't need to specify a value for it. If `#o3` is a *new* bconf, then we would need to use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to reach it. But then we would also need to provide a `bconf` value for `#o3` (x, y, theta). Since this is not requested for `bconf` objects beginning with '#', it indicates that `#o3` is likely meant to resolve to one of the existing `bconf` values (which is `v3` in this case).
           
           Let's assume `#o3` refers to `v3`. The system's error suggests otherwise. This is a tricky interpretation issue of `#o3`. Given the available actions and the initial state, the most direct interpretation is that the `kin` actions are meant to be executed at the current base configuration `v3`, so `#o3` should be `v3`. If `v35` appeared as a substitution for `#o3` and caused the error, then it implies that the internal resolution of `#o3` is not `v3`. Without knowing what `v35` represents, it's hard to proceed if `#o3` is not `v3`.
           
           However, the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is always available and means `atbconf(v3)` becomes `atbconf(v3)` again. This action is trivial, but might be needed if `canmove()` is lost and needs to be reasserted (which is not the case here).
           
           Let's stick to the simplest interpretation, that `#o3` should be `v3`. The error message is confusing, as `v35` is not in the list of objects. Perhaps the internal system is assigning a concrete value to `#o3` that leads to `v35`.
           
           Let's try the plan again, explicitly stating what `#o3` should be. However, since the system is not asking for `#o3` value, it implies it should be resolved to an existing `bconf`.
           
           Re-evaluating the plan structure with the given valid actions:
           The `pick` and `place` actions all require `atbconf(#o3)`.
           The initial state is `atbconf(v3)`.
           The only way to satisfy `atbconf(#o3)` from `atbconf(v3)` is if `#o3` is identical to `v3`, OR if we execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` and then satisfy `atbconf(#o3)`. However, if `#o3` is distinct from `v3`, then `move_base` action would change the `atbconf` from `v3` to `#o3`.
           Since there is no information on `#o3` as a `bconf` to specify, the only valid assumption is that `#o3` is `v3`.
           
           Let's assume the error message was due to a previous internal state or a misinterpretation of `#o3`. Assuming `#o3` is essentially `v3` in the context of the available actions:

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous two attempts failed with the same error: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This indicates that the system is interpreting `#o3` as `v35`, and `v35` is not `v3` (where the robot currently is). Since `#o3` is a continuous parameter for a base configuration, and the problem states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose", but not for `bconf` objects, this is difficult. However, the problem also lists `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state, meaning `#o3` is a known but uninstantiated `bconf`.
           
           Given that `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, and the `pick` and `place` actions require `atbconf(#o3)`, we *must* ensure that the robot's base is at `#o3`.
           The available `move_base` actions include `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot from `v3` to `#o3`. If we execute this action, then `atbconf(#o3)` will be true, satisfying the precondition for the pick/place actions.
           
           The full set of `basemotion` facts:
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`
           `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)`
           `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`
           
           The cost of `move_base` is the euclidean distance, which we should try to minimize. If `#o3` is far, this will increase the cost. Since we are not asked to provide the value for `#o3`, the system must be able to infer a suitable value for it. The existence of `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` strongly suggests that `#o3` is a distinct base configuration. We will perform the move first.
           
           Plan:
           1. Move the base from v3 to #o3.
           2. Pick v8 from v9.
           3. Place v8 on v16 at #o2.
           4. Pick v12 from v13.
           5. Place v12 on v16 at #o2.
           6. Pick v14 from v15.
           7. Place v14 on v16 at #o2.
           8. (Optional: Move base back to v3, but not required by goal).
           
           We need to make sure the poses for #o2 are valid and collision-free. The AABB of v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           v8: ((-0.119, -0.559), (-0.041, -0.481)) - width: 0.078, height: 0.078
           v12: ((-0.099, -0.3), (-0.028, -0.229)) - width: 0.071, height: 0.071
           v14: ((0.15, -0.519), (0.241, -0.427)) - width: 0.091, height: 0.092
           We can place them in a line on v16:
           v8: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781)
           v12: (0.0, 0.08, 0.781)
