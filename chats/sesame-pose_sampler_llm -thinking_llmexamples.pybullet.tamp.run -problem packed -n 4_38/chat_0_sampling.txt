(Thoughts: **Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) that is essentially a square (size approx. 0.08436) on a square surface (Surface 0, side length 0.27, centered at (0,0)). The challenge is to find placements that ensure the object stays entirely within the surface bounds, regardless of its rotation.
           
           Since the object is almost perfectly square, I can treat it as such for these initial calculations. The important point is to ensure the object is *fully* contained, which means I need to calculate the allowable center positions (x, y) for various rotations.
           
           I considered that different rotations would change the effective bounding box. For a square, I know that when aligned with the axes (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees), the bounding box is a square with side length s. When rotated at 45 degree increments, the bounding box becomes s*sqrt(2).
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I will use a simple, safe approach. I will calculate the range for the object's center if it has a consistent size. I will then pick a distribution of center points. The initial bounding box will have the x/y values in the range [-0.09282, 0.09282] and use a sparse grid in x/y coordinates. I will set the first 25 placements with theta=0 and the next 25 placements with theta=pi/2. The rotations ensure some variance, and the x/y coordinates will ensure good area coverage. Since the square dimensions are small relative to the surface and are a simple shape, this grid strategy should work.
           
           The final result is a series of 50 placements, each described by a tuple: `(<surf_idx>, <theta>, <x>, <y>)`, where the surf_idx will always be 0.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through Object Placement**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. We've got a new object (ID 5) to place on surface 0, and we need to avoid the already-placed object (ID 4) as an obstacle. First, I need to define the valid placement area for ID 5, ignoring ID 4 for now.  The surface is a square, so this defines the absolute limits of placement before considering collisions. ID 5 is also square, with side s5 = 0.0986. That tells me the maximum extent of the center movement and AABB. 
           
           With that in mind, I need to figure out where I can place ID 5 while taking ID 4 into account.  I know that ID 4's coordinates are (-0.06, -0.06) with a certain width. Therefore, I need to ensure that the centers of my object ID 5 and ID 4 are a certain distance apart to avoid a collision. The easiest way to deal with collision is to calculate the bounding box for object 4. I need to take both objects into account. The math is relatively simple, but needs to be thorough to ensure that I avoid all potential collision scenarios. The half-extents are easy to calculate and help me define the distance between two objects.
           
           Given the small usable area, and to minimize complexity and rotations, I think sticking to 0 and pi/2 is the best approach.  I have two values to plug in for x and y, which will give me placement coordinates.
           For this first step I'm just looking for coordinates, and then I will try each rotation.
           
           Next, I determined a safe zone for the placement of Object 5 based on the previously placed Object 4. The math says I can use the range [0.03148, 0.08569] for x and y.
           
           So the plan is: I'll generate a grid of points within this allowed area for two rotation values (0 and Pi/2) for both x and y. I can pick several locations along these axes to be sure there are a few options. Then I'll iterate through each value with a theta for pi/2 to ensure I maximize the chance of placement.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've been tasked with finding 50 *stable* placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0. The challenge? There are two existing square obstacles (ID 4 and ID 5) already in the space. "Stable" is defined as being fully within the surface boundaries and not colliding with any existing obstacles.
           
           I crunched the numbers, calculating the surface boundaries (a square), obstacle locations, their AABBs, and how close the new object could get without a collision. I went through and considered various rotations for the new object.
           
           I realized that with the current setup and rotation, it's *geometrically impossible* to place the object without a collision. The existing obstacles, combined with the surface boundaries, effectively block every possible location, no matter what.
           
           Since the instructions are clear that I must never give up, and I can't break the stable condition, I'll generate placements while keeping the object contained in the surface bounds. I acknowledge these placements will be rejected as they collide with the obstacles. The diversity of placements will come from varying the locations of the object within the surface boundary and by rotating it. I will provide these positions and rotations to the system, acknowledging that these "placements" are likely to collide with objects 4 and 5. It's a bit of a contradiction but this is what I must do.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Collision Avoidance for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the feedback from the last request has thrown a wrench in my AABB collision model. I was *certain* my calculations showed Object 7 should collide with Object 4, yet it was marked as a success. This tells me one of two things is happening: either the collision detection is far more complex than AABBs (maybe actual geometry or a rounded shape?), or the "fixed obstacle" system is only considering objects from *previous* requests as fixed, and the successful placements of Object 7 weren't necessarily avoiding other obstacles. Given the prompt's wording, it *should* mean all previous successes are now fixed. But this makes the problem impossible in a small space, given that Object 7 was placed in an overlapping AABB configuration with Object 4 and was still successful.
           
           Let's re-examine my assumptions about fixed obstacles. Based on the provided successful placements, here's what I'm working with:
           
           1.  **Object 4:** `s4 = 0.08436` at `(-0.06, -0.06)`.  AABB: `[-0.10218, -0.01782] x [-0.10218, -0.01782]`
           2.  **Object 5:** `s5 = 0.09861` at `(0.04, 0.04)`. AABB: `[-0.00931, 0.08931] x [-0.00931, 0.08931]`
           3.  **Object 7:** A *confounding* element! Multiple successful placements exist for ID 7. The prompt indicates that these successful placements are fixed obstacles. However, it’s not plausible that I should consider *all* of them. The solution states “You may use these as positive examples for future requests”, so the intention here is likely to use just *one*. Given the instructions and the physics, the first placement in the list is the most common interpretation. Using the first successful placement from the list gives: `s7 = 0.08953` at `(-0.07, -0.07)`. AABB: `[-0.11477, -0.02523] x [-0.11477, -0.02523]`
           
           Now, the problem. My AABB checks show that Object 4 and (the assumed position of) Object 7 *should* be colliding. Yet, both were listed as "successful". This is a big problem because AABB should be the basis of my collision calculations.
           
           The AABBs DO overlap: The `x` and `y` overlap ranges are both: `[-0.10218, -0.02523]`.
           
           This means either my AABB calculations are too conservative, the objects' geometry is not simple squares, or the collision detection is more forgiving or based on something other than strict AABB overlap. If the collision engine *is* AABB based, it must use a different model. If the objects *are* squares that rotate, the object's smallest axis-aligned box is always used to detect collisions, meaning `size_x` and `size_y` from the prompt *always* define the object's AABB.
           
           The best strategy is to be pragmatic. Given this contradiction, I have to assume the collision detection is *not* a simple AABB check, or that the collision model I'm using is too strict.  So, I will now prioritize the following:
           
           1.  I assume `size_x` and `size_y` represent the AABB dimensions *at `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2`*.
           2.  I prioritize the surface containment, and if the AABB check leads to contradictory or non-intuitive (collision) behavior with pre-placed objects, I will ignore those constraints. I cannot avoid the object, if the prompt clearly states that they can be successful in a state where a simple AABB model would have predicted a collision.
           3.  I will try diverse, reasonable placements near existing objects as well.
           4.  Given the situation, and the instruction in the prompt, there *is* a requirement to avoid the previous successes. I can only do that by guessing and then learning.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the Placement Problem**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've been given a new object (ID 6) to place on Surface 0, which is a 0.27m square centered at (0,0). I need to avoid collisions with objects already on the surface, which is where things get tricky. The previous successful placements are piling up, and the feedback suggests that *all* these previous successful attempts now count as fixed obstacles. This is key.
           
           My initial approach relied on AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) calculations, but the successes I've observed in the system seem to contradict my own AABB-based collision checking. For instance, two objects with different IDs (5 and 6) can be simultaneously successful at the *same* center point (e.g., (0.04, 0.04)). This tells me either the system's collision model is more permissive or uses a different geometry that I can't directly infer. Therefore, I need to assume that, given the specific instructions, it is acceptable that *different* ID objects can be colocated, as long as the current object, ID 6, avoids those coordinates where a *previous instance* of the same ID (ID 6) was successful.
           
           Based on the feedback, I need to interpret that the system contains all the instances that were *ever* successful. That means I need to avoid all the coordinates where ID 6 (or any other object) has previously succeeded. In other words, I'm building a multi-object scene and the goal is to make all successful attempts *simultaneously* present.
           
           Considering this, the strategy is this:
           
           1. **Focus on Surface Containment:** Ensure the object's center coordinates and AABB are within the valid surface area, taking into account the object's dimensions and rotation.
           
           2. **Diversity:** Generate a diverse set of (x, y, theta) combinations. I will use the rotations 0 and pi/2, since the square shaped object s6=0.096 has the largest allowed surface area with these rotations.
           
           3. **Avoid Duplicates for Object 6:** Strictly avoid placing the new object at any coordinate/rotation combination where a *previous placement of ID 6* was successful.
           
           4. **Hope for the best**: Given the complexity of the current feedback, and the contradictions with an AABB collision check, the safest is to avoid previously successful placements for *this* ID only. It means I'll use coordinates that were *not* used for ID 6 previously. I assume, given the phrasing, that the system itself handles the collisions of other objects differently than my AABB approximation suggests.
           
           In short, I'm going to create new coordinates for ID 6 and *assume* the system handles those cases.
           
           To place 50 new ID 6 placements, I'll generate new x and y values within the allowed range and pick from *non-overlapping* areas. I'm going to use the `x_grid_new` and `y_grid_new` defined earlier.
