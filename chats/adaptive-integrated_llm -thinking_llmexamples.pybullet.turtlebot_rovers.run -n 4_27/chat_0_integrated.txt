           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal within the `rovers` domain. The task necessitates satisfying several conditions, including the `receivedimage` predicate for objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20` with mode `v11`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates for stones `v1, v3, v4` and soil `v5, v7, v8`.
           
           Initially, I identified that several conditions are already met in the initial state, such as `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`.
           
           To satisfy `receivedimage`, I understand that I need to utilize the actions `send_image`, `take_image`, and `calibrate`, and ensure the necessary preconditions like `comvisible`, `imagevisible`, `haveimage`, and `calibrated` are met.
           
           Similarly, achieving `receivedanalysis` requires using `send_analysis`, which relies on conditions like `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and `NegatedAtom blocked`.  Achieving `analyzed` requires `sample_rock`.
           
           **Analysis of Available Facts and Preconditions**
           
           I meticulously examined the available facts and preconditions to determine a viable plan. I noted the `objective` and `mode` facts. Rover v14 and v12 had onboard cameras which both supported mode v11. `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates were available for the rovers.
           
           I understood that I needed to move the rovers into a position that would allow them to take the required pictures and also communicate back to the lander. The rovers are initially in configurations v13 and v15, and the above preconditions were available with configurations like #o0, #o3, and #o5. The plan seemed to be based on:
           1. `calibrate`
           2. `take_image`
           3. `send_image`
           4. `sample_rock`
           5. `send_analysis`
           
           **Critical Issue and Plan Infeasibility**
           
           However, I encountered a critical issue when analyzing the list of allowed actions. The only actions permitted were `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.
           Crucially, these actions are the only actions available. The rovers can effectively move to their own current location. No other moves, and no camera or sample actions were allowed. Therefore, it is *impossible* for the rovers to satisfy the image and analysis preconditions.
           
           **Conclusion: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Given the limited set of available actions, it is impossible to formulate a plan that achieves the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The rovers cannot acquire images or analyses, since they cannot move into any useful positions. The goal is, therefore, unreachable within the constraints of the defined problem.
           
           I must not return a plan. The goal is unreachable given the action constraints.
