           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of Planning Process for `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which basically means getting images and analysis to the lander. The initial setup already has some stuff sorted, like both rovers (`v12` and `v14`) being in the right initial states.  I see that I need to achieve: `receivedimage` for four different objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) and `receivedanalysis` for a rock (`v1`) and a soil sample (`v5`).
           
           Breaking down the actions, getting images means I have to `calibrate`, `take_image`, and then `send_image`.  For analysis, I've got to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.  The crucial part is figuring out the geometry - the initial state has the rovers at certain configurations, and it has "objects" `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` involved in image/comm/sampling. These are important for line of sight and collision-free movement.
           
           I decided to split the work: `v14` will handle the images, and `v12` will do the analysis. This lets me plan in parallel. For images, that means going to a suitable image pose, calibrating, taking the images for each objective, and then transmitting. For analysis, it’s sampling the rocks, moving to comms position, sending the analysis, and then dropping the sample. The key here is the assumption that I have to work with what's given and that "a value to satisfy a constraint" must exist. This led me to assign rover positions and movements based on those object configurations.
           
           The prompt is specific: I've got to provide the actual continuous values (x,y,theta) for the configurations represented by the '#' objects (specifically #o0, #o3).
           
           Now, based on the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements, the trickiest bit is working around `#o3`. It's used in the initial state with *all* image targets, but the prompt says to provide a *different* value for *each (rover, target)* pair. My intuition suggested `#o3` must be a single pose, so it was all rather confusing. However, I will now interpret this as the need to list the `#o3` values for each (rover, objective) pair. Because it is given in the initial state, I have to assume that the set-up is valid. Therefore, I'll list all object configurations (#o0, #o3) needed for comms and image taking separately (and I will provide just the coordinates and face angles), as instructed. This strategy is also the safest.

           The prompt is specific: I've got to provide the actual continuous values (x,y,theta) for the configurations represented by the '#' objects (specifically #o0, #o3).
           
           Now, based on the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` requirements, the trickiest bit is working around `#o3`. It's used in the initial state with *all* image targets, but the prompt says to provide a *different* value for *each (rover, target)* pair. My intuition suggested `#o3` must be a single pose, so it was all rather confusing. However, I will now interpret this as the need to list the `#o3` values for each (rover, objective) pair. Because it is given in the initial state, I have to assume that the set-up is valid. Therefore, I'll list all object configurations (#o0, #o3) needed for comms and image taking separately (and I will provide just the coordinates and face angles), as instructed. This strategy is also the safest.

Configuration #o3 = (0.5 1.0 1.57) for rover v14 at target v19 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.

(Thoughts: **Refining Continuous Parameters for Rover Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback on my initial plan. It seems I need to be more precise with my continuous parameters for the rovers' movements and observations. The core issue is that I need to ensure the parameters I'm using, `#o0` and `#o3`, actually *work* for their intended purposes. The plan requires satisfying the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, which relate to visibility and communication, and the problem constraints seem to be pretty strict.
           
           Let me break down what I need to do:
           
           1.  **Understand the Constraints:** I'm dealing with reachability, collision avoidance, and occlusion-free line-of-sight. Also, *how* I define and use these continuous parameters like `#o0` and `#o3` determines the validity of the overall plan.
           2.  **Rover `v14` & Imaging:** For rover `v14`, I'm looking at objects `v17, v18, v19, v20`. I need a way to set the continuous parameters so that `v14` can image these objects. The instruction says that *if* I use `#o3` to image *multiple* objects, I am *required* to make `conf(v14, #o3)` *one single specific* configuration so it can image all of the objects. This is key. The initial idea of `#o3` *being a placeholder for a unique pose* is the correct one.
           3.  **Rover `v12` & Sampling:** Rover `v12` is tasked with sampling rocks, namely `v1` (stone) and `v5` (soil). Similar rules apply to rover `v12` movements.
           4.  **Re-Evaluate the continuous configurations:** Based on feedback, I need to come up with new, valid `#o3` instances so that the *same* `#o3` can image the objectives with `v14` (also for `#o0` when communicating to `v9`).
           5.  **Re-Plan:** I'll use `v15=(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)` for the initial location of `v14` and `v13=(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)` as the initial pose for `v12` respectively.
           
           **My Approach:**
           
           Instead of trying to find a *single* configuration that satisfies all image visibility for all objectives for each rover's actions, I will assign different names to the object and `imagevisible` so that I can provide different continuous values that are valid per action:
           
           -   `#o3_v14_v17`: The configuration for `v14` to image `v17`.
           -   `#o3_v14_v18`: The configuration for `v14` to image `v18`.
           -   `#o3_v14_v19`: The configuration for `v14` to image `v19`.
           -   `#o3_v14_v20`: The configuration for `v14` to image `v20`.
           -   `#o0_v14_v9`: The configuration for `v14` to communicate with the lander.
           -   `#o5_v12_v1`: The configuration for `v12` to sample `v1`.
           -   `#o0_v12_v9`: The configuration for `v12` to communicate with the lander.
           -   `#o5_v12_v5`: The configuration for `v12` to sample `v5`.
           
           I need to come up with specific 3D coordinates (x, y, theta) for these parameters:
           
           -   *For `#o3`, Rover `v14`:* Starting from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, to image targets I decided on the following:
               -   `#o3_v14_v17`: `(1.0, 1.0, 0.785)`
               -   `#o3_v14_v18`: `(-1.0, 1.0, 2.356)`
               -   `#o3_v14_v19`: `(0.0, 1.0, 1.57)`
               -   `#o3_v14_v20`: `(-0.5, 1.0, 1.57)`

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1.  Both `v12` and `v14` to be at `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           2.  Both `v12` and `v14` to have free storage `v16`.
           3.  Images of `v17, v18, v19, v20` to be received.
           4.  Analysis of a stone-type rock (e.g., `v1`) and a soil-type rock (e.g., `v5`) to be received.
           
           I will continue to assign imaging tasks to `v14` and sampling/analysis tasks to `v12`. The main challenge is finding valid, collision-free, and reachable configurations for all actions, especially given the continuous nature of some parameters. I'll focus on providing configurations that are more likely to be valid within the specified constraints (distance, reachability, collision-free, occlusion-free).
           
           For `v14` (imaging):
           -   Objectives `v17` (AABB: ((1.996, 1.906), (2.088, 1.999))), `v18` (AABB: ((-2.128, 2.099), (-2.04, 2.187))), `v19` (AABB: ((0.499, 1.887), (0.582, 1.97))), `v20` (AABB: ((-0.449, 2.078), (-0.35, 2.177))) are all in the upper part of the map (positive y coordinates). I need to find positions for `v14` (initial position `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`) that allow it to image these.
               -   For `v17`: Position `v14` around `(1.5, 1.0)` with an angle towards `v17`.
               -   For `v18`: Position `v14` around `(-1.5, 1.0)` with an angle towards `v18`.
               -   For `v19`: Position `v14` around `(0.0, 1.0)` with an angle towards `v19`.
               -   For `v20`: Position `v14` around `(-1.0, 1.0)` with an angle towards `v20`.
           -   For `v14` (communicating with `v9`): Lander `v9` (AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))) is in the lower-left. `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)` is close to it. A configuration like `(-0.5, -1.75, 3.14)` would face the lander.
           
           For `v12` (sampling and analysis):
           -   Rocks `v1` (AABB: ((1.473, -1.407), (1.576, -1.304))) and `v5` (AABB: ((-0.653, 1.019), (-0.526, 1.146))).
               -   For `v1`: `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. A position around `(1.5, -1.5, 0.0)` would be `above` `v1`. The previous collision was `v22` (AABB: ((1.33, -0.93), (1.44, -0.82))), so I need to avoid this. A config like `(1.5, -1.5, 0.0)` is too close to `v1`. Let's try `(1.5, -1.35, 0.0)`.
               -   For `v5`: `v12` needs to move up the map. A position around `(-0.6, 0.5, 1.57)` would be `above` `v5`.
           -   For `v12` (communicating with `v9`): `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. A configuration like `(-0.5, -1.75, 3.14)` would be ideal for communication with `v9`.
           
           I will try to choose points that are slightly offset from obstacles and within reasonable range of the targets.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Plan Construction and Configuration Validation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to achieve the new-axiom goal, which boils down to several sub-goals: Rovers need to be in specific configurations, images need to be received, and analyses need to be done. I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, both initially at correct configurations, with free storage, and a camera onboard both rovers, capable of capturing images in a particular mode.  I have images to receive, and analyses.
           
           I've got a strategy to divide and conquer: v14 will handle all imaging and transmission, while v12 handles sampling and analysis. I'll need to figure out valid configuration positions for each of these actions, particularly focusing on how to avoid collision, ensure the range limits are obeyed and that all targets have clear line-of-sight.
           
           The previous attempts failed. The primary challenge is finding valid configurations. The current state presents several obstacles that make this tricky. Previous attempts failed due to:
           -	`#o3` collisions with imaging objectives, and not being reachable;
           -	`#o0` unreachable communication config;
           -	`#o5` collision with objects that are to be sampled.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the object locations and try to find valid poses. I have the initial positions of the rovers, and the lander location. I can infer from `motion` predicates that the rovers are capable of moving.
           
           **Strategy Refinement**
           
           Here's my refined approach: I'm going to look at each individual operation, for both rovers, and try to find a configuration that is:
           1.  **Reachable**: The robot base has to be able to get there from where it starts, ideally in a reasonably direct path, and according to the rules of `motion` given by the system.
           2.  **Collision-free**: I must ensure that the robot is clear of any obstacles.
           3.  **Occlusion-free**: Line of sight is the key.
           4.  **Range**: the distances are 2 units for imagevisible actions and 4 for comvisible actions.
           
           I have re-calculated the coordinates and distance between the target object centers and those proposed configurations. I have also rechecked the AABBs to be sure that the collision checks are correct.
           
           **Configuration Details and Plan Implementation**
           
           Now, let's nail down these configurations. For Rover v14, I'm aiming for these configurations with appropriate (x, y, theta) coordinates. I am sure that for communication and sampling, the same logic will apply: make sure that coordinates are reasonably close to obstacles, that the targets and the rovers are clear of obstacles, and within the 4 range limit. Also, I must be sure to use the exact specified configuration names (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`).
           
           Here's what I came up with:
           
           **v14 (Imaging):**
           - `#o3` (v17): (1.7, 1.7, 0.785)
           - `#o3` (v18): (-1.8, 1.8, 2.356)
           - `#o3` (v19): (0.3, 1.7, 1.57)
           - `#o3` (v20): (-0.2, 1.8, 1.57)
           
           **v14 (Communication):**
           - `#o0`: (-1.5, -1.9, 3.14)
           
           **v12 (Sampling):**
           - `#o5`: (1.5, -1.2, 0.0)
           - `#o5`: (-0.5, 0.8, 1.57)
           
           **v12 (Communication):**
           - `#o0`: (-1.0, -1.8, 3.14)
           
           So, the new plan is simply a matter of plugging in these new configurations in the original plan structure. I had to assume the given objects in `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` actions are valid, and those actions are possible.
           
)

Model:     **Plan Construction and Configuration Validation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to achieve the new-axiom goal, which boils down to several sub-goals: Rovers need to be in specific configurations, images need to be received, and analyses need to be done. I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, both initially at correct configurations, with free storage, and a camera onboard both rovers, capable of capturing images in a particular mode.  I have images to receive, and analyses.
           
           I've got a strategy to divide and conquer: v14 will handle all imaging and transmission, while v12 handles sampling and analysis. I'll need to figure out valid configuration positions for each of these actions, particularly focusing on how to avoid collision, ensure the range limits are obeyed and that all targets have clear line-of-sight.
           
           The previous attempts failed. The primary challenge is finding valid configurations. The current state presents several obstacles that make this tricky. Previous attempts failed due to:
           -	`#o3` collisions with imaging objectives, and not being reachable;
           -	`#o0` unreachable communication config;
           -	`#o5` collision with objects that are to be sampled.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the object locations and try to find valid poses. I have the initial positions of the rovers, and the lander location. I can infer from `motion` predicates that the rovers are capable of moving.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement for Imaging and Sampling Objectives**
           
           Okay, here's my refined plan. I've been wrestling with the constraints—avoiding collisions, ensuring reachability, and staying within imaging/sampling ranges—and I think I have a solid set of configurations for both rovers.  The main challenge has been navigating the tight spaces and avoiding those pesky obstacles, especially the AABBs that kept throwing a wrench in the works in previous attempts. I also had to take into account the "above" predicate, which seems to imply the rover must be within a certain distance of the rocks, meaning the distance and position of the robot from the sample site is important.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Imaging)**
           
           *   **Imaging:** For each imaging target, I've chosen a position that maximizes distance from the obstacles.
               *   `v17`:  `(1.5, 1.0, 0.785)` - Facing NE. I hope this spot is far enough from the `v24` obstacle.
               *   `v18`:  `(-1.5, 1.0, 2.356)` - Facing NW. This should be clear of `v25`.
               *   `v19`:  `(0.1, 1.2, 1.57)` - Facing N, just barely avoiding `v21` and `v26`.
               *   `v20`:  `(-0.8, 1.2, 1.57)` - Facing N, avoiding `v27`.
           *   **Communication:**  `(-1.0, -1.5, 3.14)` - Facing W, outside the lander's bounding box and within communication range. I double checked the math and it is about 1 unit away from the center of the lander.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Sampling)**
           
           *   **Sampling:** For each sample, I've had to navigate around those obstacles.
               *   `v1`:  `(1.2, -1.3, 0.0)` - Facing E, positioned to be close enough to be "above" the stone, while remaining away from `v22`.
               *   `v5`:  `(-0.8, 0.8, 1.57)` - Facing N, far enough to remain "above" the soil.
           *   **Communication:** `(-0.5, -1.5, 3.14)` - Facing W, to maximize the chances that this is a reachable spot near the lander.
           
           I've tried to make sure these positions are within a reasonable distance and, ideally, offer clear paths to the targets. I'm hoping that, by making these incremental adjustments, I've finally sidestepped those pesky collision and reachability issues, but I'm cautiously optimistic. I think I've taken the lessons from the previous failures to heart and applied them effectively. Now, it's just a matter of seeing if the path planner agrees!

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for New Axiom - Expert Level**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, based on a deep dive into the scene geometry and those nasty constraints we're up against. We need to nail down specific rover configurations to ensure those imaging, sampling, and communication goals all get met, and stay collision-free while we're at it. The initial attempts failed due to collision and visibility problems, so let's get into the details:
           
           **Rover `v14` (imaging and sending)**: Needs to grab images of objectives and communicate to the lander. The starting configuration is `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.
           
           *   **Imaging Objective `v17`**: I'm proposing a configuration of `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (1.6, 1.5)`. This puts `v14` roughly NE of `v17`, clear of obstacle `v24` and within the 2-unit visibility range. The rotation (around `0.785` radians) helps make sure the camera is aligned. Distance between centers is ~0.63. Good.
           *   **Imaging Objective `v18`**: For `v18`, I'm going with `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (-1.8, 1.5)`. Facing NW to get a good look, staying clear of `v25` and within the visual distance. The angle helps, and this distance is at ~0.7.
           *   **Imaging Objective `v19`**: For this one, the configuration is `(#o3 v14 #o4 v19): (0.1, 1.5)`. Facing North. This position avoids wall `v21` and obstacle `v26`, ensuring `v19` is visible. Distance is ~0.61.
           *   **Imaging Objective `v20`**: `(#o3 v14 #o4 v20): (-0.6, 1.5)`. Facing North, we stay clear of `v21` and `v27`, with a distance of ~0.65.
           *   **Communication with Lander `v9`**:  `(#o0 v14 #o4 v9): (-0.5, -1.5)`.  This puts us at an effective range within 4 units, avoiding collision with the lander. Distance to lander's center is ~1.48.
           
           **Rover `v12` (sampling and sending)**: `v12` will focus on collecting data and relaying it. Its start point is `v13` at `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`.
           
           *   **Sampling Rock `v1`**: Configuration `(#o5 v12 #o4 v1): (1.2, -1.5)`. This is ideal to sample, and avoids collision with obstacle `v22`.
           *   **Sampling Rock `v5`**: For soil, use `(#o5 v12 #o4 v5): (-0.5, 0.8)`. This keeps `v12` near `v5` while staying clear of the x=0 wall.
           *   **Communication with Lander `v9`**: Identical to `v14`, `(#o0 v12 #o4 v9): (-0.5, -1.5)`.
           
           **Important Considerations**:
           
           *   **Range Checks**: Distances must be less or equal to the maximum ranges. Also, be sure that `v12` and `v14` are moving within the limits and are collision-free throughout the entire motion.
           *   **Line of Sight**: Ensure there are not any visual occlusions on the lines of sight, with obstacles and rover's body.
           *   **Reachability**: Movement between rover initial and final positions are possible. `move` actions should be allowed between states, and `motion` facts should be valid.
           
           Let's double-check all those `move` actions for both robots to confirm they're doable given these precise positions. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates must be met for each case. Given what I have seen and the previous failures, I am confident we can solve `new-axiom@0()`.

           **Important Considerations**:
           
           *   **Range Checks**: Distances must be less or equal to the maximum ranges. Also, be sure that `v12` and `v14` are moving within the limits and are collision-free throughout the entire motion.
           *   **Line of Sight**: Ensure there are not any visual occlusions on the lines of sight, with obstacles and rover's body.
           *   **Reachability**: Movement between rover initial and final positions are possible. `move` actions should be allowed between states, and `motion` facts should be valid.
           
           Let's double-check all those `move` actions for both robots to confirm they're doable given these precise positions. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates must be met for each case. Given what I have seen and the previous failures, I am confident we can solve `new-axiom@0()`.
