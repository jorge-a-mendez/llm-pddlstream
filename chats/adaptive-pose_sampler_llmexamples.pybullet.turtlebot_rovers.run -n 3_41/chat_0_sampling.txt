User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is essentially a large square room defined by bounding boxes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. There's a vertical wall in the middle (box 5). Many smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the room, primarily concentrated in the top-left and top-right quadrants, but also some near the bottom-left and right.
           
           Given the target point, I will try to place the robot in a circle of radius 2 around it. I will prioritize positions that are not too close to the obstacles, and I will try to diversify my choices as much as possible by using angles. I'll generally try to be on one side or another of the target, and prefer positions that are further away from walls.

Model:     The scene is a square room with a central vertical wall. There are many smaller obstacles scattered throughout, particularly in the upper half of the room. The previous attempt at (1.4939050519129532, 2.379203913009589) collided with the top wall (box 0). This tells me that the Y coordinate was too high and went beyond the bounds of the room. I will adjust my strategy to ensure the y-coordinate is kept within the bounds of the room. I will still prioritize positions that are not too close to other obstacles, and I will try to diversify my choices as much as possible by using angles.

This confirms that a high Y-coordinate can lead to collisions. I will ensure that the y-coordinate for new positions is not too high. I will reuse previous successful positions if they seem valid, but will continue to diversify my choices as much as possible, focusing on positions within the range of 2 from the target and avoiding the known collision area.

Model:     The scene is a square room with a central vertical wall (box 5) and many smaller obstacles, particularly in the upper half.
           
           Analyzing the past failures:
           1. (1.4939050519129532, 2.379203913009589) for target (0.5871191024780273, 2.1900696754455566) collided with the top wall (box 0). This confirms high Y values near the wall are problematic.
           2. (2.0722378810235775, 1.0558153400269095) for target (-1.9009017944335938, 1.885944128036499) had no line of sight. This is expected given the target is far on the left and the proposed position is far on the right, likely blocked by the central wall (box 5) or other obstacles.
           3. (0.04359418844890664, 1.2223838428803377) for target (-1.9009017944335938, 1.885944128036499) collided with box 5 (the central vertical wall). This position is very close to the wall, which makes sense.
           4. (0.9168058249679168, -0.6588524248001405) for target (-1.9009017944335938, 1.885944128036499) had no line of sight. Again, the target is on the far left and high, while the position is on the right and low. This is also expected due to the central wall and distance.
           
           From these failures, I've learned that I need to be careful with proximity to the central wall (box 5) and ensure the robot is on the correct side of the central wall (box 5) to have line-of-sight to the target. I also need to avoid placing the robot too close to the outer walls.
           
           The current target is (0.9168058249679169, 1.3411475751998595). This target is on the right side of the central wall (box 5). Therefore, all proposed positions should also be on the right side (x > 0.05). I'll also aim for positions that are not too close to the top wall (y < 2.45).
