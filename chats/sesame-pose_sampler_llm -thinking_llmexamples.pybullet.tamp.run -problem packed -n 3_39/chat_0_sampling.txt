(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. This object is a square with dimensions (0.07367, 0.07367), and surface 0 is a square area defined by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Since the object and surface are both squares, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees do not change the bounding box dimensions from a stability perspective, as the square is symmetric. However, I must consider arbitrary rotations for the effective bounding box calculations. The key is to ensure the object's AABB is fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           For simplicity, I will use surface 0 for all placements. First, I determine the valid ranges for the object's center (x, y) for both 0 and pi/4 rotations.
           The maximum size of the AABB is 0.1042 when rotated by 45 deg or theta = pi/4.
           Valid x,y range for center when rotated by theta = 0: is [-0.098, 0.098].
           
           For theta= 0, I create a 7 x 7 grid within the range [-0.09,0.09] and the grid is defined by values {-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09}.
           
           For the 50th placement, I use a rotation of `pi/4` (45 degrees) and center it at (0, 0).
           
           Because this is the initial request, I have no collision data, so I'm assuming that the basic AABB containment rule is sufficient to meet the requirements for stable placements, and no further considerations are needed.

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got the go-ahead – object 5 is successfully placed! Its AABB is now at `(-0.1268, -0.1268)` to `(-0.0531, -0.0531)`. Now, I'm tasked with placing object 4, which is a square with side `s4 = 0.09896`. Surface 0 is a nice, big square: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. I need to find 50 stable placements for object 4 on this surface without any overlap with object 5.
           
           First, I figured out that, at `theta = 0`, object 4's effective half-size will be `0.0495`, so I'm calculating the allowable range for its center. In the x and y axes, it's `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`.
           
           To find 50 safe spots, I'll generate a grid of potential center points for object 4 with an offset from object 5. My method is to look for collision, so I'm picking up a grid of points within the allowed range and skip collision with object 5, which ends roughly at `x=-0.05316` and `y=-0.05316`. Any AABB overlaps here means a potential collision.
           
           I'm working with a center point `(x4, y4)` now. I'll check collisions where my `x4` and `y4` coordinates might collide. If object 4's AABB (which is a center point and a `S_eff4_half`) falls within the box of object 5, it means a collision is taking place.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I'll use a `9x9` grid for potential center points of object 4 where the `x` and `y` coordinates are equally spaced from `-0.08` to `0.08`.  I can easily filter for collision by checking if the AABBs of objects 4 and 5 overlap using these coordinates. The collision zone is where both `x` and `y` fall between `-0.1763` and `-0.0036`.  Since `y` is the same, this means the center needs to fall beyond that zone.
           
           I have selected the following 50 points, which should guarantee no collision with object 5:
           (0, 0, -0.08, 0.0), (0, 0, -0.08, 0.02), (0, 0, -0.08, 0.04), (0, 0, -0.08, 0.06), (0, 0, -0.08, 0.08), (0, 0, -0.06, 0.0), (0, 0, -0.06, 0.02), (0, 0, -0.06, 0.04), (0, 0, -0.06, 0.06), (0, 0, -0.06, 0.08), (0, 0, -0.04, 0.0), (0, 0, -0.04, 0.02), (0, 0, -0.04, 0.04), (0, 0, -0.04, 0.06), (0, 0, -0.04, 0.08), (0, 0, -0.02, 0.0), (0, 0, -0.02, 0.02), (0, 0, -0.02, 0.04), (0, 0, -0.02, 0.06), (0, 0, -0.02, 0.08), (0, 0, 0.0, -0.08), (0, 0, 0.0, -0.06), (0, 0, 0.0, -0.04), (0, 0, 0.0, -0.02), (0, 0, 0.0, 0.0), (0, 0, 0.0

(Thoughts: **Finalized Placement Strategy for 50 Stable Positions of Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's what I've worked out: I need to place Object 6, which is a square, 50 times on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing Objects 5 and 4. I've analyzed their placements and sizes to make sure I don't run into problems.
           
           *   **Group 1 (36 Placements - Theta = 0):**  I'll place Object 6 with no rotation (theta = 0) at various x, y positions. The x-coordinates will be selected from the set {0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08}, and the y-coordinates will be from the grid {-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08}. This ensures I am safe with the geometry on the surface.
           
           *   **Group 2 (5 Placements - Theta = pi/4):** I will place Object 6 with a rotation of 45 degrees (theta = pi/4)  with a small shift. The x-coordinate will always be at 0.06, and the y-coordinate will be chosen from {-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06}.  (These are the most reliable spots)
           
           *   **Group 3 (5 Placements - Theta = -pi/4):** Again, I will place Object 6 with a rotation of -45 degrees (theta = -pi/4) using the same coordinates as Group 2, to ensure symmetry across the plane of the surface.  This also ensures I don't create problems due to the chosen orientation.
           
           *   **Group 4 (4 Placements - Theta = pi/2):** For these, the angle is 90 degrees (theta = pi/2), with x=0.02, and y in {-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02}. These make up the last placements needed on this surface.
           
           I've carefully verified that none of these positions collide. With this approach, I am confident I've found 50 valid, stable placements for Object 6.
