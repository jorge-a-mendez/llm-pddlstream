           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The goal is straightforward: get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto v18.  Easy enough in principle, right? They're currently on v11.  The `on` predicate tells me that each object needs to be both supported by v18 *and* located at pose #o2. Based on the initial facts,  the `supported` facts indicate that #o2 is the correct place on v18.
           
           Here's the problem: *I only have one action* available to me: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move base is simply a no-op; it's just setting `canmove` to false. And this is clearly a useless action for this situation.
           
           My understanding of the situation means I need to *pick* and *place* those objects. I have to pick up each object from v11 and place it on v18.  That's the only way to alter the `atpose` relationships and to successfully achieve the desired `on` state.
           
           But I have *no* pick and place actions available. Without those, there is no plan.  I'm stuck. It's impossible to reach the goal with only a move base no-op. The prompt specifies I can only use available actions. Therefore, this goal is unsolvable under the current constraints.
