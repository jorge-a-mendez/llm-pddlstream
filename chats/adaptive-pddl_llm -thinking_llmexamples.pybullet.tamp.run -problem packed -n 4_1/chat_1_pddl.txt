               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break down this planning problem. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. The key to this is the axiom `on(?o, ?r)`, which translates to `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I've confirmed that each object can be supported on `v18` at pose `#o2` based on the initial state. However, the `atpose` states of these objects are currently different from `#o2`.
           
           This means I need to `place` each object onto `v18` at pose `#o2`. I've analyzed the initial state and confirmed the feasibility of placing these objects on `v18` with the appropriate kinematic information. Crucially, the robot base needs to be in a specific configuration (`#o3`) to perform `pick` and `place` actions, as dictated by the `kin` predicates.
           
           My initial state tells me the robot base is at `v3`, expressed as `atbconf(v3)`.  The only available `move_base` action, however, is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does *not* transition the base to `#o3`; it simply maintains the current base configuration.  I've verified that all the `pick` and `place` actions require the base to be at `#o3` (`atbconf(#o3)`).
           
           Since there is no `move_base` action available to achieve `atbconf(#o3)`, and I'm constrained to only use the provided action instances, I am forced to conclude that the goal is *unachievable* within the given constraints. The robot cannot change its base configuration to enable the necessary pick-and-place actions to achieve the desired `on` predicates. The available actions do not support achieving `atbconf(#o3)`. Therefore, the planning problem is unsolvable.
