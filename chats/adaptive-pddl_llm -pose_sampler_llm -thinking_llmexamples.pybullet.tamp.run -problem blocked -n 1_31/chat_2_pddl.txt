           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the `new-axiom@0()` Goal in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, this means I need to make sure an object, let's call it `?green`, is `on` another object, say `v18`, and that this `?green` object must also be of a specific type, `v17`.
           
           First, I need to understand what objects are of type `v17`. Looking at the initial state, I see both `v8` and `v12` fit this description. My initial thought is to make either `v8` or `v12` go `on` `v18`.
           
           Now, I analyze `v18`. I don't see any explicit region types defined for `v18` in the initial state. But, I see it's related to some stackable predicates. Specifically, I see `v12` *and* `v8` are stackable on `v18`, suggesting it's likely a supporting structure.
           
           Given the `on` axiom, to have something `on` `v18` means I need to find a pose `p` such that `supported(?o, p, v18)` and place that object `?o` at that pose `p`. Looking at my available facts, I see `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This tells me that either `v12` or `v8` *can* be supported at pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           So, I decide to pursue moving `v12` to `v18` as the path to satisfy this goal. I know `v12` is of type `v17`, and that is a key requirement of the `new-axiom` predicate.
           
           Looking at `v12`'s current state, it's `atpose(v12, v13)`, supported on a supporting structure at pose `v13`. It's graspable and stackable on `v18` (and also `v10`).
           
           To move `v12`, I'll need to use two steps. First, pick it up from `v13`. Second, place it onto `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Checking the preconditions for the `pick` action with an arm `v4`, I realize that I need to be in a base configuration at the time. Right now, I'm at `v3` and the base is not set to `atbconf(#o3)`. Therefore, I must use the `move_base` action. I check the available `move_base` predicates and parameters. I can achieve the correct base configuration and then proceed with the `pick` action.
           
           So, the plan unfolds like this: first, execute `move_base` to reach the configuration `#o3`. Then, perform `pick` to grasp `v12`. I need to be very sure that all applicable `atpose` and `atbconf` predicates are true for the required parameters.
           
           I then check the conditions for the `place` action. Assuming my base configuration has been addressed in the pick action, all of the preconditions are satisfied, so I can place `v12` at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Post execution,  `atpose(v12, #o2)` is true. And I know that the fact that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is also true. This also means that `on(v12, v18)` is true. Finally, I confirm that `type(v12, v17)` is true. The goal is satisfied because all requirements of `new-axiom` are satisfied.
           
           I review all object variables used in the plan to assure they are correct. `v4` is the arm. `v12` is the desired object, and so on.
           
           The plan appears optimal because the plan satisfies the preconditions and achieves the goal.
           
           The plan should have low cost because each action is assumed to cost at least a little bit. The move action is based on distance, and the pick and place are assumed to also cost non-negative.
