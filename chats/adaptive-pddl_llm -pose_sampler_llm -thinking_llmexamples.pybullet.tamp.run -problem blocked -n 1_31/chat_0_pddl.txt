           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.0974484802162543, 0.09744848021625363)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0.**  I'm dealing with an object that's essentially a small square (dimensions: 0.0974 x 0.0974) and a rectangular surface defined by the bounding box ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). My goal is to find 50 different positions and orientations (theta) where the object is *guaranteed* to be fully contained within the surface's boundaries.
           
           The critical piece here is making sure the bounding box of the *rotated* object stays inside the surface. Since the object's small, I'll initially ignore rotation for simplicity, but I *must* account for rotation to get diverse results. To be safe for *any* rotation, I need to use the maximum possible AABB size the object can have.  Since the object is close to a square, this will happen when the object is rotated by pi/4 (or 45 degrees).
           
           The half-extents of the object will be: size/2 = 0.04872424010812715. The maximum half-extent when rotated will be: sqrt(2) * 0.04872424010812715 = 0.0688949826079961. This sets the boundary conditions.
           
           Here's my strategy:
           
           1. **Calculate Safe Range for (x, y):** Given the surface bounding box and the maximum rotated half-extents, I'll calculate the safest ranges for the object's center (x, y) to *guarantee* containment, regardless of rotation.  The new bounds for x and y are [4.26889, 4.7311] and [-0.5311, -0.06889]
           2. **Create a Grid:** I will create a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this safe range.
           3. **Add Rotation:** For each grid point, I'll consider two different rotation angles: 0 radians (no rotation) and pi/2 radians (90 degrees).  That gives me 50 total combinations.
           
           The placement generation process:
           - I'll create `x_coordinates` using 5 equally spaced values between 4.268894982607996 and 4.731105017392004.
           - I'll create `y_coordinates` using 5 equally spaced values between -0.531105017392004 and -0.0688949826079961.
           - Each generated coordinate will have the appropriate surf_idx, theta, x and y attributes.
