           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Summary of My Analysis**
           
           My initial thought was, "Okay, let's break down this `new-axiom@0()` goal."  It boils down to getting an object of a specific type (`v17`) onto `v18`.  I quickly identified `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates since they have the correct `type`.  Then I dug into what "being on" actually *means*: essentially, an object has to be "supported" by `v18` and in a matching "atpose" configuration.
           
           My initial approach was, "Alright, I'll need a plan involving `pick` and `place`." My analysis of the preconditions and effects of these actions, along with the given `kin` facts and initial state, clearly illustrated a way to make the target axiom true, if only I was permitted to use the actions!
           
           That's where the problem hit me like a brick wall.  The problem description *very clearly* stated that *only* actions in the provided "list of valid action instances" are allowed.  And the provided list?  It only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action essentially does nothing; it just resets the planner's internal base-configuration to its initial state, which is irrelevant to the goal I am trying to achieve.
           
           I re-read the problem statement *carefully*.  This crucial point – the restriction to only a *predefined small list* of action instances - makes the goal utterly impossible. The goal requires manipulating objects to satisfy the `on` predicate, and I can't do that with just the base-configuration resetting `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, the only honest answer is: **the `new-axiom@0()` goal is unreachable** given the constraints.
