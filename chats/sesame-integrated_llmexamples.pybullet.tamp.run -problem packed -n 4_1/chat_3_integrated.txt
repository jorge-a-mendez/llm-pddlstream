           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q6', '#t39'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g1', '#q6', '#t9'))

           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p4', '#g1', '#q8', '#t11'))

           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v16', 'p7', '#g3', '#q11', '#t22'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v14', 'p6', 'v8', 'p4')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The problem asks us to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto the surface v18. Currently, all four objects are on v11, which is a different surface. Some objects have multiple poses on v10 and v18 in the initial state. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is controllable.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing `v14` at `p6` collided with `v8` at `p4`. This implies that `p6` and `p4` are too close to each other on the surface `v18` for `v14` and `v8` to be placed there simultaneously. We need to choose poses for these objects that are collision-free.
           
           Looking at the AABBs of the objects:
           v14: ((-0.085, -0.035), (-0.015, 0.035))
           v12: ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035))
           v8: ((-0.035, -0.085), (0.035, -0.015))
           v16: ((0.175, -0.397), (0.27, -0.302))
           
           The poses for v8, v12, v14, and v16 on v18 are:
           v8: p4 (0.0, -0.05, 0.782), p8 (0.0, -0.05, 0.782)
           v12: p5 (0.05, 0.0, 0.782), p9 (0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           v14: p6 (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782), p10 (-0.05, 0.0, 0.782)
           v16: p7 (0.0, 0.05, 0.782), p11 (0.0, 0.05, 0.782)
           
           Note that p4 and p8 for v8 are the same, p5 and p9 for v12 are the same, p6 and p10 for v14 are the same, and p7 and p11 for v16 are the same. This means that if `p4` and `p6` caused a collision, then `p8` and `p10` would also cause a collision, as would `p4` and `p10`, and `p8` and `p6`. It seems the fixed poses for these objects on `v18` are problematic for simultaneous placement.
           
           We have a free pose `#o2` which can be used for any of the objects on `v18`. Since the existing `p4, p5, p6, p7` and their duplicates are causing collisions, we need to find new collision-free poses.
           The surface `v18` has AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Let's try to place the objects in a way that minimizes collision by utilizing the `#o2` pose. We need to find 4 collision-free poses on v18. Since `p4` and `p6` are too close, we should place objects further apart. We will use `#o2` for each object. We need to provide distinct continuous values for `#o2` for each object.
           
           We can place `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16` on `v18` using the free pose `#o2` for each. We will need to compute 4 separate poses for `#o2` to accommodate all 4 objects. Let's try placing them in the corners of `v18`.
           
           Object v8 AABB: ((-0.035, -0.085), (0.035, -0.015)). Object v18 AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           A good corner pose for v8 on v18, considering its shape, could be around (-0.1, -0.1).
           A good corner pose for v12 on v18, considering its shape, could be around (0.1, -0.1).
           A good corner pose for v14 on v18, considering its shape, could be around (-0.1, 0.1).
           A good corner pose for v16 on v18, considering its shape, could be around (0.1, 0.1).
           
           We need to pick each object from its initial pose (on v11) and place it on one of the new collision-free poses on v18. Since all `kin` actions for picking use `#o3` for the base configuration and `#o4` for the trajectory, we will use these. We also have `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`. So, the robot needs to move its base to `#o3` first if not already there, and then to `v3` again. In this case, since the robot is already at `v3`, we will assume that `#o3` refers to a configuration close enough to `v3` such that the provided `kin` actions are valid, or that a `move_base` to `#o3` and then back to `v3` is allowed. The simplest plan is to move to `#o3` once, and stay there for all pick and place operations, as the `kin` actions use `#o3`.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           1. Move base to `#o3` from `v3`.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`.
           3. Place `v8` at `#o2` (first instance for v8) on `v18`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`.
           5. Place `v12` at `#o2` (second instance for v12) on `v18`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` using arm `v4`.
           7. Place `v14` at `#o2` (third instance for v14) on `v18`.
           8. Pick `v16` from `v17` using arm `v4`.
           9. Place `v16` at `#o2` (fourth instance for v16) on `v18`.
           
           For the continuous values for `#o2`:
           v8: `(-0.1, -0.1, 0.782, 0.0)`
           v12: `(0.1, -0.1, 0.782, 0.0)`
           v14: `(-0.1, 0.1, 0.782, 0.0)`
           v16: `(0.1, 0.1, 0.782, 0.0)`
           
           The `kin` actions provided are `kin(v4, <object>, <pose>, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. This implies that `#o1` is the grasp for all objects.

Model:     The previous plan failed because the provided poses for `#o2` were not stable; the objects extended beyond the boundaries of the `v18` surface. I need to re-calculate the poses to ensure they are within the bounds of `v18`.
           
           Let's re-examine the AABBs:
           Surface `v18`: AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). This means `x` can range from -0.135 to 0.135, and `y` from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Object `v8`: AABB = ((-0.035, -0.085), (0.035, -0.015)). This object is oriented in a way that its length is along the y-axis, and its width along the x-axis. It's approximately 0.07 units wide (0.035 - (-0.035)) and 0.07 units long (0.085 - 0.015).
           Object `v12`: AABB = ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035)). This object is oriented such that its length is along the x-axis, and its width along the y-axis. It's approximately 0.07 units wide (0.035 - (-0.035)) and 0.07 units long (0.085 - 0.015).
           Object `v14`: AABB = ((-0.085, -0.035), (-0.015, 0.035)). Similar to `v12` but shifted in x-axis.
           Object `v16`: AABB = ((0.175, -0.397), (0.27, -0.302)). This object is significantly larger and is currently not fitting in the given surface (0.135 range for x and y). Let me double check its original AABB. It seems this object definition is for a different purpose, perhaps related to the original configuration. Given the `stackable(v16, v18)` predicate, it *should* fit. Let's assume the bounding box given for `v16` is not its real one in this context, or it will fit when considering its local frame after rotation. Given the failure from the previous prompt, it's safer to use a more conservative estimate for the center. For the sake of stability, let's assume `v16` has a similar size to the other objects.
           
           If we place the center of `v8` at (x,y), its AABB would be (x-0.035, y-0.085) to (x+0.035, y-0.015). To be within `v18`, the range must be (-0.135, 0.135).
           So, x-0.035 > -0.135 => x > -0.1
           x+0.035 < 0.135 => x < 0.1
           y-0.085 > -0.135 => y > -0.05
           y-0.015 < 0.135 => y < 0.15
           
           Let's adjust the x, y coordinates for each object. We need to consider the half-width and half-length of each object and make sure its center is placed such that the entire object is within `v18`.
           
           For `v8` (dimensions approximately 0.07x0.07):
           Center at `x` should be between `-0.135 + 0.035 = -0.1` and `0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1`.
           Center at `y` should be between `-0.135 + 0.085 = -0.05` and `0.135 - 0.015 = 0.12`.
           Let's try `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.782, 0.0)` for `v8`. AABB would be `(-0.08-0.035, -0.08-0.085)` to `(-0.08+0.035, -0.08-0.015)` which is `(-0.115, -0.165)` to `(-0.045, -0.095)`. The y-min `(-0.165)` is still out of bounds.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the object dimensions and where the "center" for pose is.
           AABB of `v8` is ((-0.035, -0.085), (0.035, -0.015)). This is relative to its own origin.
           So, if `v8` is placed at `(x, y, z, theta)`, its actual extent in the world frame is (x + min_x, y + min_y) to (x + max_x, y + max_y) if `theta = 0`.
           So for `v8` at pose `(px, py, pz, ptheta)`:
           Its lower x-bound is `px - 0.035`, upper x-bound is `px + 0.035`.
           Its lower y-bound is `py - 0.085`, upper y-bound is `py - 0.015`.
           
           For `v8` to be stable on `v18` ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)):
           `-0.135 <= px - 0.035` => `px >= -0.1`
           `px + 0.035 <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.1`
           `-0.135 <= py - 0.085` => `py >= -0.05`
           `py - 0.015 <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.15`
           
           Let's select points for the objects that are well within these bounds:
           For `v8`: Choose `px = -0.1`, `py = -0.05`. So, `(-0.1, -0.05, 0.782, 0.0)`
           Its AABB will be `(-0.1-0.035, -0.05-0.085)` to `(-0.1+0.035, -0.05-0.015)` which is `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.065, -0.065)`. This is just within the lower-left corner of `v18`.
           
           For `v12`: AABB = ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035)).
           `px + 0.015 >= -0.135` => `px >= -0.15`
           `px + 0.085 <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.05`
           `py - 0.035 >= -0.135` => `py >= -0.1`
           `py + 0.035 <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.1`
           
           Let's choose `px = 0.05`, `py = -0.1`. So, `(0.05, -0.1, 0.782, 0.0)` for `v12`.
           Its AABB will be `(0.05+0.015, -0.1-0.035)` to `(0.05+0.085, -0.1+0.035)` which is `(0.065, -0.135)` to `(0.135, -0.065)`. This is just within the lower-right corner of `v18`.
           
           For `v14`: AABB = ((-0.085, -0.035), (-0.015, 0.035)).
           `px - 0.085 >= -0.135` => `px >= -0.05`
           `px - 0.015 <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.15`
           `py - 0.035 >= -0.135` => `py >= -0.1`
           `py + 0.035 <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.1`
           
           Let's choose `px = -0.05`, `py = 0.1`. So, `(-0.05, 0.1, 0.782, 0.0)` for `v14`.
           Its AABB will be `(-0.05-0.085, 0.1-0.035)` to `(-0.05-0.015, 0.1+0.035)` which is `(-0.135, 0.065)` to `(-0.065, 0.135)`. This is just within the upper-left corner of `v18`.
           
           For `v16`: AABB = ((0.175, -0.397), (0.27, -0.302)). This AABB is problematic. The prompt says `stackable(v16, v18)`. If I use this AABB, it won't fit anywhere on `v18`. I'll assume that this AABB is the *local* AABB, and the origin is meant to be at a place that will make it fit. Given the small range of movement and similarity of all objects, it is likely that `v16` has a similar size to the others. I will assume it's like a 0.07x0.07 square and use a similar calculation based on a bounding box of (-0.035, -0.035) to (0.035, 0.035) to allow it to be placed. If this is not the case, the problem is ill-posed as it implies `v16` cannot be placed on `v18`. I will use the general object size to estimate its position.
           Assuming `v16` is centered like the other objects (approx. 0.07x0.07 bounding box):
           `px >= -0.1`, `px <= 0.1`
           `py >= -0.1`, `py <= 0.1`
           
           Let's choose `px = 0.1`, `py = 0.1`. So, `(0.1, 0.1, 0.782, 0.0)` for `v16`.
           Its AABB will be `(0.1-0.035, 0.1-0.035)` to `(0.1+0.035, 0.1+0.035)` which is `(0.065, 0.065)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. This is just within the upper-right corner of `v18`.
           
           These new pose values for `#o2` should be stable and collision-free with respect to each other given their separation.

           Let's re-examine the AABB calculations very carefully.
           Surface `v18`: AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object `v8`: AABB = ((-0.035, -0.085), (0.035, -0.015)). This AABB is relative to the object's local origin.
           If object `v8` is placed at `(px, py, pz, ptheta=0)`, its world AABB will be `(px + min_x, py + min_y)` to `(px + max_x, py + max_y)`.
           
           For `v8` with local AABB (min_x=-0.035, max_x=0.035, min_y=-0.085, max_y=-0.015):
           World min_x: `px - 0.035`
           World max_x: `px + 0.035`
           World min_y: `py - 0.085`
           World max_y: `py - 0.015`
           
           To be stable on `v18` (min_surf_x=-0.135, max_surf_x=0.135, min_surf_y=-0.135, max_surf_y=0.135):
           `min_surf_x <= px - 0.035` => `-0.135 <= px - 0.035` => `px >= -0.1`
           `px + 0.035 <= max_surf_x` => `px + 0.035 <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.1`
           `min_surf_y <= py - 0.085` => `-0.135 <= py - 0.085` => `py >= -0.05`
           `py - 0.015 <= max_surf_y` => `py - 0.015 <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.15`
           
           So for `v8`, valid `px` range is `[-0.1, 0.1]` and valid `py` range is `[-0.05, 0.15]`.
           My previous choice for `v8`: `(-0.1, -0.05, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           World AABB for `v8` at this pose: `(-0.1-0.035, -0.05-0.085)` to `(-0.1+0.035, -0.05-0.015)`
           This means `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.065, -0.065)`.
           This seems perfectly within the bounds of `v18` which is `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           The error message: `AABB(lower=(-0.13500000149011612, -0.08500000074505806), upper=(-0.06500000149011612, -0.015000000745058056))` is not the world AABB. It says `AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.13500000149011612, -0.08500000074505806), upper=(-0.06500000149011612, -0.015000000745058056)))`. This AABB *is not* what I computed based on the local AABB and the pose. It is reporting a *transformed* AABB which is effectively a bounding box around the object's local AABB as if its origin was the center. This is very confusing.
           
           Let me assume the error message provides the actual AABB of the object *in the world frame*, and it says this AABB is *not contained*. This is a direct contradiction to my interpretation of the numbers.
           
           Let's assume the AABB given in the *error message* for `v8` is the true *effective* AABB of the object when placed at `(-0.1, -0.05, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           Error message AABB for `v8`: `(lower=(-0.13500000149011612, -0.08500000074505806), upper=(-0.06500000149011612, -0.015000000745058056))`
           This is `(-0.135, -0.085)` to `(-0.065, -0.015)` (ignoring floating point inaccuracies).
           Surface `v18`: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           Here, the `y_min` for the object is `-0.085`, which is indeed *greater* than `-0.135` (the surface `y_min`). So the lower bound *is* contained.
           The `y_max` for the object is `-0.015`, which is indeed *less* than `0.135` (the surface `y_max`). So the upper bound *is* contained.
           The `x_min` for the object is `-0.135`, which is equal to the surface `x_min`. So the left bound *is* contained.
           The `x_max` for the object is `-0.065`, which is less than `0.135` (the surface `x_max`). So the right bound *is* contained.
           
           Based on this strict comparison, `(-0.135, -0.085)` to `(-0.065, -0.015)` IS contained within `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           This suggests the stability check might be interpreting the bounding boxes differently or I'm missing some crucial detail.
           
           Could it be that the object's *local* AABB is being compared directly against the surface AABB? No, that wouldn't make sense.
           
           Let me try to shift the objects a bit more towards the center, away from the edges, to give more buffer. Maybe the comparison is strict `lower > lower_surf` and `upper < upper_surf`.
           
           Let's use `0.05` as a buffer from the edge `0.135 - 0.05 = 0.085`.
           So the center `px` would be within `[-0.085, 0.085]` and `py` would be within `[-0.085, 0.085]` for objects of negligible size.
           Since the objects have extent, we need to account for their actual dimensions relative to the center of the object.
           
           Let `w_o = (max_x - min_x)` and `h_o = (max_y - min_y)` be the width and height of the object (from its local AABB).
           Let `cx_o = (min_x + max_x) / 2` and `cy_o = (min_y + max_y) / 2` be the center of the local AABB.
           
           For `v8`: `min_x=-0.035, max_x=0.035, min_y=-0.085, max_y=-0.015`.
           `w_v8 = 0.07`, `h_v8 = 0.07`.
           `cx_v8 = 0`, `cy_v8 = -0.05`.
           
           If we place `v8` at `(px, py)` its actual center is `(px+cx_v8, py+cy_v8)`.
           The object extends from `px + min_x` to `px + max_x` and `py + min_y` to `py + max_y`.
           This means we need `px + min_x >= min_surf_x` and `px + max_x <= max_surf_x`, and similarly for y.
           `px + (-0.035) >= -0.135` => `px >= -0.1`
           `px + 0.035 <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.1`
           `py + (-0.085) >= -0.135` => `py >= -0.05`
           `py + (-0.015) <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.15`
           
           Let's try to make the actual placement in the center of the quadrant to give some margin.
           For `v8`: target quadrant lower-left. Let's aim for `px = -0.06`, `py = -0.09`.
           This would mean `px` range `(-0.06-0.035, -0.06+0.035)` = `(-0.095, -0.025)`.
           `py` range `(-0.09-0.085, -0.09-0.015)` = `(-0.175, -0.105)`.
           The `py` here, `(-0.175)` is too low, extending past `-0.135`.
           
           Okay, the most reliable way is to choose the pose `(px, py)` such that `(px + min_x, py + min_y)` is `(min_surf_x, min_surf_y)` and `(px + max_x, py + max_y)` is `(max_surf_x, max_surf_y)`.
           This gives us a range for valid `px` and `py` for each object.
           
           For `v8`:
           `px` range: `[-0.1, 0.1]`
           `py` range: `[-0.05, 0.15]`
           Let's choose `px = -0.08`, `py = -0.02`. This gives some buffer inside the allowed range.
           `v8` at `(-0.08, -0.02, 0.782, 0.0)`
           World AABB: `(-0.08-0.035, -0.02-0.085)` to `(-0.08+0.035, -0.02-0.015)`
           `(-0.115, -0.105)` to `(-0.045, -0.035)`. This should be contained in `v18`.
           
           For `v12`: `min_x=0.015, max_x=0.085, min_y=-0.035, max_y=0.035`.
           `px` range: `[-0.15, 0.05]`
           `py` range: `[-0.1, 0.1]`
           Let's choose `px = 0.02`, `py = -0.08`.
           `v12` at `(0.02, -0.08, 0.782, 0.0)`
           World AABB: `(0.02+0.015, -0.08-0.035)` to `(0.02+0.085, -0.08+0.035)`
           `(0.035, -0.115)` to `(0.105, -0.045)`. This should be contained in `v18`.
           
           For `v14`: `min_x=-0.085, max_x=-0.015, min_y=-0.035, max_y=0.035`.
           `px` range: `[-0.05, 0.15]`
           `py` range: `[-0.1, 0.1]`
           Let's choose `px = -0.02`, `py = 0.08`.
           `v14` at `(-0.02, 0.08, 0.782, 0.0)`
           World AABB: `(-0.02-0.085, 0.08-0.035)` to `(-0.02-0.015, 0.08+0.035)`
           `(-0.105, 0.045)` to `(-0.035, 0.115)`. This should be contained in `v18`.
           
           For `v16`: I'm assuming it has a local AABB `(-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)` as a generic object of small size to ensure it can be placed.
           `px` range: `[-0.1, 0.1]`
           `py` range: `[-0.1, 0.1]`
           Let's choose `px = 0.08`, `py = 0.02`.
           `v16` at `(0.08, 0.02, 0.782, 0.0)`
           World AABB: `(0.08-0.035, 0.02-0.035)` to `(0.08+0.035, 0.02+0.035)`
           `(0.045, -0.015)` to `(0.115, 0.055)`. This should be contained in `v18`.
           
           These new positions provide a buffer of about 0.025 to 0.05 from the edge of the surface for each object. Let's try this.
