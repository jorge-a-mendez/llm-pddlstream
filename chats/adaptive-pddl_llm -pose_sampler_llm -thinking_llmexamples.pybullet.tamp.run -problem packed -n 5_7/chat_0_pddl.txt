           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on a flat surface (Surface 0). This surface is a square bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). The object's dimensions are almost a perfect square: (0.09786275851871082, 0.09786275851871079).  A 'stable placement' means the object is fully *within* the surface boundaries. A placement is defined by the surface index (0 in this case), rotation angle (theta), and the object's center (x, y) coordinates.
           
           **Defining Stability and AABB Considerations**
           
           To be stable, the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must remain *inside* the surface. Rotating the object changes the size of the AABB. So, I need to account for this. The formulas are in place to determine the effective width and height (`W` and `H`) of the rotated AABB, given the object's dimensions and the rotation angle (theta).
           
           **Initial Bounds and Simplifications**
           
           Given that the object is almost square, I can make some simplifying assumptions for efficiency.
           
           *   `w = h = 0.0978627585187108` is a good approximation.
           *   The effective AABB is *always* a square, of side `W = h * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This side has a minimum when the rotation is a multiple of `90 degrees`, and a maximum when it is at `45 or 135`, etc.
           *   Maximum `W` is about  `0.09786275851871082 * sqrt(2)  = 0.13840742514`. This helps to define the maximum constraints on placement.
           
           Given this, I have a good framework to begin building placements.
           
           **Generating Placements: The Grid and Angle Strategy**
           
           To achieve the goal of 50 placements, I'll employ a two-step strategy.
           
           1.  **Varying Theta:** I'll use 10 distinct values for *theta* that produce distinct AABBs: `0`, `pi/20`, `2*pi/20`, ... , `9*pi/20`. These rotations will cover a range from 0 to 90 degrees.
           2.  **Valid Center Space:** For each *theta*, I'll calculate the smallest allowable x and y center ranges,  which will ensure that the object remains within the surface borders. Given the nearly square nature of the object, there will be the smallest allowed placement region where the AABB is rotated by 45 degrees, and the object's maximum dimensions are used to compute valid placement coordinates.
           3.  **Generating Center Points:** I'll select 5 different center points *(x, y)* that follow an even distribution centered on the valid region defined in step 2.
           
           This should give me the diversity required. I'll focus on the area around the origin, and points close to the corners.
           
           **Point Generation**
           
           *   First, the center is always valid for any angle.
           *   Then, compute `cx_min` and `cx_max` and `cy_min` and `cy_max` -- the minimum/maximum bounds for x and y center locations given the bounds. I'll center 4 points just within these bounds.
           
           **Details**
           
           1.  Calculating the *W* and *H* dimensions for each rotation, which determines the area for placement.
           2.  Computing the placement center bounds, to center the object safely, at each rotation.
           3.  Choose 5 placement points near the corners for each angle, and one at the center, creating 50 placements total.
           
           I need to confirm all `x` and `y` centers are within [-0.135, 0.135], which can be derived from the calculations.

(Thoughts: **Generating Non-Colliding Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's get down to business. I need to figure out where to place this new object, Object 4, on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Object 7, which is already sitting pretty at (0, 0, 0). I've got the dimensions of Object 4, about 0.073 units in each direction, and I know the surface bounds. Object 7's AABB is roughly [-0.049, 0.049] in x and y.
           
           The plan is to generate 50 stable placements, but now I have to factor in Object 7's presence. I'll stick to generating potential locations, checking for collisions, and only keeping the safe spots.
           
           For each possible orientation (theta), I'll calculate the valid ranges for Object 4's center, ensuring that it's within Surface 0. Then, I will filter out the placements that overlap with the AABB of Object 7. I'll use a 5x5 grid of sampling points.
           
           I'm essentially building a collision detection system, comparing the bounding boxes and discarding any positions that collide. The trick is to pick x and y coordinates that keep Object 4 far enough away from Object 7. I'll choose points from each valid range and then filter for collisions.
           
           The code will iterate through different orientations, calculate the bounding boxes and coordinates, and then, for each potential location, perform a collision check. I will keep track of valid placements, breaking the loop once I have 50 non-colliding locations.
           
           Let's do this!

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, I've got a task: find 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on Surface 0. This means I need to place the object without any collisions, taking into account the existing obstacles, objects 7 and 4. Surface 0 is a square, from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           I need to strategically consider how to place object 6. First, object 6 is a square. So, I need to iterate through orientations from 0 to pi/2 in some increments, say 10 values. For each of these, I'll calculate object 6's effective bounding box (AABB), specifically calculating its width and height (W, H). Since I know `size_x` and `size_y` values for Object 6, I can calculate `W = size_x * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)` and `H = size_y * (|sin(theta)| + |cos(theta)|)`. From there, I'll calculate the valid space to place the center of object 6. Then I will generate a number of candidates, with a more dense grid. I now have the positions and will check each position and orientation to avoid collisions.
           
           Here are the details for Object 7 (AABB: [-0.0489, 0.0489] x [-0.0489, 0.0489] ) and Object 4 (AABB: [-0.135, -0.0621] x [-0.135, -0.0621] ). Object 6 is given as size_x = size_y = 0.0936.
           
           I'll check for overlaps between the AABB for object 6 (rotated) and the existing AABBs. I'm going to assume that there are no overlapping collisions, by the calculation checks between min and max positions, using the `check_collision` function.
