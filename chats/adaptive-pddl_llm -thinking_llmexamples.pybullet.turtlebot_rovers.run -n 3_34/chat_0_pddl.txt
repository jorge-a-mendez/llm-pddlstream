           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           I'm faced with the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain. After dissecting the axiom, it boils down to ensuring several conditions hold true. Crucially, these include obtaining images of three objectives (`receivedimage`) and analyzing two types of material (stone and soil, `receivedanalysis`).
           
           I've carefully examined the initial state and identified that the initial conditions related to location and free storage are already satisfied. However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not. This means I need to plan actions to fulfill these conditions.
           
           My initial thought was to use rover `v14` to manage the images and the analyses to simplify the plan. The available operators are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`.
           I attempted to formulate a plan involving calibration, taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analyses to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           I noted the available state for both rovers is almost identical, with the only difference being their location, and the fact that one or the other rover *could* carry out the steps required.
           
           However, a critical constraint arises: the list of allowed action instances is extremely restrictive, consisting only of `move` (self-moves, so nothing changes location) and `drop_rock`. Crucially, action instances for taking images (and calibrating, and sending images) and performing analyses are *not* permitted.
           
           This means that *no* action instances that satisfy the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates are allowed.
           Since satisfying these predicates is fundamental to achieving the goal, the goal cannot be achieved. I conclude the `new-axiom@0()` goal is currently impossible to achieve.
