           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal that's already partially satisfied by the initial state: the rovers are at their starting locations and the storage facility is free. However, the remainder of the goal hinges on acquiring and sending images of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) *and* analyzing and transmitting data on a stone and soil sample. The key challenge lies in the tight constraints of the planning problem, particularly the severely restricted list of permissible actions.
           
           **Understanding the Actions and Prerequisites**
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll need to use the `send_image` action. This, in turn, requires `haveimage`, which I can obtain via the `take_image` action. This action then demands I first calibrate the camera with the `calibrate` action. Similarly, to get `receivedanalysis`, I'd need to send the analyses using `send_analysis`, which relies on having analyzed the objects using the `sample_rock` action.  
           
           The problem specifically provides the following actions as allowed instances:
           -  Self-move: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` (Rover 12 at its initial position)
           -  Self-move: `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` (Rover 14 at its initial position)
           -  Drop Rock action on the storage facility: `drop_rock v12 v16`
           -  Drop Rock action on the storage facility: `drop_rock v14 v16`
           
           **The Core Constraint: The Forbidden Actions**
           
           Now, the fatal twist. I'm explicitly told "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This list *does not* include `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_analysis`, or `sample_rock`.  These actions, vital to achieving the goal, are therefore effectively *prohibited*.
           
           **Analysis of Reachability**
           
           Consider the images. Both rovers have `conf` in the initial state. The question is can `imagevisible` even be made possible since it has to be `atconf(v, #o3)` and all move actions are no-ops?
           
           Given the available and limited move options, my rovers are locked in place at their respective initial positions, v12 at v13 and v14 at v15.  Therefore, they can never reach other image configurations if those image configurations are not also their initial position (v13 or v15).
           
           To complete the plan, I would require moving to various image configurations. Since such moves are disallowed, I cannot achieve the needed `receivedimage` predicates. The problem's constraints render the remaining goal elements, including the sample analysis and transmission, equally inaccessible.
           
           **Final Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           In summary, the specific constraints on available actions renders the intended goal expression `new-axiom@0()` inherently unreachable. There's no possible sequence of valid steps that leads to fulfilling both the image acquisition and sample analysis/transmission sub-goals, given the restricted action set. The provided plan is not possible.
