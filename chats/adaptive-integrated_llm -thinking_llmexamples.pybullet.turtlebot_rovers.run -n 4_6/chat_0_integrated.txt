           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: A Deadlock**
           
           My task is to achieve a goal that seems straightforward on the surface, but a closer examination of the axioms and initial state reveals a fundamental constraint that prevents any progress. My objective is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've broken down into a series of predicates that need to be true. Initially, some conditions are already met, but the core challenge lies in satisfying the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve this, I need to take images and analyses, then send them to the lander. The problem is, while the initial state provides the necessary predicates regarding the capabilities and locations of the rovers, it doesn't provide a way to move the rovers to the locations needed to meet the preconditions for the actions.
           
           **The Crucial Bottleneck: Rover Movement and Configuration**
           
           The primary issue revolves around the `atconf` predicate, which signifies that a rover is "at" a particular configuration. The actions required to take and send images or perform analyses all have `atconf(?v, ?q)` as a precondition. Yet, the available action instances only include self-directed "move" actions where a rover starts at a base configuration and remains in that same base configuration. The continuous parameters associated with `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates present a dilemma. If these `#` parameters represent a physical location, the available `move` actions prevent rovers from reaching those required configurations.
           
           **The Inflexible Rule Set**
           
           A core issue is that I can only use actions defined in the initial state and can't make assumptions that aren't specifically mentioned. It prevents me from interpreting the goal conditions flexibly or using alternative routes. The "any fact not explicitly stated is false" rule reinforces this rigid constraint.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Interpretations & Implications**
           
           The prompt instructions around continuous parameters are the key to the core problem. The initial state defines parameters starting with `#`. For example, `#o0` and `#o3` are used within the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates. I could try to provide continuous values for them to try and move closer to the goal.
           
           Even if I assumed I could use `#o0, #o3`, etc., as if the rover was *at* the stated coordinates, the problem still exists. This assumption is a generous interpretation, but is ultimately insufficient.
           
           **The Unsolvable Nature of the Goal**
           
           The fundamental problem is the *lack of the necessary movement* actions and the distance constraints of the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, which prevent me from satisfying the preconditions for taking the necessary actions. Given the initial state and list of actions, the goal is simply unattainable.
           
           In conclusion, I have found that, given the strict action and initial state, I can't fulfill the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This is because all actions have a base `atconf` state, while the problem is structured such that `atconf` conditions cannot be achieved via the actions provided.
