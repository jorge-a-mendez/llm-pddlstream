           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal: to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Since I'm working with a domain that uses axioms for the `on` predicate, I understand this requires me to ensure each object is both *at* a specific pose and *supported* at that pose by `v16`. Given the known facts and the *stackable* predicates, `#o2` appears to be a viable pose for placing these objects on `v16`.
           
           My strategy will be straightforward: I must pick up each object from its current location, move it, and then place it onto `v16` at pose `#o2`. I'll employ the available actions: `pick` and `place`.
           
           However, the robot's base configuration is currently `v3`, while the available action instances for picking and placing require a different base configuration, `#o3`. Hence, I have to add an additional step: `move_base`.
           
           My plan is as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick:** Then I'll pick up object `v8` from its current location, `v9`, using arm `v4`.
           3.  **Place:** Following that, I'll place `v8` at pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           4.  **Repeat:**  I will then repeat steps 2 and 3 for the remaining objects, picking up `v12` from `v13` and `v14` from `v15`, and placing them also at pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           To determine if actions are applicable, I'll check their preconditions. The most important preconditions are `kin` relations and the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`).  Because all the available `kin` facts and actions involve `#o3` for the base configuration, ensuring the robot is at `#o3` first is crucial. I'll need to make some assumptions about the initial state, such as assuming `unsafeapproach`, `unsafeatraj`, and `unsafepose` preconditions are initially false.
           
           This plan addresses all subgoals and will achieve the overall goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
