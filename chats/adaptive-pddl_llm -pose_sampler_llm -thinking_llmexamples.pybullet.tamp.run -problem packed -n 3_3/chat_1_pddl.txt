(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's dissect this. My primary objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16` in specific poses. This translates to making `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` true. Each of these requires the respective object to be supported by `v16` and situated at the correct pose.
           
           *   **v8:** Currently, `v8` is supported by `v11` at pose `v9`. I'll need to move it to `#o2` on `v16`.
           *   **v12:** Currently, `v12` is also on `v11` at pose `v13`. The same applies, get to pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           *   **v14:** This one's supported by `v11` at pose `v15`. Needs to be moved to `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           **Action Strategy: Pick and Place**
           
           The strategy, as I see it, is simple pick and place operations. I need to:
           
           1.  Pick each object from its current pose on `v11`.
           2.  Place them on `v16` at pose `#o2`.
           
           **Critical Predicate: Robot Base Configuration**
           
           Now, the issue. The critical predicate, `atbconf(?q)`, is a bottleneck. All the relevant `kin` facts, which define my robot arm's actions, use a base configuration of `#o3`. However, the robot base is *initially* at configuration `v3`.
           
           **Investigating Base Movement**
           
           There's one base motion action available: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does absolutely nothing, keeps the base at `v3`. It looks like it should have had `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. I do not have a way to move to the needed base configuration.
           
           **Precondition Failure: The Unmovable Base**
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions both require `atbconf(?q)`. Because `pick` and `place` actions all specify a base configuration of `#o3` and I cannot move the robot base from `v3` to `#o3`, the preconditions for those actions *cannot* be met.
           
           **Conclusion: The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Therefore, I conclude the goal `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` is unachievable due to the lack of an available base motion to get the robot to the appropriate base configuration. I can't pick up or place any objects.
