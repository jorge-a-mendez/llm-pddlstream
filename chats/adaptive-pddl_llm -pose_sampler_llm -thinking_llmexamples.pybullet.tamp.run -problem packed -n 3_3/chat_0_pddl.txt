(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. I've got a square object, ID 4, with dimensions roughly 0.0975 x 0.0975 units. The goal is to find 50 stable placements for it on a square surface defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Stability means the object is fully *within* the surface's boundaries.
           
           First, I need to figure out the acceptable center positions (x, y) for the object at any given rotation (theta). The surface has a total width and height of 0.27, with the center at (0, 0). The object is nearly square so the effective dimensions don't change very much with rotations. I can't place the center within 0.04875 of the edges, because of size constraints.  I'll start by checking the corners to ensure I capture the placement region.  I'll try a few rotations like 0, pi/4, pi/2, etc., and pick 50 good placements from there.
           
           Now, for each rotation, I have to ensure the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) stays within the surface's AABB.  I'm using the effective width and height that depends on the theta. Since the object is quite small relative to the surface and is very close to a square, the exact rotation doesn't change the bounding box much, but I'll still account for it. I will use the minimum and maximum ranges of valid x and y coordinates that account for these rotations.
           
           To efficiently get 50 different placements, I'll go with a systematic approach.  I'll test several key rotations to ensure even coverage across rotation values. Then, for each rotation, I have to determine where it fits, from edge to corner, and pick coordinates, x, y. I need a minimum distance between placements so they don't overlap, but for a 0.27 x 0.27 bounding box, 50 points seems manageable without checking distances between points.
           
           Now, I'll calculate the bounds.  For a given rotation, I'll find the valid x-range and y-range. Then, I'll strategically sample positions within these ranges to ensure good coverage.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan:**
           
           I've been given information about a previous successful placement of object ID 4.  That means I have the dimensions, precise location and orientation, which I need to consider an obstacle.  My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object, ID 5, on the same surface, while avoiding any collisions with object ID 4.
           
           **The Surface:**  It's a simple rectangular area defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           **Object ID 4:** This obstacle is placed at (-0.086, -0.086) with dimensions 0.097 by 0.097.  It's not rotated (theta = 0).
           
           **Object ID 5:** This is the new square object, with dimensions 0.086 x 0.086.
           
           **My Approach:**
           1.  **Calculate the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object ID 4:** Since it's not rotated, this is straightforward. The AABB tells me the precise region Object 4 occupies.
           2.  **Determine Valid Regions for Object ID 5:** I'll calculate the boundaries of the valid area on the surface where I can place Object 5 without overlap with Object 4.  I will take a systematic approach to check and ensure there's no collision with object 4 by calculating AABB coordinates.
           3.  **Generate Placement Candidates:** I will focus on a 5x5 grid arrangement for x and y coordinates on each valid region to make the placements evenly distributed. I'll test it out with 3 angles: 0, pi/4 and pi/2. These 3 angles should produce a wide variety of placements.
           4.  **Collision Checks:** For each candidate placement of object ID 5, I will check if its AABB overlaps with Object 4's AABB by calculating the effective bounding box dimensions given rotation theta. I also consider cases where the center is placed to the right or above Object 4, which ensures non-overlapping placements.
           5.  **Placement Selection:** I'll filter out any placements that result in collision with the obstacle and will choose 50 valid placements for object ID 5, prioritizing a range of angles from the 3 angles tested.
           
           I will iterate with these methods and ensure that all 50 placements are distinct and stable.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Optimization - My Thinking**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with the existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5). I have a detailed description of the surface and the current positions, sizes, and orientations of ID 4 and ID 5.
           
           First, I need a reliable way to check for collisions. I'll use the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for each object. The `collide()` function will quickly determine if two AABBs overlap. The AABB approach is very efficient for collision checks.
           
           Next, I need to define a systematic strategy for placing ID 6 and finding stable placements. I will test several rotation angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, and pi. For each angle, I will first calculate the effective width and height of ID 6 to account for the rotation. This will be an important parameter to calculate the proper candidate x, y combinations to be tested.
           
           Once I have the dimensions, I determine the valid ranges for the center point (x_c, y_c) of ID 6, ensuring it stays within the bounds of the surface. To sample these ranges, I will create a set of points (x_coords and y_coords) within the safe area. I'll construct a grid of sampling points. Then I'll check each point's placement.
           
           Finally, I will iterate through all possible (x_c, y_c) combinations. For each one, I will calculate the AABB of ID 6 and check for collisions with the AABBs of ID 4 and ID 5 using the `collide()` function. If no collisions are detected, I'll record that as a stable placement, adding the corresponding rotation and coordinates.
           
           The total search space is five rotation angles, and a grid of sampling points. So I can systematically create 50 stable placements, that way.
