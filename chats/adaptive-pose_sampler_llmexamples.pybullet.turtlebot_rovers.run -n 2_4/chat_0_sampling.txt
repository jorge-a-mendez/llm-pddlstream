User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. The target point is (0.00, -0.00). The max_range is 4. I will try to find diverse positions around the target point, avoiding the central wall at x=0 and the other smaller obstacles. The room's outer walls are at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. I will prioritize positions within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. Since the target is at (0,0), and there's a wall at x=0, I must choose positions to the left or right of this wall, i.e., x < 0 or x > 0.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now (-1.9, -2.0). My previous attempt to place the robot at (0.5, 0.5) and (0.5, -0.5) failed because they were "not reachable." This means they were too far from the target point given the max_range of 4. Also, (-0.5, 0.5) collided with obstacle 15. The central wall at x=0 is still there, and the obstacles within the room need to be considered. The previous target point was (0,0), so I need to adjust my strategy for the new target. Since the target is in the bottom-left quadrant, I should explore positions around that area.
           
           Based on the failures:
           - (0.5, 0.5) is too far from (-1.9, -2.0).
           - (-0.5, 0.5) collides with obstacle 15: ((-0.59, 0.59), (-0.45, 0.73)). This means any point in this bounding box is invalid.
           - (0.5, -0.5) is too far from (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           Since the target is at (-1.9, -2.0), I will try to place the robot closer to it. I will also avoid the central x=0 wall for direct line of sight from the right side of the room to the target in the left side. I should explore the area around (-1.9, -2.0) within a 4 unit radius. I will also keep in mind the room limits of [-2.5, 2.5] for x and y.
