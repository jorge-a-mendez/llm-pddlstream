User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.549, -0.385, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.62, 0.785).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.592, -0.427), (-4.507, -0.342)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal here is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having a "green" object, defined as a specific type `v17`, be `on(v18)`.  We've got some facts at our disposal: we know the objects' `type` and their current poses, and that the `green` object could be either `v8` or `v12`. I'm going with `v12` as the `green` object.
           
           To get `v12 on v18`, we need to find a way to make it true. The `on` predicate tells us we need `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. We already have  `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, so we need to set  `?p` as `#o2` for an achievable goal. Then we need to satisfy `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`.  My plan is to *pick* `v12` from `v13` and then *place* it at pose `#o2` on `v18`.  This involves two actions:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Using the robot arm `v4`, pick up `v12` from its current pose `v13`. This requires the arm to have a grasp on the object, and we have a grasp given: `#o1`.
           2.  **Place:** Then, place `v12` at the target pose `#o2`.
           
           For the `pick` to work, the following preconditions must hold:
           *   The arm can reach the object
           *   The object must be at pose `p`
           *   The arm must be empty
           *   The base must be at a certain configuration
           
           We have some `kin` (kinematics) assertions that must hold for these actions.
           It turns out that based on how things are set up, the base configuration has to remain unchanged (i.e. we use base at `v3`). Otherwise `kin` cannot hold, based on what we're given.
           
           Similarly, we check for `place`:
           * The arm can reach the object at the new pose
           * The arm has a grasp on the object (achieved in the pick action)
           * The base must be at a certain configuration (unchanged)
           
           I need to make sure to avoid collisions. I am assuming those conditions hold since they are not stated.
           
           I then evaluate continuous parameters, specifically, `#o2`, a pose for v12,  which needs a specific x, y, z and orientation.
           The robot base does not move, so it is just a no-op action.
           
           The plan is therefore:
           
           1.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4`
           2.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4`
           
           To execute this, I need values for the continuous parameters:
           
           *   **#o1**: The grasp. I will rely on the `kin` assertions that already know how to grasp the object in this context.
           *   **#o2**: The target pose. From the initial state and information given, I can place the object to the middle of surface `v18`: `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           This plan fulfills all requirements. I did a detailed analysis, double checking that I had all the relevant facts, and all collision constraints are assumed to hold, the grasp is valid, the arm positions are reachable and that all action preconditions are satisfied, ensuring that `new-axiom@0()` is met.
           
           Therefore I am satisfied with this plan, and will move forward with my next task.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the critical flaw in my previous thinking. I completely missed the crucial constraint: the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits what I can do.  My initial approach assumed the availability of `pick` and `place` actions, which are *explicitly* disallowed.
           
           Looking at the goal, `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which unpacks to `Atom on(?green, v18) ∧ Atom type(?green, v17)`, I can see the core issue. I need to get either `v12` or `v8` (both of which are of type `v17`) onto the surface `v18`.  However, achieving `on(?o, ?r)` requires an `atpose` predicate change, and this *necessitates* `pick` and `place` actions, or at least a similar action that alters the object's position with respect to a surface.
           
           With only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I can't change any object's position at all. This action is a no-op as it just moves the robot base from a location to the same location. It has no effect on the `atpose` predicates, which are the key to achieving the goal.
           
           Even if I focus on the facts provided, with `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` true, I still need `atpose(v12, #o2)` or `atpose(v8, #o2)`. Since these objects are *currently* at `v13` and `v9`, respectively, I need to get them to the right pose to achieve the `on` predicate. I cannot pick up and place an object.
           
           In summary, the permitted action, `move_base`, is insufficient to achieve the goal because it cannot manipulate the positions of the objects or the robot's grasp. The `pick` and `place` actions that I need simply are not available. Therefore, the goal `on(?green, v18)` is fundamentally unachievable within the given constraints. I need to explain the unreachability due to the action restriction.
