           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.549, -0.385, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.62, 0.785).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.592, -0.427), (-4.507, -0.342)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning on Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with creating a plan to satisfy the goal of `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be placed `on` object `v18`. After examining the initial state, I see I can potentially use `v8` or `v12` as objects of the correct type. They are currently *not* on `v18`, so I must move one of them there. The problem boils down to using `pick` and `place` actions. However, I am presented with a severe constraint: I am only allowed to use the specific action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           My initial thought is to pick the object, let's say `v12`, currently supported by surface `v14` at pose `v13`, with arm `v4`, and place it on surface `v18`. I understand I need to provide a new pose (`#o2`) for `v12` on `v18`. I know `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are in the initial state, so I *must* provide a valid `pose` value for the robot to execute. Furthermore, I already know a valid grasp exists (grasp(v12, #o1)) in the state.
           
           I start outlining the following plan:
           1. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o_atraj_pick)` - where `#o1` is the correct grasp and `#o_atraj_pick` is an arm trajectory.
           2. `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o_atraj_place)` - where `#o2` will be determined by placing `v12` on `v18` and `#o_atraj_place` is also a calculated arm trajectory.
           
           However, here's where the problem really strikes: the prompt is *very* strict. I am told that only the provided action instances are valid. This severely limits me. As only the move base `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is in the specified list, my initial plan seems impossible to execute. No `pick` or `place` instances are in the list. This constraint renders any plan *impossible* to make since no `pick` or `place` can be computed if such action instances do not exist to compute. The "move" instance only indicates the robot base isn't allowed to move. The goal is unreachable.
