           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()`: Placing `v8` on `v18`**
           
           Okay, the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having a `type` object, like `v8`, `on` a surface, like `v18`. After reviewing the axioms and the initial state, it's clear that placing either `v8` or `v12` on `v18` will do the trick. Since `v8` seems closer to the robot's base configuration, I'll go with that. Both are stackable, and picking `v8` seems more feasible.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v8` is currently at location `v9`. I see that `v18` has valid dimensions, I confirm that. The key here is figuring out the continuous pose for `v8` when on top of `v18`. I need to ensure it's stable and collision-free. After analyzing the AABB for both `v8` and `v18`, and considering the table-like nature of the surface, I've determined that `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for the pose `#o2` is ideal. This places `v8` centered on `v18` and at a reasonable height.
           
           Now, let's plan the steps. First, I need to get the robot base to a suitable configuration for grasping and placing. That means a `move_base` action from the initial base position `v3` to a base configuration `#o3` near `v8`. Then, I'll use the robot's arm `v4` to `pick` `v8` from `v9` and *then* use `place` `v8` to `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           I've carefully checked all preconditions for each action, including ensuring the base configuration is correct with the `move_base` step and that any potential collision concerns are addressed (implicitly through the safe assumption about the trajectories). It's crucial for the preconditions `unsafeapproach`, `unsafepose` and `unsafeatraj` to be absent for the actions to work.
           
           Therefore, the final plan is straightforward:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           This achieves the goal (`on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`) while also providing the correct continuous values for the poses.
