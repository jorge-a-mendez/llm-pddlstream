           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Axiom Achievement**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to tackle this. My ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, but that breaks down into smaller, manageable tasks.
           
           First, I need to get images of three objects (v17, v18, v19) using camera mode v11. I plan to use rover v14 for this.  It is the most efficient to have v14 do all the imaging and v12 do analysis. It's currently at v15, and I'll need to move it to a specific spot I'm calling "#o3," to be visible for the camera to take those pictures. Then, it will move to "#o0" to send the images to lander v9. Then return to v15.
           
           Secondly, I've got to analyze a rock and some soil, and send those analyses. I'll use v12 for this.  V12 needs to move from v13 to #o5 where rocks are located. It will pick up a stone, analyze it, drop it, then do the same for some soil. It must send the analyzed information through #o0, then go back to v13.
           
           Now, there are some tricky constraints.  The starting and ending positions of the rovers are important. They need to be back where they started at the end of the plan. And I can only communicate with the lander from #o0.  So, I need to make sure v12 is at the correct place to pick up both types of objects, and that v14 is positioned for the camera work and communications.
           
           To get all of this working, I have to consider the initial states of these rovers. I need to make sure the configurations, and the line-of-sight are considered in my plan.
           
           **Key Challenges:**
           
           1.  **Motion Planning:**  I need to move the rovers efficiently to the correct positions (#o3, #o0, #o5) without collisions. I must consider the cost of each movement.
           2.  **Calibration:** The camera needs to be calibrated at the configuration where the picture is taken. The robot cannot take multiple photos until it has been recalibrated.
           3.  **Coordination:** Making sure I do the imaging and analysis in a logical order, taking into account the limitations of the rovers and the locations of the objects.
           4.  **Final states:** It's critical that the rovers are back in their initial positions.
           5. **Continuous Coordinates:** The most confusing part is that I need to provide values for the parameters that represent the locations of the rovers. I have to make sure there's enough room for both rovers to reach the configuration, and that the position is visible to both of the required objects.
           6. **"Above" constraint**: I need to take the fact that the rocks and soil are so spatially spread out. I have to find a reasonable location that satisfies the "above" constraint. This will be the position labeled #o5.
           
           **Plan Summary:**
           
           1.  **v14 (Imaging):**
               *   Move v14 from v15 to #o3.
               *   Calibrate the camera.
               *   Take images of v17, v18, v19.
               *   Move from #o3 to #o0 to send images.
               *   Move from #o0 back to v15.
           2.  **v12 (Analysis):**
               *   Move v12 from v13 to #o5.
               *   Take a rock, analyze it, and release it.
               *   Take soil, analyze it, and drop it.
               *   Move from #o5 to #o0 to send analyses.
               *   Move from #o0 back to v13.
           
           **Coordinates:**
           
           I'll provide the coordinates for the configurations:
           *   `#o0`: (-1.5, -2.0)  (For v14 to lander)
           *   `#o3`: (-0.7, 1.0) (For v14 to picture objectives)
           *   `#o5`: (-0.3, 0.0) (For v12 to sample rocks)
           
)

It's currently at v15, and I'll need to move it to a specific spot I'm calling "#o3," to be visible for the camera to take those pictures. Then, it will move to "#o0" to send the images to lander v9. Then return to v15.
           
           Secondly, I've got to analyze a rock and some soil, and send those analyses. I'll use v12 for this.  V12 needs to move from v13 to #o5 where rocks are located. It will pick up a stone, analyze it, drop it, then do the same for some soil. It must send the analyzed information through #o0, then go back to v13.
           
           Now, there are some tricky constraints.  The starting and ending positions of the rovers are important. They need to be back where they started at the end of the plan. And I can only communicate with the lander from #o0.  So, I need to make sure v12 is at the correct place to pick up both types of objects, and that v14 is positioned for the camera work and communications.
           
           To get all of this working, I have to consider the initial states of these rovers. I need to make sure the configurations, and the line-of-sight are considered in my plan.
           
           **Key Challenges:**
           
           1.  **Motion Planning:**  I need to move the rovers efficiently to the correct positions (#o3, #o0, #o5) without collisions. I must consider the cost of each movement.
           2.  **Calibration:** The camera needs to be calibrated at the configuration where the picture is taken. The robot cannot take multiple photos until it has been recalibrated.
           3.  **Coordination:** Making sure I do the imaging and analysis in a logical order, taking into account the limitations of the rovers and the locations of the objects.
           4.  **Final states:** It's critical that the rovers are back in their initial positions.
           5. **Continuous Coordinates:** The most confusing part is that I need to provide values for the parameters that represent the locations of the rovers. I have to make sure there's enough room for both rovers to reach the configuration, and that the position is visible to both of the required objects.
           6. **"Above" constraint**: I need to take the fact that the rocks and soil are so spatially spread out. I have to find a reasonable location that satisfies the "above" constraint. This will be the position labeled #o5.
           
           **Plan Summary:**
           
           1.  **v14 (Imaging):**
               *   Move v14 from v15 to #o3.
               *   Calibrate the camera.
               *   Take images of v17, v18, v19.
               *   Move from #o3 to #o0 to send images.
               *   Move from #o0 back to v15.
           2.  **v12 (Analysis):**
               *   Move v12 from v13 to #o5.
               *   Take a rock, analyze it, and release it.
               *   Take soil, analyze it, and drop it.
               *   Move from #o5 to #o0 to send analyses.
               *   Move from #o0 back to v13.
           
           **Coordinates:**
           
           I'll provide the coordinates for the configurations:
           *   `#o0`: (-1.5, -2.0)  (For v14 to lander)
           *   `#o3`: (-0.7, 1.0) (For v14 to picture objectives)
           *   `#o5`: (-0.3, 0.0) (For v12 to sample rocks)

(Thoughts: **Refined Plan for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so the initial feedback identified two problems: collisions with the lander and unreachable imaging configurations.  I need to re-evaluate the configurations for communication (`#o0`), imaging (`#o3`), and sampling (`#o5`).
           
           First, I looked at the Rover `v14` ([-1.187, -1.929], [-0.821, -1.571]) and Lander `v9` ([-2.405, -2.346], [-1.395, -1.654]). I considered the communication range of 4 for `v9`. The initial configuration was within the lander's AABB; I need to move it outside, but within range. I decided on `(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o0`, a small move from the starting point, and that seems safe because it will be out of range of any collision with `v9`.
           
           For the imaging, I need to look at three objective locations (`v17`, `v18`, and `v19`) where each has ranges. It looks like the original point `(-0.7, 1.0)` from the first analysis wouldn't be reachable. The analysis must be at the current position, the planner must follow that constraint. It looks like using the *same* `#o3` for all targets may not be feasible. Because the distances between the targets and the rovers are too great.
           
           The problem specifically says to use distinct positions if there are different rover/target pairs in the `imagevisible` predicates. That interpretation is critical. So, I will define different configs for each `imagevisible` pairing (v14, v17), (v14, v18) and (v14, v19).
           
           Since it is hard to reach all three targets with a *single* config, I will use `#o3` `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
           
           My revised plan is now:
           -   `v14` (imaging) moves to `#o3` `(-1.0, 1.0)` and images the targets, sending the images to the lander (`(-1.0, -1.0)` for `#o0`).
           -   `v12` (sampling/analysis) moves to `#o5` to sample and analyze rocks and then sends analysis to the lander.  I don't need to specify the value for `#o5`. It can stay where it is, because the problem instructions specifically state I only need to specify values for `#` variables used in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates, which does not include the `above` predicate, where I intend to use `#o5`.
           
           After a collision check, this revised strategy should meet all mission objectives, using separate configs for the different image targets and providing coordinates for the communication and the imaging.

(Thoughts: **Refined Configurations and Pathing Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous coordinates for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) were still causing problems. Time to address those! The main issue seems to be a collision with a new obstacle, `v20`.  Let's walk through my reasoning.
           
           **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):**
           
           The target for this comms is `v9` (the lander), and the communication range is 4 units. My previous coordinate `(-1.0, -1.0)` was getting in the way of `v20`.  I need to move it further out and avoid any collisions. I've placed `#o0` at `(-0.5, -0.5)`. The distance to the center of `v9` should be just around 2.05, well within range. Now, `(-0.5, -0.5)` is outside of *all* the known AABBs of the other obstacles, including this new `v20`. Seems good so far.
           
           Now I have to check the rover's path (starting at `v15` at coordinates `(-1.0, -1.75)`) to see if it collides. This path is from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, -0.5)`. There's an obstacle `v20` there; it's centered at around `-1.04` , `-0.82`. This looks problematic.
           
           I re-evaluated the entire path for the rover and for `(-0.5, -0.5)`. `v20` has an x-range of `[-1.1088, -0.9742]` and a y-range `[-0.8868, -0.7522]`. The rover at `(-0.5, -0.5)` is an AABB with dimensions of  `[x: -0.683, -0.317]`, `[y: -0.683, -0.317]`, and the current position of the rover in space at  `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Therefore, I'll go with `(0.0, -1.5)` for `#o0`, and I need to *explicitly* avoid `v20` on the path. This point is also within the communication range and is collision-free.
           
           **Imaging Configuration (`#o3`):**
           
           My initial attempts at `(-1.0, 1.0)` and then `(-0.5, 1.5)`  were rejected as unreachable.  The main goal here is to image the objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` with a range of 2. After doing the math, it seems like `(-0.5, 1.5)` is good for seeing the given targets. I re-evaluated, and I will use `(0.0, 1.5)`.
           
           I'll check all the distances, and I'll confirm that no x values overlap (especially with this new `v20`)
           The x range is from `-1.0 to -0.5`, with an additional boundary condition of -0.183 and 0.183, which puts the range as `[-1.183, 0.183]`. The y range is `[-1.933, 1.683]`.  `v20` is centered in the range, and by definition, has an x-range `[-1.1088, -0.9742]`. Therefore, a straight line would not work.
           
           I've decided to stick with the planner's ability to create a path for me given the start `(-1.0, -1.75)` and end point `(0.0, 1.5)`, as a straight line seems to cause collision.
           
           **Revised Strategy for #o3**
           
           I've chosen the target point of `(0.0, 1.5)` to be `#o3`. It avoids all collisions.
           
           My final thought is that the *specific* path from the starting position to these points is handled by a separate path planning algorithm. I simply need to ensure that the *final* configurations are valid.
           
           **Rock Selection & Plan Verification**
           
           I'm sticking with `v4` (stone) and `v5` (soil). The plan's overall structure remains solid.  I've double-checked that my chosen

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a bit of a puzzle.  I need to configure two rovers, *v14* and *v12*, for communication and imaging tasks. The catch? I need to avoid a pesky vertical bar obstacle, *v21*, which is smack dab in the middle of things (at *x* = 0). My initial plan, where I used separate configurations for each rover (e.g., `#o0_v14`, `#o0_v12`) and separate communication spots, didn't quite gel with the existing action definitions in the problem. The planner seemed to want a single `#o0` for all communication.
           
           I'm an expert, so I've recognized this as a tricky instance of continuous value generation. The instruction "If the plan requires..." specifically targets scenarios where multiple (rover, target object) combinations exist for the same predicates. This appears to be a *special instance* where I am *forced* to work with single values for each parameter.
           
           I must use one value to satisfy communication needs for *v14* and *v12*, while still avoiding collisions. This is where the challenge lies.
           
           **Refining the Communication Configuration (#o0)**
           
           My first thought was to just place `#o0` at `(-0.5, -1.5)`, but that was instantly problematic, as it put v12 through the object v21. I considered that a valid plan would have to include trajectories *around* v21, but now I must make a single, fixed `#o0`.  I tried `x=0.7` to solve the collision issue, but this *also* put the position in the path of the reachability requirements.
           
           Given the constraints, finding a single, collision-free `#o0` that's reachable for both rovers is proving impossible. I *must* avoid the obstacle and ensure each robot can still reach the object. My only choice is to ensure the plan does not require the use of these points simultaneously.
           
           I am now moving the objects and positions as though these were *continuous* values, not points.
           
           **Updating Imaging Configuration (#o3)**
           
           Now for the imaging configuration, `#o3`.  This only affects rover *v14*. I'll put it at `(-0.5, 1.5)`. This ensures *v14* won't collide with *v21*, and it is within range of the imaging targets (*v17*, *v18*, and *v19*).
           
           **Final Configurations**
           
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):**  I'll place this at `(0.5, -1.5)`. The positive *x* allows `v12` to reach it directly, and the planner must now include a trajectory to allow `v14` to go around the obstacle.
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):**  I've decided on `(-0.7, 1.5)`. This is ideal for *v14* to capture images, and stays outside of *v21* and *v20*.
           
           **Ensuring Reachability and Collision-Free Paths**
           
           The planner will handle trajectory generation for reaching these positions. This means the planner will compute the *correct* path for each rover.
           
           This plan should allow the rovers to complete their tasks while adhering to all the defined constraints and objective requirements.
           
           **Final Solution**
           
           The *plan* for this setup *must* use these assumptions to work:
           *   The planner will be able to handle trajectories from each rover to target.
           *   Reachability will be handled with trajectory generation.

I need to avoid a pesky vertical bar obstacle, *v21*, which is smack dab in the middle of things (at *x* = 0). My initial plan, where I used separate configurations for each rover (e.g., `#o0_v14`, `#o0_v12`) and separate communication spots, didn't quite gel with the existing action definitions in the problem. The planner seemed to want a single `#o0` for all communication.
           
           I'm an expert, so I've recognized this as a tricky instance of continuous value generation. The instruction "If the plan requires..." specifically targets scenarios where multiple (rover, target object) combinations exist for the same predicates. This appears to be a *special instance* where I am *forced* to work with single values for each parameter.
           
           I must use one value to satisfy communication needs for *v14* and *v12*, while still avoiding collisions. This is where the challenge lies.
           
           **Refining the Communication Configuration (#o0)**
           
           My first thought was to just place `#o0` at `(-0.5, -1.5)`, but that was instantly problematic, as it put v12 through the object v21. I considered that a valid plan would have to include trajectories *around* v21, but now I must make a single, fixed `#o0`.  I tried `x=0.7` to solve the collision issue, but this *also* put the position in the path of the reachability requirements.
           
           Given the constraints, finding a single, collision-free `#o0` that's reachable for both rovers is proving impossible. I *must* avoid the obstacle and ensure each robot can still reach the object. My only choice is to ensure the plan does not require the use of these points simultaneously.
           
           I am now moving the objects and positions as though these were *continuous* values, not points.
           
           **Updating Imaging Configuration (#o3)**
           
           Now for the imaging configuration, `#o3`.  This only affects rover *v14*. I'll put it at `(-0.5, 1.5)`. This ensures *v14* won't collide with *v21*, and it is within range of the imaging targets (*v17*, *v18*, and *v19*).
           
           **Final Configurations**
           
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):**  I'll place this at `(0.5, -1.5)`. The positive *x* allows `v12` to reach it directly, and the planner must now include a trajectory to allow `v14` to go around the obstacle.
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):**  I've decided on `(-0.7, 1.5)`. This is ideal for *v14* to capture images, and stays outside of *v21* and *v20*.
           
           **Ensuring Reachability and Collision-Free Paths**
           
           The planner will handle trajectory generation for reaching these positions. This means the planner will compute the *correct* path for each rover.
           
           This plan should allow the rovers to complete their tasks while adhering to all the defined constraints and objective requirements.
           
           **Final Solution**
           
           The *plan* for this setup *must* use these assumptions to work:
           *   The planner will be able to handle trajectories from each rover to target.
           *   Reachability will be handled with trajectory generation.
           

User:      Configuration #o0 = (0.5 -1.5) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.7 1.5) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking of tackling this "new-axiom@0()" goal.  My main objective is to satisfy the given conditions, focusing on the tricky part – the rovers' interactions with the environment.  My approach hinges on a few key assumptions about the geometry and the constraints within the planning domain.
           
           First, I have two rovers, "v12" and "v14," each with a specific starting point.  I also have a lander "v9," along with three objectives (images to be taken) and several rocks (for both imaging and sending analyses). It's important to know I'm dealing with two rock types (v2, v6), and each of these I need to analyze.
           
           I've determined that "v14" will handle all sampling, imaging, and communication with the lander.  This is necessary due to the spatial arrangement of the problem.  The initial configuration and the "not reachable" errors I'm getting strongly suggest that "v21" – a vertical obstacle at x=0 – forms an impassable barrier for the rovers' *movement*. I can also only send from one side to the other.
           
           To avoid these problems and respect the rule that I can't assume any preconditions are true unless explicit, I'm making the following interpretations:
           
           *   "v14" will stay on the *left* side of v21.
           *   "v12" will stay on the *right* side of v21.
           *   "v14" must move to the various positions without touching the obstacle.
           *   "v21" does *not* block the light.
           
           Based on this plan, my "v14" plan will have these steps:
           1.  **Move to sample configuration (#o5):** It seems my analysis of the errors showed that I needed a target that did not intersect the obstacle.
           2.  **Sample rocks (v4 and v5):**
           3.  **Move to the image configuration (#o3):**
           4.  **Calibrate and image objectives (v17, v18, and v19):**
           5.  **Move to the lander configuration (#o0):**
           6.  **Send images and analyses to the lander:**
           7.  **Return to the starting point.**
           
           Rover "v12" has a similar plan, but it is much simpler.  It just goes back to its starting point.
           
           The *key* to success here is understanding that my configuration choices *cannot* result in direct collision with "v21".  This means very specific placement of the rovers to avoid a collision. The choice of the correct placement helps with the "imagevisible" facts.
