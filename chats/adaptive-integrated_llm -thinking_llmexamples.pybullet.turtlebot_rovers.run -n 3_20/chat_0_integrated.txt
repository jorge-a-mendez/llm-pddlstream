           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this problem. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to: get images of three specific objectives, get analysis of two types of rocks, and send all that data to the lander.  Seems straightforward, but there are a few snags.
           
           First, I looked at the initial state and all the facts. There are two rovers, v12 and v14, cameras, a lander, and a whole bunch of rock samples.  The initial state says I have visibility and communication, but, in order to *do* anything, I *must* be at a specific location.
           
           I saw the available actions and immediately focused on the image and analysis actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. To take images, I need to be in the configurations `#o3` and `#o0`.  Similarly, the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` also have required configurations like `#o0` and `#o5`. But here's the kicker: The only 'move' actions I'm *allowed* are ones that essentially don't move the rovers at all! I'm stuck, literally.  The rovers can't reach those critical configurations.
           
           I looked at the given actions: I can drop rocks from store `v16`, but the store is initially empty. I thought maybe I could sample the rocks, put them in the store, and drop them later. But I can't sample either, as `sample_rock` has a location constraint.
           
           **The issue boils down to a fundamental conflict:**  the required actions (image acquisition, rock sampling, and data transmission) all depend on the rovers being at *specific* locations, namely `#o3`, `#o0` and `#o5`. My available 'move' actions *prevent* me from going to those places, so I can't satisfy the *preconditions* of those crucial image/analysis-related actions.
           
           Since the rovers are fixed and cannot fulfill the required action preconditions, I'm stuck. No plan can achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. The goal is simply unreachable given the initial state and permitted actions. I won't be returning any plan here because, simply put, there *isn't* one.
