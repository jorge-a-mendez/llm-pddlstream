User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) down the middle at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including a few in the corners (obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10), and some smaller ones. My strategy will be to place the robot in open areas that are likely to have line-of-sight to the target. I will try to diversify the positions around the target point.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempt failed. (0.5, 0.0) and (-1.0, 0.0) did not have line of sight to the target (2.08, 2.08), likely due to the central obstacle (obstacle 5) and the cluster of obstacles in the upper right. (0.0, 1.0) collided with obstacle 5. The target is in the upper right quadrant. I need to be careful with the central obstacle. I will try to place the robot in the upper right quadrant, close to the target, and avoid the known obstacles.

Model:     The previous attempt failed. The new target point is (-2.16, 2.09), which is in the upper left quadrant. My previous attempts were to place the robot in the upper right quadrant, which would not have line of sight due to the central obstacle. I will now target the upper left quadrant, close to the target, avoiding obstacle 5.
