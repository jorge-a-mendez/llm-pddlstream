           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unattainable with Limited Actions**
           
           My objective is to move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto `v20`. Currently, they are all on `v11`. The goal is to have them all on `v20`, which translates to needing to achieve `on(object, v20)` for each object.
           
           To make progress, I looked at a simpler sub-goal: getting one of those objects, say `v8`, onto `v20`.  This requires it to be at a specific pose on `v20`, defined as `atpose(v8, ?pose)`.
           
           I quickly saw that the robot's available actions don't allow it to directly achieve this.  The only valid action instance is `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)`. This moves the robot's base *from* its starting position *to* the same starting position. While this fulfills all of the action's preconditions which are `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`, `atbconf(v3)`, `canmove()` it makes `canmove()` false, which has interesting consequences when looking at the effects of the `pick` and `place` actions, which seem to *enable* the robot to perform the next action.
           
           Although I did see that, ideally, a plan to move `v8` would be:
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (requires robot's arm to be empty, robot's base to be in a configuration, that the object is in a supported pose)
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (requires robot to be at a pose with an object to be placed at a location)
           
           I then re-examined the key constraint: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that even if the `pick` and `place` actions are logically valid and would advance the planning, I cannot use them here.  The constraint makes it so that only that action can be taken. 
           
           The single `move_base` action changes `canmove()` to false.  This is a flag that essentially prevents the use of `pick` and `place`, and does not allow any change in the object poses or the satisfaction of the `on(object, v20)` goal.
           
           Given these strict action limitations, the goal of moving the objects to `v20` cannot be achieved.
