User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.011, -0.578), (0.105, -0.484)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.083, -0.351), (0.016, -0.252)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.058, -0.531, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.236).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.07, 0.462), (0.144, 0.536)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.033, -0.301, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.358, 0.934).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.107, 0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.687, 0.727).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment & Strategy:**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with devising a plan to place three objects (v8, v12, v14) onto a specific surface, v16.  Essentially, I need to get each object from where it currently is (on v11) to v16. The robot only has one usable arm, v4, so the strategy is straightforward: pick, then place, for each object. The key challenges lie in ensuring these placements are collision-free and that the robot can *actually* execute these actions based on the available predicates and the initial state. I'll need to carefully consider the geometry of the objects and the target surface, specifically the AABBs provided.
           
           **Decomposition into Sub-Problems:**
           
           To tackle this, I'm going to break it down. First, determine the necessary *moves*:
           *   **Move Base**: I'll need to move the robot base from its initial configuration to a "working" configuration (#o3) that is needed for the kin predicates used in picking/placing.
           *   **Object Manipulation**: Then, I'll need to execute a pick-and-place sequence for each object.
           
           **Generating Detailed Plan & Pose Computation:**
           
           1.  **Move Base (preparatory step):**  The kin predicates are dependent on a base configuration, #o3, which may or may not be the initial configuration, v3. If they are different, which seems likely, I'll insert a *move_base* action to get the robot into the proper configuration first.
           
           2.  **Object-Specific Actions (Pick & Place):** For each object (v8, v12, v14), the core plan is:
               *   **Pick:** Use the *pick* action to grasp the object from its current pose.
               *   **Place:** Then, I'll use the *place* action to put the object onto v16 at a *newly calculated* pose.
           
           **Crucially, I need to generate distinct pose values for these objects on the same v16 surface.** I must compute the specific x, y, z, and theta values for where I want to place each object to avoid collisions and keep them within v16's boundaries.
           
           **AABB Analysis & Safe Placement Strategies:**
           
           The initial poses are on v11, and the target is v16. v16's AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I must ensure each object stays *within* this AABB.
           
           I examined the AABBs for each object, and the poses show how the object is currently situated relative to a reference. Each object is around 0.1 wide. Using that information, and aiming for collision-free positioning, I propose a linear arrangement for placing objects on v16's surface. With each object situated precisely next to each other, they will all fit within the bounds of v16. Their z coordinate will all be equal to 0.781. theta will also be equal to zero.
            *   For v8 I've calculated (x,y) = (-0.0865, 0.0)
            *   For v12 I've calculated (x,y) = (-0.0025, 0.0)
            *   For v14 I've calculated (x,y) = (0.084, 0.0)
           
           **The Fully Specified Plan**
           
           I should now have a solid plan and poses to get the objects to their destination. Given all this, the final plan is:
           
           1.  *move\_base v3 #o3 #o0* (If v3 is not #o3)
           2.  *pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4*
           3.  *place v4 v8 (-0.0865, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4*
           4.  *pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4*
           5.  *place v4 v12 (-0.0025, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4*
           6.  *pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4*
           7.  *place v4 v14 (0.084, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o
)
