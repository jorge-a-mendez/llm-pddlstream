User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.011, -0.578), (0.105, -0.484)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.083, -0.351), (0.016, -0.252)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.058, -0.531, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.236).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.07, 0.462), (0.144, 0.536)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.033, -0.301, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.358, 0.934).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.107, 0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.687, 0.727).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Objects on a Surface**
           
           My objective is to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto the surface `v16`, achieving the goal of `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. To accomplish this, I must execute the following for each object: pick it up from its current location and then place it onto `v16`.
           
           Initially, the objects are in these states:
           - `v14` is at pose `v15` supported by `v11`.
           - `v8` is at pose `v9` supported by `v11`.
           - `v12` is at pose `v13` supported by `v11`.
           
           The plan hinges on utilizing `pick` and `place` actions. The `pick` action has the preconditions: `atpose`, `handempty`, and the appropriate `kin` instance (given). The action effect is holding the object (`atgrasp`) and the hand not being empty anymore (`NegatedAtom handempty`). The `place` action then presupposes having the object in the hand (`atgrasp`) and the given `kin`. It requires the target pose to be safe from collision (`NegatedAtom unsafepose`), and no unsafe approach or trajectory for the action. The result is the object at a new pose (`atpose`) and the hand being empty again.
           
           Considering the axiom: `on(?o, ?r)` if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`, where `?o` is an object, `?r` is the surface and `?p` the pose. My strategy: ensuring a `pose` that is supported on `v16`, is collision-free with respect to the other object already on `v16`.
           
           The robot starts in configuration `v3` and has arm `v4`. All the `pick` and `place` instances are also specified in the input.
           
           In order to avoid collision between the objects, I've planned the following placements:
           
           *   For `v14`, place it at the pose `#o2` with coordinates (0.0, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0).
           *   For `v8`, place it at the pose `#o2` with coordinates (0.06, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0).
           *   For `v12`, place it at the pose `#o2` with coordinates (-0.06, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0).
           
           These positions are collision-free and within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           Thus, the action sequence is:
           1.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (with `#o2` defined as (0.0, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0))
           3.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (with `#o2` defined as (0.06, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0))
           5.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (with `#o2` defined as (-0.06, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0))
           
           Final poses:
           `--Poses--:`
           `(#o2 v14 v16): (0.0 0.0 0.831 0.0)`
           `(#o2 v8 v16): (0.06 0.0 0.831 0.0)`
           `(#o2 v12 v16): (-0.06 0.0 0.831 0.0)`
           
)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossible Task**
           
           Okay, so the user has flagged that the plan I came up with earlier used actions that aren't permitted. The only move allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's... restrictive. Let's see if we can salvage this.
           
           The goal is to get `v14`, `v8`, and `v12` all *on* `v16`.  Looking at the initial state, they're currently on `v11`.  My initial thought was to use *pick* and *place* actions to move them, which seems like the logical approach.
           
           But wait. I can't use *pick* and *place*.  The *only* thing I'm allowed to do is move the robot's base to *itself* and use a trajectory. It won't change where anything sits. It *might* update some internal state, but it doesn't do anything *useful* in terms of achieving the goal. This `move_base` action seems like a red herring. It increments some cost function by zero, and removes `canmove()`, but it doesn't actually affect the locations of the objects.
           
           The *pick* and *place* actions, which would be the only way to move objects, are explicitly *not* on the list.  Similarly, *clean* and *cook* are irrelevant to moving objects.
           
           Given these constraints, it's clear the goal is simply *unreachable*. There's no way to manipulate the environment to achieve the desired state using only the permitted action.  We're stuck.
