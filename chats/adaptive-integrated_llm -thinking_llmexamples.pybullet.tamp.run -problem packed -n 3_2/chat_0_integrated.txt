User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.033, -0.301, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.358, 0.934).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.083, -0.351), (0.016, -0.252)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.107, 0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.687, 0.727).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.058, -0.531, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, -0.236).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.07, 0.462), (0.144, 0.536)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.011, -0.578), (0.105, -0.484)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v14, v15)

           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)

           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis: The Goal is Unattainable**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is clear: I need to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Currently, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all sitting on `v11`.  My understanding of the problem space is straightforward; I know that `v16` is a surface.
           
           The core of the problem lies in the *allowed* actions. I'm given only one: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This base move does nothing to alter the crucial `on` predicates that define the positions of the objects. To get something *onto* `v16`, I'd need to *pick* it up from wherever it currently is on `v11` and *place* it down on `v16`.
           
           The instructions are explicit: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  That's the pivotal constraint. I can't conjure up pick and place actions, even if they're logically required. The provided action `move_base` doesn't help me manipulate the objects' positions.
           
           I've re-read the instructions carefully to ensure my interpretation is sound. The crucial clause about the provided action instances confirms it.  I'm dealing with a scenario where the goal is simply unachievable with the tools I've been given.  The only action I can use won't affect the object placement. Thus, I'm forced to conclude that no plan to achieve the goal state exists with the provided action instances. It is an impossible task.
