(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (surface 0). Since this is a new request, there are no existing objects to consider for collision. The object is a square with dimensions approximately 0.0928 x 0.0928.  The surface is a square centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27.
           
           To ensure stability, a placement must meet two criteria: (1) the object must be entirely within the surface, and (2) it must not collide with other placed objects (none exist yet).
           
           I've determined the valid range for the object's center (x, y) based on the object's size and the surface dimensions.  The valid x and y ranges are approximately -0.0885 to 0.0885. Since the object's shape is a square, the AABB extents (its bounding box) are the same regardless of its orientation (theta).  However, for variety, I plan to vary theta.
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll use a 7x7 grid of x, y coordinates within the valid range. This grid will generate 49 distinct placement positions. I will use a series of diverse angles across the 7 x 7 grid to cover the space effectively.
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'll then add one more placement with the same position as (or very nearly) a grid position (0,0) with angle math.pi/8. This is distinct enough from the other 49.
           
           This grid-based approach ensures I have a diverse set of placements that meet the stability criteria.

(Thoughts: **My Process for Placing Object 8**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 4 and now I need to figure out where to put Object 8.  I've got the dimensions and I know it needs to fit within Surface 0, which is basically a square.  I've already calculated Object 4's bounding box and I *must* avoid colliding with it.
           
           First, I need to define the boundaries.  Object 8 is a square, so I'll calculate the half-width.  I know the surface's boundaries, so I can establish a feasible *search* area.
           
           I established two *critical* constraints: Object 8 has to be inside Surface 0 and it can't overlap Object 4.  To ensure no collision, I had to analyze Object 4's bounding box and then create an anti-collision region within Surface 0 which essentially prevents the center of Object 8 from entering a specific bottom-left region.  This guarantees no overlap.
           
           I broke down the solution into smaller, manageable chunks:
           1. I determined the valid range for the center coordinates of Object 8 *without* considering the collision.
           2. I then considered the collision with Object 4, to calculate the *actual* valid space.
           3. I built a grid and eliminated any grid points that would have resulted in collisions.
           4. I carefully selected 50 non-colliding coordinates within this filtered grid.
           
           I generated a 10x10 grid over the valid region, then filtered out the collision zone and grabbed the first 50 points to ensure they're stable and non-colliding.  For the sake of simplicity, since it's a square, I went with an angle of 0.
           
           So, I'm confident that the 50 placements I've generated will meet the criteria: they're all within the surface and don't collide with Object 4.

(Thoughts: **Object 5 Placement Strategy: 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable locations for Object 5 on Surface 0, taking into account its square-like dimensions (approximately 0.09m x 0.09m) and the surface's boundaries (-0.135m to 0.135m in both x and y). I've broken this down into these core considerations:
           
           1.  **Ensuring Object 5 is within Surface 0:** I've calculated the permissible center point range for Object 5 to stay entirely within the surface boundaries, considering it's half-dimension (roughly 0.045m).
           2.  **Avoiding Collisions with Object 4:** Object 4 is positioned at (0, 0) relative to the surface and is centered around x and y = -0.088, approximately. It is another square object of approximately 0.09. I've determined that, to avoid overlap, Object 5's center must be either to the right of 0.003 or above 0.003 in both x and y. So Object 5 must not be present in the bottom-left area of the surface.
           3.  **Preventing Collisions with Object 8:** Object 8 is located with its bottom left corner at (-0.086, 0.009). Following similar calculations, this necessitates Object 5's center is either to the right of 0.006 in x, or below -0.083 in y. It should be outside of the upper right.
           
           **Placement Algorithm:**
           I've decided to test a grid-based approach. I will place object 5 at the center of each of the cells of the 10x10 grid on the surface, such that it has the following possible centers:
           (-0.0898,-0.0898), (-0.0698,-0.0898) ... (0.0898, 0.0898), with 10 values each along x and y axis.
           
           For each point on the 10x10 grid on the surface:
           1.  Check for Collision with Object 4: A valid point if it meets the criteria of #2 above.
           2.  Check for Collision with Object 8: Valid points also meet the criteria of #3.
           
           **Grid Test:**
           I've confirmed that the top row will have y centers from -0.0898 to 0.0898, each 0.02 step apart, and that only values from 5-9 in `x_centers` have valid placements, as the collision range for object 4 takes up the space. The next 10 columns are all valid from there. The value where object 8 intersects is less than -0.083, which is close enough to surface, so this only eliminates the first column and not the rows.
           
           **Valid Placements:**
           
           I will place object centers at the locations along the grid, starting with index 5 through 9 for `x_center` which gives 5 columns of 10 rows each, or 50 valid placements. Theta for all placement will be 0.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID: 7 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for Object 7 on Surface 0. This is what I'm thinking:
           
           First, I need to make sure the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) stays within Surface 0's AABB. Then, I have to ensure Object 7 doesn't collide with Objects 4, 8, or 5.  
           
           Based on the object's dimensions (`size_x`, `size_y`), I'll treat it as a square and use `obj7_half_dim = max(size_x, size_y) / 2`.  I've already calculated the Surface 0 bounds.
           
           For Object 7 to fit, its center must fall within a specific region.  Given surface bounds and `obj7_half_dim`, I've worked out the allowed `x` and `y` center coordinates.
           
           Now, I'll deal with the collision checks.  For each object (4, 8, 5), I'll determine the collision region within Surface 0 where Object 7's center can't be.  I've defined these collision regions: `C4_region`, `C8_region`, and `C5_region`.  Essentially, I'm finding the "forbidden zones" where the AABBs overlap.
           
           To locate non-collision regions, I'll iterate through a 15x15 grid of potential center points for Object 7, ensuring they're within Surface 0's bounds. I'll test each grid point to see if it's within `C4_region`, `C8_region`, or `C5_region`. If not, it's valid.
           
           To make sure I get 50 different placements, I'll also add rotations, varying `theta`. This doesn't change my AABB check, but it adds another layer to vary the results. I will pick angles in the sequence `[0, np.pi/4, np.pi/2, 3*np.pi/4, np.pi, 5*np.pi/4, 3*np.pi/2, 7*np.pi/4]` to diversify the results.
