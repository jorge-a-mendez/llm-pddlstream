           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Challenge**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the best spots for a robot to stand so it can "see" a target.  I need to give the system three x, y coordinates for the robot's base. These spots need to be pretty close to the target (within a distance of 2), and they have to fit within the boundaries of the environment: x values between -2.5 and 2.5, and y values between -2.5 and 2.5.  The robot's facing direction will automatically be set, so I don't need to worry about that.
           
           The tricky part?  Avoiding obstacles. I'm given a list of rectangles (AABBs) that represent solid objects in the scene. My goal is to find robot positions that don't cause the robot to bump into any obstacles and that *also* have a clear line of sight to the target. I'll get some feedback on whether my proposed spots work. If I get asked for the same target again, it means the previous spots were no good (probably because of a non-fixed obstacle that I need to learn about).  I'll want to remember failed positions so I don't suggest them again.
           
           **Analyzing the Scene**
           
           First, I need to get a good picture of the environment from the list of AABBs.  I see a bunch of rectangles. The first rectangle, number 0, defines the very edge of the space. Obstacles 1 through 4 are walls. Obstacle 5 is a big vertical wall right in the middle, and this will be a big challenge. Obstacles 6 to 21 are smaller obstacles scattered around the space. I need to make sure I don't have the robot's base in these obstacles.
           
           **Developing a Strategy**
           
           My plan is to find good spots by considering different angles around the target point. I know the robot's base can be at most 2 units away.  So I'll focus on the area around the target, and pick spots on a circle or within the 2-unit radius.
           I'll also have to watch out for the various AABB obstacles.
           
           I need to make sure the base doesn't end up *inside* any of the fixed obstacles, and the straight line from the robot's base to the target has to avoid those obstacles, too.  I have to be especially careful with the wall at x=0; if the target is to the right of this wall, I want the robot to be to the right of the wall as well, for clear visibility.
           
           **Putting It Into Action**
           
           Because I don't have past experience to learn from, this is a fresh start. I'll try to pick a range of base positions. I will select points within 2 distance from the target. The points will be distributed at various angles around the target.
           
           I will implement two helpful functions. The first, `is_position_valid`, will check that a robot base position meets these conditions:
           1. It's within the overall environment limits.
           2. It's close enough to the target.
           3. It avoids any fixed obstacles.
           4. The line of sight is clear.
           
           I will use this to generate points around the target, and test their validity.
           
           I've also built a robust function to verify a line segment and obstacles. To calculate a valid robot position, I first define the target, then check a few properties:
           
           - If the base position is inside the allowed x and y coordinate range.
           - The distance between the target and robot base position.
           - If the robot base position is colliding with any AABBs of the static obstacles.
           - If the line segment from the target to the robot base intersects with the AABBs.
           
           If a point passes all of these tests, it is returned as a valid robot position.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy and Reasoning**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on this challenging problem. My initial goal is to find robot base positions that achieve line-of-sight (LOS) to the target point while avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles, all within a 2-unit radius of the target. However, the fact that the target is *inside* an obstacle (and within two obstacles!) introduces a major complication.  The core of my approach focuses on addressing this unique aspect.
           
           First, I recognized that the "not reachable" errors from the previous attempts were likely due to unforeseen constraints or obstacles, and I'll treat those positions as fundamentally bad for this target. Then, I decided to approach this problem with the following assumptions:
           
           1.  **Robot Footprint and Collision Checking:** I'm assuming a robot with a small radius (0.1 units). I used that value to expand all obstacles. I check to see if the robot footprint collides with each obstacle. I also used more sophisticated geometric check.
           
           2.  **Line-of-Sight (LOS):** The real issue is the target's location within those obstacles. Standard raycasting would block the LOS, but to make this problem solvable, I'm going with this: If the *target* is located within an obstacle's bounding box, then the line of sight is *valid* if it does not intersect any *other* obstacle. In other words, I'm assuming that the problem allows LOS *through* the bounding box that *contains the target*. So, I'll exclude from LOS checks the obstacles containing the target.
           
           3.  **Global Boundaries:**  I considered the global boundaries [-2.5, 2.5] and the central wall and expanded the walls with my 0.1 buffer.
           
           With that, here's how I identified three valid positions:
           
           *   **(1.6, 1.6):** This position, to the *left and below* the target, meets all my requirements: it's within 2 units, has no base collision, and, according to my new LOS rule, has a clear path.
           
           *   **(1.5, 1.0):** This is below the target and clear on my collision and LOS checks.
           
           *   **(1.2, 1.5):** This is to the *left* of the target and clear on all checks.
           
           These three positions should satisfy the prompt, given my interpretation of LOS.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, a new target point has been provided: `(-0.3171, 2.0274)`. My primary task is to find three distinct and reachable positions for the robot to *observe* this target, considering obstacles and constraints.  There's also some "dirty laundry" to sort out: feedback from the *previous* request, positions I proposed for that request, and how the system's interpreting my proposals for this new target. It seems the feedback engine may be confused, but I will make the most of it.
           
           **Contextual Clues and Previous Feedback Analysis**
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. My previous attempt, aimed at `(2.1068, 1.8311)`, hit some problems:  some proposed locations were deemed "not reachable," and others collided with obstacles (especially Obstacle 9 and 19).  The feedback for this *new* target mistakenly associates those previous positions with *this* request. I have to interpret this carefully, as the feedback relates to a different situation. I'll need to carefully verify everything.
           
           **Local Environment and Obstacle Identification**
           
           The target `(-0.3171, 2.0274)` is positioned in an area heavily influenced by Obstacle 5 (the central wall), and I need to avoid it. The target lies within the boundaries of Obstacle 10 and 21, which are important because they are *containing* obstacles.
           
           The robot's limits are x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5] and I assume r=0.1.
           
           **Generating Candidate Positions (Initial Attempts)**
           
           My first instinct is to try positions around the target. But I have to be careful as the target `(-0.3171, 2.0274)` resides on the left side of the x=0 wall (Obstacle 5). My generated positions *have* to be on the left side, as any proposed positions on the opposite side of the target are blocked by that wall.
           I need to check for the global limits, obstacle boundary violations, and a line of sight.
           
           **Candidate Position 1: Thorough Collision and Line-of-Sight Check.**
           I begin by generating candidate locations based on possible angles and distances.
           I start with the position directly below the target: `(-0.3171, 0.5274)`.
           I must check constraints: x,y boundaries, x < -0.15 (to be left of the central wall), and the distance to the target < 2.
           The robot center AABB is in: `[-0.4171, -0.2171]`.
           I start the collision checks, and I find collision with Obstacle 18 (x overlap). It requires careful AABB collision checking to rule out false positives. This position is invalid.
           
           **Candidate Position 2: Attempting Positions Around Obstacle 8.**
           I shift my attention to generating positions that are to the side and the bottom-left of the target.
           Here, the major issue I must keep in mind is avoiding Collision with Obstacle 8.
           I consider placing a location to the left of the target, but I realize the robot would immediately collide with Obstacle 8. This method is too challenging, given the proximity.
           I try various other positions, but the previous checks help me to rule out a collision.
           Then, I focus on the bottom-left area of the target.
           I have a hard time, since I must avoid collision with Obstacle 8.
           
           **Candidate Position 3: Further Verification and Obstacle 18 Issue.**
           I try for positions based on diverse ranges.
           I check a position: `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
           Then I check with constraints: distance from the target, bounds, LOS. I carefully check for collision from multiple obstructions using AABB. I successfully clear the collision, and the LOS from this position looks good.
           
           **Candidate Position 4: Top-Left Region and Obstacle Limits**
           Since the bottom-left corner and the right bottom corner look challenging, I consider a region at the top. I generate a position at `(-0.3171, 2.3)`. It is only valid if I am very close to a horizontal wall. Then, I confirm the bounds, distance, and LOS. It passes.
           
           **Revised Strategy: Targeted Search**
           I change the search strategy and generate more diverse locations.
           
           **Candidate Position 5: Further Refinement**
           I generate `(-1.5, 0.5)`
           I go through all collision checks.
           I find this position is acceptable

           My first instinct is to try positions around the target. But I have to be careful as the target `(-0.3171, 2.0274)` resides on the left side of the x=0 wall (Obstacle 5). My generated positions *have* to be on the left side, as any proposed positions on the opposite side of the target are blocked by that wall.
           I need to check for the global limits, obstacle boundary violations, and a line of sight.
           
           **Candidate Position 1: Thorough Collision and Line-of-Sight Check.**
           I begin by generating candidate locations based on possible angles and distances.
           I start with the position directly below the target: `(-0.3171, 0.5274)`.
           I must check constraints: x,y boundaries, x < -0.15 (to be left of the central wall), and the distance to the target < 2.
           The robot center AABB is in: `[-0.4171, -0.2171]`.
           I start the collision checks, and I find collision with Obstacle 18 (x overlap). It requires careful AABB collision checking to rule out false positives. This position is invalid.
           
           **Candidate Position 2: Attempting Positions Around Obstacle 8.**
           I shift my attention to generating positions that are to the side and the bottom-left of the target.
           Here, the major issue I must keep in mind is avoiding Collision with Obstacle 8.
           I consider placing a location to the left of the target, but I realize the robot would immediately collide with Obstacle 8. This method is too challenging, given the proximity.
           I try various other positions, but the previous checks help me to rule out a collision.
           Then, I focus on the bottom-left area of the target.
           I have a hard time, since I must avoid collision with Obstacle 8.
           
           **Candidate Position 3: Further Verification and Obstacle 18 Issue.**
           I try for positions based on diverse ranges.
           I check a position: `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
           Then I check with constraints: distance from the target, bounds, LOS. I carefully check for collision from multiple obstructions using AABB. I successfully clear the collision, and the LOS from this position looks good.
           
           **Candidate Position 4: Top-Left Region and Obstacle Limits**
           Since the bottom-left corner and the right bottom corner look challenging, I consider a region at the top. I generate a position at `(-0.3171, 2.3)`. It is only valid if I am very close to a horizontal wall. Then, I confirm the bounds, distance, and LOS. It passes.
           
           **Revised Strategy: Targeted Search**
           I change the search strategy and generate more diverse locations.
           
           **Candidate Position 5: Further Refinement**
           I generate `(-1.5, 0.5)`
           I go through all collision checks.
           I find this position is acceptable
