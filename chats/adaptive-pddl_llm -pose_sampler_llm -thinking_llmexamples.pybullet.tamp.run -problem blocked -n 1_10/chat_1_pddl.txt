           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've concluded. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making an object of type `v17` be "on" `v18`.  From the initial state, I can see that either object `v8` or `v12` could fulfill this if placed correctly.
           
           To achieve this, I need to use the `on` axiom. The axiom for `on` states that an object `?o` must be supported on a pose `?p` and also be at that pose. This means placing object `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.  Both objects are currently in different poses, `v12` at `v13` and `v8` at `v9`.
           
           To move either object, I need to execute `pick` and `place` actions. However, the plan provided only includes the action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually move the base, it's essentially a no-op.  The problem description is very specific: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Crucially, the problem only provides one *specific* action: the no-op move. So, given the constraints of the prompt, I can't construct the needed `pick` and `place` instances to achieve `on(v12, v18)`. Without these actions, the goal is simply unreachable.
