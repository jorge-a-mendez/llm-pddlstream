           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.09809256402851574, 0.09809256402851563)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) on a given surface (surface 0, defined as the line segment between (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)). I know the object's dimensions: `size_x = 0.09809256402851574` and `size_y = 0.09809256402851563`. A "placement" means defining the surface index, rotation angle (radians), and the center coordinates (x, y) of the object's AABB.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must be fully contained within the surface's bounding box. I need to account for rotation: the new width `W` and height `H` are defined as `W = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|` and `H = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|` where w and h are the object's AABB dimensions and theta is the rotation.
           
           I've calculated that the object's dimensions are almost a perfect square. This means that at rotations where theta=0 or pi/2, the object's AABB dimensions are also its x and y side lengths. The range for W and H will vary between 0.098 to 0.138. The surface is 0.6x0.6, so there's plenty of space.
           
           I've calculated precise ranges for the center coordinates (x, y) across several rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). For the range calculations, I used the formula with the appropriate cos and sin values for the rotation angle. Then, I will generate a grid of x,y coordinates within these calculated ranges, at the appropriate intervals. I've designed helper functions to help me calculate the valid range for the center coordinates (x,y) for a particular rotation.
           I'll create a grid: 2 values along the x-axis, 5 values along the y-axis, and 5 different rotations for 50 total placements.
