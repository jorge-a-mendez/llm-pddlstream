           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.077, -0.545), (0.021, -0.447)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.089, -0.39), (-0.006, -0.308)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.253, 0.132, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.225, 0.974).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, 0.503), (-0.203, 0.595)).

           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.028, -0.496, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.903, -0.429).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.048, -0.349, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.631, 0.776).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.249, 0.549, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.98, -0.198).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, 0.085), (-0.206, 0.179)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.191, 0.276), (-0.116, 0.352)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: A Deep Dive into Constraints**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: my goal is to get objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 all *on* surface v20.  Currently, they're all sitting on v11.  I need to figure out a plan, but there are some serious restrictions.
           
           First, I know that for an object to be on another surface I need both supported and atpose assertions. I've broken down each goal predicate `on(vX,v20)` into its required components, `supported` and `atpose`, for each object. The state seems to define that v16 is currently supported by pose v17 and v11, for example, but it also has supported predicates to move the object to the right place.
           
           I’m also aware that I have two empty robot arms, v4 and v6, which are located at base configuration v3, and each arm also has a dedicated ataconf and handempty predicate. The problem *looks* like a classic pick-and-place task. But here's the rub: I'm only allowed to use the `move_base` action.
           
           The problem specifically says I can *only* use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That does *nothing* except generate some bookkeeping predicates (btraj, basemotion, increasing the cost). This is an immediate red flag.
           
           The `move_base` action cannot alter the positions of the objects. It only changes my base configuration, which doesn't help me with the "on" predicates. These objects need to be *picked up* and *placed* onto v20. There's no way around it.  My initial analysis looked at `kin` predicates, which could potentially give a good plan to move each object with two arm movements (one to pick up and one to place down). I've got kin predicates for each object.
           
           I’m now absolutely certain: I can't move these objects with *only* `move_base`. There are no other actions I can take.
           
           The initial state, which confirms that all the objects are currently *on* v11, and the target *on* v20, confirms my findings. Given the rules I must follow, the goal is simply *unreachable*. I will explain that the available action isn't capable of completing the task.
