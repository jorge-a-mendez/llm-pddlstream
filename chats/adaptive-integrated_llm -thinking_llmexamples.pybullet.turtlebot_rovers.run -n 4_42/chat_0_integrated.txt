           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Plan Unattainable: The Rovers' Impasse**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've been tasked with conjuring a plan to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the "rovers" domain. This particular axiom is a demanding one, requiring me to get images, analyze rocks, and then communicate these findings.  But, as I dive in, it quickly becomes apparent that this task is not going to work out with the given premises.
           
           The crux of the problem lies in the rovers' restricted movement. I have two rovers, *v12* and *v14*, already at specific "conf" states—`v13` and `v15`, respectively.  To achieve my ultimate goal, they must, to obtain necessary information, occupy the configuration states  `#o3`, `#o5` and  `#o0` in order to complete the image taking, rock sampling and communication tasks, respectively.  The problem is, my initial analysis reveals that the rovers are chained to configurations  `v13` and `v15`.
           
           The available move actions, `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, provide a trajectory (#o2) but *only* result in no state change, the rover configurations remain in their initial states. They can *only* move *from* where they currently *are* in their given confined space.  There are no `motion` predicates that would permit either rover to change its `atconf` state. No path exists.
           Given the initial setup, it's impossible for either rover to perform its necessary functions.  
           
           Specifically, I need:
           
           1.  To get images of objectives *v17, v18, v19, v20* using the `imagevisible` predicates. This depends on reaching the configuration state `#o3`.
           2.  To analyze rocks *v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8* using the `above` and `sample_rock` predicates. This requires the configuration `#o5`.
           3.  To send images and analyses to the lander *v9* using the `comvisible` and `send_image/analysis` predicates. This necessitates the configuration `#o0`.
           
           But, as no available `move` action exists that would allow me to change the `atconf` state of either rover to meet these preconditions, my ability to take an image, analyze a rock, or communicate with the lander is completely locked down.  I'm at an impasse. Because I can't meet the preconditions, the objective is unreachable. The objective simply is.
