           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan to achieve that `new-axiom@0()` goal, broken down into manageable steps. The key is to get the rover, `v14`, to take some pictures, analyze some rocks, and send the data back.
           
           **Step 1: Get those Images!**
           
           *   First, we'll move `v14` from its starting spot, `v15`, to the designated imaging configuration, which we'll call `#o3`.  This `#o3` is at coordinates `(-0.05, 0.0)`.
           *   Then we'll calibrate the camera, taking pictures of the four imaging targets: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           *   After the pictures are taken, we will move the rover to the communication configuration, `#o0` which is located at `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           *   Finally, we will send all those lovely images back to base!
           
           **Step 2: Rock Analysis Time!**
           
           *   Now, we need to get the rock analyses. We'll move `v14` back over to our sampling configuration `#o5`. While I didn't need to define this configuration in particular, for completion's sake, it is the same as the imaging configuration, `(-0.05, 0.0)`.
           *   We'll start by sampling a rock identified as `v3` which is a type `v2` rock.
           *   Once sampled, we will move the rover to our communications configuration (`#o0`).
           *   Then we will send the rock analysis back to base.
           *   Next, we will move to `v5` (a type `v6` rock) and follow a similar procedure.
           
           **Step 3: Return Home**
           
           *   Move the rover back to the starting position at `v15` to finalize the goal condition.
           
           **To Summarize, here's the step-by-step plan for the planner**

Model:     **Finalized Plan for Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan to achieve that `new-axiom@0()` goal, broken down into manageable steps. The key is to get the rover, `v14`, to take some pictures, analyze some rocks, and send the data back.
           
           **Step 1: Get those Images!**
           
           *   First, we'll move `v14` from its starting spot, `v15`, to the designated imaging configuration, which we'll call `#o3`.  This `#o3` is at coordinates `(-0.05, 0.0)`.
           *   Then we'll calibrate the camera, taking pictures of the four imaging targets: `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           *   After the pictures are taken, we will move the rover to the communication configuration, `#o0` which is located at `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           *   Finally, we will send all those lovely images back to base!
           
           **Step 2: Rock Analysis Time!**
           
           *   Now, we need to get the rock analyses. We'll move `v14` back over to our sampling configuration `#o5`. While I didn't need to define this configuration in particular, for completion's sake, it is the same as the imaging configuration, `(-0.05, 0.0)`.
           *   We'll start by sampling a rock identified as `v3` which is a type `v2` rock.
           *   Once sampled, we will move the rover to our communications configuration (`#o0`).
           *   Then we will send the rock analysis back to base.
           *   Next, we will move to `v5` (a type `v6` rock) and follow a similar procedure.
           
           **Step 3: Return Home**
           
           *   Move the rover back to the starting position at `v15` to finalize the goal condition.
           
           **To Summarize, here's the step-by-step plan for the planner**

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Plan and Continuous Configurations**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan had a problem: the chosen continuous configurations for object `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (communication) led to collisions. Time to find new, collision-free values and regenerate the plan.
           
           First, I need to figure out a new value for `#o3`.  This is used by robot `v14` to image objectives `v17, v18, v19, and v20`. The tricky part: it *must* be collision-free with obstacle `v21` (a vertical wall at x=0), reachable from `v15` (the initial configuration), have line-of-sight to the imaging targets, and stay within range.  The previous attempt, `(-0.05, 0.0, 0.0)`, was a collision with the wall at x=0, making that an obvious starting point.
           
           Considering the layout, I need to position `#o3` somewhere that allows it to see the widespread imaging targets. A position with an x-coordinate greater than `0.05` or less than `-0.05` (to avoid v21) is needed. My calculations and the initial plan pointed to a potential position to handle the object's line of sight `(0.1, 0.0, 0.0)` for `#o3`.
           
           For the communications, I then decided to determine a value for `#o0`.  This is for communication between `v14` and the lander `v9`.  The previous attempted configuration resulted in a collision.  The target is to move `v14` to a position `comvisible` to `v9` while being collision-free.  To do this, I needed to pick a position just outside of `v9`'s bounding box.  I've chosen `(-1.3, -1.75, 0.0)` for `#o0`.  This would allow `v14` to communicate with the lander without getting tangled.
           
           With these configurations in place, I then revisited the complete plan:
           
           *   **Move:** Rover `v14` goes from its starting position (`v15`) to the imaging position (`#o3`).
           *   **Image:** At `#o3`, `v14` calibrates its camera and takes images of all the objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`).
           *   **Communicate:** The rover then moves from the imaging position (`#o3`) to the communication position (`#o0`) to send the images to the lander (`v9`).
           *   **Sample, Analyze, and Send:** Rover goes to sampling location (`#o5`) and gathers two different rock samples, sending both the analysis and the sample to the lander via the communication position.
           *   **Return:** Finally, the rover moves back to its starting position (`v15`) to complete the axiom requirements.
           
           I then verified the plan, making sure each step is now valid with the new coordinates, checking for visibility, reachable movements and collision-free environments.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The goal is the `new-axiom@0()` action in the `rovers` domain. It looks like I need to revisit my plan because the continuous configurations I previously suggested caused some collisions, specifically with a wall-like obstacle, `v21`.  Here's the revised plan:
           
           I'll start with the initial and goal conditions and re-evaluate each step. The core idea is still the same: image objectives, analyze rocks, and get the lander to receive all the required information.
           
           First, I need to focus on moving rover `v14` to a new imaging configuration, which I'll call `#o3`.  I need to ensure that this position allows for imaging of all four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) *and* that it avoids the obstacle `v21`. I think my previous x-coordinate choice of `0.1` was causing the collision, so I'm going to set `#o3` to `(0.5, 0.0, 0.0)`. This should be safe. I'll need to double check that this positioning is still within range for imaging.
           
           Once in the correct imaging position, the rover will need to image all four objectives. Then, I need to get it in a position to communicate with the lander. The suggested continuous parameters for `communication` need to be set to `#o0` which I'm setting to `(-0.5, -1.75, 0.0)`. I picked this location because it shouldn't collide with the lander (`v9`) or the obstacle, `v21`.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           1.  **Move rover `v14` from its current configuration `v15` at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0) to configuration `#o3` (0.5, 0.0, 0.0).**
           2.  **Image each objective**: Calibrate camera `v10` on `v14` and image the four objectives.
           3.  **Move rover `v14` from `#o3` (0.5, 0.0, 0.0) to the communication configuration `#o0` (-0.5, -1.75, 0.0).**
           4.  **Send images to the lander**. I need to ensure the four images taken are relayed to the lander `v9`.
           5.  **Move rover `v14` from `#o0` to the sampling configuration `#o5`.**
           6.  **Analyze rock `v3`.** I have to sample rock `v3`, which is type `v2`.  Get the rock into `v16`.
           7.  **Move rover `v14` back to `#o0`.**
           8.  **Send rock analysis to lander `v9`.**
           9.  **Drop rock `v3`**. I need to free the rover's store, `v16`.
           10. **Move rover `v14` back to `#o5`.**
           11. **Sample rock `v8`.** This is the soil sample.
           12. **Move rover `v14` back to `#o0`.**
           13. **Send soil analysis to lander.** Send the analysis of rock `v8` to lander `v9`.
           14. **Drop rock `v8`**. I will drop the second rock.
           15. **Move rover `v14` back to its original location, `v15` at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           
           I'm confident this revised plan addresses the collision issues and gets me to the new axiom.

(Thoughts: **Problem Re-evaluation for Plan Generation**
           
           Okay, so I'm back at the drawing board. It's clear that my previous attempts to solve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain haven't worked out, specifically when it comes to finding those reachable and collision-free continuous configurations for imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0). The "not reachable" errors are a real pain. Time for a complete problem re-think, focusing on those pesky reachability and collision constraints.
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The task is straightforward: image a set of objectives, analyze some rocks and soil, and transmit the data to the lander. The starting point for the rover, `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`, and the lander's location are fixed. I'm given all the objective details, their positions, AABBs, and more. This is basically a data transmission challenge where I have to handle image capture, and sampling/analysis.
           
           **Obstacle in the Way:**
           
           The biggest thing is the vertical obstacle, `v21`, a thin wall running along the y-axis, centered at x=0. It's only 0.1 meters high, which probably doesn't impact line of sight, but it's causing issues.
           
           **What I Know (or Think I Know):**
           
           *   `motion(v14, <from>, #o2, <to>)` means the rover can move *between* these configurations: `v15`, `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. But, it means the intermediate configurations are a big risk for collision.
           *   I *need* to pick locations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that *guarantee* reachability, and minimize the risk of collision with `v21` and the lander. That's the key.
           *   `imagevisible` is true for all objectives, and implies that the camera's base has a clear line of sight.
           
           **Strategic Shift:**
           
           Instead of trying to find the *perfect* configurations, I need to focus on points that are:
           
           1.  **Close:** Relatively near `v15` (to minimize movement).
           2.  **Obstacle-free:** Clear of the `v21` wall and the lander's boundary (I can't be in the lander, and I must not clip `v21`).
           3.  **Feasible:** Within a "reachable" region, or a place where my movement actions will work without collision with the wall.
           
           **Proposed Configuration Strategy:**
           
           Let's try these locations and try that again:
           
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):**  Position `(-1.0, -1.5, 0.0)`. This point is outside of the lander AABB, but nearby.
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):** Position `(-0.9, -1.7, 0.0)`. Very close to `v15` for a quick trip. Collision free with v21.
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):** Position `(-0.8, -1.8, 0.0)`. Same conditions as #o3.
           
           **Rationale:** These points are all near `v15`, so those `motion` predicates should be fine.  They avoid the obstacle. With these I can move easily and without clashing with things, and then do the job of grabbing images, grabbing samples, and making the data drop.
           
           **Key Assumption and Next Steps:**
           
           I'm banking on the `imagevisible` predicates being true for all the objectives given the setup of the problem. If everything is setup in the environment as is, and assuming that I can be collision-free and be very near these points, that I will have a valid solution.
           
           With these configurations, I'll stick with the plan.

Model:     **Problem Re-evaluation for Plan Generation**
           
           Okay, so I'm back at the drawing board. It's clear that my previous attempts to solve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain haven't worked out, specifically when it comes to finding those reachable and collision-free continuous configurations for imaging (#o3) and communication (#o0). The "not reachable" errors are a real pain. Time for a complete problem re-think, focusing on those pesky reachability and collision constraints.
           
           **Understanding the Goal:**
           
           The task is straightforward: image a set of objectives, analyze some rocks and soil, and transmit the data to the lander. The starting point for the rover, `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`, and the lander's location are fixed. I'm given all the objective details, their positions, AABBs, and more. This is basically a data transmission challenge where I have to handle image capture, and sampling/analysis.
           
           **Obstacle in the Way:**
           
           The biggest thing is the vertical obstacle, `v21`, a thin wall running along the y-axis, centered at x=0. It's only 0.1 meters high, which probably doesn't impact line of sight, but it's causing issues.
           
           **What I Know (or Think I Know):**
           
           *   `motion(v14, <from>, #o2, <to>)` means the rover can move *between* these configurations: `v15`, `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. But, it means the intermediate configurations are a big risk for collision.
           *   I *need* to pick locations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that *guarantee* reachability, and minimize the risk of collision with `v21` and the lander. That's the key.
           *   `imagevisible` is true for all objectives, and implies that the camera's base has a clear line of sight.
           
           **Strategic Shift:**
           
           Instead of trying to find the *perfect* configurations, I need to focus on points that are:
           
           1.  **Close:** Relatively near `v15` (to minimize movement).
           2.  **Obstacle-free:** Clear of the `v21` wall and the lander's boundary (I can't be in the lander, and I must not clip `v21`).
           3.  **Feasible:** Within a "reachable" region, or a place where my movement actions will work without collision with the wall.

           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):** Position `(-0.8, -1.8, 0.0)`. Same conditions as #o3.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-0.9 -1.7 0.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is out of range. The maximum range is 4, but the distance to the target is 4.05.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Challenge and Crafting a Solution**
           
           I'm tackling a tricky planning problem in the `rovers` domain, aiming to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. I've hit some snags before with continuous configuration values, specifically concerning `#o3` and `#o0`, due to collision and reachability issues. The core problem this time is that the proposed `#o3` configuration (specifically, an attempt with the coordinates (-0.9,-1.7, 0.0)) failed the `imagevisible` constraint, as its calculated distance to the target was out of range. My primary concern revolves around the proper interpretation of continuous parameters in the context of visibility (specifically `imagevisible` and `comvisible`) and direct access (specifically the `above` predicate).
           
           My goal is to develop a collision-free and reachable plan that satisfies the various initial state conditions.  There are several requirements that must be accounted for:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Ensuring the initial configurations are maintained throughout the process.
           2.  `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Ensuring the robot's store remains available to receive objects as needed.
           3.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Taking and sending images.
           4.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Collecting and sending analyses of specific rock and soil samples.
           
           **Key Constraints and Considerations:**
           
           The rover `v14` is the primary actor in this plan. Obstacles in the environment include a central wall/pillar (`v21`) and a large lander (`v9`). Collision avoidance is critical. Reachability between points is determined by the `motion` predicates. Two core range limitations come into play: The maximum imaging distance (`imagevisible`) is limited to 2m, and the communication distance (`comvisible`) is limited to 4m.
           
           The rover begins at position `v15` which is (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).  I've double-checked my understanding of the coordinates and the given information.
           
           **Navigating the Complexities of Continuous Parameters**
           
           The key to unlocking this problem is understanding the nuances of how continuous parameters, represented by symbols like `#o3` and `#o0`, are handled. The original problem description states if a plan requires different pairs to satisfy visibility constraints, different values must be provided for each pair. This is a crucial detail that was initially overlooked. It does *not* require a single continuous value to satisfy all preconditions. I have to create different `#o3` locations for each of the imaging tasks (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), and different `#o0` values for communication. This means I'm free to define a set of distinct configurations!
           * I have to find a `#o3_v17`, `#o3_v18`, `#o3_v19`, and `#o3_v20` to satisfy the imaging targets. This must satisfy the range for `imagevisible`.
           * I also need a `#o0` to allow `comvisible` and access to the lander at `v9`.
           * Additionally, I must define `#o5_v3` and `#o5_v8` to satisfy the `above` predicate needed for sampling the rocks, making sure the rover is above the rock target.
           
           **Crafting the Plan and the New Configurations:**
           
           The revised plan goes like this:
           1.  Move the rover (`v14`) to the appropriate `#o3` for each image target, calibrate, take the image, using a different `#o3` for each target to solve visibility issues.
           2.  Move the rover to `#o0` for communication with the lander. Send the images.
           3.  Then, move the rover to the correct `#o5` to sample the target rocks, send the analysis, drop the rocks.
           4.  Finally, return the robot to its base position `v15`.
           
           **The Continuous Configuration Parameters and their Values:**
           
           The specific coordinates are:
           *   `#o3_v17`: (0.4, 0.5, 0.0)
           *   `#o3_v18`: (-2.0, 0.5, 0.0)
           *   `#o3_v19`: (-0.6, 0.5, 0
