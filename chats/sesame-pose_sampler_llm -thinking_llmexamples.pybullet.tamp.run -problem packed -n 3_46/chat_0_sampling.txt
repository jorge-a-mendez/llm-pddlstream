(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5 and dimensions (0.077, 0.077) on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). This object and surface are both squares. I need to make sure the object remains entirely inside the surface.
           
           I've got the necessary calculations: The object's side is `s = 0.077`. The surface's side is 0.27. I know it will fit because 0.077 is less than 0.27.
           
           Placements are represented as (surface index, rotation angle, x, y). The object can rotate which will affect its overall AABB. The rotation angle, theta, ranges from 0 to pi/2, to prevent duplicate AABB's for a square.  I'm going to vary the `theta` and (x, y) to make a diverse set of placements.
           
           I need to calculate the bounding boxes for the object to figure out the acceptable (x, y) values. The object's effective half-extent will grow as the object rotates to `pi/4`. The rotated size of the object will then restrict the allowed x and y values for the center of the object. My strategy is to vary theta and make sure the grid of x and y values fit within this reduced area based on rotation.
           
           So I determined the effective half-extent based on the given theta, then found the x and y limits based on that. I've broken the rotational space from 0 to pi/2 in 10 sections, each with its own theta. Within each theta, I have picked a good distribution of 5 (x,y) values for each theta. This approach, is a good way to cover the space effectively.
           
           Let's begin.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task: place object 4, a square with a side of about 0.087, onto surface 0.  Surface 0 is a rectangle, and I need to avoid collisions with a pre-existing object, square 5, which is smaller and centered at (0,0).  The core of this problem is finding 50 stable placements for object 4 where they don't overlap, so I'm thinking about the geometry.
           
           First, I define object 5's bounding box to be about [-0.038, 0.038] in both x and y.  Then I set the stability condition, which basically means object 4's center needs to be within a certain distance from the edge of surface 0.  The stability extent depends on rotation, but I can approximate a collision-avoidance boundary of  [-0.082, 0.082].
           
           Initially, I planned to use positions like (0,0) and some positions on x-axis and y-axis.
           The real challenge is to keep object 4 *far enough* away from the center to avoid object 5.
           I determined that if I just looked at the coordinates, such a placement requires placing the object at locations where either absolute `x` or absolute `y` are greater than the object extent and the size of object 5.
           
           I need 50 valid solutions. If my boundary is 0.082, I can calculate valid regions for `x` and `y` from that, and find the corners.
           To be effective, I would create an algorithm to generate many placements, check for collisions, and then return the first 50 stable ones. I'll test corners because they will be far away from each other.
           
           To start, I'll generate a list of angles. I am setting it up so that my algorithm tests if `x` or `y` is greater than 0.082 to determine if the location is valid.
           
           I am re-evaluating my process. I am determining that there is a range of angles where no solution is valid.
           After considering the rotation, I found a collision check that determines if absolute values of either `x` or `y` are greater than the extents.
           I am finding that for the object's stability, the angles of zero and pi/2 work.
           Because I am starting with angles of zero and pi/2, this indicates the best way to get this list will be generate a list within 0 to 0.10, and pi/2 to pi/2-0.10.
           
           Now I am calculating the numbers for the final solutions.
           
           I'm checking my method and using various angles and checking their validity.
           Now it's time to generate the stable placements!

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Stable Placement of Object 6**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 6) on surface 0, and I need to be *absolutely* sure these placements are solid.  "Stable" here means the entire AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 6, no matter how it's rotated, has to stay snugly within the boundaries of surface 0.  Crucially, I also need to make sure this new object doesn't bump into either Object 5 or Object 4, using their AABBs as collision guards.
           
           Here's the scene's layout: Surface 0 is this square with sides of length `0.27` (`surf_half_side = 0.135`). Object 5 is a square (`s5 = 0.077`) placed right in the center (at `(0,0,0)`), and Object 4 is also a square (`s4 = 0.087`) slightly off-center (at `(0, 0.091, 0.091)`).  The object 6 is a square (`s6 = 0.070`).
           
           The constraints are as follows:
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:**  The "effective" size of Object 6 depends on its rotation (theta6). I've got a formula (`effective_half_extent6 = half_s6 * (abs(cos(theta6)) + abs(sin(theta6)))`) to calculate this.  This also defines surface boundary for the object. `x_lim_surf = 0.135 - effective_half_extent6`.
           
           2.  **No Collision with Object 5:**  I need to make sure the AABB of Object 6 doesn't touch Object 5. Since Object 5 is centered, this means the center of Object 6 has to be far enough away from the origin in both the x and y directions (`abs(x6) >= effective_half_extent6 + half_s5` OR `abs(y6) >= effective_half_extent6 + half_s5`). To make the process manageable, I've got this collision distance: `coll5_dist = effective_half_extent6 + half_s5`.
           
           3.  **No Collision with Object 4:** The new object must not overlap with object 4, which is in the top-right corner.
           
           Now, here's my game plan:
           
           *   **Angle Selection:** Because of object 4's location, I'm going to focus on placing Object 6 in three main regions:  bottom-left, top-left, and bottom-right "quadrants." I need to avoid high-rotation angles, so I will stick with angles in the range 0 to 0.5. These angles will be used.
           *   **Placement Strategy:** I'm going to calculate the valid placement zones by computing x and y bounds that are: far enough from Object 5 and fit nicely on Surface 0.
           *   **Generate Positions and test:** generate positions using the valid range for each angle.
           
           I will iterate:
           
           1.  Pick angle in range.
           2.  Calculate all constraints based on this angle.
           3.  Calculate all valid positions, making sure to avoid Object 5 (using `coll5_dist`) and Object 4.
           4.  Get at least 50.
