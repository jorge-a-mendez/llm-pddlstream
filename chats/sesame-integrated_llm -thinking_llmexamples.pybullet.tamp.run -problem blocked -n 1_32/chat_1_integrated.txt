           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Robot's Plan to Achieve a New Axiom**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring that an object is both "on" a specific surface and of a particular "type".  Let's break this down. From the problem setup, `new-axiom@0()` requires two subgoals: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The "type" condition is easily satisfied because the initial state indicates that `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` are already true.  This leaves us to focus on the "on" relation.
           
           My first task is to identify the object represented by `?green`. Considering available options, `?green` could be `v8` or `v12`. Because there are 2 candidates, let's explore `v8` first. This converts the subgoal to achieving `on(v8, v18)`. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find a suitable pose.  The definition states that an object `?o` is "on" another `?r` if it's both "supported" and "atpose".
           
           Initially, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)`. Also, `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` is in the initial state. Thus, I need to make `atpose(v8, #p0)` true. The plan is to get `v8` to `#p0`, and I know from looking at the `kin` facts that, I must:
           1.  **move_base**: To first get the robot's base near the pose of the object to be picked. (bconf is short for *base configuration*).
           2.  **pick**: Arm `v4` needs to pick `v8` from `v9` with grasp `#g0` and trajectory `#t0`.
           3.  **move_base**: The robot base has to move. It's currently base config (`v3`). I have to go to base config (`#q0`), so the robot can place to get to the `#p0` position to achieve `atpose`.
           4.  **place**: Finally, arm `v4` to place `v8` at `#p0` with grasp `#g0` using trajectory `#t1`. The object is now `atpose(#p0)`!
           
           This "first attempt" planning used `v8`. The initial cost would be *distance from `v3` to `#q0`* + *pick cost* + *distance between q0 and q1* + *place cost*. The total cost is represented with these action primitives.
           
           I should also analyze if other objects would lead to a more efficient plan: I look at the possibility of using `v12` instead. So, I will re-do the planning with `v12`. I need to evaluate *distance from v3 to base position #o3* + *pick cost* + *place cost*.
           
           In considering `v12`, I noted a discrepancy in the initial state information regarding the starting and target locations of `v12`. The available `kin` information suggests that the robot's base configuration (`bconf`)  used for picking `v12` from `v13` (its initial location) is the same as the bconf required to place it on the target region `#o2` on `v18`. This is very efficient!
           To satisfy the sub-goal of `on(v12, v18)`, the actions are simpler:
           
           1.  **move_base:** move to base config `#o3`.
           2.  **pick**: pick `v12` from `v13`.
           3.  **place**: place `v12` at `#o2`.
           
           This shorter plan eliminates a move_base, reducing the overall cost. Since the pick and place action are 1 unit, the "distance cost" is what will increase or decrease the plan cost. I am confident that `v12` is the ideal object to achieve the goal in the most cost-effective manner.
           
           I need to precisely define the pose coordinates for `#o2` on surface `v18` for placing `v12`. `v18` is a region from AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v12`'s AABB is `((-4.487, 0.492), (-4.39, 0.59))`. I will
