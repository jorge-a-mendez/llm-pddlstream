           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. My goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means I need to make sure an object of a specific `type` (`v17`) is `on` `v18`. I've looked at the initial state and noticed that `v12` and `v8` are candidates because they have the right `type`.  To get something `on` `v18`, it needs to be *supported* by `v18` and be at the correct *pose*.
           
           Now, the issue arises when I try to figure out how to put `v12` or `v8` on `v18`. I need to change their poses using `pick` and `place` actions. However, all these pick and place operations require a specific base configuration, `#o3`. The problem is, the only `move_base` action I have allows me to stay at my current base configuration, `v3`. It looks like `move_base` should be able to move me between base configurations and poses, but the current problem definition restricts it.
           
           I've checked the action carefully, and if the start and end configuration are the same, `atbconf(v3)` stays true. So, I can't reach `#o3` and can't perform any useful pick and place actions.  Because I can't manipulate objects, `v12` and `v8` won't be moved, and neither will be `on` `v18`. Based on the evidence, the goal is unachievable given the constraints of the action instances available and the initial state. I cannot satisfy the goal of moving a object to `v18`. This implies that `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
