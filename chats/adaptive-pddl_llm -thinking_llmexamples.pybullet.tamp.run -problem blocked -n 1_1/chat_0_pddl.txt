           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing an object, let's call it `?green`, that's both *on* something (`v18`) and has a specific *type* (`v17`). My initial thought is to check the initial state. I need `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           The definition of 'on' is crucial: it requires that something be *supported* by and *atpose* on the object. Right away, I see this is going to be a problem. My focus shifts to the two objects that have `type v17`, which are `v12` and `v8`.
           
           I analyze `v12` first. Does `on(v12, v18)` hold true? To satisfy that I need `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  I can see that `v12` is *atpose* `v13` (which is supported by something else) and also *supported* on something else. This isn't helpful, and I don't see anything explicitly that would satisfy `on(v12, v18)`. A similar analysis of `v8` yields the same negative result.
           
           So, the initial state doesn't meet the goal. The only action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. My task now is to determine if this action *can* get me to the goal.
           
           I examine the effects of `move_base`: it affects the base configuration and the `canmove()` predicate. Crucially, it doesn't touch `atpose`, `supported`, or `type`, which are the predicates that relate to my goal. The effect is simply a no-op, i.e., I move the base and `canmove` is false now. 
           
           Given the goal and only this action, my conclusion is clear: the goal is *unreachable*. The action I've been given is completely irrelevant to satisfying the preconditions for `on(?green, v18)`, and my initial state doesn't meet those conditions. It's a dead end. My expert intuition is that some critical action that relates the object pose must be missing for this plan to work, and without it, I cannot reach the target state.
