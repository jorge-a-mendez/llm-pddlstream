           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this planning problem.** I've been given a goal: to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all `on` object `v18`.  Since I know that `on` is defined by the `supported` and `atpose` predicates, this means I need to find poses on `v18` that support each of the target objects and then move them there.
           
           Currently, all the target objects are `on` object `v11`.  So, I need to plan a series of "pick" and "place" actions to transfer them from `v11` to `v18`.  My available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`, but given the goal and available facts, `clean` and `cook` are clearly not needed. `move_base` is available but based on the provided facts the base does not need to move. I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently `handempty`. Arm `v4` looks like the best option for this plan, since it looks like the initial state has all necessary `kin` (kinematic) facts needed for the pick and place operation.
           
           I'm starting by looking at the initial state and determining the sequence of actions for each object. The preconditions for my actions will be the same regardless of which object is picked up, since all four objects are `on` object `v11`, and all four have the required `kin` facts related to object `v18`. 
           
           For each object, I'll need to `pick` it from its current pose and `place` it onto `v18`.  Since I have arm `v4` available and it is `handempty` after each `place` operation, I can simply repeat this pick-and-place sequence for each of the four objects.
           
           For a specific object (let's say `v8`), I need to:
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.  The grasp, base config, and arm trajectory will be determined by the specific `kin` facts present in the state.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. The pose `#o2` on object `v18` is the pose needed to place the object onto `v18`.
           
           I can repeat this sequence for `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, with each object using `v4` with a different grasping pose and placing pose for each object.
           
           I've carefully checked all preconditions, especially the `canmove()` predicate.  I am confident that the pick and place actions, and the fact that `handempty` will be true prior to each pick, ensures that all preconditions will be met.
           
           I am omitting any `move_base` actions since the robot base does not need to move to accomplish the goal.
           
           Therefore, the plan is:
           1. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2. `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           4. `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           5. `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           6. `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           7. `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           8. `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           And I am confident this plan will successfully achieve the desired goal of placing all the objects on `v18`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, the user flagged my initial plan, and they're right. I was using actions that weren't in the provided action list: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  My goal is to have multiple objects placed *on* a specific object: `Conjunction (on(v8, v18)) (on(v12, v18)) (on(v14, v18)) (on(v16, v18))`.  The only action available to me is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Let's dissect this.  The only action doesn't actually *do* anything useful for my goal. It merely checks that I'm at the correct pose, and sets `canmove()` to false. Since the user can only use the `move_base` action, I can't move any objects or do any of the other things needed to achieve my goal. My goal requires changing the `on` predicate for a bunch of things, but the definition of `on` is `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`, where `p` is the pose of object `o` on object `r`.  This `move_base` action doesn't touch the `on` predicate.
           
           To get `on(v8, v18)`, I'd need to change `atpose(v8, v9)` to `atpose(v8, #o2)`. To do *that*, I would need `pick` or `place` actions which are not allowed. Since `move_base` doesn't alter the object positions, there is no way to reach my goal state. The poses of the objects, v8, v12, v14, and v16 cannot be changed because of the restricted action set. The goal is unreachable given the current constraints.
