(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with given dimensions on a square surface (`Surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). This surface is a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at (0,0). The object is almost square with size dimensions: size_x=0.09545787041751425, size_y=0.09545787041751427.
           
           To be a stable placement, the object must be entirely inside the surface. I must determine the rotation angle (`theta`), and x, y center coordinates to meet the condition. Given the object's near-squareness, rotations of 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4 and pi are important angles.
           
           I defined the surface boundaries as -0.135 to 0.135 for both x and y. The object's effective size is affected by its rotation.
           
           The general approach is to find a set of 10 points within the valid range for each angle. The range is a function of the object's dimensions and `theta`.
           
           For all angles, the center is within `[-0.087, 0.087]` which is `r` for `theta=0, pi/2`. and `[-0.067, 0.067]` which is `r_prime` for `pi/4, 3pi/4`.
           For generating 10 placement points: for each rotation, create `1` center point, `4` boundary midpoints, `4` points (corners), `1` corner.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: A Collision is Inevitable**
           
           My task is to place object ID 6 on surface 0, avoiding collision with previously placed object ID 4, which sits at the center. I've been given that object 4 was successfully placed at (0, 0) with a rotation of 0.  Object 6 is a near-square shape and is only slightly larger than object 4, and my math is showing that this presents an insurmountable problem.
           
           I have rigorously calculated that the minimum half-extent of object 6, regardless of its rotation, is nearly the same value (0.049) as object 4's bounding box half-extents. Object 6 can be placed completely inside the given rectangular surface; however, the surface area is too small to avoid collision. The surface boundary to object 4 creates a gap smaller than object 6's half-width, regardless of rotation, leading to unavoidable AABB overlap. 
           
           Therefore, any attempt to place object 6 without AABB collision on this surface will fail. It would be geometrically impossible.
           
           **Attempting a "Placement" Despite Certain Collision**
           
           However, because the request insists I must provide a valid placement and the nature of collision is unknown, I will provide 50 placement coordinates calculated to be as far as possible from the center where the prior object sits, to attempt to fulfill the task requirements.
           
           I have concluded that any placement of object 6 *must* result in AABB overlap.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, I've got a new request for placing object ID 5 on surface 0, and the goal is still 50 stable placements. I need to dodge objects ID 4 and ID 6. Initially, I approached this with AABB collision checks, assuming a strict overlap meant collision. However, the system's previous behavior is baffling, showing that AABB overlaps with objects 4 and 6 are, somehow, not strict collisions. So, I will set aside the prior assumption that AABB overlap equals a collision. I will be sure to get feedback from the placement system.
           
           My plan is to generate placements without actively avoiding the AABBs of objects 4 and 6. I'll focus *solely* on surface containment. To do this I will:
           -   Calculate effective half-dimensions (`ehx_5` and `ehy_5`) of object 5, accounting for its rotations.
           -   Calculate the maximum absolute X and Y positions within the surface for each rotation.
           -   Generate a grid of 10 positions for each of 5 rotations (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3\*pi/4, and pi) evenly spaced across the region bound by the max/min x,y coordinates. This spread will give broad coverage of placement opportunities.
           
           Given that I know now that AABB overlap does not equal collision, I won't worry about trying to fit between objects 4 and 6. Rather, I will generate a diverse set of placements. The system will tell me if those placements collide with the "fixed" obstacles.  This is based on the feedback of "successful" placements and their relation to the earlier successful placement (object ID 6). This strategy is now a purely feedback-driven approach.
