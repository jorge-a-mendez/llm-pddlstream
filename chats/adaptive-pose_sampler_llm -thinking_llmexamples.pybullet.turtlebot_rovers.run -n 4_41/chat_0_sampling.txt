(Thoughts: **Understanding the Task and Scene Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three (x, y) robot base positions for a given target point, ensuring they're within a 2-unit range and the scene's boundaries. The robot's orientation will automatically face the target, which is convenient. Crucially, I have to avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles in the scene. I am *explicitly* told that I will get feedback if my proposed positions collide or *don't* have line-of-sight to the target, meaning the target is the thing in question.
           
           My initial step is to analyze the AABBs that define the fixed obstacles. It appears there is a major central vertical wall (`5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`) centered at x=0. Other obstacles are walls, and some smaller ones scattered throughout the scene. The central wall significantly divides the space, and the target's position relative to it is *critical*. The template says the target will be `{target_point}`.
           
           **Handling a Placeholder and Interpreting Constraints**
           
           Here is my initial point of confusion: "Target point: {target_point}". I need to literally *treat* this value as the target coordinate, even though it's a placeholder. I *must* assume the target is either a problematic (e.g., inside an obstacle) or neutral point given that the current `{target_point}` is not a literal numerical coordinate. In a real scenario, this placeholder would be replaced by an actual target coordinate.
           
           The problem specifically says I "never give up", indicating that even if there are difficulties (like the target being within an obstacle), I still need to return positions.
           
           **Addressing the Potential of an Inaccessible Target**
           
           If `{target_point}` were `(0.0, 0.0)` in this scenario, the target would be *inside* the central vertical obstacle. This creates an unresolvable line-of-sight issue (in a standard scenario), which is not possible.
           
           Given that I must deliver positions regardless, if this target point were `(0.0,0.0)`, I'd provide positions close to that spot *outside* the x=0 wall for the robot to avoid a physical collision and at least try for a view.
           
           **Strategy for Candidate Position Generation**
           
           Based on this, my strategy, for the placeholder target, would be as such:
           
           1.  **If the `{target_point}` is *near* the central x=0 wall, I should prioritize finding positions on the same side of that wall as the target.**
           2.  **Otherwise, if the central wall is not an issue, pick locations around the target, *within* the maximum range, *avoiding* all fixed obstacles.**
           3.  **For obstacle avoidance:** I'll calculate distances between candidate positions and the edges of AABBs. It is most important to avoid the larger, fixed obstacles.
           4.  **I will diversify my positions**: To get angles and ensure reasonable distances and viewpoints, I will pick points around the target: Left, right and above or below.
           
           **Candidate Positions (Illustrative with the Assumption)**
           
           Given I interpret the target point as literally `{target_point}` or *maybe* as `(0.0, 0.0)` for a simplified template, the following three representative positions, should be generated. My approach is to take both positions right and left of the central wall:
           
           1.  `(0.1, 0.0)`: Position right next to the central wall. Clear of the wall and other obstacles.
           2.  `(-0.1, 0.0)`: Position left of central wall, on the other side.
           3.  `(1.0, 1.0)`: A position near the target but far enough to avoid most obstacles.
           
           These choices are within the bounds, are reasonably spaced, and, in a theoretical sense, offer a way to get *as close as possible* to the "target" (even though I assume the value for `{target_point}` as a value inside an obstacle).

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Robot Placement with Obstacle Avoidance**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. I'm tasked with positioning a robot to "see" a target point, but there are obstacles. The key challenge is that the feedback I'm getting isn't entirely clear on the nature of these obstacles or the robot's collision characteristics.
           
           First, I need to understand the coordinate system. Initially, I thought I knew the obstacle layout, but the feedback seems to have different indexing or labeling. The crucial element, the "central wall" or dividing barrier, is listed as "0" in the feedback, but it's *actually* obstacle 5 in my original list. Got it. The AABB of this wall is `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`.
           
           Now, the confusing part: previous attempts to place the robot at `(0.1, 0.0)` and `(-0.1, 0.0)` supposedly resulted in a collision with this "central wall," which, according to the feedback, is labeled '0'. *This doesn't make sense*. These points should not collide with the wall if the robot is treated as a point, but something is up. Either there's a misunderstanding or mislabeling in the feedback, *or* the robot has some size (radius). I'm guessing the robot has a small radius because the "feedback system" said those positions collided.
           
           The target point has changed to `(-0.324, 1.916)`. It lies *inside* obstacle 10, which is `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`.  This means *any* robot position will be occluded. With that said, I still need to find a valid position for the robot. 
           
           So, with the robot radius issue, I need to approach this methodically. I am going to expand my obstacle's coordinates and identify valid areas for placement. I'm going to assume the robot has a radius. I am going to put the robot in positions that avoid colliding with these expanded boundaries of the obstacles. I am *sure* of the general areas to be clear, and so I am going to choose *diverse* positions that are within the range.
           
           Here's my chosen positions, with a robot radius of 0.1:
           
           *   `(-1.5, 2.0)`: Safe from all obstacles within a range of 2. Good position.
           *   `(-1.0, 1.0)`: Safe from all obstacles within a range of 2. Good position.
           *   `(0.5, 1.0)`: Safe from all obstacles within a range of 2. Good position.
           
           The main idea: The target is obscured, so all I need to do is generate valid locations.

(Thoughts: **Feedback Analysis and Position Proposals**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. The user's feedback, particularly the confusion around target points and the relationship between proposed positions and failure messages, has highlighted some ambiguities. I need to be *very* precise here.
           
           First, the feedback indicates a target point of `(-0.324, 1.916)`.  The initial assumption of `(0.0, 0.0)` was incorrect.  The positions `(0.1, 0.0)` and `(-0.1, 0.0)` for the target point `(-0.324, 1.916)` collided with obstacle 5. I also know that there is obstacle 10 and obstacle 22 which is very close to the target location, where obstacle 22 contains the target itself, so the line of sight problem might happen here.
           
           The user is requesting the *same* target point `(-0.324, 1.916)` again. I should proceed, but taking into consideration previous feedback.
           I'll reuse the potentially valid position `(1.0, 1.0)` since no negative feedback was given, also considering the obstacle location around the target. Then, I am going to try two other new positions.
           These new positions must:
           1.  **Avoid Obstacle 5 (Central Wall):** The robot base center must be `|x| > 0.15`.
           2.  **Avoid Obstacle 10 and 22:** The robot base center must be outside the expanded regions.
           3.  **Distance Constraint:** Within 2 units of `T`.
           4.  **Diversity:** Spread around the area, outside the center.
           
           Based on this:
           
           1.  **`(-1.9, 1.5)`:** This location is valid, after checking against all obstacles, and is at a distance of approximately 1.63 units from the target. It is located to the left.
           2.  **`(1.0, 0.5)`:** This location is valid, after checking against all obstacles, and is at a distance of approximately 1.938 units from the target. It is located to the right.
           3.  **`(1.0, 1.0)`:** This location is valid, after checking against all obstacles, and is at a distance of approximately 1.61 units from the target.
           All these are now valid to be passed back to the user to make a decision.
