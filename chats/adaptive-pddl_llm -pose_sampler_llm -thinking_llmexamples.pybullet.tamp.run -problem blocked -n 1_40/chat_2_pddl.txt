(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           My task is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined means ensuring a specific object, let's call it `?green`, is both "on" a particular object (`v18`) and has a certain "type" (`v17`).
           
           I've examined the initial state and identified potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. Both currently have the required `type` predicate assigned. Looking at the "on" predicate, I recognize it requires two further facts: an object to be supported by, and an atpose fact. Examining the given facts, I can identify that both `v8` and `v12` are supported by an object and both are in an initial position at a given atpose fact, respectively: `v9` and `v13`. 
           
           To achieve the "on" requirement for `v8` and `v12`, I needed to achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           I noticed that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are true already. 
           Therefore, I need to make `atpose(v8, #o2)` true or `atpose(v12, #o2)` true.
           
           I have decided to create a plan that targets the object `v8`. To achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`, I recognize that I must move `v8` from its current pose `v9` to the target pose `#o2` on top of `v18`. This involves standard pick and place movements, which I am familiar with.
           
           I checked the kinematics, current state of the objects, and the available actions and constraints (unsafe facts), I determined the following plan is valid:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** I need to reposition the base of my robot to allow for picking `v8`. The initial base configuration is v3. To accomplish this, I must employ a `move_base` action, and bring the base to #o3.
           2.  **Pick:** With the base in the right spot, I'll execute the `pick` action to grasp `v8` from its current position `v9`.
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll execute the `place` action to correctly put `v8` on top of `v18` in pose `#o2`.
           
           Once this plan is executed, `v8` will be "on" `v18`, its correct "type" predicate already met, and `new-axiom@0()` will be satisfied.
