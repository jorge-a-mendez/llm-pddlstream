           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable: No Plan Possible**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, that means finding an object, let's call it `?green`, that's both "on" something (`v18`) and has a certain "type" (`v17`). To be "on," the object needs to be supported at a certain pose.  I've got a list of facts, and two objects, `v12` and `v8`, seem promising because they match the "type" criteria.
           
           Now, here's where it gets tricky.  Both `v12` and `v8` are *already* supported at specific poses, but not the right pose (which needs to be `v18`).  However, the facts tell me that both are supported at the desired pose, `#o2`.  So, if I could just *move* either `v12` or `v8` to that pose, the goal is met.
           
           The problem? The only action I'm allowed to use is "move_base," which just moves the robot's base. It's not the right kind of action to modify the pose of an object. The required action to change the pose, the `pick` and `place` actions, are *not* permitted.
           
           Given the constraints, it's impossible to manipulate the objects to satisfy the "on" condition and therefore meet the goal.  I've exhaustively analyzed the initial state and the permissible actions, and I'm convinced the goal is fundamentally unreachable under these conditions.
