(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to tackle this.  The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to finding an object, let's call it `?green`, that's both `on` something and has a specific `type` (v17).
           
           1.  **Analyze the Situation:** I started by checking the initial state. There are two objects of `type v17` that I can work with: `v12` and `v8`. The `on` predicate is tricky, but I can break it down. An object is `on` something if it's `supported` by that thing and `atpose` in the right location.  Looking at the current state, `v12` is on `v14`, `v15` is on `v11`, and `v8` is also on `v11`.
           
           2.  **Strategic Object Selection:** My target is `v18`. From the initial state, I see that I can make either `v8` or `v12` supported by `v18` but I want to use the object whose type will make this statement true.
           
           3.  **The Path to `v8` on `v18`:**  I decided to go for `v8` because it's *already* of the correct `type` (`v17`), which gets me closer to my goal. The key here is to find a way to make the state of `on(v8, v18)` true. My plan:
               *   **Pick `v8` up:** It's currently at pose `v9`. I'll need to grab it.
               *   **Move `v8`:**  Then I need to carefully place `v8` at the position `#p0` on `v18`.
           
           4.  **Action Breakdown:**  Now for the granular details of the plan:
               *   **Move the Base First:** The initial state's base configuration is at `v3` and the picking pose is at `#q0`. So, I need the action `(move_base v3 #q0 #t2)`. I have to move the base because `pick` needs `atbconf(#q0)` to be true, and right now the robot is not in that configuration. The preconditions for move base check out: I have `basemotion(v3, #t2, #q0)` and `atbconf(v3)` is true to start.
               *   **Pick `v8`:** Once the base is at `#q0`, I can pick `v8`. The action is `(pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0)`.  The preconditions are all met, including `kin(v4, v8, v9, #g0, #q0, #t0)` and that the robot is currently empty. I can assume the action is safe and it will transition the plan into a new state.
               *   **Move Base Again:** To make sure `place` works, I need the base to be at the correct placement pose. My next action is `(move_base #q0 #q1 #t4)`. Preconditions include that the base has a transition plan, is at `#q0` and that the robot can move. I should be able to make this transition after picking `v8`.
               *   **Place `v8` on `v18`:**  Finally, I will use `(place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t1)` to put `v8` on `v18`. All of the preconditions are met here as well. I need this to be on the proper `atbconf` so that I can `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           5.  **Achieving the Goal:** After placing `v8`, I'll have the `atpose` fact I need and the `supported` relation I already have. This is when both parts of the rule, `on(v8, v18)` are true. Since the initial state provides the predicate `type(v8, v17)`, this means `new-axiom@0()` is true and I've solved the problem.
           
           This plan uses the allowed actions, and the robot can complete each of them safely and achieve the goals.
