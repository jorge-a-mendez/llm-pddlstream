(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface defined by the AABB `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  A placement is characterized by the surface index, rotation angle `theta`, and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center.  The term "stable" usually implies that the *entire* object, not just its AABB, stays within the surface. The object is a square.  So, I need to consider how the rotation `theta` affects the object's global AABB.
           
           **Rotation and Bounding Box Analysis**
           
           The object's dimensions (0.07 x 0.07) are the extents of its local (axis-aligned) AABB. When rotated, this local AABB results in a larger global AABB. Since it's a square, its global AABB dimensions will change based on `theta`. Let's calculate the global AABB's dimensions.
           
           For a rotation `theta`, the global AABB dimensions are:
           `global_size_x = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           `global_size_y = 0.07 * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))`
           
           The maximum extent will be at `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), with a size of `0.07 * sqrt(2) ≈ 0.09899`. To be conservative, I need to use this maximum size when determining valid placement ranges.  The effective half-extent of the object will be `0.09899 / 2 ≈ 0.049495`. If the full rotation range is needed, the minimal AABB (0.07 x 0.07) will be within this conservative placement space.
           
           **Surface Dimensions and Placement Constraints**
           
           The surface is defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. This surface is a rectangle that spans 0.6 units in both the x and y directions.
           
           My goal is to find stable placements, so the rotated AABB needs to remain within the surface. Thus, the center (x, y) must satisfy these constraints:
           
           *   `4.2 + 0.0495 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.0495`
           *   `-0.6 + 0.0495 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.0495`
           
           This gives me the conservative bounds for x and y placement:
           `4.249495 <= x <= 4.750505`
           `-0.550505 <= y <= -0.049495`
           
           **Placement Strategy and Generation**
           
           I will now generate the 50 placements as required.
           
           The placement strategy is to:
           
           1.  Use the conservative (rotated) half extent when calculating the bounds for `x` and `y`.
           2.  Set `surf_idx=0` (one surface).
           3.  Vary `theta`. I will use 0.0 and pi/4.
           4.  Create a grid to cover the region defined by my calculated x and y ranges.
           
           I will create a 5x5 grid (25 points).
           Then for each grid point, I'll take a pair `(0.0, pi/4)`.
           This gives me the desired 50 total placements.
           
           The x and y center coordinates will be:
           
           `x_vals`:
           `[4.2494975, 4.37474875, 4.5, 4.62525125, 4.7505025]`
           
           `y_vals`:
           `[-0.5505025, -0.42525125, -0.3, -0.17474875, -0.0494975]`
           
           Using these coordinates, here is the structure of the final placements:
           
           for y in y_vals:
              for x in x_vals:
                 (surf_idx=0, theta=0, x, y)
                 (surf_idx=0, theta=pi/4, x, y)
