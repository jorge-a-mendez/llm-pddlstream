           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan: Analyzing the Rovers Domain Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to satisfying a conjunction of several predicates: achieving four `receivedimage` predicates for different objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20), and ensuring I receive analyses for a "stone" and a "soil".  My initial assessment is that I need to determine a plan.
           
           I see that the rovers are at the starting configuration with their stores free, and each has a camera (v10) onboard. I will use rover v12 to handle the imaging tasks, with its configuration at location v13, and rover v14 will be at configuration v15.  
           
           Achieving `receivedimage` requires the `send_image` action, which in turn needs `haveimage`. `haveimage` can be obtained by using the `take_image` action. The pre-conditions involve `imagevisible` and `atconf`. The available `imagevisible` predicates provide the location for the camera.
           
           The immediate problem is that the given action instances are extremely limited. I only have access to actions involving "move" and "drop_rock". However, the only available "move" actions don't actually move the rover (the destination is the same as the start), and the "drop_rock" action isn't applicable because the stores are initially free.
           
           This means that achieving any objective that requires an action like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` is impossible. Those action instances are not in the list of valid actions.
           
           Since the goal relies upon achieving  `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` and those can't be achieved with the given actions. I've concluded the goal is unachievable.
