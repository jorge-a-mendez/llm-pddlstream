           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           I've carefully analyzed the problem and the available actions, and I've concluded that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. Here's my breakdown:
           
           1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The goal requires achieving several sub-goals: `receivedimage` for two objectives, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock and soil sample. These require specific actions: take and send images, and sample and send analysis.
           
           2.  **Precondition Bottleneck: `atconf`:** The critical observation is that all actions leading to the goal (image and analysis related) have a *crucial* precondition: `atconf(?v, ?q)`. This predicate requires the rover to be *at a specific configuration* (`?q`) for the action to succeed.  For instance:
               *   Image-taking and calibrating: `atconf(v14, #o3)`
               *   Image-sending and analysis-sending: `atconf(v14, #o0)`
               *   Rock-sampling: `atconf(v14, #o5)`
           
           3.  **Limited Actions:** The only *available* actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.  The `move` actions are simple self-loops:  `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`.  These do NOT change the configuration of the rovers (`v12` or `v14`).  They don't alter the `atconf` values.  They keep them at their initial configuration.
           
           4.  **Initial State vs. Action Requirements:** The initial state only provides `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  Since there are no actions to move `v12` or `v14` to the required configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`), I can never meet the preconditions for the image and analysis actions. No available move action actually changes the `atconf` predicate to a different configuration.
           
           5.  **Unachievable Sub-Goals:** Because of the missing `atconf` transitions,  `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` remain unachievable.
           
           6.  **Conclusion:** Because the goal depends entirely on the unachievable sub-goals, and there is no way to reach the needed rover configurations using the permitted actions, the overall goal is unattainable.  The plan cannot be made.
