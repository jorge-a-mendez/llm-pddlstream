           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Right, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but it's immediately clear that several conditions present a significant hurdle. My primary concern centers on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates and their dependence on the `atconf` predicate in the `rovers` domain.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal is a conjunction of many atomic facts, but the tricky ones are the `receivedimage` predicates. To get a rover to receive an image, the rover needs to take an image first, and then send it. To take and send images, a rover needs to be in a specific configuration, which is specified using the `atconf` predicate.
           
           The initial state defines `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`, meaning the rovers are locked into configurations v13 and v15. But to *take* images or *send* images or *sample* analysis, the rovers need to be in different configurations (#o0, #o3, #o5).
           
           The problem, as I see it, is the absence of any *move* actions to change the rovers' configuration. The only move actions available are self-loops—meaning I can't move to the right configurations where imaging, communication, and sampling are possible.
           
           This lack of movement leaves me stymied. To take and send images, I need the rovers to change their configurations. But they can't. The same problem applies to analysis, given the rovers' fixed configuration.
           
           The preconditions of both `take_image` and `sample_rock` actions require `atconf`, and the initial state, combined with the lack of movement capabilities, dooms me. The current situation leads to a logical inconsistency. The rovers are geographically stuck. 
           
           I think the best conclusion is that this goal, in the domain as presented, is definitively unreachable. There's no way to reach the required states without any ability to move.
