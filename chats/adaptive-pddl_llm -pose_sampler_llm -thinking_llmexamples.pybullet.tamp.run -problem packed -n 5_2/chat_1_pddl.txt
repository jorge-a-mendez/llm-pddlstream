           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Action Instance Restrictions**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to arrange objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 atop object v20.  This necessitates positioning each object at pose #o2 on v20, a state governed by the 'on' predicate, which requires both 'supported' and 'atpose' to be true. Analysis of the initial state reveals each target object is at a different initial pose on v11. The core of the problem then is to move these objects from their current poses to #o2. The actions available are move_base, pick, place, clean, and cook, where 'clean' and 'cook' are deemed irrelevant.
           
           The pivotal action here must be 'pick' and 'place'. However, a critical constraint is imposed: only action instances explicitly provided in a list of "valid action instances" are permissible. The sole valid instance provided is (move_base v3 v3 #o0), which effectively moves the robot's base without significantly changing the state concerning the positions of the objects.  Therefore, I analyze if I can create pick and place instances, however, due to the explicit constraint and the definition of a action instance as fully grounded,  I cannot.
           
           Consequently, without the ability to use the 'pick' and 'place' actions, the goal is inherently unattainable. The state of the objects can't be changed because the problem restricts the use of 'pick' and 'place' to instances listed and there are none. The initial locations of the objects remain unchanged, and thus, the required arrangement cannot be achieved. The 'move_base' action isn't helpful in fulfilling the goal.
