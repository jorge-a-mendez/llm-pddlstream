           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.182, 0.213), (0.253, 0.284)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.261, -0.502), (-0.163, -0.403)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.199, 0.087), (0.275, 0.162)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.218, 0.248, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.712, 0.702).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.212, -0.452, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.433, 0.901).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.237, 0.125, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.68, 0.734).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Block Stacking Plan**
           
           My goal is to figure out a sequence of actions that will get three blocks (v8, v12, and v14) onto a table (v16).  I know they all have to end up *on* the table (v16), which means their final poses will be defined by their position on that table. The arm (v4) will be doing all the heavy lifting, and it's starting with an empty hand and base at a given configuration (v3).  The objects are currently sitting on the table, v11.
           
           I've got a clear picture of the starting state: the arm's position, the objects' initial poses, and their relationship to each other. The robot can hold one object at a time. The 'kin' (kinematics) predicates are my tools to analyze the robot's movements, and available pick and place actions with the 'kin' predicates.
           
           The available actions are pick and place. So, I will create plan where the robot will pick each object from its initial location and place them one-by-one on v16. I can use grasp( #o1) for all of them.
           
           Now I need to address the continuous parameters. I know `#o2` is a pose I need to define.  I've got the grasps (#o1),  the initial arm trajectory, and the base configuration which must all line up. My bconf has to cover the start and end of all pick/place actions, and my trajectory, atraj, needs to move from pick to place. My bconf will have to be at v3, where the robot base is at the start and the location of bconf has to be a safe one for picking and placing to avoid collision. Then I also have `#o0` which is a btraj, a base trajectory.
           
           The cost is 1 for picking and placing, while 'move_base' has cost based on distance. The distance cost for v3 and to the pick/place locations will be based on the given value, distance(v3, #o3).
           
           Now I'm focusing on defining `#o2` â€” the final location for the blocks on the table, and how `#o3` is set up such that I have a low travel distance. I know I have to avoid collisions. I'll need to calculate a good configuration `#o2`. I need to make sure the pose I define for each block is stable and collision-free with respect to the objects themselves and the surrounding environment, i.e., I can't place the object in the air or within other objects. I'll position them in a row, with gaps. I think placing them in a row on the tabletop in a way that minimizes the "move_base" action will minimize cost.
           
           The actual robot base position doesn't directly influence the final *state* of the objects, it only governs the *actions*. So, I'll need to start with v3 and move, and then go to the pick locations for the objects.
           
           The overall sequence will be: 1) Move base 2) Pick Object 3) Place Object 4) Move base 5) Pick Object and 6) Place Object. Finally I must consider the costs of move_base.
           The prompt wants me to specify the continuous values for the poses, which is `#o2`, to execute the actions with `pose(obj, #<name>)` in the initial state. Since it also states 'continuous parameter is that one *pose*'. So I must calculate a valid placement for the objects with their starting `#o2` poses on the table.
           I will place v14 centered at the negative value, then v12 at the center, then v8 at the positive x location. Their z-coordinate should be all the same. So that all of them are at height 0.781 from the surface of `v16`. Since I calculated how to safely place them and the dimensions of them, with a bit of small space between each.
           The `kin` predicate does have a configuration, which I set, and now all those values are defined.
           Here's the plan.
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 #o3 #o0)
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o
)
