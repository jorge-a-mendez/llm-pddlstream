           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but this looks like a serious challenge given the restrictions.  The `new-axiom@0()` goal boils down to ensuring several conditions hold true, specifically about being at certain configurations, being free, having received images, and received analyses of specific soil and stone types.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see that the `atconf` and `free` conditions are already satisfied. That's a start. However, I immediately notice the crux of the problem: I need to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions, and those aren't present in the initial state. I need to take pictures of things, send them back, analyze them, and *then* send the analyses.
           
           Now, let's consider the actions I'm allowed to use. It seems my toolkit is incredibly limited. I only have `move` and `drop_rock` actions available. The `move` actions appear to be no-ops since they don't change the robot's configuration at all, and `drop_rock` can be ignored because it requires the robot to be full, and it isn't.
           
           This is a problem. Achieving the `receivedimage` predicates requires a full sequence of actions: `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.  To get the `receivedanalysis` predicates, I need to use `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. None of these actions are available to me.
           
           I checked again:  "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." That's the hard constraint.
           
           Since none of the available actions can lead to `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` and these predicates are not present in the initial state, I conclude that the goal is not achievable with the given action instances. I cannot generate the needed states. I need to explain *why* it's unreachable, not just throw a plan together. I'm sure I haven't missed anything.
