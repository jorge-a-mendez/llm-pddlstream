(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to arrange three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, such that they are all supported by `v16` (i.e., `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`). This translates to getting each of these objects to a specific pose on `v16`.
           
           My analysis of the initial situation reveals that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are graspable and stackable. Currently, they are resting on `v11`, with each object at its own distinct pose. `v10` and `v16` are other potential supporting surfaces. It looks like my move will put everything in a position on top of the `v16`.
           
           I've determined that there's a target pose, denoted as `#o2`, which all three objects need to be in for them to be positioned on `v16`.
           
           The available actions are limited. I can move my base, but the `move_base` instance offered doesn't actually change anything. It just toggles the `canmove()` predicate. The real work is done by `pick` and `place`. These require me to be able to move and to pick or place an object, but they assert `canmove()` at the end of execution.
           
           Here's my strategy: I will pick each object from its initial pose and place it at the target pose `#o2` on `v16`. The robot has two arms: `v4` and `v6`. `v4` is controllable, and it's the one I'll use. Since `move_base` doesn't do much, the assumption is that the `kin` information, which involves base configurations, means the existing base configuration will have to work.
           
           Therefore, the plan should consist of the following sequence:
           
           1.  **Pick v8**: Pick `v8` from its initial pose, where it is supported by the surface `v11` using arm `v4`.
           2.  **Place v8**: Place `v8` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v16`.
           3.  **Pick v12**: Pick `v12` from its initial pose on surface `v11` using arm `v4`.
           4.  **Place v12**: Place `v12` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v16`.
           5.  **Pick v14**: Pick `v14` from its initial pose on surface `v11` using arm `v4`.
           6.  **Place v14**: Place `v14` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v16`.
           
           I am assuming I can use the existing `kin` information directly, and the `unsafe` conditions are not true. If all goes as planned, I'll have all three objects stacked on `v16`. The *continuous parameter*, `#o3`, should refer to my current robot base configuration. I don't need any additional motions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've thoroughly re-examined the problem. The user was correct; my previous plan utilized disallowed actions. My focus now is strictly on the permitted action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           The target state is, as before, that the objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all located *on* `v16`. This requires their `atpose` predicates to match `v16's` supported pose, `#o2`. I need to transform the initial state, where each object has a different pose, `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, to the target state.
           
           However, the permitted `move_base` action *doesn't* alter the `atpose` of objects. It only changes the robot's base configuration and affects the `canmove()` predicate. To move objects, I need `pick` and `place` actions. The core of the problem is that *no instances* of `pick` or `place` are available.
           
           Without `pick` and `place`, I'm completely unable to manipulate the objects. I can't change their `atpose` predicates. Since the initial state doesn't satisfy the goal condition (the objects are *not* initially on `v16`), and I lack the means to change that, the goal is unachievable given the restrictions. The robot simply can't move the objects to the desired poses. I need to explicitly state that the goal cannot be satisfied, and explain this limitation.
