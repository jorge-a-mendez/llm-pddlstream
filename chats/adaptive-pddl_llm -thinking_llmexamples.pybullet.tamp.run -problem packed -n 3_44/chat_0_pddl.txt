           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. My goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  Currently, the initial state tells me they're all resting on `v11`. I can see from the available actions and predicates that I need to manipulate the robot arms to move these objects.  I'm dealing with the predicates like `on`, `atpose`, `supported`, `graspable`, and `handempty`, which are all crucial.  The `on` predicate is particularly relevant as it captures the core of the problem. Also, the robot is initially in base configuration `v3` and has handempty arms v4 and v6.
           
           **Analyzing the Initial State and Goal State**
           
           I've examined the initial state closely. `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are at specific poses, and they're all supported by `v11`.  The key here is that they *can* be placed on `v16` (indicated by `stackable`).  The goal state, in essence, is to change their relationships from `on(..., v11)` to `on(..., v16)`. The continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2` are uninstantiated.
           
           **Formulating the Plan - The Core of the Problem**
           
           To move an object, I'd need to use a standard "pick and place" strategy.  That is, I'd need to first *pick* an object from its current location, and then *place* it on `v16`.  This directly translates to changing the robot's arm configuration, hand state, object pose, and object supported position via available action predicates and parameters.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint - The Missing Actions**
           
           Here's the problem: The only available action instance is `move_base`. But, this action doesn't actually allow me to *pick* or *place* anything. It only allows for simple base reconfiguration, or lack thereof.  This seriously limits what I can do.  If there were `pick` and `place` action instances available, I could develop a detailed plan to get the objects to v16. I can see the parameters for a good pick and place instance. But no pick or place action is provided to me as an instance. The problem doesn't change `atpose` or `supported`.
           
           **Conclusion - The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Since the actions needed to change the spatial relationships between the objects (pick and place) are not available, it's impossible to reach the goal state.  The current plan only allows for moving the robot base; that won't suffice. Therefore, the goal is currently unreachable given the allowed actions.
