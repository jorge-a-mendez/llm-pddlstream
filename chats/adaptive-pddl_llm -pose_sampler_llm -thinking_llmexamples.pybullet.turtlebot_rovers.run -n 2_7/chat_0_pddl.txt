           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inaccessible Goal with Current Actions**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unattainable.  The initial state satisfies a few of the conjunctions, but the key requirements – `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` – cannot be met with the provided action instances.
           
           To break it down: achieving `receivedimage` necessitates using `send_image`, which, in turn, requires actions like `take_image` and `calibrate`. Similarly, `receivedanalysis` calls for `send_analysis` after a `sample_rock`. However, the only available action instances are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions influences the state of image or analysis reception. The `move` actions are also no-ops, since they move rovers from the same configuration to itself, and the `drop_rock` actions require a rock to be full, which the initial state says it isn't.
           
           Furthermore, the structure of `blocked(?y)` suggests a potential problem with line-of-sight based on rays and configurations, however even these are moot given the set of allowed actions. The inability to use essential actions such as `send_image` and `send_analysis` makes the goal unreachable based on the restricted action set. The initial state provides facts about type and rocks, but those facts are moot without the ability to sample and analyze them. It is clear that the goal is unattainable due to the missing operations.
