           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, `type(v8, v17)`, `type(v12, v17)`, and `type(v15, v17)` are true. This means we need to place either `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` on `v18`.
           `v18` is an object with AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           `v11` is an object with AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           `v14` is an object with AABB ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           `v10` is not described with a bounding box, but is used as a surface in some supported predicates.
           
           We have three objects to choose from: `v8`, `v12`, `v15`.
           `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`. `v9` is (4.5, 0.3, 0.8).
           `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`. `v13` is (-4.61, 0.119, 0.801).
           `v15` is at `v16` on `v11`. `v16` is (4.35, 0.3, 0.8).
           
           The robot arm `v4` is at `v5` (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989), and the base `v3` is at (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           We want to place one of `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` on `v18`.
           `v18`'s AABB is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). This means it's located near the x=4.5, y=-0.3.
           `v8` is at `v9` (4.5, 0.3, 0.8), which is close to `v18`. `v15` is at `v16` (4.35, 0.3, 0.8), which is also close. `v12` is far away at (-4.61, 0.119, 0.801). Therefore, picking `v8` or `v15` would involve less base movement.
           
           Let's try to pick `v8` from `v9` and place it on `#o2` on `v18`. The base configuration is `#o3`.
           The previous plan failed due to a collision during the pick of `v8` from `v9`. This suggests that the continuous parameters generated for the pick action were not collision-free. We should try to use a different object, or a different pose if available.
           
           Let's consider `v15`. `v15` is at `v16` on `v11`. `v16` is (4.35, 0.3, 0.8).
           `v18` is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           We need to pick `v15` from `v16` and place it on a pose supported by `v18`. We can use `#o2` for the placement pose.
           
           The robot starts at `v3`=(2.5, 0.0, 0.0). `v15` is at `v16`=(4.35, 0.3, 0.8). The `kin` predicate `kin(v4, v15, v16, #o1, #o3, #o4)` implies that `#o3` is a base configuration that allows `v4` to reach `v15` at `v16`. Similarly, `kin(v4, v15, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` implies `#o3` allows placement at `#o2`. The base motion `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` allows moving between `v3` and `#o3`.
           
           So the plan would be:
           1. Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v15` from `v16` with arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`, using kinematic configuration `#o3` and trajectory `#o4`.
           3. Place `v15` onto `#o2` on `v18` with arm `v4` and grasp `#o1`, using kinematic configuration `#o3` and trajectory `#o4`.
           Since the goal is an axiom, and this axiom is satisfied by `on(v15, v18)` and `type(v15, v17)`, and we know `type(v15, v17)` is true, achieving `on(v15, v18)` will satisfy the goal.
           
           Let's select `#o2` to be a pose for `v15` on `v18`. The AABB of `v18` is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). A suitable pose would be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8). The z-height is 0.8 because that's where the other objects are.

           (#o2 v15 v18): (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because the goal `new-axiom@0()` was not satisfied. The axiom `new-axiom@0()` is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. My previous plan would place `v15` on `v18`. Since `type(v15, v17)` is true in the initial state, placing `v15` on `v18` would satisfy the goal. The error message `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()` indicates that even after the plan, this fact was not true. This suggests that the interpretation of the axiom or how the `on` predicate is evaluated might be incorrect in the system, or there was some unstated issue in the simulated environment.
           
           Let's re-examine the `on` predicate: `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` is true if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           In the initial state, we have `supported(v15, #o2, v10)` and `supported(v15, #o2, v18)`. So if we place `v15` at `#o2`, it would be `on(v15, v18)` because of `supported(v15, #o2, v18)`.
           Given that `type(v15, v17)` is true, the goal `new-axiom@0()` should be satisfied.
           
           Let's consider if there is any other way to interpret `new-axiom@0()`.
           The provided axioms are:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0(?o: object)
             Conjunction
               NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)
               Atom graspable(?culprit)
           
           Axiom new-axiom@1()
             Conjunction
               Atom on(?green, v18)
               Atom type(?green, v17)
           
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom on(?green, v18)
               Atom type(?green, v17)
           ```
           There are two axioms named `new-axiom@0`. One takes an argument `?o` and one takes no arguments. The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which means it refers to the axiom without arguments. My previous reasoning was based on this, and it seems correct.
           
           Perhaps the issue is with the specific continuous parameters. The previous failure `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()` indicates a collision during the trajectory for `v8` pick. We're now trying `v15` pick.
           
           The `basemotion` predicates are:
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`
           `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)`
           `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`
           `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`
           
           We need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3` to execute the pick and place.
           The `kin` predicates:
           `kin(v4, v15, v16, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (for picking v15)
           `kin(v4, v15, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (for placing v15)
           
           The base starts at `v3`. We want to move to `#o3` to perform the pick. The action `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)` satisfies `atbconf(v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`.
           
           The pick action requires: `kin(v4, v15, v16, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atpose(v15, v16)`, `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(#o3)`. All these are true after the `move_base` action (assuming `atbconf(#o3)` after the move).
           The place action requires: `kin(v4, v15, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atgrasp(v4, v15, #o1)`, `atbconf(#o3)`. All these are true after the pick action.
           
           Let's assume the previous failure was a collision for a pick trajectory that was not `v15` related, or that specific set of values for `#o1, #o3, #o4` causes issues. We are providing `#o2` for the placement pose.
           
           Could it be that `v10` is an implicit surface that obstructs `v18`? `v10` is not given an AABB.
           `supported(v15, #o2, v10)` and `supported(v15, #o2, v18)` both refer to `#o2`. The goal requires `on(?green, v18)`.
           The previous failure was "Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()". This is strange, as the logic seems sound. Let's try placing `v8` instead of `v15`. `v8` is also `type(v8, v17)`.
           
           Initial state: `atpose(v8, v9)`
           `v9` is (4.5, 0.3, 0.8).
           `v18` is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Let's try to place `v8` on `v18` at `#o2`. The pose could be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) as before.
