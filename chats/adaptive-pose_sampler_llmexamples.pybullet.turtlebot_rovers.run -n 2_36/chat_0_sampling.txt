User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). The walls are defined by AABBs 1-4. There's a vertical obstacle in the middle of the room (AABB 5). Several other obstacles are scattered throughout the room, including two large ones in the top left and right corners (AABB 8, 7), two smaller ones near the top center (AABB 9, 10), one in the bottom left (AABB 6), and several smaller obstacles (AABBs 11-20).
           
           My strategy is to try positions around the target point, prioritizing locations that appear to be in open areas or less cluttered. I will try to generate positions in a circular pattern around the target point, varying the radius and angle to cover a good range of possibilities. I will also make sure the positions are within the room's boundaries and within the `max_range` of 4 from the target point. I will avoid placing the robot too close to any known obstacles. Since the `max_range` is 4, and the room is 5x5, most points in the room are within range. I will be careful to ensure that no proposed positions fall within any of the listed fixed obstacles. I will also ensure diversity in the generated positions.
