           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Achieving the New Axiom: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal here is to establish the new axiom, `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, specifically `v8`, *on* a specific object, `v18`, and ensuring `v8` is of a specific `type`, `v17`. Since we know `v8` is the only object of `type(v17)`, our focus is achieving `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, we need `v8` to be placed on `v18`. Initially, we can see that `v8` is supported in the initial state. Examining the axioms, we see `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` necessitates the fulfillment of `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. We have `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`, so we only need to have `atpose(v8, #p0)`.
           
           This means the plan must move `v8` from its current pose, `v9`, to the new target pose, `#p0`, on `v18`. A direct placement is impossible. This requires a pick-and-place operation by the robot arm, `v4`.  
           
           The plan necessitates four steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base (v3 -> #q0):**  The robot's base currently is at configuration `v3`. It needs to move to configuration `#q0` to be positioned for the pick action.  There's a trajectory associated with that movement, `#t1`. This step is crucial. The robot moves from current base position `v3` to a new base position `#q0` using a trajectory `#t1`. The base has to move to be able to pick an object with the robot arm. The movement makes sure the base configuration changes from `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(#q0)`.
           
           2.  **Pick v8 from v9:** With the robot at `#q0`, the robot needs to pick up object `v8` currently located at pose `v9`. The relevant action has the preconditions of kinematic configurations, `atpose`, `handempty` and the negative preconditions on collision avoidance, which will have to be assumed to be valid given that they are not present in the initial facts. This also establishes `atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)`, changing current state.
           
           3.  **Move Base (#q0 -> #q1):** After picking, the robot needs to position itself for the placement. This base movement from config `#q0` to a new pose `#q1`. This move is specified with a base motion `#t3`. This makes sure base config switches to `atbconf(#q1)`.
           
           4.  **Place v8 at #p0:** With the robot now at `#q1`, `v8` is placed at the target pose, `#p0`, on `v18`. This requires valid kin configurations. The negative preconditions need to be checked for safety concerns. This operation leads to `atpose(v8, #p0)`. `v8` is then held at pose `#p0` by the robot arm, now on `v18`, with the goal state reached.
           
           We are certain that our actions meet the requirements for achieving the new axiom `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Furthermore, regarding the `pose` parameters (values) mentioned, to provide values for `#p0`, we consider the initial facts provided: `pose(v8, #p0)`, `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`. The supporting relation suggests `v8`'s target placement at a y value of -0.3 and a z value of 0.8 on the target object. The base and the supported object must be at the correct y position. Thus, `#p0` is now associated with the continuous parameter and continuous values.
           
           The plan uses two base movement actions to position the robot and make the goal achievable. The move actions are a necessary part of the task. They add to the actions required to achieve the goal but are necessary for successful pick and place tasks. With the movements, we ensure `v8` is at the correct configuration, leading to the fulfillment of the new axiom and ensuring that the plan functions correctly.
