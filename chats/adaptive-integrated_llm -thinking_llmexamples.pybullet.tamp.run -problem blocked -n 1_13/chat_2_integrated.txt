           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.646, -0.176, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.802, 0.597).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.689, -0.22), (-4.602, -0.132)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Planning Process: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           My goal is to achieve the new axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` onto `v18`. I know that both `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. The crucial factor is their current location: `v8` is currently at pose `v9`, and `v12` is at `v13`.  `v18` is an AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Essentially, my objective is to pick one of these objects and set it on `v18`.
           
           Examining the available actions, I have `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. To place an object on `v18`, it needs to satisfy the axiom `on(?o, ?r)`. This requires the object to be `supported` by `v18` and be `atpose` on `v18`. The system gives that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. That means I can place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18` at `#o2`.
           
           Considering the positions, placing `v8` is a better solution. `v8` is currently at a pose close to the target `v18`, meaning the base robot movement will be shorter and lower cost.  `v12` is far away and requires a longer base motion.
           
           My plan unfolds as follows:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  The robot needs to be at the correct base configuration to pick and place. Since I'm starting at `v3` and the pick and place actions use base config `#o3`,  I must first execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This brings the robot within reach.
           
           2.  **Pick v8:** The action `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` will be performed.  The necessary precondition `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is met,  as is `atpose(v8, v9)` (since `v8` starts at that position). The robot's hand is empty (satisfied), and the base config is correct at `#o3`.  Furthermore, since unsafe motions were not mentioned, I can assume unsafe conditions are not present.  The effect will be that the robot has grasped `v8`, will not be at the initial grasp position, and the robot's hand is no longer empty.
           
           3.  **Place v8:** The action will be `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.  `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is satisfied, `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` is satisfied from the previous pick action.  The base config is still `#o3`, and `unsafepose`, `unsafeapproach`, and `unsafeatraj` predicates can be assumed to be false.  The effect is that `v8` will be at `#o2`. The robot's hand will be empty, and the robot will be able to move (canmove()).
           
           After these steps, `v8` will be `atpose` on `#o2`, and since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true,  `on(v8, v18)` is achieved.  The value of pose `#o2` should be a configuration such that `v8` is supported by `v18`.  Given the initial state,  the continuous value for `#o2` is x=4.5, y=-0.3, z=0.8.
           
           Therefore, the complete solution, assuming no unexpected constraints, is: `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`, then `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, and lastly, `(place v4 v8 (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, 1) #o1 #o3 #o4)`. The overall cost will be the movement from `v3` to the configuration of `#o3` and plus the cost of both pick and place.
