User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v15: object
           v16: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.646, -0.176, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.802, 0.597).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.689, -0.22), (-4.602, -0.132)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Based on the explicit constraint, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," and given the list `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, the goal of `new-axiom@0()` (achieving `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`) is *unreachable*.  This is because achieving the goal requires moving objects, which necessitates `pick` and `place` actions. However, the provided action list lacks any `pick` or `place` instances, explicitly restricting the actions I can employ to the no-op base movement `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           My analysis began by defining the goal and exploring potential solutions. I determined that to satisfy the requirements, an object (either `v12` or `v8`) would need to be moved to `v18`. This requires a `pick` action to grasp the object and a `place` action to place the object on `v18`. Initially, I checked to see if any `on` predicates were true initially; they were not.
           
           I identified that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` exists, but `atpose(v12, #o2)` does not. To have the object at the target location, the action `place` had to be executed, but the explicit lack of `place` action instances is the roadblock.
           
           I then considered the preconditions for `pick` and `place` (using the given `kin` facts), particularly the requirement of having the robot's base configuration (`atbconf(#o3)`) be correct.  The problem provides a `move_base` action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the base from `v3` to `v3`. This, in essence, is a no-op, meaning it doesn't solve any of the state changes required, specifically to bring about the state `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           The only possible exception would be if `#o3` could be interpreted as the current base configuration `v3`. However, the problem statement states, "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose such that, given the geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement for the object on a surface for which `supported(obj, #<name> surf)` is in the initial state."  While this would apply to the `pose(#o2)` for placement, it does not provide any values for the `bconf(#o3)`.
           
           Therefore, the stated constraint, and lack of `pick` and `place` instances, dictates the goal is unachievable, as the only available action does not support any object manipulation.
