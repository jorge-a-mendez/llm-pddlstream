User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.646, -0.176, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.802, 0.597).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.689, -0.22), (-4.602, -0.132)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom canmove()
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)

           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking: the goal is to get an object of a specific type (`v17`) onto a particular surface (`v18`).  I've identified the relevant objects: `v12` and `v8` are both of type `v17`. To achieve the goal, I need either `v12` or `v8` to be "on" `v18`. This "on" condition relies on two things: something being *supported* by `v18` and being *at* a particular pose.
           
           I see that both `v12` and `v8` are capable of being supported by `v18` at a pose identified as `#o2`.  However, neither is *currently* at `#o2`.  `v12` is at `v13`, and `v8` is at `v9`.  The problem is the *only* action I'm allowed to use is a `move_base` action that doesn't actually *move* the robot's base.  It's effectively a no-op!
           
           Since I can't pick up, place, or otherwise change the pose of the objects, I can't move either `v12` or `v8` to `#o2`. Given the initial state and the restricted actions, there's no way to satisfy the "on" condition and, therefore, no way to reach the goal. The goal is simply unachievable.
