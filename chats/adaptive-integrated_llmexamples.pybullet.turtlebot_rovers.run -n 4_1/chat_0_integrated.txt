           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem states that the goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex set of conditions including `receivedimage` for four objectives and `receivedanalysis` for two specific rock types (stone and soil).
           
           Looking at the available action instances, there are only `move` and `drop_rock` actions.
           The `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions move rover `v12` from `v13` to `v13` and rover `v14` from `v15` to `v15`, respectively. In essence, these are no-op movements as the start and end configurations are the same.
           The `drop_rock` actions are `(drop_rock v12 v16)` and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`. These actions require the rover to have a full store (`full(v, s)`) to drop a rock. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, meaning the stores are empty. Therefore, these `drop_rock` actions cannot be executed.
           
           None of the available actions can directly achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. These predicates are typically achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. However, these actions are not provided in the list of allowed action instances.
           
           Given that only `move` (no-op) and `drop_rock` (precondition not met) actions are available, and the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` which are only achievable through `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions (which are not provided), the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move v12 v13 #o2 v13)
           (move v14 v15 #o2 v15)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The initial assessment remains the same: the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. The available action instances are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.
           
           As explained previously:
           1. The `move` actions are effectively no-operations as they move the rover to its current configuration. They do not change any state relevant to achieving the goal.
           2. The `drop_rock` actions have a precondition `full(?v, ?s)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true, meaning the stores are empty. Therefore, the `drop_rock` actions cannot be executed as their precondition is not met.
           
           Crucially, the actions required to achieve the goal (i.e., `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are *not* in the provided list of allowed action instances. Without these actions, it is impossible to generate images, analyze rocks, or send any data back to the lander, which are all necessary to satisfy the conditions embedded in `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions.
