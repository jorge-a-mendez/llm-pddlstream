           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to having object `v12` *on* `v18` and ensuring `type(v12, v17)` holds true.  Fortunately, we already have `type(v12, v17)` in the initial state.  Therefore, all that remains to be done is to establish `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Now, the `on` axiom tells me that to achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I need two things:  `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` for some pose `?p`.  Digging into the initial state, I can see that we have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` already.  There's also `pose(v12, #o2)` which confirms that #o2 is the correct pose for that specific object, and we have `stackable(v12, v18)`. The initial state also has `atpose(v12, v13)`, but the target is `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           This tells me that object `v12` is *currently* at pose `v13`, but we need it at `#o2` supported by `v18`.  Given the available actions, the solution is obvious: *move* `v12` from its current pose `v13` to its desired pose `#o2`.  We need to use a `pick` and a `place` action.
           
           The plan will be:  First, *pick* `v12` from `v13`, and then *place* `v12` at `#o2`.  I've checked the preconditions for both `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` and `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The robot arm is represented by `v4`, `#o1` is the grasp, `#o3` is the base configuration, and `#o4` is the trajectory. The base configuration seems to remain constant so there is no need for `move_base`. Given the initial state and the absence of any contradicting facts, I can safely assume that the negative preconditions (e.g., `~unsafeapproach`, `~unsafepose`) are all true for the given object locations and arm configuration.
           
           After the `pick` action, the arm will hold `v12`, and `v12` will no longer be at `v13`. The base configuration remains correct. Finally, `place` will move `v12` to `#o2`, fulfilling the goal's requirement of `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Since we know that `v12` is supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`, the goal `on(v12, v18)` is also fulfilled.
           
           So, the definitive plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` is:
           
           1.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           2.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           This sequence will ensure that the object has the correct support and that the specific object is the correct type. Thus, this constitutes a complete and sound plan to reach the goal.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-examining the Plan and the Contradictory Error**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: the planner's telling me "Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!" after the `pick` action, but that *makes no sense* based on the PDDL I have.  I've re-read the `pick` action definition, and it *doesn't* negate `atbconf(#o3)`. My initial state is: `atbconf(#o3)` and I should have `atbconf(#o3)` after the `pick` action because the `pick` action has `atbconf` as a precondition, so `atbconf` *should* be true after the action.
           
           The crucial issue is the `place` action requires `atbconf(#o3)`. The `move_base` action *could* affect `atbconf`, but it also sets `canmove()` to false. And `canmove()` is required for *both* `pick` and `place`. So if I were to somehow use `move_base`, it would break the chain of actions required to solve the task.
           
           I've carefully checked all the action instances. The preconditions are met. All the *assumptions* seem to hold, too.
           
           The PDDL rules say the only way `atbconf(#o3)` could become false is through `move_base`. But I can't use `move_base` because it messes up the `canmove()` condition. So I'm looking at a *logical contradiction*. I can't satisfy this precondition in any way if I assume the PDDL rules are correct and the initial state holds.
           
           Since `pick` *should not* negate `atbconf(#o3)` and because the rules for the `pick` and `place` seem clear, the error message means the goal *must* be unreachable given the provided PDDL domain and initial state.  If the checker is right, the initial state *could be incorrect*, a fact could be implicit or an axiom has not been defined.
           
           Thus, the most logical response here is to state that the problem is unreachable.
