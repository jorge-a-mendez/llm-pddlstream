           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is a 0.07 x 0.07 square, and the surface is defined as ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object is fully within the surface bounds, doesn't collide with obstacles, and doesn't collide with previously placed objects (none yet).  Since the object is square, its bounding box size is fixed regardless of rotation.  I calculate the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) within the surface.  The valid x-range is from 4.235 to 4.765, and the valid y-range is from -0.565 to -0.035.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I plan to vary the x and y coordinates and the object's rotation (theta). I create a 10 x 5 grid of x and y values, giving me 50 different (x, y) positions. To further diversify the set and fulfill the prompt's request for "diversity", I also vary the rotation, using 5 different angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, and pi. I iterate through the x and y values for the 50 spots, assigning each of the 5 theta values to 10 of the spots.
