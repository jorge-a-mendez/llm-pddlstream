           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Multiple "On" Goals**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the following: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, these objects are on `v11` at various poses. The plan requires me to move each object to the target object, `v16`.
           
           To achieve this, I've broken down each goal into two conditions: `supported(object, pose, v16)` and `atpose(object, pose)`.  The initial state provides crucial information. The desired state has `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`. Also, based on `pose` facts, for all objects, I need to place them at `#o2`.
           
           The robot's arm `v4` and `v6` are available, however, only the arm `v4` is listed in the `kin` facts, which pertain to the feasibility of picking and placing the objects. The base configuration is initially `v3` and `canmove()` is initially true, and the arm is handempty.
           
           The strategy involves the following steps for each object: pick up the object from its current location, and place it at the designated `pose` on `v16`.
           
           Focusing on `v8`, I start with the current state where it's at `v9` and its goal to be `on(v8, v16)`. The action instances available are pick and place actions.  Before any `pick` or `place` action, the robot needs to move its base from its initial location `v3` to the base configuration `#o3` required by all `kin` actions. I therefore will move the base first to `#o3`.
           
           Action sequence:
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#o3`
           2.  Pick v8 from its position on v11
           3.  Place v8 onto v16 at `#o2`
           4.  Pick v12 from its position on v11
           5.  Place v12 onto v16 at `#o2`
           6.  Pick v14 from its position on v11
           7.  Place v14 onto v16 at `#o2`
           
           By performing these steps the robot will achieve the goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. All object are in the proper position and stacked correctly on `v16`.
