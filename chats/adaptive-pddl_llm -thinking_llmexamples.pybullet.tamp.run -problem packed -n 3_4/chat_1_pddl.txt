           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all onto `v16`.  Standard object manipulation problem.  The initial state shows these objects are currently on `v11`.  My immediate thought is, "I need to pick each object up from `v11` and place it on `v16`." Straightforward.
           
           Now, let's look at the toolbox.  I've got the usual `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` actions at my disposal, plus some cleaning and cooking actions that are irrelevant here. Ah, but wait.  The available action instances...  There's only one: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is crucial.  The documentation explicitly states that only actions *listed* can be used.  Meaning, I *can't* use `pick` or `place`!
           
           This throws a wrench in the whole plan.  I'm trying to get `on(vX, v16)` to be true, but that requires moving the objects. And I'm explicitly *not* allowed to move them.
           
           The initial state facts confirm the starting positions:  `v12`, `v8`, and `v14` are all sitting on `v11`.  The goal is to move them to `v16`.  To do this, I'd need to leverage the information about support - the `supported` relation - but without the ability to physically manipulate the objects, I'm stuck.
           
           The only action I can use is `move_base v3 v3`. Essentially, I can't do anything to change the scene. I can confirm this by re-examining the relevant facts. To achieve `on(vX, v16)`, I must place the object on `v16` and make sure it is supported.  I simply can't do that.
           
           Thus, based on the very clear constraint on allowed action instances, this goal is *unreachable*.  I've got a classic "locked-in" initial state.  No pick, no place... no progress.  The planning problem is essentially unsolvable. I am certain of this.
