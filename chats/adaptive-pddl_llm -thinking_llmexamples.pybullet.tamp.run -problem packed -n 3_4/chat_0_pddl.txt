           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Problem of Constraints**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to devise a plan to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  In essence, I need to get v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. However, a quick analysis of the initial state reveals a fundamental problem. All three objects are currently situated on v11, supported by it.
           
           My first thought was to examine the available actions.  The only valid action instance I'm given is `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)`. This action manipulates the robot's base but doesn't interact with any of the objects directly or change their positioning related to "on" predicate.
           
           Given my expertise, I immediately recognize the actions required to achieve the goal: *pick* and *place*.  I would need to *pick* up v8, v12, and v14 from v11 and *place* them on v16.  However, these actions are NOT present in the allowed list.
           
           I re-read the problem statement, double-checking the constraints.  The crucial sentence stands out: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  The implication is unmistakable.  Since I'm restricted to `move_base`, and it doesn't modify the `on` predicate, the goal is inherently unreachable. I have verified the initial state and goal state predicates, and the limited actions available confirm the impasse.
           
           Thus, based on the limited action set and the specified goal, the plan is impossible to generate.
