(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, the goal is to get object `?green` to be both `on v18` and of `type v17`.  Thinking through this, I can see that we have `type(v12, v17)` right from the start. So, really, the only challenge is getting `v12` onto `v18`.  Luckily,  `stackable(v12, v18)` is also in the initial state, meaning this is feasible.
           
           To be `on v18`, the object needs to be both *supported* (by `v18` in this case) and *at a pose*. We have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, indicating we can put v12 on v18 *at* pose #o2.
           
           Since we currently know `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `v12` is stackable, the key now is to move `v12` to `#o2`. This requires the following actions, based on preconditions/effects for the actions:
           
           1.  **Move the base configuration**: Our current base configuration (`v3`) needs to be adjusted to enable picking and placing `v12`. I'll use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to move the base from `v3` to a different configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick v12**: Since we have handempty and kin information, I'll need to move my arm to perform `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` and pick it from the `v13` pose it's at currently.
           3.  **Place v12**: Finally, I'll `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` and place it at pose `#o2` on top of `v18`.
           
           Once this sequence is complete, we'll have `atpose(v12, #o2)`, which combined with the `supported` relation, fulfills the `on` requirement of the goal.  We know that the `type` requirement is already satisfied. This three-step plan should be sufficient to satisfy the original goal.  I've double-checked the action preconditions, and everything looks good with respect to `canmove()` as well.  The intermediate values like `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, and `#o4` appear to be well-formed continuous parameters for the actions, specifically the robot’s base, grasp position, pose position, base configuration, and trajectory.  Excellent.
