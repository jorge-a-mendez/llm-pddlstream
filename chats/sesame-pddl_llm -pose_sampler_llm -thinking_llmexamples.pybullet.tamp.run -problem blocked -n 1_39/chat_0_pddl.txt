(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a single surface (Surface 0: dimensions 4.2 to 4.8 in x, -0.6 to 0.0 in y).  "Stable" here means the object, *after* rotation, must fit entirely within the surface's boundaries. Collisions with other objects and obstacles aren't an issue *right now*.
           
           First, I figured out the effective size of the object as it rotates. Because it's a square, its "effective" bounding box changes with the rotation.  The maximum effective size (when rotated 45 degrees or multiples) is about 0.07 * sqrt(2), or roughly 0.099. The minimum is just its original side length, 0.07.
           
           The surface is plenty big (0.6 x 0.6), so there's room to play.  To guarantee *absolute* stability regardless of rotation, I needed to define a safe zone *inside* the surface's boundaries.  I did this by shrinking the surface by half the *maximum* rotated size (0.099 / 2).  This gives me a safe x range of [4.24949, 4.75050] and a safe y range of [-0.55050, -0.04949].
           
           I created a grid of 25 (x, y) coordinates within this safe zone.  Then, to get my 50 placements, I paired these (x, y) coordinates with *two* different orientations.  The first 25 had a rotation of 0 radians (no rotation), and the second 25 had a rotation of pi/4 radians (45 degrees). This ensures a good spread and guarantees stability because all placements are *within* the "safe zone" that accounts for *any* possible rotation. That should be good!

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan: I've got to place object ID 10 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into object ID 5.  The tricky part is I only have a list of successful placements for object 5, all at a `theta` of 0.  This tells me where object 5 *could* be, but not for certain.  Since I need to *avoid* collision, I have to assume the worst-case scenario: that object 5 is *in* one of those successful spots.
           
           I'm interpreting the instructions as a direct "you must avoid" collision between any object that has *already* been placed, and the new object.  I only have positive feedback (successes) from the previous object's placements, which makes this even more ambiguous.
           
           Given this, I have to play it safe.  My priority is to select a diverse set of coordinates that will hopefully avoid the potential locations. I need to figure out where object 10 can *safely* go, considering object 5 might be in any of the successful spots.
           
           First, I calculate the maximum size of object 10, considering rotation (to ensure that the longest extension of object 10 is considered). The object is roughly a `0.093 x 0.093` square.  Then, I calculate the `safe` x and y boundaries that the center of the object can occupy.
           
           Next, I look at the placement successes for object 5. Since I do not want to overlap where object 5 *might* be, I need to make sure my new placements for object 10 will avoid collision. Since I know all successes of the object 5 were in the two leftmost columns on the surface, I assume that if object 5 *is* there, it's there with orientation 0. So, I will set up a new grid of coordinates for object 10 that doesn't overlap those areas, and generate a diverse sampling there. My plan includes an even distribution of placements across the surface, in the 0 and `pi/4` orientations, to consider all possibilities, but centered at a spot far from object 5.
