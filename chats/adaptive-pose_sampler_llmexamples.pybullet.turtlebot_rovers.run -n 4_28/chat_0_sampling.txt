User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a central open area, with several obstacles near the edges and some smaller ones scattered throughout. There's a large cross-shaped obstacle in the center (obstacle 5 and its intersection with obstacle 0). Obstacles 0-4 define the outer walls of the environment, limiting the robot's movement to x and y within [-2.5, 2.5]. There are several rectangular obstacles that look like viewing platforms (obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10). I will prioritize positions that are within the max_range of 2 from the target and are likely to be in open spaces, away from the known obstacles.

Model:     The previous attempts failed due to collisions with the central obstacle (obstacle 5) and the top wall (obstacle 1), and one specific obstacle (obstacle 17) near the target. This indicates that the target point is in a crowded area. I need to be more careful to avoid these obstacles. I will try to place the robot further away from the central x-axis and from the top wall, and also be mindful of the smaller obstacles.

Model:     All previous positions collided with either the central vertical bar (obstacle 5), the top wall (obstacle 1), or a smaller obstacle (obstacle 17) which is very close to the target in the y-direction. This time, I will try to place the robot further to the left and right of the target's x-coordinate to avoid the central vertical bar. I will also try to stay clear of the y-coordinate of obstacle 17. The target is at (0.103, 1.488). Obstacle 17 is at y between 1.309 and 1.444. My previous proposed position (-0.89, 1.48) was too close to it. I will try to stay further away from the center (x=0) and the y-coordinates that are prone to collision.
