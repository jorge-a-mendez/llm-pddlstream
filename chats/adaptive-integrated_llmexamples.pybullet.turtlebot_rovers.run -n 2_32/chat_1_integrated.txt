           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (where `?stone` is a rock of type `v2`)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (where `?soil` is a rock of type `v6`)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is a stone)
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is a stone)
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is a stone)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is a soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is a soil)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is a soil)
           
           So, we need to achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)` (or v1, or v3, which are of type v2)
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)` (or v8, or v7, which are of type v6)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           1. Calibrate the camera (`calibrate`)
           2. Take an image (`take_image`)
           3. Send the image (`send_image`)
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           1. Sample a rock (`sample_rock`)
           2. Send the analysis (`send_analysis`)
           
           We can use rover v12 or v14. Both are at their initial configurations, and both have store v16 free. They both have onboard camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           
           Let's use rover v14 for imaging and analysis since it has imagevisible and comvisible facts related to its initial position.
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v14 can image v17 and v18 from configuration #o3 using ray #o4.
           Rover v14 can communicate from configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(v4)` (stone) and `receivedanalysis(v5)` (soil):
           Rover v14 can sample v4 and v5 from configuration #o5.
           Rover v14 can communicate from configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           A possible plan:
           1. Move v14 to #o3 to calibrate and take images of v17 and v18.
           2. Move v14 to #o0 to send images.
           3. Move v14 to #o5 to sample v4 (stone) and v5 (soil).
           4. Move v14 back to #o0 to send analyses.
           
           All continuous parameters are relative to rover v14.
           - `#o3` is a configuration for v14 to image v17 and v18.
           - `#o0` is a configuration for v14 to communicate with v9.
           - `#o5` is a configuration for v14 to be above rocks.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (where `?stone` is a rock of type `v2`)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (where `?soil` is a rock of type `v6`)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is a stone)
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is a stone)
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is a stone)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is a soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is a soil)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is a soil)
           
           So, we need to achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)` (or v1, or v3, which are of type v2)
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)` (or v8, or v7, which are of type v6)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           1. Calibrate the camera (`calibrate`)
           2. Take an image (`take_image`)
           3. Send the image (`send_image`)
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           1. Sample a rock (`sample_rock`)
           2. Send the analysis (`send_analysis`)
           
           We can use rover v14 for imaging and analysis. Both are at their initial configurations, and both have store v16 free. They both have onboard camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           
           Let's use rover v14.
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v14 can image v17 and v18 from configuration #o3 using ray #o4.
           Rover v14 can communicate from configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(v4)` (stone) and `receivedanalysis(v5)` (soil):
           Rover v14 can sample v4 and v5 from configuration #o5.
           Rover v14 can communicate from configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           A possible plan:
           1. Move v14 to #o3 to calibrate and take images of v17 and v18.
           2. Move v14 to #o0 to send images.
           3. Move v14 to #o5 to sample v4 (stone) and v5 (soil).
           4. Move v14 back to #o0 to send analyses.
           
           The rover v14 has AABB (( -1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           The lander v9 has AABB ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Objective v17 has AABB ((1.812, 1.834), (1.911, 1.932)).
           Objective v18 has AABB ((-1.97, 1.886), (-1.877, 1.98)).
           Rock v4 has AABB ((0.496, -1.067), (0.6, -0.963)).
           Rock v5 has AABB ((-1.239, 0.548), (-1.123, 0.665)).
           
           We need to provide configurations that are collision-free and within range.
           For imaging v17 (x=1.86, y=1.88), v14 needs to be within 2 units.
           For imaging v18 (x=-1.92, y=1.93), v14 needs to be within 2 units.
           For communicating with v9 (x=-1.9, y=-2.0), v14 needs to be within 4 units.
           For sampling v4 (x=0.55, y=-1.01) and v5 (x=-1.18, y=0.6), v14 needs to be above them.
           
           For #o3 (image v14 to v17): A good position for v14 would be (1.0, 1.8). This is within 2 units of v17, and not blocked by any given objects.
           For #o3 (image v14 to v18): A good position for v14 would be (-1.5, 1.8). This is within 2 units of v18, and not blocked by any given objects.
           For #o0 (com v14 to v9): A good position for v14 would be (-1.9, -1.8). This is within 4 units of v9, and not blocked by any given objects.
           For #o5 (above v4): A good position for v14 would be (0.55, -0.9). This is above v4 and not blocked.
           For #o5 (above v5): A good position for v14 would be (-1.18, 0.7). This is above v5 and not blocked.
           
           Since #o3 and #o5 are used for multiple targets, we need to ensure that the chosen single value for each #o3 and #o5 is valid for all its target objects.
           For #o3, imaging v17 and v18: we need two separate values. However, the planning system asks for one value per (conf, rover, ray, target) tuple. Since #o3 is tied to a single ray #o4, and it's used for two different imagevisible predicates with v17 and v18, we can specify two separate configurations for it, one for each target.
           Let's name them `_o3_v17` and `_o3_v18` for clarity, even though the PDDL uses `#o3`. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This implies that for the `calibrate` and `take_image` actions, if the same configuration `#o3` is used for different `objective`s (v17 and v18), we need to specify a value for `#o3` for each instance.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the plan with distinct configurations if needed.
           The provided action instances show:
           `((calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10))` and `((calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10))`.
           This implies the same `#o3` configuration is used for both objectives. This suggests a position from which both are visible. However, v17 and v18 are quite far apart. It's more likely that the problem expects the single `#o3` to refer to one specific (rover, target) pair. Given the prompt's phrasing, "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name," I will treat `#o3` as different configurations when paired with different targets.
           
           Plan:
           1. Calibrate camera for v17 at #o3_v17.
           2. Take image of v17.
           3. Calibrate camera for v18 at #o3_v18.
           4. Take image of v18.
           5. Move to #o0_v9 to send images.
           6. Sample rock v4 at #o5_v4.
           7. Sample rock v5 at #o5_v5.
           8. Move to #o0_v9 to send analysis.
           
           However, the action instances only provide `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10` and `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`. This means we use the *same* `#o3` for both, which implies that a single configuration `#o3` must be valid for both v17 and v18. This is challenging given their positions. Let's assume there is a `#o3` from which both are visible, and prioritize reachability and collision-freeness for the provided coordinates. If a single configuration for #o3 must serve both v17 and v18, it would need to be in a position to see both. Given v17 is (1.8, 1.8) and v18 is (-1.9, 1.9), this implies a very far camera, or a very specific spot. Let's try a point that is approximately equidistant from both. Perhaps (0.0, 1.8). This would be 1.8 units from v17 and 1.9 units from v18, within range.
           
           For sampling: #o5 is used for multiple rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8). Similar to #o3, the problem's phrasing about "different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" suggests that if `#o5` is in `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, these could conceptually be different. However, the action instances are `sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16` and `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16`, using the same `#o5`. This implies that a single configuration `#o5` must be above both v4 and v5. This is highly unlikely since v4 is (0.55, -1.01) and v5 is (-1.18, 0.6). The rover would have to move.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 are *configurations* and the `motion` predicates describe trajectories between them. The initial state already provides motion between various configurations, including between #o0, #o3, #o5, and the initial base configurations v13/v15.
           
           To solve this, I will make a plan using distinct movements to each required configuration if a single configuration is not feasible for multiple targets. I will choose target coordinates close to the given objects.
           
           Revised Plan (assuming #o3 for v17 and #o3 for v18 are distinct instances of the continuous parameter #o3, and similarly for #o5):
           
           --Plan--:
           (move v14 v15 #o2 #o3) ; move to a config for imaging v17

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (where `?stone` is a rock of type `v2`)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (where `?soil` is a rock of type `v6`)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `type(v4, v2)` (v4 is a stone)
           - `type(v1, v2)` (v1 is a stone)
           - `type(v3, v2)` (v3 is a stone)
           - `type(v5, v6)` (v5 is a soil)
           - `type(v8, v6)` (v8 is a soil)
           - `type(v7, v6)` (v7 is a soil)
           
           So, we need to achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)` (or v1, or v3, which are of type v2)
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)` (or v8, or v7, which are of type v6)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           1. Calibrate the camera (`calibrate`)
           2. Take an image (`take_image`)
           3. Send the image (`send_image`)
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           1. Sample a rock (`sample_rock`)
           2. Send the analysis (`send_analysis`)
           
           We can use rover v14 for imaging and analysis. Both are at their initial configurations, and both have store v16 free. They both have onboard camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           
           Let's use rover v14.
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v14 can image v17 and v18 from configuration #o3 using ray #o4.
           Rover v14 can communicate from configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(v4)` (stone) and `receivedanalysis(v5)` (soil):
           Rover v14 can sample v4 and v5 from configuration #o5.
           Rover v14 can communicate from configuration #o0 using ray #o1 to lander v9.
           
           The problem states "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This means that if `#o3` is used for imaging `v17` and `v18`, it needs a distinct value for each (v14, v17) and (v14, v18) pair. The same logic applies to `#o5` for sampling multiple rocks.
           
           Revised Plan:
           
           --Plan--:

Model:     The goal remains the same: satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires achieving `receivedimage` for `v17` and `v18`, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of `type v2` (stone, e.g., `v4`) and a rock of `type v6` (soil, e.g., `v5`).
           
           From the initial state, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are already true. We have rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and `v6` (v5, v7, v8).
           
           Rover `v14` is initially at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.
           Lander `v9` has AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Rover `v14` has AABB `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`.
           
           The previous configurations were rejected for reachability and collision. Let's adjust them.
           
           For reachability from `v15` for `v14` (initial position `(-1.0, -1.75)`):
           - `#o3` for `v17` (target at `(1.86, 1.88)`): Max distance for `imagevisible` is 2. The previous (1.0, 1.8) is too far from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to be reachable, or out of imaging range for `v17`. A position closer to `v17` and reachable for `v14` would be required, but given v14's current position, moving to a point where v17 is within 2 units may not be possible. Let's re-examine if v12 might be better for v17.
               - Rover `v12` is at `v13` which is `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. This is closer to `v17`. `v17` is at `(1.812, 1.834)`. A configuration for `v12` to see `v17` could be `(1.0, 1.0)`. Distance to `v17` is about 0.9. Distance from `v13` to `(1.0, 1.0)` is 2.75, which is large but possibly reachable. Let's try this with `v12` for `v17`.
           
           - `#o3` for `v18` (target at `(-1.92, 1.93)`): Max distance for `imagevisible` is 2.
               - Rover `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. A position for `v14` to see `v18` could be `(-1.5, 0.0)`. Distance to `v18` is `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.5)^2 + (1.93 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.42^2 + 1.93^2) = sqrt(0.1764 + 3.7249) = sqrt(3.9013) approx 1.97`. This is within 2. Reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           - `#o0` for `v9` (lander at `(-1.9, -2.0)`): Max distance for `comvisible` is 4.
               - The previous `(-1.9, -1.8)` for `v14` was in collision with `v9`. This is because `v9`'s min y is `-2.346` and max y is `-1.654`. The rover `v14` has min y `-1.929` and max y `-1.571`. Placing the center of `v14` at `(-1.9, -1.8)` places the rover within `v9`'s y range. We need to move `v14` outside `v9`'s bounding box. Let's try `(-0.5, -2.0)`. This is further from `v9` but within the 4 unit range (`sqrt((-1.9 - -0.5)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.4^2 + 0^2) = 1.4`). This is also reachable from `v14`'s initial position `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           - `#o5` for `v4` (rock at `(0.55, -1.01)`):
               - Rover `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. A position for `v14` above `v4` could be `(0.55, -1.0)`. This is reachable.
           
           - `#o5` for `v5` (rock at `(-1.18, 0.6)`):
               - Rover `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. A position for `v14` above `v5` could be `(-1.18, 0.7)`. This is reachable.
           
           We will use `v12` for `v17` and `v14` for `v18`, then both `v12` and `v14` will send their images and analyses. The axiom requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. It doesn't specify which rover has to get them.
           
           Revised Plan Strategy:
           1. Rover `v12` moves to a config to image `v17`. Calibrates and takes image.
           2. Rover `v14` moves to a config to image `v18`. Calibrates and takes image.
           3. Rover `v12` moves to a config to sample `v4` (stone).
           4. Rover `v14` moves to a config to sample `v5` (soil).
           5. Both `v12` and `v14` move to their respective communication configurations to send images and analyses.

Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal remains the same: satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires achieving `receivedimage` for `v17` and `v18`, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of `type v2` (stone, e.g., `v4`) and a rock of `type v6` (soil, e.g., `v5`).
           
           From the initial state, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are already true. We have rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and `v6` (v5, v7, v8).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (`(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`).
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (`(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`).
           Lander `v9` has AABB `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           Objective `v17` has AABB `((1.812, 1.834), (1.911, 1.932))`. (Center approx `(1.86, 1.88)`)
           Objective `v18` has AABB `((-1.97, 1.886), (-1.877, 1.98))`. (Center approx `(-1.92, 1.93)`)

           Obstacle `v19` has AABB `((0.779, 0.888), (0.881, 0.990))`.
           
           Let's carefully choose reachable and collision-free configurations, keeping the maximum distance for `imagevisible` (2 units) and `comvisible` (4 units) in mind.
           
           **For `v12` to image `v17` (at `(1.86, 1.88)`):**
           - Current `v12` position: `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           - Previous `#o3` (1.0, 1.0) was in collision with `v19` (0.779, 0.888) to (0.881, 0.990).
           - We need to be close to `v17` but avoid `v19`.
           - Let's try `(1.6, 0.0)` for `v12`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.6)^2 + (1.88-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.26^2 + 1.88^2) = sqrt(0.0676 + 3.5344) = sqrt(3.602) approx 1.89`. This is within 2 units.
           - Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.6, 0.0)`: This is `sqrt((1.6-1.0)^2 + (0.0 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.6^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.4225) approx 1.85`. This should be reachable.
           - Collision with `v19`: `v19` is around `(0.8, 0.9)`. `(1.6, 0.0)` is far from `v19`. Collision-free.
           
           **For `v14` to image `v18` (at `(-1.92, 1.93)`):**
           - Current `v14` position: `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - Previous `#o3` (-1.5, 0.0) was "not reachable". Let's try something closer to v14's current position and still within range of v18.
           - Let's try `(-1.0, 0.5)` for `v14`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.0)^2 + (1.93 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.92^2 + 1.43^2) = sqrt(0.8464 + 2.0449) = sqrt(2.8913) approx 1.7`. This is within 2 units.
           - Reachability from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, 0.5)`: Vertical movement of `2.25`. This should be reachable.
           - Collision: No obstacles in this region. Collision-free.
           
           **For `v12` to communicate with `v9` (at `(-1.9, -2.0)`):**
           - Current `v12` (after imaging) is at `(1.6, 0.0)`.
           - Previous `#o0` (-0.5, -2.0) was "not reachable".
           - Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `v12`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.9^2 + 0^2) = 0.9`. This is within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(1.6, 0.0)` to `(-1.0, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.0-1.6)^2 + (-2.0-0.0)^2) = sqrt(-2.6^2 + -2.0^2) = sqrt(6.76 + 4) = sqrt(10.76) approx 3.28`. This should be reachable.
           - Collision: `v9` is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. `v12` at `(-1.0, -2.0)`: `v12` has AABB `((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571))` when at `v13`. If its center is `(-1.0, -2.0)`, its AABB would be roughly `((-1.0-0.183), (-2.0-0.183), (-1.0+0.183), (-2.0+0.183))` which is `((-1.183, -2.183), (-0.817, -1.817))`. This overlaps with `v9` in the y-axis (v9's y range is -2.346 to -1.654, v12's is -2.183 to -1.817).
           - So, `(-1.0, -2.0)` is still potentially in collision with `v9`. Let's try to put it further out in the x direction. `(0.0, -2.0)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - 0.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2) = 1.9`. Within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(1.6, 0.0)` to `(0.0, -2.0)`: `sqrt((0.0-1.6)^2 + (-2.0-0.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.6^2 + -2.0^2) = sqrt(2.56 + 4) = sqrt(6.56) approx 2.56`. Reachable.
           - Collision with `v9`: `v12` at `(0.0, -2.0)` would have AABB centered at `(0.0, -2.0)`. No overlap with `v9` now. Collision-free.
           
           **For `v14` to communicate with `v9` (at `(-1.9, -2.0)`):**
           - Current `v14` (after imaging) is at `(-1.0, 0.5)`.
           - Previous `#o0` (-0.5, -2.0) was "not reachable".
           - Let's try `(0.0, -2.0)` for `v14`. Distance to `v9`: `1.9`. Within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(-1.0, 0.5)` to `(0.0, -2.0)`: `sqrt((0.0 - -1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.0^2 + -2.5^2) = sqrt(1 + 6.25) = sqrt(7.25) approx 2.69`. Reachable.
           - Collision-free, same as `v12`.
           
           **For `v12` to sample `v4` (rock at `(0.55, -1.01)`):**
           - Current `v12` (after imaging) is at `(1.6, 0.0)`.
           - Let's try `(0.55, -0.9)` for `v12` (above `v4`).
           - Reachability from `(1.6, 0.0)` to `(0.55, -0.9)`: `sqrt((0.55-1.6)^2 + (-0.9-0.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.05^2 + -0.9^2) = sqrt(1.1025 + 0.81) = sqrt(1.9125) approx 1.38`. Reachable.
           - Collision: No obstacles in this region. Collision-free.
           
           **For `v14` to sample `v5` (rock at `(-1.18, 0.6)`):**
           - Current `v14` (after imaging) is at `(-1.0, 0.5)`.
           - Let's try `(-1.18, 0.7)` for `v14` (above `v5`).
           - Reachability from `(-1.0, 0.5)` to `(-1.18, 0.7)`: `sqrt((-1.18 - -1.0)^2 + (0.7-0.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.18^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.0324 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.0724) approx 0.27`. Reachable.
           - Collision: No obstacles in this region. Collision-free.

           Objective `v18` (center approx `(-1.92, 1.93)`).
           Rock `v4` (center approx `(0.55, -1.01)`).
           Rock `v5` (center approx `(-1.18, 0.6)`).
           Obstacle `v19` has AABB `((0.779, 0.888), (0.881, 0.990))`.
           Obstacle `v20` has AABB `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This is a thin wall or line segment along x=0, stretching across a large y range.
           
           Let's adjust configurations again for reachability and collision-freeness.
           
           **For `v12` to image `v17` (at `(1.86, 1.88)`):**
           - Current `v12` position: `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           - Previous `#o3` (1.6, 0.0) was "not reachable". Let's try something closer to `v12`'s initial position and in range of `v17`.
           - Try `(1.0, 0.0)` for `v12`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.0)^2 + (1.88-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.86^2 + 1.88^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 3.5344) = sqrt(4.274) approx 2.06`. This is slightly out of range (max 2).
           - Let's try `(1.5, 0.8)` for `v12`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.5)^2 + (1.88-0.8)^2) = sqrt(0.36^2 + 1.08^2) = sqrt(0.1296 + 1.1664) = sqrt(1.296) approx 1.14`. This is well within range.
           - Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.5, 0.8)`: `sqrt((1.5-1.0)^2 + (0.8 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.55^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 6.5025) = sqrt(6.7525) approx 2.6`. This seems reasonable for reachability.
           - Collision with `v19` (`((0.779, 0.888), (0.881, 0.990))`): `v12` center `(1.5, 0.8)`. `v12` AABB is `((1.5-0.183), (0.8-0.183), (1.5+0.183), (0.8+0.183))` which is `((1.317, 0.617), (1.683, 0.983))`. This would overlap with v19's y range (0.888, 0.990) and x range (0.779, 0.881) if the x component was smaller. It is currently collision-free.
           
           **For `v14` to image `v18` (at `(-1.92, 1.93)`):**
           - Current `v14` position: `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           - Previous `#o3` (-1.0, 0.5) was "not reachable". Let's try something closer to v14's current position and still within range of v18.
           - Try `(-1.5, 0.5)` for `v14`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.5)^2 + (1.93 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.42^2 + 1.43^2) = sqrt(0.1764 + 2.0449) = sqrt(2.2213) approx 1.49`. This is within 2 units.
           - Reachability from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.5, 0.5)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - -1.0)^2 + (0.5 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-0.5^2 + 2.25^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) approx 2.3`. This seems reasonable.
           - Collision: No obstacles in this region. Collision-free.
           
           **For `v12` to communicate with `v9` (at `(-1.9, -2.0)`):**
           - Current `v12` (after imaging) is at `(1.5, 0.8)`.
           - Previous `#o0` (0.0, -2.0) was in collision with `v20` (a wall at x=0).
           - We need to be on one side of the x=0 wall (either positive x or negative x) and close to `v9`. `v9` is at `x=-1.9`. So `v12` needs to be on the negative x side.
           - Let's try `(-0.5, -2.0)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.5)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.4^2 + 0^2) = 1.4`. Within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(1.5, 0.8)` to `(-0.5, -2.0)`: This path crosses `x=0`. `sqrt((-0.5-1.5)^2 + (-2.0-0.8)^2) = sqrt(-2.0^2 + -2.8^2) = sqrt(4 + 7.84) = sqrt(11.84) approx 3.44`. This is reachable. The path crosses the `v20` obstacle (x=0). This suggests the `motion` predicate doesn't check for collision during trajectory, only start/end. However, good practice suggests avoiding known obstacles. Let's try to communicate from a spot on the same side of the wall as the lander.
           - Let's try `(-0.1, -2.0)`. This is right next to the x=0 wall, on the negative side. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.1)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.8^2 + 0^2) = 1.8`. Within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(1.5, 0.8)` to `(-0.1, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-0.1-1.5)^2 + (-2.0-0.8)^2) = sqrt(-1.6^2 + -2.8^2) = sqrt(2.56 + 7.84) = sqrt(10.4) approx 3.22`. Reachable.
           - Collision with `v20`: `v12` at `(-0.1, -2.0)` (center). `v12`'s AABB `((-0.1-0.183), (-2.0-0.183), (-0.1+0.183), (-2.0+0.183))` -> `((-0.283, -2.183), (0.083, -1.817))`. This is very close to `v20` (`x=-0.05` to `x=0.05`). `v12`'s upper x bound `0.083` might overlap with `v20`'s upper x bound `0.05`. We need to be slightly further left.
           - Let's try `(-0.4, -2.0)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.4)^2 + (-2.0 - -2.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.5^2 + 0^2) = 1.5`. Within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(1.5, 0.8)` to `(-0.4, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-0.4-1.5)^2 + (-2.0-0.8)^2) = sqrt(-1.9^2 + -2.8^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 7.84) = sqrt(11.45) approx 3.38`. Reachable.
           - Collision with `v20`: `v12` at `(-0.4, -2.0)` (`x` range is approx `(-0.58, -0.21)`). This is collision-free with `v20` (`x` range `(-0.05, 0.05)`). Collision-free.
           
           **For `v14` to communicate with `v9` (at `(-1.9, -2.0)`):**
           - Current `v14` (after imaging) is at `(-1.5, 0.5)`.
           - Let's use `(-0.4, -2.0)` for `v14` as well. Distance to `v9`: `1.5`. Within 4 units.
           - Reachability from `(-1.5, 0.5)` to `(-0.4, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-0.4 - -1.5)^2 + (-2.0 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + -2.5^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 6.25) = sqrt(7.46) approx 2.73`. Reachable.
           - Collision-free.
           
           **For `v12` to sample `v4` (rock at `(0.55, -1.01)`):**
           - Current `v12` (after imaging) is at `(1.5, 0.8)`.
           - Let's try `(0.55, -0.9)` for `v12` (above `v4`).
           - Reachability from `(1.5, 0.8)` to `(0.55, -0.9)`: `sqrt((0.55-1.5)^2 + (-0.9-0.8)^2) = sqrt(-0.95^2 + -1.7^2) = sqrt(0.9025 + 2.89) = sqrt(3.7925) approx 1.95`. Reachable.
           - Collision: No new obstacles in this region. Collision-free.
           
           **For `v14` to sample `v5` (rock at `(-1.18, 0.6)`):**
           - Current `v14` (after imaging) is at `(-1.5, 0.5)`.
           - Let's try `(-1.18, 0.7)` for `v14` (above `v5`).
           - Reachability from `(-1.5, 0.5)` to `(-1.18, 0.7)`: `sqrt((-1.18 - -1.5)^2 + (0.7-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.32^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.1024 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.1424) approx 0.38`. Reachable.
           - Collision: No new obstacles in this region. Collision-free.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.5 0.8) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 0.5) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.4 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.4 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal remains the same: satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires achieving `receivedimage` for `v17` and `v18`, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of `type v2` (stone, e.g., `v4`) and a rock of `type v6` (soil, e.g., `v5`).
           
           From the initial state, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are already true. We have rocks of type `v2` (v1, v3, v4) and `v6` (v5, v7, v8).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (`(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`). Rover `v12` AABB is `((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571))`.
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (`(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`). Rover `v14` AABB is `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`.

           Obstacle `v20` has AABB `((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`.
           
           It seems the definition of "reachable" for the robot base is more constrained than I'm accounting for, especially for large movements. Let's try to minimize movement and stick closer to the initial robot positions if possible, or only take small steps. If `motion` predicates define all possible movements, then maybe I'm overthinking reachability and should just ensure collision and range. However, the system explicitly says "not reachable for robot base." This implies geometric or kinematic limits are being hit.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given for motion in the initial state are the only valid continuous paths for these `motion` actions and if my chosen coordinates don't fall on one of those paths, it's "not reachable". This is a very restrictive interpretation.
           Given that the problem description states "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter*... Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*... you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object...", this means I *do* need to find these values.
           
           The previous attempts to move `v12` (from `(1.0, -1.75)`) and `v14` (from `(-1.0, -1.75)`) to positive y coordinates have failed on "reachability". This could mean that the y-axis movement is limited, or movement costs too much. The motion primitives like `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` where `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)` and `#o3` is a higher y value, suggest movement *is* possible. The error explicitly says "not reachable for robot base," which implies the calculated path is too long or kinematically impossible.
           
           Let's try to minimize movement drastically.
           Could we perform any imaging or sampling from the base configurations `v13` and `v15`?
           - `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v17)` is not in the initial state.
           - `imagevisible(v14, v15, #o4, v18)` is not in the initial state.
           So, we *must* move.
           
           Let's check the given `motion` primitives to see what kinds of movements are actually allowed.
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)` implies `v14` can move from `v15` to `#o0`.
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` implies `v14` can move from `v15` to `#o3`.
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)` implies `v14` can move from `v15` to `#o5`.
           Similar for `v12`.
           
           This means the problem *expects* `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` to be reachable from the initial `v13`/`v15`. The issue must be with *my chosen coordinates* for those `#` objects.
           
           Let's rethink coordinates completely, staying very close to the base if possible.
           
           **For `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) to image `v17` (at `(1.86, 1.88)`):**
           - Previous `(1.5, 0.8)` was not reachable.
           - We need to be within 2 units of `v17`. `(1.86, 1.88)`
           - Let's try `(1.0, 1.0)`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.0)^2 + (1.88-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.86^2 + 0.88^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 0.7744) = sqrt(1.514) approx 1.23`. This is good for range.
           - Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, 1.0)` is a vertical move of `2.75`. This might be the issue.
           - Collision with `v19` (`((0.779, 0.888), (0.881, 0.990))`): `v12` at `(1.0, 1.0)` AABB: `((1.0-0.183), (1.0-0.183), (1.0+0.183), (1.0+0.183))` -> `((0.817, 0.817), (1.183, 1.183))`. This would collide with `v19` since x overlaps (0.817-0.881) and y overlaps (0.888-0.990).
           - This means we need to avoid `v19` as well.
           - Let's try to move `v12` to `(0.7, 0.7)`. Range to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-0.7)^2 + (1.88-0.7)^2) = sqrt(1.16^2 + 1.18^2) = sqrt(1.3456 + 1.3924) = sqrt(2.738) approx 1.65`. This is good for range.
           - Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.7, 0.7)`: `sqrt((0.7-1.0)^2 + (0.7 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-0.3^2 + 2.45^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 6.0025) = sqrt(6.0925) approx 2.47`. Still a large move.
           - Collision with `v19`: `v12` at `(0.7, 0.7)` AABB: `((0.517, 0.517), (0.883, 0.883))`. `v19` X range is `(0.779, 0.881)`, Y range `(0.888, 0.990)`. `v12`'s y max is `0.883`, `v19`'s y min is `0.888`. No overlap. Collision-free.
           - This seems like a better candidate if reachable.
           
           **For `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) to image `v18` (at `(-1.92, 1.93)`):**
           - Previous `(-1.5, 0.5)` was not reachable.
           - We need to be within 2 units of `v18`.
           - Let's try `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.0)^2 + (1.93 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.92^2 + 1.93^2) = sqrt(0.8464 + 3.7249) = sqrt(4.5713) approx 2.13`. This is slightly out of range (max 2).
           - Let's try `(-1.5, 0.7)`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.5)^2 + (1.93 - 0.7)^2) = sqrt(-0.42^2 + 1.23^2) = sqrt(0.1764 + 1.5129) = sqrt(1.6893) approx 1.3`. Good for range.
           - Reachability from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.5, 0.7)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - -1.0)^2 + (0.7 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-0.5^2 + 2.45^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 6.0025) = sqrt(6.2525) approx 2.5`. This seems plausible.
           
           **For `v12` to communicate with `v9` (at `(-1.9, -2.0)`):**
           - Current `v12` is at `(0.7, 0.7)`.
           - Previous `(-0.4, -2.0)` was not reachable. It also crossed `v20` (x=0 wall).
           - We need to be on the negative x side of `v20`.
           - Let's try `(-0.1, -1.8)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.1)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.8)^2) = sqrt(-1.8^2 + -0.2^2) = sqrt(3.24 + 0.04) = sqrt(3.28) approx 1.81`. Within range.
           - Reachability from `(0.7, 0.7)` to `(-0.1, -1.8)`: `sqrt((-0.1-0.7)^2 + (-1.8-0.7)^2) = sqrt(-0.8^2 + -2.5^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 6.25) = sqrt(6.89) approx 2.62`. This is a large movement, but it crosses the `x=0` barrier. Perhaps there are no implicit "no-go" zones other than explicit obstacles.
           - Collision with `v20`: `v12` at `(-0.1, -1.8)` AABB `((-0.283, -1.983), (0.083, -1.617))`. This still overlaps with `v20` (`x=(-0.05, 0.05)`).
           - We need to be further away from the x=0 wall. Let's try `(-0.5, -1.8)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.5)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.8)^2) = sqrt(-1.4^2 + -0.2^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 0.04) = sqrt(2.0) approx 1.41`. Within range.
           - Reachability from `(0.7, 0.7)` to `(-0.5, -1.8)`: `sqrt((-0.5-0.7)^2 + (-1.8-0.7)^2) = sqrt(-1.2^2 + -2.5^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 6.25) = sqrt(7.69) approx 2.77`. Still a large movement.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (0.7 0.7) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.5 0.7) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.8) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -1.8) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem insists that the specified configurations are not reachable for the robot base, despite my attempts to find shorter, collision-free paths within range. This suggests a very tight constraint on robot movement, or that the path geometry itself (not just start/end points) is being checked for collision, and my chosen values are leading to collisions on the path that I'm not explicitly accounting for from the AABB information.
           
           Given the repeated "not reachable" errors, I need to drastically reduce the distance moved or reconsider the rover allocation. What if the `motion` predicates themselves define very short, specific paths? For example, `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)` might imply `#o0` is *very* close to `v15`.
           
           Let's assume the problem means that the path between the two configurations is too long or that intermediate collisions occur. I will try to use the most static configurations possible (i.e., minimal movement from initial positions). If an objective or rock is out of reach of both rovers, then the task might be impossible, but I should exhaust options first.
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (`(1.0, -1.75)`).
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (`(-1.0, -1.75)`).
           
           **Can `v12` or `v14` achieve imaging/sampling/comms from *very close* to their starting positions?**
           
           **1. Imaging `v17` (at `(1.86, 1.88)`)**:
              - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.0)^2 + (1.88 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.86^2 + 3.63^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 13.1769) = sqrt(13.9165) approx 3.73`. This is outside the image range (max 2).
              - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86 - -1.0)^2 + (1.88 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(2.86^2 + 3.63^2) = sqrt(8.1796 + 13.1769) = sqrt(21.3565) approx 4.62`. Outside image range.
              - Conclusion: Neither rover can image `v17` from their initial positions. They *must* move closer.
           
           **2. Imaging `v18` (at `(-1.92, 1.93)`)**:
              - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - 1.0)^2 + (1.93 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-2.92^2 + 3.68^2) = sqrt(8.5264 + 13.5424) = sqrt(22.0688) approx 4.7`. Outside image range.
              - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.0)^2 + (1.93 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-0.92^2 + 3.68^2) = sqrt(0.8464 + 13.5424) = sqrt(14.3888) approx 3.79`. Outside image range.
              - Conclusion: Neither rover can image `v18` from their initial positions. They *must* move closer.
           
           **3. Sampling `v4` (rock at `(0.55, -1.01)`)**:
              - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Being "above" means the rover's AABB x-y projection covers the rock's AABB x-y projection. `v12` is to the right and below `v4`. It would need to move to `(0.55, -1.01)` or very close to it.
              - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` is far from `v4`.
              - Conclusion: Rover must move.
           
           **4. Sampling `v5` (rock at `(-1.18, 0.6)`)**:
              - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Far from `v5`.
              - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` needs to move to `(-1.18, 0.6)` or very close to it.
              - Conclusion: Rover must move.
           
           **5. Communication with `v9` (lander at `(-1.9, -2.0)`)**:
              - `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - 1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-2.9^2 + -0.25^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) approx 2.91`. This is within comms range (max 4).
              - `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-0.9^2 + -0.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93`. This is well within comms range.
              - Collision check for `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` with `v9` `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
                - `v14` AABB `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`.
                - `v9` X range `(-2.405, -1.395)`. `v14` X range `(-1.187, -0.821)`. No X overlap.
                - `v9` Y range `(-2.346, -1.654)`. `v14` Y range `(-1.929, -1.571)`. Y overlap.
                - The rover is positioned *just above* the lander, so it's not a direct collision, but it's very close. `comvisible` requires a clear line of sight, which could be blocked by the rover's own body if it's too close/above.
                - Let's assume that `v14` at `v15` is collision free for `comvisible`. The initial state does *not* contain `comvisible(v14, v15, #o1, v9)`. But it contains `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So even for comms, we might need a specific `#o0` that is not `v15`.
           
           The "not reachable" error strongly implies the geometry of paths, or the maximum travel distance for a single `move` action, is extremely constrained. Since I cannot know these constraints, I'm left guessing. I must try minimal moves.
           
           Let's assume the problem's implicit "reachable" check for `motion` means that only *small* deviations from the initial configurations are allowed, or movements between points explicitly mentioned in the `motion` predicates.
           Given the existing `motion` facts, such as `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` and `motion(v14, #o3, #o2, #o0)`, these parameters *are* intended to be distinct.
           
           Perhaps the "reachable" check is related to the coordinate system and available space. The large y-coordinates for targets `v17` and `v18` are problematic for rovers starting at `y = -1.75`.
           
           What if the initial problem statement is suggesting a "global" path exists for #o2 (a time-series of robot configurations), and that any `#oX` is a point on that path? This is not how PDDL usually works. I am providing (x,y) for specific configurations, which are typically end-points of paths or critical poses.
           
           Let's try to assume that the `motion` predicates describe the only possible moves between the specified # objects. And the values I provide for `#oX` need to be consistent with the goal (collision-free, in range). The "not reachable" then means that a path between start and end configs is invalid.
           
           I'll try a different approach, only moving rovers to positions very close to the objects they need to interact with, minimizing overall travel, and carefully avoiding known obstacles.
           
           **Plan Strategy:**
           1. `v12` images `v17`: Move `v12` *just enough* towards `v17`. `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` is at `(1.86, 1.88)`.
           2. `v14` images `v18`: Move `v14` *just enough* towards `v18`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v18` is at `(-1.92, 1.93)`.
           3. `v12` samples `v4`: Move `v12` *just enough* to be above `v4`. `v4` is `(0.55, -1.01)`.
           4. `v14` samples `v5`: Move `v14` *just enough* to be above `v5`. `v5` is `(-1.18, 0.6)`.
           5. Both rovers communicate from configurations that are collision-free with `v9` and `v20`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v20` is at `x=0`.
           
           Let's select very minimal movements.
           - For `v12` to `v17`: from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.8, 0.0)`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.8)^2 + (1.88-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.06^2 + 1.88^2) = sqrt(0.0036 + 3.5344) = sqrt(3.538) approx 1.88`. In range.
             - Reachability: `sqrt((1.8-1.0)^2 + (0.0 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.7025) approx 1.92`. Let's test this.
             - Collision with `v19` (`((0.779, 0.888), (0.881, 0.990))`): `v12` at `(1.8, 0.0)` AABB approx `((1.617, -0.183), (1.983, 0.183))`. No overlap.
           
           - For `v14` to `v18`: from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.8, 0.0)`. Distance to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.8)^2 + (1.93 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.12^2 + 1.93^2) = sqrt(0.0144 + 3.7249) = sqrt(3.7393) approx 1.93`. In range.
             - Reachability: `sqrt((-1.8 - -1.0)^2 + (0.0 - -1.75)^2) = sqrt(-0.8^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.7025) approx 1.92`. Let's test this.
             - Collision: No obstacles nearby.
           
           - For `v12` to `v4`: from `(1.8, 0.0)` to `(0.55, -1.0)`.
             - Reachability: `sqrt((0.55-1.8)^2 + (-1.0-0.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.25^2 + -1.0^2) = sqrt(1.5625 + 1) = sqrt(2.5625) approx 1.6`. This seems reasonable.
             - Collision: No obstacles.
           
           - For `v14` to `v5`: from `(-1.8, 0.0)` to `(-1.18, 0.7)`.
             - Reachability: `sqrt((-1.18 - -1.8)^2 + (0.7-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.62^2 + 0.7^2) = sqrt(0.3844 + 0.49) = sqrt(0.8744) approx 0.93`. This seems reasonable.
             - Collision: No obstacles.
           
           - For comms for `v12` (from `(0.55, -1.0)`): Need to avoid `v20` (`x=0`) and `v9` (`((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`).
             - Let's try `(0.1, -1.8)`. This is just past `x=0`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - 0.1)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.8)^2) = sqrt(-2.0^2 + -0.2^2) = sqrt(4 + 0.04) = sqrt(4.04) approx 2.01`. In range.
             - Reachability from `(0.55, -1.0)` to `(0.1, -1.8)`: `sqrt((0.1-0.55)^2 + (-1.8 - -1.0)^2) = sqrt(-0.45^2 + -0.8^2) = sqrt(0.2025 + 0.64) = sqrt(0.8425) approx 0.91`. This is a small movement.
             - Collision with `v20`: `v12` at `(0.1, -1.8)` AABB `((-0.083, -1.983), (0.283, -1.617))`. This still overlaps with `v20` (`x=(-0.05, 0.05)`).
             - Let's try `(-0.6, -1.8)`. Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.6)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.8)^2) = sqrt(-1.3^2 + -0.2^2) = sqrt(1.69 + 0.04) = sqrt(1.73) approx 1.31`. In range.
             - Reachability from `(0.55, -1.0)` to `(-0.6, -1.8)`: `sqrt((-0.6-0.55)^2 + (-1.8 - -1.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.15^2 + -0.8^2) = sqrt(1.3225 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.9625) approx 1.4`. Seems small enough.
             - Collision: `v12` at `(-0.6, -1.8)` AABB `((-0.783, -1.983), (-0.417, -1.617))`. No overlap with `v20`. Collision-free with `v9` too.
           
           - For comms for `v14` (from `(-1.18, 0.7)`):
             - Let's use `(-0.6, -1.8)`. Distance to `v9`: `1.31`. In range.
             - Reachability from `(-1.18, 0.7)` to `(-0.6, -1.8)`: `sqrt((-0.6 - -1.18)^2 + (-1.8 - 0.7)^2) = sqrt(0.58^2 + -2.5^2) = sqrt(0.3364 + 6.25) = sqrt(6.5864) approx 2.56`. This is a relatively long move. Maybe this is what "not reachable" means.
           
           This is getting extremely difficult without knowing the exact motion constraints. I will try the current set of values and hope they pass the reachability test. The length of paths I'm proposing is within a few units, which normally should be fine for a rover. The repeated "not reachable" indicates a deeper issue.
           
           If the goal is truly achievable, there must be a sequence of points that pass these checks. My current strategy is to find specific points that are:
           1. Within visual/comms/sample range.
           2. Avoid known obstacles.
           3. Minimize distance traveled as much as possible, as this seems to be the core of the "not reachable" error.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.8 0.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.8 0.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.6 -1.8) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.6 -1.8) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem continues to state that the configurations are not reachable, even with minimized path lengths and careful collision avoidance with fixed obstacles. This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding on my part regarding what "reachable" implies in this specific robot context, or that the problem is unsolvable with the provided action instances and initial state, given the implicit motion constraints.
           
           Given the initial state, the only explicit `motion` facts are of the form `motion(rover, #config1, #o2, #config2)`. If `motion` implies a *direct* path, then the problem of reachability is primarily about path length and intermediate collisions. If the current rover position `(x1, y1)` and target configuration `(x2, y2)` lead to a path that is "not reachable," it means either:
           1. The straight-line distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is too great for a single `move` action.
           2. The implied path between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` passes through an implicit, unstated obstacle.
           3. The robot's kinematic limits prevent reaching `(x2, y2)` from `(x1, y1)`.
           
           Since I don't have access to the full robot model or a path planner that provides these detailed errors, I am constrained to infer from the "not reachable" message. The movements I've suggested have been decreasing in path length, yet are still rejected. This makes me suspect the path planner has very strict limits on how far the robot can move in a single `move` action, or there are unseen obstacles.
           
           Let's check the given `motion` predicates again:
           `Atom motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)` (move from v15 to v15)
           `Atom motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` (move from v13 to v13)
           These are trivial movements.
           
           The problem statement mentions `#o2` as a continuous parameter for motion. It seems to represent a time duration or a specific trajectory instance. I am only providing the start and end configurations, and `#o2` itself.
           
           Perhaps there are other configurations with names not starting with `#` (i.e., fixed, pre-computed configurations) that are explicitly reachable and could serve the purpose. However, in the provided initial state, there are no `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, or `above` predicates involving `v13` or `v15` directly. All these predicates use `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` as the configuration. This means I *must* provide values for these `#` configurations.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty in satisfying the "reachable" constraint for any significant movement, I will try to satisfy the goal by relying on *both* rovers as much as possible to minimize *individual* rover travel distances. And by positioning the rovers *as close as possible* to their initial positions while still satisfying other constraints.
           
           Let's assume "not reachable" refers to *any* change in configuration that's not infinitesimally small. If this is the case, and no imaging/sampling can happen from `v13`/`v15`, then the problem is unsolvable. But this is unlikely.
           
           Let's assume the issue is with large `y` coordinate changes from `-1.75`. I will try to keep `y` as close to `-1.75` as possible for reachable configurations.
           
           **For `v12` to image `v17` (at `(1.86, 1.88)`):**
           - Current `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` is at `(1.86, 1.88)`.
           - We need to be within 2 units.
           - Moving to a high `y` is proving hard. What if we go to `(2.0, 0.0)`? This is close to `v17` x-wise, but still far in y.
           - Let's try `(1.0, -0.5)`. Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.0)^2 + (1.88 - -0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.86^2 + 2.38^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 5.6644) = sqrt(6.404) approx 2.53`. Out of range.
           - **This might mean `v17` is fundamentally out of reach for `v12` if `y` movement is severely restricted.**
           
           Let's look at `v12`'s `imagevisible` predicates from the initial state: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`. The fact that both `v17` (far positive x, far positive y) and `v18` (far negative x, far positive y) are targets for the *same* `#o3` configuration is problematic. It would imply `#o3` needs to be far away to see both, or that the cameras have very wide FOV.
           This implies my interpretation of one `#o3` per (rover, target) pair for values might be incorrect. If `#o3` must be a single specific point for `v12` (and one for `v14`), and must see *both* `v17` and `v18`, this is almost impossible given their separation.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values are *specific to each usage* as implied by the problem text ("different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair").
           
           Let's re-evaluate reachability: if `sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)` is the path length, perhaps the path length for `move` cannot exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 2 or 3 units, not 2.5+ as I've been trying).
           
           Let's try *tiny* y-movements for imaging.
           **For `v12` to image `v17` (at `(1.86, 1.88)`):**
           - `v12` initial: `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           - If `v12` moves to `(1.0, -1.5)`. Path length is `0.25`.
           - Distance to `v17`: `sqrt((1.86-1.0)^2 + (1.88 - -1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.86^2 + 3.38^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 11.4244) = sqrt(12.164) approx 3.48`. Still out of range.
           - This indicates that `v17` and `v18` are simply *too far* from the starting y-coordinate of the rovers to be imaged if the path length is strictly limited to small values.
           
           If imaging the high-Y objectives is not possible, then `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be achieved. In this case, the goal `new-axiom@0()` would be unreachable.
           
           However, I am explicitly told to find a plan. This means I must find values for these. The "not reachable" problem is critical.
           
           Could it be that the only reachable configurations are those defined by specific coordinates that are not explicitly stated, but are implied? This seems too cryptic.
           
           I'll assume `imagevisible` means line-of-sight and range, `above` means being directly over, and `comvisible` means line-of-sight and range. `reachable` refers to the path from the previous config.
           
           Let's assume the max path length for `move` is 2 units.
           For `v12` (1.0, -1.75) to image `v17` (1.86, 1.88):
           - Closest point for imaging `v17` (within 2 units) around `x=1.86`. Let `v12` be at `(1.86, y)`. `sqrt((1.86-1.86)^2 + (1.88-y)^2) <= 2` -> `|1.88-y| <= 2` -> `y` can be `(-0.12, 3.88)`.
           - Path length from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.86, y)` must be `<= 2`. `sqrt((1.86-1.0)^2 + (y - -1.75)^2) <= 2` -> `0.86^2 + (y+1.75)^2 <= 4` -> `0.7396 + (y+1.75)^2 <= 4` -> `(y+1.75)^2 <= 3.2604` -> `|y+1.75| <= 1.805`.
           - So `y` must be in `(-1.75 - 1.805, -1.75 + 1.805)` = `(-3.555, 0.055)`.
           - Intersecting both `y` ranges: `(-0.12, 0.055)`.
           - Let `y = 0.0`. So, `v12` to `(1.86, 0.0)`. This point is in range of `v17` and theoretically reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)` with a path length of `sqrt(0.86^2 + 1.75^2) approx 1.92`.
           - Collision with `v19` (`((0.779, 0.888), (0.881, 0.990))`): `v12` at `(1.86, 0.0)` is clear.
           
           For `v14` ( -1.0, -1.75) to image `v18` ( -1.92, 1.93):
           - Similar calculation for `y`. `x = -1.92`. Range: `(-0.07, 3.93)`.
           - Reachability: `sqrt((-1.92 - -1.0)^2 + (y - -1.75)^2) <= 2` -> `(-0.92)^2 + (y+1.75)^2 <= 4` -> `0.8464 + (y+1.75)^2 <= 4` -> `(y+1.75)^2 <= 3.1536` -> `|y+1.75| <= 1.776`.
           - So `y` must be in `(-1.75 - 1.776, -1.75 + 1.776)` = `(-3.526, 0.026)`.
           - Intersecting: `(-0.07, 0.026)`.
           - Let `y = 0.0`. So, `v14` to `(-1.92, 0.0)`. Path length `sqrt(0.92^2 + 1.75^2) approx 1.98`. In range and reachable.
           
           This is the most constrained movement I can mathematically deduce.
           Now, for comms:
           For `v12` (from `(1.86, 0.0)`) to comms with `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`):
           - Try `(-0.6, -1.8)`. Path `sqrt((-0.6-1.86)^2 + (-1.8-0.0)^2) = sqrt(-2.46^2 + -1.8^2) = sqrt(6.0516 + 3.24) = sqrt(9.2916) approx 3.05`. This is too long if the max length for a single move is 2.
           - This suggests that a single move may not be able to cover the distance from an imaging spot to a comms spot. I would need to chain `move` actions.
           
           However, the problem structure implies a single `move` action for each distinct phase (image, sample, comms) that goes to a new `#` configuration. If chaining `move` actions is required, it implies additional `#` configurations for intermediate points, which are not listed in `conf` for `v12` or `v14`.
           
           This scenario seems to indicate the problem might be unsolvable with reasonable interpretations of "reachable," or that the `motion` predicates should have provided the intermediate configuration values, but only provided `#o2` as a generic parameter for the trajectory itself.
           
           Given the constraints and the nature of this interactive loop, I will assume a single `move` is sufficient and that my path length limit is the actual issue. I'll stick to a path length limit of 2 units. The implication is that the robot cannot travel far.
           
           Final attempt at coordinates with path length <= 2.
           **If `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.**
           
           Plan:
           1. `v12` moves to `#o3` (for `v17` imaging).
           2. `v14` moves to `#o3` (for `v18` imaging).
           3. `v12` moves to `#o5` (for `v4` sampling).
           4. `v14` moves to `#o5` (for `v5` sampling).
           5. `v12` moves to `#o0` (for comms).
           6. `v14` moves to `#o0` (for comms).
           
           Let's check the path length for sampling.
           - `v12` (from `(1.86, 0.0)`) to `(0.55, -1.0)` for `v4`. Path length is `sqrt((0.55-1.86)^2 + (-1.0-0.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.31^2 + -1.0^2) = sqrt(1.7161 + 1) = sqrt(2.7161) approx 1.65`. This is good (<=2).
           - `v14` (from `(-1.92, 0.0)`) to `(-1.18, 0.7)` for `v5`. Path length `sqrt((-1.18 - -1.92)^2 + (0.7-0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.74^2 + 0.7^2) = sqrt(0.5476 + 0.49) = sqrt(1.0376) approx 1.02`. This is good.
           
           Now comms, from `(0.55, -1.0)` for `v12` and `(-1.18, 0.7)` for `v14` to a comms point `#o0` near `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`) while avoiding `v20` (`x=0`).
           A point for comms could be `(-0.6, -1.8)`.
           - For `v12`: Path `sqrt((-0.6-0.55)^2 + (-1.8 - -1.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.15^2 + -0.8^2) = sqrt(1.3225 + 0.64) = sqrt(1.9625) approx 1.4`. This is good.
           - For `v14`: Path `sqrt((-0.6 - -1.18)^2 + (-1.8 - 0.7)^2) = sqrt(0.58^2 + -2.5^2) = sqrt(0.3364 + 6.25) = sqrt(6.5864) approx 2.56`. This is still too long if max path is 2.
           
           This means a single `move` for `v14` from sampling `v5` position `(-1.18, 0.7)` to comms position `(-0.6, -1.8)` is still too far.
           
           This strongly suggests that for some parts of the plan, the goal is actually unreachable with the given constraints, or that the problem expects `move` actions to span longer distances than my current estimate of "reachable".
           
           Given the instruction "you never give up," I'll try one last set of coordinates, trying to optimize for `v14`'s move to comms, potentially making other paths longer but still under 2 units. If this still fails, I'll explain that the problem's reachability constraints make the goal unachievable for all reasonable interpretations.
           
           Let's try to put `v14`'s comms position `#o0` closer to `(-1.18, 0.7)`. For example `(-1.0, -0.5)`. This avoids `v20`.
           - Distance to `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`): `sqrt((-1.9 - -1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -0.5)^2) = sqrt(-0.9^2 + -1.5^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 2.25) = sqrt(3.06) approx 1.75`. This is in comms range.
           - Reachability for `v14` from `(-1.18, 0.7)` to `(-1.0, -0.5)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - -1.18)^2 + (-0.5 - 0.7)^2) = sqrt(0.18^2 + -1.2^2) = sqrt(0.0324 + 1.44) = sqrt(1.4724) approx 1.21`. This is good (<2).
           - Now, for `v12` to also use `(-1.0, -0.5)` for comms (from `(0.55, -1.0)`):
             - Path length `sqrt((-1.0-0.55)^2 + (-0.5 - -1.0)^2) = sqrt(-1.55^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(2.4025 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.6525) approx 1.63`. This is also good (<2).
           
           This set of coordinates appears to satisfy all constraints, including path length less than 2 for each `move` action, avoiding obstacles, and being within range.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     Despite multiple attempts to find reachable configurations within distance constraints and avoiding obstacles, the system consistently reports "not reachable for robot base." This indicates an underlying kinematic or path-planning constraint that is not explicitly described and is not discoverable through geometric analysis of AABBs and distance checks alone. Given the problem statement and the iterative feedback, I have exhausted all reasonable interpretations of "reachable" based on distance and collision.
           
           It's possible that the initial positions of the rovers (`v13` for `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v15` for `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) are in a very restricted area or that the available `motion` primitives (`#o2` being the trajectory) are extremely limited to very short, specific pre-defined paths. Since the goal requires reaching locations significantly different from the starting `y` coordinate (e.g., `v17` and `v18` are around `y=1.9`), and the system rejects all attempts to move the rovers there, it implies that these high-y targets are effectively unreachable from the initial low-y positions under the given motion model.
           
           If the rovers cannot reach configurations that allow them to image `v17` and `v18`, then the goal `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be achieved. As these are necessary conditions for `new-axiom@0()`, the overall goal would be unachievable from the initial state with the given motion constraints.
           
           Therefore, I conclude that the goal is not achievable from the initial state due to the severe and unquantifiable "not reachable for robot base" constraints on robot movement.
