           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.054, -0.483), (0.131, -0.406)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, -0.435), (-0.006, -0.346)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.112, 0.391), (-0.033, 0.469)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.061, 0.366), (0.146, 0.451)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.092, -0.445, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.665, 0.747).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.271, -0.256), (-0.186, -0.171)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.051, -0.391, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.985, 0.175).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.073, 0.43, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.066, 0.998).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.103, 0.409, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.791, 0.612).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.229, -0.214, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, -0.124).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of a Robot Manipulation Task**
           
           My objective is to create a plan to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial location on object v11 to a target object v20. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both currently handempty, and a base at bconf v3. The robot's base doesn't move, as indicated by the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The goal state necessitates that all five objects should be on object v20, expressed as `on(object, v20)`.
           
           A key challenge lies in the nature of v20. While we have its AABB dimensions, `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, its actual position in the world is not explicitly defined.  The problem description states that if the position of the surface is not given, it is treated as a dummy surface. In order to fulfill the plan requirement, objects must be placed on surfaces whose position is given, but in this case, v20's position is not given, thus, v20 will be considered a dummy surface.
           
           The "dummy surface" rule poses a significant constraint: when the target surface is a dummy surface, the plan must involve placing objects on any other surface whose position is given. In this scenario, v11's position is implicitly defined by the initial locations of the objects currently on it, using the predicate `atpose`.
           
           This leads to a contradiction. If the plan mandates placing objects on v11 instead of the goal surface v20, it is impossible to satisfy the ultimate goal, which is placing objects on v20. Therefore, the goal is unachievable given the rules, and the initial state.
