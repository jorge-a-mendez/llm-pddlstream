           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Core of the Problem: Unreachable Configurations**
           
           My initial analysis confirms the goal's structure: to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, I need to satisfy a conjunction of facts, primarily related to obtaining and analyzing images and rocks. The challenge lies in the *unreachable configurations*.
           
           I broke down the sub-goals. I need to get images: `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, which comes from `take_image` and `send_image`. I also need to get analyses: `receivedanalysis(?r)`, which comes from `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. However, the current problem's set up is that `take_image` has a precondition `atconf(rover, conf)` where `conf` is a configuration that is **not** where the rovers are currently at, there are limited moves, and no way to move to the required configurations.
           
           I started by listing the initially true facts and realizing the `receivedimage` predicates and `receivedanalysis` predicates are currently false. My strategy was to find a plan for them and combine them.
           
           The crucial issue is that the rovers are currently at configurations `v13` and `v15`. However, actions like `take_image` and `sample_rock` require the rovers to be at different configurations, which I'll call `#o3` and `#o5`. The provided `move` actions do *not* allow the rovers to change these configurations.
           
           I went through the process assuming that `#o3` and `#o5` were somehow the locations the rovers were at, but those locations were unknown. I worked out the plan, but quickly realized that I need the rovers at some configurations, which means the plan must move them. Then I went back to the requirements and made sure I had a solid understanding of the problem space.
           
           With the current setup, all the required actions for imaging and sampling have preconditions that can *never* be met. The `move` actions seem to be ineffective self-loops that don't allow the rovers to move, and the constraints of the problem prevent the rovers from reaching the right configurations.
           
           Therefore, `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
