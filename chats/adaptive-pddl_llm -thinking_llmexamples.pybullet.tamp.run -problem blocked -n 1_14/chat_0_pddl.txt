User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis and Unreachability**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type (v17) "on" another object (v18).  Given the definitions, this means I need to find an object of type v17 that is both supported by v18 and at a specific pose.
           
           Initially, I identify two objects that are of the correct type: v8 and v12. Both of these objects are supported by v18 *at a specific pose* (#o2). The problem, however, is that both v8 and v12 are *not* at pose #o2 initially.  v8 is at pose v9, and v12 is at pose v13.
           
           To achieve my goal, I need either v8 or v12 to be at pose #o2. To change their poses, I would typically use "pick" and "place" actions. *Crucially, however, the problem constraints only allow the action `move_base v3 v3 #o0`*. This is the critical constraint: I'm essentially "locked" into the initial configuration.
           
           The available `move_base` action has no meaningful effect on the `atpose` of objects, therefore no change can be made to get v8 or v12 at pose #o2.
           
           In conclusion, I have to assume that the `atpose` of all objects remain unchanged. In the initial state, *neither* v8 nor v12 is "on" v18 (i.e., at the supported pose, #o2). Since the sole allowable action cannot change object positions, and the goal necessitates a change in position, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable* given these constraints.
