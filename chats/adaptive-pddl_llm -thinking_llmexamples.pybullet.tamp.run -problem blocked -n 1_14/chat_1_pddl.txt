           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Understanding and Planning**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of a specific type (v17) onto v18.  I've thoroughly analyzed the initial state, identifying potential candidates (v8 and v12) as objects of type v17 and their current positions.  The available actions, particularly *pick* and *place*, are crucial to manipulating these objects' positions to meet the goal condition.  Since the object v8 is already graspable and currently in the supported pose, I have decided to pick this object.
           
           **Plan Formulation and Action Sequence**
           
           I've formulated a straightforward plan consisting of two key steps: *pick* and *place*.  The essential reasoning is that I must use these two operators to shift object v8 from its initial position on v11 to the desired location, v18.
           
           **Step 1: Pick v8**
           
           The *pick* action involves arm v4 grasping object v8 at its current pose v9. The `kin` predicate is crucial here, as it validates the grasping operation given an available grasp and trajectory. The precondition `handempty(v4)` also holds true, as my hand is currently unoccupied.  The robot's base configuration *v3* is constant, as the only *move_base* action in the initial state moves the base to its current position, which is *v3*.  Given the restricted nature of the base configuration, it's inferred that the bconf `#o3` must be equal to v3. The *pick* action will result in an object being held and will leave my hand full.
           
           **Step 2: Place v8**
           
           The *place* action will place object v8 at a valid location, determined by the *supported* predicate. Given the initial state, placing v8 at target pose #o2, supported by v18. Similarly, the *kin* predicates are required to perform the *place* operation. The preconditions such as `atgrasp` from the prior state and `atbconf(v3)` from the base state must also be satisfied. This action assumes no unsafe approach or trajectories.  This action will leave my hand empty, and change the robot's state to achieve the goal of `on(v8,v18)`.
           
           **Goal Verification and Continuous Parameter Analysis**
           
           I've ensured that each action's preconditions are met and all effects align with my desired outcome. The `on` predicate, combined with the initial state fact of `type(v8, v17)`, will satisfy the objective.
           The problem highlights continuous parameters, namely poses and trajectories, that will be determined by a subsequent algorithm. However, based on the provided `kin` predicates, I've confirmed that the same grasp `#o1`, base configuration `v3`, and trajectory `#o4` will be maintained across both actions, simplifying the plan.
           
           **Conclusion: Success and Validation**
           
           Given the provided actions and the initial state, the two-step plan *pick* and *place* will solve the given problem, yielding the desired state where an object of type v17 will be `on v18`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **A Dead End: The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user's right. My initial plan was using actions that aren't allowed. The only action at my disposal is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. A no-op as far as object manipulation goes. Let's see if this drastically limited set of actions can even make a dent in the problem.
           
           The goal is to get something, specifically something of type `v17` (let's call it 'green'), onto `v18`. Right now, my initial state has two objects of the correct type: `v8` and `v12`. They're currently resting on `v11` and `v14` respectively.  The crucial part is the `on` predicate: I need `on(?green, v18)` to be true, and right now, it isn't.
           
           Thinking about what it takes to change an object's support in a planning problem, I know I'm usually using `pick` and `place` actions. However, with the ridiculously limited action set I've got, those are off the table.  The `move_base` action doesn't touch `atpose` or `supported`.  It changes my base configuration, from `v3` to `v3`. It turns `canmove()` into false. And that's it.
           
           Let's carefully verify the initial state. The initial state tells me that objects are *capable* of being placed on `v18`, but aren't yet.  I need to check for a 'green' object that's *already* on `v18`.  
           
           I run through both candidate green objects, `v8` and `v12`.  They are both of type `v17`, but the important part is if there is an `?p` for which `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` are both true, and, in both cases the support is `v11` and `v14`, which is a problem. They might be able to *go* on `v18`, but they're not *on* it yet. It doesn't matter what I know about locations, though, as no objects are on `v18` in the initial state.
           
           With a moment's consideration, I realize I'm stuck. I'm trying to move something from the initial state's support to `v18`. However, with the severely restricted action set, there's absolutely no way to alter the `on` predicate. I cannot pick up an object and place it on a new support.
           
           Therefore, the only possible outcome is that the goal is *unreachable*. It's a dead end given the constraints.  The `move_base` action just won't cut it. My problem is *impossible* to solve, because there is no way for me to move an object to `v18`.
