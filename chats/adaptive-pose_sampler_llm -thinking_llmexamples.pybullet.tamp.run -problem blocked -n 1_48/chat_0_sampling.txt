(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for this tiny square object (0.07 x 0.07) on a defined surface (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since the object is a square, its rotated bounding box is also a square, and the AABB of the rotated square's dimensions can be easily calculated.  The key is to account for the object's rotation angle (`theta`) when determining the bounds for placement. Given that `size_x = size_y = 0.07`, the half-extents will always be `0.07/2 = 0.035` or `0.07/2*sqrt(2)` based on the angle.
           
           Because the object is much smaller than the surface, I can place it pretty much anywhere within the surface's boundaries. I'll define these placements as (surface index, theta, x, y). All the objects will use surface index 0.
           
           To ensure stability and containment, the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) must fit inside the surface's AABB.  I need to compute the rotated object's bounding box using the `size_x`, `size_y`, and `theta`. Since the object is a square, the rotated AABB will always be square, and its half extents can be computed as 0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) regardless of the value of `theta`. The maximum AABB width is achieved at 45 degrees where its side equals `0.07 * sqrt(2)/2`, or about 0.04949.
           
           My plan is to choose 50 placements in total. I'll split this by assigning half to one rotational position and the others to another rotational position.  Since the object can easily fit, I can generate a systematic pattern within the surface. I will use only two angles. Let's make theta = 0 for the first 25 objects and theta = pi/4 for the remaining 25 objects.  Note that theta = 0 and theta = pi/2 are identical in terms of the object's AABB dimension, so I can choose either.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I'll determine the valid range for the center of the object's AABB. My goal is to ensure a good distribution of placements across the surface for x and y. Because the rotations are small, I can maximize the area by not changing the objects' AABB values so much and generate a 5x5 grid. The min-x and max-x for valid centers will be, respectively, 4.235 and 4.765. The min-y and max-y will be -0.565 and -0.035. I will make a grid of 5 points for the x,y plane and place the centers for `theta = 0`. The choice of `x = 4.27, 4.37, 4.47, 4.57, 4.67` and `y = -0.53, -0.43, -0.33, -0.23, -0.13` meets the criteria.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, it should be the same, but the AABB is 0.035 * sqrt(2), which is slightly larger. The min-x and max-x for valid centers will now be 4.249 and 4.751. The min-y and max-y are -0.551 and -0.05. I will generate a shifted grid of the previous one where `x = 4.29, 4.39, 4.49, 4.59, 4.69` and `y = -0.51, -0.41, -0.31, -0.21, -0.11`. These values are valid and meet the constraints.
           
           Finally, I will combine these grid coordinates with the defined values of theta. The surface index is always 0. The output is a list of tuples with these parameters.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've successfully placed object ID 5, and I need to do the same for object ID 10, a square of size ~0.0985 x 0.0985, on surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The critical part is avoiding collisions with object 5, which is already placed at (4.27, -0.53).
           
           First, I calculated the half-extents of object 10, which are about 0.0492.  Since it's a square, I'm using that value for both x and y. Then, for the rotated AABB, the maximum rotated half-extents are about 0.0696 (using `sqrt(2)` for the maximum `(abs(cos) + abs(sin))` term).
           
           I'll be generating 50 placements, considering two orientations: `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.  I need to stay within the surface's boundaries, adjusting my chosen coordinates by the rotated half-extents (0.0492 for `theta = 0` and 0.0696 for `theta = pi/4`) for valid ranges.
           
           Now, the collision avoidance is where it gets interesting. I've determined that object 5's AABB extends from 4.235 to 4.305 in x and from -0.565 to -0.495 in y. To avoid collision, I need to make sure object 10's AABB doesn't overlap object 5's AABB.  This is done by considering the AABB ranges in X and Y, and calculating the minimum and maximum ranges of a non-overlapping AABB for object 10.
           
           *   **For `theta = 0`:** I have 2 options. I'll need to choose coordinates where object 10 is either significantly to the right of object 5 or above it.  I've defined precise ranges to ensure this:
               *   20 placements: x between 4.36 and 4.66, y between -0.54 and -0.14
               *   5 placements: x values between 4.26 and 4.46, y=-0.06.
           *   **For `theta = pi/4`:** I have 2 similar options and similar bounds:
               *   20 placements: x values from 4.38 to 4.68, y values from -0.52 to -0.12.
               *   5 placements: x values from 4.28 to 4.48, y=-0.08.
           
           I've carefully planned all those placement coordinates, ensuring that the ranges do not overlap.
           
           I am confident that these placements will be stable.
