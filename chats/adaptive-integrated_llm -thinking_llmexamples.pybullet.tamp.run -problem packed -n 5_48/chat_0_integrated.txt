           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.183, 0.313, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.913, 0.409).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.173, 0.506, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.062, 0.998).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.182, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.568, 0.823).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.008, 0.249, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.325, 0.946).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.048, 0.332), (0.143, 0.427)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.137, -0.3), (0.227, -0.21)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.233, 0.263), (-0.134, 0.362)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.212, 0.467), (-0.134, 0.546)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.057, 0.2), (0.041, 0.299)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.095, 0.379, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, 0.233).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem: I need to get several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto a single surface, v20.  The "on" predicate is derived from support relationships, meaning I have to *place* each object at a pose that v20 supports.
           
           My initial state defines: the objects to move, their current poses (all on v11), the robot's base and arm configurations, and that the robot's hands are empty.  The goal, clearly, is for each of those objects to be "on" v20.
           
           I note that the initial poses of the target objects seem related to grasp points (#o1) and the target pose (#o2).
           
           The constraint is that the base can't move, specified by `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means all manipulation has to be done *from* the robot's current base location.
           
           **Analysis of Actions and Constraints**
           
           Now, the crucial aspect: I'm only allowed to use a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is a no-op that just sets `canmove()` to false. That is the only available action.  No `pick` or `place` actions are listed.
           
           To achieve my goal of placing the objects, I *need* `pick` and `place` actions.  Those actions would require the robot to have kinematically feasible configurations to pick and place objects, and the base configuration to be at `v3`, which is my only base configuration.
           
           With only the `move_base` action, I can't move the objects.  The robot is essentially stuck.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           Given the severe limitation of only having the useless `move_base` action and the absence of any `pick` or `place` actions, the goal is *unachievable*.  I cannot construct a valid plan.
