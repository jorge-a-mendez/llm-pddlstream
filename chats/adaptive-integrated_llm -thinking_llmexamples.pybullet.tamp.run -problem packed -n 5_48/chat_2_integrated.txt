           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning a Multi-Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've got a challenge: move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) currently stacked on surface v11, onto a smaller surface, v20.  I have two robot arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant here, currently in a "handempty" state at configuration v5.  The robot base is at v3. The goal for all five objects is `on(object, v20)`. This means each object needs a stable and collision-free *pose* on v20.
           
           First, I list out the initial locations and target poses of the objects, all initially supported by v11, with the goal of being supported by v20. The important part is that the PDDL syntax uses a single placeholder `#o2` for *all* the new poses on v20, but the instructions require me to define a *unique* continuous value for *each* object at that target pose. So, even though it's all `#o2`, I need to create five different, unique poses, one for each object.
           
           The available actions are `pick` and `place`, which all use arm v4, a specific grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3`, and a trajectory `#o4`. This means my base configuration `#o3` is a key parameter that needs to be chosen to cover a reasonable access and placement area.  The initial base location is v3, so a `move_base` action will need to bring the robot to `#o3`.
           
           Since all my pick/place actions use v4 and require being at the base configuration `#o3`, I'll start with a base movement.
           
           My strategy will be:
           1.  Move the base from v3 to a location `#o3`.
           2. For each object:
               *   `pick` it up from its current location on v11.
               *   `place` it on v20 at its individually-defined pose.
           
           The critical part of the plan is finding collision-free placement poses for each object on v20.  The AABB, or axis-aligned bounding box, of `v20` is small ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), and each object also has its own AABB ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy)). Since I'm aiming for "collision-free stable placement," I must ensure these object bounding boxes don't overlap, and each individual object is fully contained within the v20's bounding box.
           
           My first thought was to just pick an arbitrary order (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) for the objects.
           
           The object AABBs relative to their initial positions on v11 were also listed.
           
           I calculated object placement to maximize use of the v20 space while ensuring that the AABBs of each object stay within v20's dimensions, and with collision-free and stable positioning. After much calculation, I concluded that given the size of v20 and the AABBs of the objects, a good starting point is to place them along a diagonal for object x coordinate. I tried various arrangements of placing them along corners of a smaller grid. I tried 2-rows and 3-rows and a diamond but failed collision checks due to the tight packing of bounding boxes.
           
           Through more calculations, I am at a set of coordinates that ensures no collision of the AABBs. I have v18 in the center and v8, v12, v14, and v16 around the outside, avoiding collision and fitting the requirements.
           
           I've got the poses. I'll need to define the poses, `#o3`, `#o4`, and `#o1` within the action sequence.
           
           So, here's my plan in detail:
           
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#o3 (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           2.  `pick` v14 from `v15` on `v11`.
           3.  `place` v14 on v20 at the specified pose `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           4.  `pick` v16 from `v17` on `v11`.
           5.  `place` v16 on v20 at the specified pose `(0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`.
