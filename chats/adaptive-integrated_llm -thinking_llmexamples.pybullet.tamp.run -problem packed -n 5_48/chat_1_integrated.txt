           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.095, 0.379, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, 0.233).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Moving Objects onto v20**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get these five objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`, all onto `v20`. They're currently stacked on `v11`.  The robot has two arms, but only `v4` has the necessary `kin` predicates to work with. There's no need to move the robot base as it's already in the right spot (`v3`).  The provided `kin` predicates use `#o3` for the base configuration, which I can determine from the facts. Since the robot's base doesn't move and there is an initial atbconf(v3) fact, and the only "move" action is v3->v3. I can safely infer that `#o3` represents the current robot base `v3`.
           
           My plan is straightforward: use arm `v4` to pick up each object from `v11` and place it onto `v20`. There are no constraints, which simplifies things.  I need to compute the trajectories and grasp configurations, but those are part of the system's responsibility. I'll just represent them with continuous parameters.
           
           I need to come up with five distinct poses for the objects on `v20`. I'll use the provided AABBs to get valid positions. All objects will be at a `z` height of `0.781` based on the given poses to be consistent with the other pose dimensions. Since the given surface AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, the most straightforward thing to do would be to position them so they don't overlap, so the placement grid looks like:
           - `v8`: (-0.08, 0.08)
           - `v12`: (0.08, 0.08)
           - `v14`: (-0.08, -0.08)
           - `v16`: (0.08, -0.08)
           - `v18`: (0.0, 0.0)
           
           With those poses in mind, the plan looks like this:
           
           ```
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v20): (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v12 v20): (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v14 v20): (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v16 v20): (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v18 v20): (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)
           ```
           This should satisfy all the preconditions and achieve the goal. No complex reasoning needed.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable with Current Action Set**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a PDDL problem and I generated a plan involving pick and place actions, which is my typical approach for problems like these. However, the user's feedback makes it clear that all those pick and place actions are invalid. The *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's a pretty severe constraint.
           
           Now, let's break down the goal: it's a conjunction of `on` predicates, meaning I need to get several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto a specific surface (v20).  The `on` predicate itself is axiom-defined, requiring both `supported` and `atpose` predicates to hold.  So, for each object, I need to find a pose `p` where it's supported on v20 and at that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state, *none* of those objects are initially on v20. They're all on v11, supported at different poses.  To get them onto v20, I'd normally use pick and place actions, but that's a no-go.  The only thing I can use is `move_base`.
           
           The problem is, `move_base` only changes the robot's base configuration; it *cannot* interact with objects. It can't pick them up, it can't place them down, it can't change their poses.  It's like having a car but no hands!
           
           The instructions are also very explicit: only the provided action instances are allowed. That extremely limited set, which only includes the do-nothing `move_base` action, means there's no way to manipulate the objects.  Since the goal requires changing object poses (moving them to v20), and that can *only* be done via pick and place, it is impossible to reach the goal with the given actions.  The problem is *unsolvable* under these constraints.
