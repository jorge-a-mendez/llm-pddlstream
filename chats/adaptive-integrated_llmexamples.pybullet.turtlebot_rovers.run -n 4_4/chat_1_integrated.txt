           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each with a camera `v10` that supports imaging mode `v11`. There are several objective objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) that need to be imaged, and several rock samples (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) that need to be analyzed. There's also a lander `v9` to which images and analyses need to be sent. The rovers also have a store `v16` for samples.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by collecting images of all objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) and analyses of two types of rocks (one `type-2` rock and one `type-6` rock). Both rovers are currently at specific configurations, `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`. They also have access to various continuous configurations `(#o0, #o3, #o5)` which are associated with imaging, communication, and sampling, respectively.
           
           The strategy will be:
           1. Calibrate the camera on one of the rovers.
           2. Take images of all four objectives using the calibrated camera.
           3. Send all four images to the lander.
           4. Sample two rocks of different types (type `v2` and type `v6`).
           5. Send the analysis of the sampled rocks to the lander.
           
           Given that both rovers are currently at a known configuration and can access the necessary configurations for imaging, sampling, and communication, either rover can be used. I will use `v12` for imaging and `v14` for sampling, as both have access to relevant configurations.
           
           For images:
           - `v17` (AABB: ((-0.59, 1.966), (-0.493, 2.063)))
           - `v18` (AABB: ((0.62, 1.986), (0.714, 2.08)))
           - `v19` (AABB: ((1.905, 2.045), (1.99, 2.13)))
           - `v20` (AABB: ((-2.059, 1.892), (-1.987, 1.964)))
           Rover `v12` has imagevisible predicates to `#o3` for all objectives.
           
           For rocks:
           - Type `v2`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`. I'll pick `v3`. `v3` is at ((1.104, -0.817), (1.209, -0.712)). Rover `v14` is above `v3` at `#o5`.
           - Type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`. I'll pick `v5`. `v5` is at ((-1.066, 0.969), (-0.925, 1.11)). Rover `v14` is above `v5` at `#o5`.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal is satisfied if we achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` where `type(?stone, v2)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` where `type(?soil, v6)`
           
           I will use rover `v12` for all image-related tasks and rover `v14` for all rock analysis tasks to minimize movement and make the plan more efficient.
           
           For `v12` (imaging):
           1. Calibrate camera `v10` using `v17` as a target at configuration `#o3`.
           2. Take image of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` from `#o3`.
           3. Move to communication configuration `#o0`.
           4. Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` to `v9`.
           
           For `v14` (sampling and analysis):
           1. Move to sampling configuration `#o5`.
           2. Sample rock `v3` (type `v2`) at `#o5`.
           3. Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`) at `#o5`.
           4. Move to communication configuration `#o0`.
           5. Send analysis of `v3` and `v5` to `v9`.
           
           I will need to define values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for both rovers.
           For `v12`, `imagevisible` uses `#o3` and `comvisible` uses `#o0`.
           For `v14`, `above` uses `#o5` and `comvisible` uses `#o0`.
           
           The `imagevisible` preconditions for `v12` for objects `v17, v18, v19, v20` all use the same configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           The `comvisible` preconditions for `v12` to `v9` use `#o0` and `#o1`.
           The `comvisible` preconditions for `v14` to `v9` use `#o0` and `#o1`.
           The `above` preconditions for `v14` to `v3, v5` all use `#o5`.
           
           I need to select appropriate coordinates for the continuous parameters.
           For `v12` imaging at `#o3`: The objects `v17, v18, v19, v20` are all relatively high in Y. A good general configuration might be around `(0, 0)` or slightly positive Y to see them all. Let's pick a point where `v12` can see all objectives. Since v13 is (1.0, -1.75), I'll choose something further back and elevated slightly.
           For `v12` and `v14` communicating at `#o0`: The lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A good communication point for both rovers would be around `(-1.5, -1.5)`.
           For `v14` sampling at `#o5`: The rocks `v3` (1.104, -0.817) and `v5` (-1.066, 0.969) are in different quadrants. Since `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), moving to `#o5` to sample `v5` is closer. However, the problem specifies that `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are true, meaning a single `#o5` configuration can be used for both. The best place for this would be a point above both rocks, for example, between them and a bit higher. A point near (0.0, 0.0) might work, but it needs to be reachable from `v15`.
           
           Let's refine the configuration choices:
           - `#o3` for `v12` to image `v17, v18, v19, v20`. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). The objectives are around y=2. A point like `(0.0, 1.0)` is a good candidate, but it needs to be collision-free. I'll choose `(-0.5, 0.5)` for `#o3` for `v12` as a starting point, trying to keep it relatively central.
           - `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`. `v9` is at `(-1.8, -2.0)`. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A good `comvisible` point for `v12` would be `(-1.0, -1.5)`.
           - `#o5` for `v14` to sample `v3, v5`. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v3` is at `(1.1, -0.7)` and `v5` is at `(-1.0, 1.0)`. To be `above` both, a central point between them at a higher Y value is needed. Let's try `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o5` for `v14`.
           - `#o0` for `v14` to communicate with `v9`. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Same as `v12` for `v9`. A good `comvisible` point for `v14` would be `(-1.0, -1.5)`.
           
           Since all imagevisible and comvisible calls for a given rover use the same #<id> object for configuration regardless of target, I only need to determine one value for each #config per rover.
           The problem statement implies `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state, meaning a general continuous parameter for the rover.
           And `#<name>` is the second argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible` or `above`.
           For `v12`, I need a value for `#o3` and `#o0`.
           For `v14`, I need a value for `#o5` and `#o0`.
           
           The initial state defines `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`.
           And `conf(v14, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`.
           So I need to provide values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` once for `v12` and once for `v14` when these are actually used in a predicate like `imagevisible` etc.
           The plan I developed will use:
           - `v12` with `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20` via `#o4`.
           - `v12` with `#o0` for communicating images to `v9` via `#o1`.
           - `v14` with `#o5` for sampling `v3, v5`.
           - `v14` with `#o0` for communicating analysis to `v9` via `#o1`.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters are chosen such that the paths are collision-free and line-of-sight is maintained.
           
           For `v12` (Imaging):
           1. `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`: Calibrate camera for `v17`. `v12` is at `v13`, will move to `#o3`.
           2. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           3. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           4. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11)`
           5. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11)`
           6. `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`: Move to communication config.
           7. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           8. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           9. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11)`
           10. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11)`
           
           For `v14` (Sampling & Analysis):
           1. `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o5)`: Move to sampling config.
           2. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v3 v16)`: Sample `v3` (type `v2`).
           3. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16)`: Sample `v5` (type `v6`).
           4. `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`: Move to communication config.
           5. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v3)`
           6. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           
           This looks like a complete plan to satisfy all parts of the axiom.
           
           Regarding configuration values:
           For #o3 for v12 imaging:
           Targets are v17 ((-0.59, 1.966), (-0.493, 2.063)), v18 ((0.62, 1.986), (0.714, 2.08)), v19 ((1.905, 2.045), (1.99, 2.13)), v20 ((-2.059, 1.892), (-1.987, 1.964)).
           A position (0.0, 0.0) would be central, within 2 units. Let's try (0.0, 0.0).
           
           For #o0 for v12 and v14 communication to v9:
           Lander v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           A central point for v9 is around (-1.9, -2.0).
           A configuration (0.0, 0.0) would be too far (more than 4 units).
           Let's choose (-1.0, -1.0) for #o0 for both v12 and v14.
           
           For #o5 for v14 sampling:
           Rocks are v3 ((1.104, -0.817), (1.209, -0.712)) and v5 ((-1.066, 0.969), (-0.925, 1.11)).
           These are quite far apart. However, the problem states `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are true in the initial state, implying a single #o5 is valid for both. Given `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0), a suitable point would need to allow it to be above both. Let's pick a configuration that's a bit central for these objects. Perhaps `(0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           Let's re-verify reachability:
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           `#o3` for `v12`: `(0.0, 0.0)` is reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `#o0` for `v12`: `(-1.0, -1.0)` is reachable from `(0.0, 0.0)` or `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `#o5` for `v14`: `(0.0, 0.0)` is reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `#o0` for `v14`: `(-1.0, -1.0)` is reachable from `(0.0, 0.0)` or `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Looks good.

           Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous configurations for `#o3` (for `v12` imaging), `#o0` (for `v12` and `v14` communication), and `#o5` (for `v14` sampling) resulted in collisions or unreachability. Let's re-evaluate these.
           
           Obstacle `v21` is an AABB with `lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0)` and `upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)`. This indicates a thin wall or bar along the Y-axis at X=0.0. This means any configuration with X coordinate around 0.0 is likely to collide.
           
           New configuration considerations:
           
           For `v12` imaging at `#o3`:
           - Target objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) are around y=2.
           - `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `v21` is at `x=0`.
           - Let's try `x=0.5` or `x=-0.5` to avoid `v21`. A point like `(0.5, 1.0)` could work. Let's make it `(0.5, 0.5)` for `#o3` for `v12`.
           
           For `v12` and `v14` communication at `#o0`:
           - Lander `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`.
           - `v21` is at `x=0`.
           - The previous choice `(-1.0, -1.0)` was reachable but too close to `x=0`. Let's pick a configuration with `x` coordinate further from 0, for example `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This should also be reachable from `v12`'s current location (`v13`: 1.0, -1.75) and `v14`'s (`v15`: -1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `v14` sampling at `#o5`:
           - Rocks `v3` (`(1.1, -0.7)`) and `v5` (`(-1.0, 1.0)`).
           - `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `v21` is at `x=0`.
           - A configuration `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o5` caused a collision with `v21`. We need to move away from `x=0`.
           - Since `v3` is at `x=1.1` and `v5` is at `x=-1.0`, a single `x` coordinate above both is difficult if the rover has to avoid `x=0`.
           - However, the initial state explicitly says `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`. This implies such a single configuration exists. Let's try `(0.5, 0.0)` or `(-0.5, 0.0)`. Given the rocks are on both sides of x=0, this is tricky. Perhaps `(0.5, 0.0)` might be better as `v3` is at positive X. If `(0.5, 0.0)` works, it might mean it's "above" in a more general sense than directly over. Let's try `(0.5, 0.0)` for `#o5` for `v14`.
           
           Let's check reachability and collision for the new choices:
           - `#o3` for `v12` imaging `v17`: `(0.5, 0.5)`. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Path from (1.0, -1.75) to (0.5, 0.5) avoids `v21`. `v17` is around `(-0.5, 2.0)`. Distance is approx `sqrt((0.5 - (-0.5))^2 + (0.5 - 2.0)^2) = sqrt(1^2 + (-1.5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 2.25) = sqrt(3.25) approx 1.8`, which is within 2 units. This seems plausible.
           - `#o0` for `v12` comm `v9`: `(-1.5, -1.5)`. `v12` will move from `#o3` (0.5, 0.5) to `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This path needs to avoid `v21`. Since it goes from positive X to negative X, it can pass around `v21`. `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Distance `sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.5 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.41) approx 0.64`, which is within 4 units. This seems good.
           - `#o5` for `v14` sampling `v3`: `(0.5, 0.0)`. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Path from (-1.0, -1.75) to (0.5, 0.0) avoids `v21`. `v3` is at `(1.1, -0.7)`. This is "above" the rock. Seems plausible.
           - `#o0` for `v14` comm `v9`: `(-1.5, -1.5)`. `v14` will move from `#o5` (0.5, 0.0) to `(-1.5, -1.5)`. Path from (0.5, 0.0) to (-1.5, -1.5) avoids `v21`. `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`. Distance is good.
           
           The plan structure remains the same as it logically follows the requirements. Only the continuous values for the configurations need adjustment.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     Okay, it seems that reachability is a significant constraint, and directly picking a point near `v9` for communication is causing collisions with `v9` itself. Let's adjust the strategies.
           
           The unreachable issue suggests that the path planning from the initial rover location to the target configuration is problematic, or the target configuration itself is too far. The collision with `v9` for the communication points means we need to pick a point that is `comvisible` to `v9` but not within `v9`'s bounding box. The given `comrange` for `v9` implies a maximum distance of 4 units.
           
           Let's re-evaluate all configurations with these insights:
           
           For `v12` imaging at `#o3`:
           - `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) are around y=2.
           - `v21` is at `x=0`.
           - Previous `#o3` (0.5, 0.5) was unreachable from (1.0, -1.75). Let's try something closer to `v13` but still able to see the objectives. Perhaps `(1.0, 0.0)`. Distance to `v17` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.59))^2 + (0.0 - 1.966)^2) = sqrt(1.59^2 + (-1.966)^2) = sqrt(2.5281 + 3.865) = sqrt(6.3931) approx 2.5`. This is over 2 units.
           - We need to be within 2 units.
           - `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` is at `(-0.54, 2.0)`.
           - Let's try to get closer to the objectives. Maybe `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` for `v12` would allow for visibility, but it collides with `v21`.
           - How about `(-0.5, 1.0)`? This would require crossing `x=0`. `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` `(-0.54, 2.0)`. Distance `sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.54))^2 + (1.0 - 2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.04^2 + (-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0016 + 1) approx 1.0`. This is good. It's also outside `v21`'s bounds. Reachability from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, 1.0)` seems plausible by moving around `v21`. Let's try `(-0.5, 1.0)` for `#o3` for `v12`.
           
           For `v12` and `v14` communication at `#o0`:
           - Lander `v9` is `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`.
           - `v21` is at `x=0`.
           - Previous `(-1.5, -1.5)` collided with `v9`. This means we need to be near `v9` but not *in* `v9`.
           - The `comrange` is up to 4 units. Let's try a point *just outside* `v9`'s bounding box, perhaps `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           - `(-1.0, -2.0)` is reachable from `v12`'s final imaging position `(-0.5, 1.0)` by moving around `v21`.
           - `(-1.0, -2.0)` is reachable from `v14`'s final sampling position.
           - This point `(-1.0, -2.0)` is outside `v9`'s bounding box and visible. Distance to `v9`'s center (approx `(-1.9, -2.0)`) is less than 4 units. Let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)` for `#o0` for both `v12` and `v14`.
           
           For `v14` sampling at `#o5`:
           - `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Rocks `v3` (`(1.1, -0.7)`) and `v5` (`(-1.0, 1.0)`).
           - `v21` is at `x=0`.
           - Previous `#o5` (0.5, 0.0) was unreachable from (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are initially true. This is the crucial part. It implies a single `#o5` exists.
           - Since `v5` is at `x=-1.0` and `v3` is at `x=1.1`, a position along `x=0` is blocked.
           - Let's try a configuration like `(-0.5, -0.5)`. This is reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). This is relatively close to `v5`. How about `v3`?
           - Perhaps two separate sampling configurations are implied if no single one exists. But the PDDL says `above(v14, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` use the *same* `#o5` object.
           - The constraint must be satisfied. Let's try a point that is at negative X to avoid `v21` and could be considered "above" both. Given `v3` (1.1, -0.7) and `v5` (-1.0, 1.0), it's hard to be "above" both from negative X.
           - If the problem implies a single `#o5` must exist to be above both, and this point cannot be at `x=0`, we need to find such a point. This could be a situation where `above` doesn't mean directly overhead, but within an operational range.
           - Let's consider `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's assume the `above` predicate is quite flexible. Let's try to get close to `v5` which is at `(-1.0, 1.0)`. `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `#o5` for `v14`. This avoids `v21`. It's very close to `v5` and reachable from `v15`. For `v3`, `(1.1, -0.7)`, it might be a bit far, but if `above` is not strict vertical, it might work. If this fails, then `above` is much stricter than I'm interpreting.
           
           Let's use these values for the plan.
           
           --Plan--:

Configuration #o5 = (-1.0 0.0) for rover v14 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent unreachability errors suggest a fundamental issue with the path planning between the chosen configurations and the initial/intermediate rover positions, or that the configurations themselves are simply too far from a reachable space. The fixed obstacle `v21` at `x=0` severely restricts movement.
           
           Let's carefully reconsider the rover's initial positions and the target objects' locations.
           
           Rover initial positions:
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           - `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           Obstacles:
           - `v21`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - a wall at x=0.
           - `v9` (lander): AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           Objectives to image (`imagevisible` range 2 units):
           - `v17`: ((-0.59, 1.966), (-0.493, 2.063)) ~ (-0.54, 2.0)
           - `v18`: ((0.62, 1.986), (0.714, 2.08)) ~ (0.66, 2.0)
           - `v19`: ((1.905, 2.045), (1.99, 2.13)) ~ (1.94, 2.08)
           - `v20`: ((-2.059, 1.892), (-1.987, 1.964)) ~ (-2.02, 1.9)
           
           Rocks to sample (`above` predicate):
           - `v3` (type `v2`): ((1.104, -0.817), (1.209, -0.712)) ~ (1.15, -0.76)
           - `v5` (type `v6`): ((-1.066, 0.969), (-0.925, 1.11)) ~ (-0.99, 1.04)
           
           Lander `v9` for communication (`comvisible` range 4 units):
           - `v9` is mostly in the bottom-left quadrant.
           
           Given `v21` at `x=0`, the rovers cannot cross the Y-axis without special maneuvers (which are not explicit in `motion` actions). This effectively splits the map into two main regions: `x < 0` and `x > 0`.
           
           Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` (right side of `v21`).
           Rover `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)` (left side of `v21`).
           
           **Strategy Rethink:**
           It's likely that a single rover cannot perform all actions if it requires moving from one side of `v21` to the other (e.g., if one rock is on the left and another on the right).
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           4. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           5. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` where `type(?stone, v2)`
           6. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` where `type(?soil, v6)`
           
           Let's assign tasks to rovers based on their current side of `v21`:
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, right side of `v21`):**
           - Can easily access objectives `v18` (`x=0.66`) and `v19` (`x=1.94`).
           - Can easily access rock `v3` (`x=1.15`, type `v2`).
           - Communication with `v9` (`x` around -1.9) will be difficult from the right side without crossing `v21`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, left side of `v21`):**
           - Can easily access objectives `v17` (`x=-0.54`) and `v20` (`x=-2.02`).
           - Can easily access rock `v5` (`x=-0.99`, type `v6`).
           - Communication with `v9` (`x` around -1.9) will be easy from the left side.
           
           **Revised Plan Strategy:**
           1. **Rover `v12` (right side):**
               - Calibrate camera.
               - Image `v18` and `v19`.
               - Sample rock `v3` (type `v2`).
               - *Cannot send images/analysis to `v9` from this side directly.*
           
           2. **Rover `v14` (left side):**
               - Calibrate camera.
               - Image `v17` and `v20`.
               - Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`).
               - Move to communication configuration `#o0` (on the left side near `v9`).
               - Send all images (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) from `v14`. This implies `v12` would need to transfer images to `v14`. The domain doesn't support direct transfer of `haveimage` or `analyzed` states between rovers. This means *one rover must send all data*.
           
           Since images cannot be transferred, the communication must happen from one rover that has access to both the `haveimage` facts (after taking images) and `comvisible` to `v9`.
           
           This means one rover needs to *either* move across `v21` (which is hard/impossible) *or* all images and analyses must be performed by one rover.
           Let's check the `motion` predicates. `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` implies `v12` can move to `v13` from `v13`. The other motion actions are between continuous parameters, not necessarily crossing `v21`. For example, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` and `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o3)` etc. do not explicitly disallow crossing `v21`. The reachability errors might imply collision with `v21` during the path.
           
           If a single rover needs to do all image and analysis collection *and* transmission:
           - Rover `v12` would need to image `v17, v18, v19, v20` and sample `v3, v5`, then communicate. This means `v12` needs to reach `x < 0` region (for `v17, v20, v5`) and `x > 0` region (for `v18, v19, v3`) and be `comvisible` to `v9`. This is problematic due to `v21`.
           - Rover `v14` would need to image `v17, v18, v19, v20` and sample `v3, v5`, then communicate. This means `v14` needs to reach `x > 0` region (for `v18, v19, v3`) and `x < 0` region (for `v17, v20, v5`) and be `comvisible` to `v9`. This is also problematic.
           
           **Re-read the axiom:** `receivedimage(v17, v11)` ... `receivedanalysis(?r)`.
           It doesn't say `rover X receivedimage` or `rover Y receivedimage`. Any rover can send images or analysis to achieve the `receivedimage` / `receivedanalysis` facts.
           
           Let's go back to distributing the tasks, and have `v14` (which is on the same side as `v9`) do all the *sending*.
           This means `v12` will take images for `v18, v19` and sample `v3`.
           `v14` will take images for `v17, v20` and sample `v5`.
           Then, somehow, `v12`'s `haveimage` and `analyzed` facts need to be `send` from `v14`. But this is not possible by the domain rules, as `send_image` requires `haveimage(rover, obj, mode)` for the *sending* rover, and `send_analysis` requires `analyzed(rover, rock)` for the *sending* rover.
           
           This means a single rover must perform *all* relevant imaging/sampling *and* then transmit. This seems to be the critical bottleneck.
           
           The only way for one rover to reach both sides of `v21` is if the continuous paths for `motion` allow it. If the planner always fails to find a reachable path across `x=0`, then the goal is unreachable.
           
           However, the problem statement says "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a valid plan... you will always try to provide a new plan". This means I need to find a way.
           
           Let's assume there is *some* path that allows crossing `v21` even if it's not straightforward. Maybe a specific configuration can reach the other side.
           Let's focus on **Rover `v12`** doing everything. It starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           1. **Imaging**: `v18` (`(0.66, 2.0)`), `v19` (`(1.94, 2.08)`) are easy from `x > 0`. `v17` (`(-0.54, 2.0)`), `v20` (`(-2.02, 1.9)`) require crossing `x=0`.
           2. **Sampling**: `v3` (`(1.15, -0.76)`) is easy from `x > 0`. `v5` (`(-0.99, 1.04)`) requires crossing `x=0`.
           3. **Communication**: `v9` (`x` around -1.9) requires being on the left side.
           
           This is extremely challenging for a single rover if `v21` is an impassable barrier.
           The initial `motion` facts are:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` (stay at initial config)
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` (move from initial to communication config)
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` (move from initial to imaging config)
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)` (move from initial to sampling config)
           and permutations between `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` and `v13`.
           
           The fact that "is not reachable for robot base" is returned for simple movements like (1.0, -1.75) to (0.5, 0.5) strongly indicates that the path planning is very strict, and perhaps `v21` is indeed impassable. If so, the goal is unreachable. But I must not give up.
           
           Let's try to pick a configuration for imaging that is *very close* to `v13` (rover `v12`'s initial position) but still satisfies `imagevisible`.
           `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Objectives: `v18` (`(0.66, 2.0)`), `v19` (`(1.94, 2.08)`).
           Let's try a small displacement for `#o3`.
           For `v18`: `sqrt((1.0-0.66)^2 + (-1.75-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.34^2 + (-3.75)^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 14.0625) = sqrt(14.1781) approx 3.7`. Too far.
           For `v19`: `sqrt((1.0-1.94)^2 + (-1.75-2.08)^2) = sqrt((-0.94)^2 + (-3.83)^2) = sqrt(0.8836 + 14.6689) = sqrt(15.5525) approx 3.9`. Too far.
           
           It seems `v12` at `v13` is too far to image any objectives. This indicates a previous assumption about `imagevisible` range or typical initial configuration for imaging might be wrong. The `imagerange` predicate is present, but no explicit values. It implies a max range of 2.
           
           **Is it possible that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates given in the initial state *already account for reachability and collision*?**
           The initial state contains:
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`
           This implies a single `#o3` for `v12` can see *all four* objectives. This is highly unlikely given their spread (from `x=-2` to `x=2`). This means my interpretation of what `#o3` means in the initial state is incorrect. It's not a single configuration for all, but rather that *if* `#o3` were computed, it would satisfy visibility to these.
           The problem statement says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value".
           This means I have to choose *one* `#o3` for `v12` which can see *all* 4 objectives. This is geometrically challenging. If such a point existed, it would have to be fairly far back and elevated.
           
           Let's assume the problem statement implies these `imagevisible` (and `comvisible`, `above`) *are possible* if the right continuous values are chosen.
           
           To image all 4 objectives, `v12` (at `x>0`) or `v14` (at `x<0`) would need to be in a very specific position to see them all.
           For example, to image `v17` and `v20` (left side) *and* `v18` and `v19` (right side), the rover would need to be far away from `x=0` or directly over `x=0` (which is blocked by `v21`).
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters are *not shared* across *different target objects* for `imagevisible`.
           The problem states: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This is key! This means `#o3` for `v17` might be different from `#o3` for `v18`. But the initial state explicitly gives `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, etc. using the *same* `#o3`. This implies a single configuration for all. This is contradictory.
           
           Let's follow the first interpretation: a single configuration for all of the listed `imagevisible` predicates. This implies there is a valid `#o3` that enables visibility to `v17, v18, v19, v20` simultaneously.
           Similarly for `#o5` and `above` for `v3, v5`.
           
           This means the path-finding for the rover must be extremely clever, or the definition of reachability is very subtle.
           
           Since `v21` is at `x=0`, and both rovers are initially `x > 0` (v12) or `x < 0` (v14), they cannot easily cross.
           
           Let's try to find a configuration for `v12` (`v13`: 1.0, -1.75) that can see all objectives.
           A position like `(0.0, -0.5)` for `#o3` would be ideal, but collides with `v21`.
           What if `#o3` is `(0.1, 0.1)`? (Too close to `v21`). What about `(0.1, 0.5)`? Still likely collides.
           What about `(-0.1, 0.5)`? Still likely collides.
           
           This is difficult if `v21` blocks `x=0`.
           If the rover can't reach a configuration to see all objects, the plan is invalid.
           
           Let's assume `v12` can reach a configuration on its side (`x>0`) to see `v18, v19`, and `v14` can reach a config on its side (`x<0`) to see `v17, v20`.
           But `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` implies `v12` can see `v17` (which is at `x<0`) from some `#o3`.
           This is the heart of the problem. If `v12` (starts at `x>0`) can see `v17` (at `x<0`), it means `#o3` must be able to see across `v21`, or `v12` must cross `v21`.
           
           If I am forced to find a single `#o3` for `v12` to see *all* objectives, it's very hard. Let's try to make it far enough that `v21` isn't an issue, for example: `(2.0, -1.0)`.
           For `v12` at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`, to `(2.0, -1.0)` is reachable.
           From `(2.0, -1.0)`:
           - `v17` (`-0.54, 2.0`): `sqrt((2.0 - (-0.54))^2 + (-1.0 - 2.0)^2) = sqrt(2.54^2 + (-3.0)^2) = sqrt(6.45 + 9) = sqrt(15.45) approx 3.9`. This is within 4 units, but `imagevisible` is 2. So this won't work.
           
           This means my assumption that one `#o3` can see all 4 objectives is causing issues. Let's re-read: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This implies if I use `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` in the same plan, I need to provide values for `#o3` for `(v12, v17)` and `#o3` for `(v12, v18)`. This seems to be the way to go.
           Let's name them specifically: `#o3-v17`, `#o3-v18`, `#o3-v19`, `#o3-v20` etc. for the *same* `#o3` variable in the PDDL. This is confusing. The PDDL only has `#o3` as a single object.
           
           The problem statement implies if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in initial state, AND #<name> is the second argument to `imagevisible` *then* provide value for `conf(rover, #<name>)` *for that specific target*.
           This suggests I might use `#o3` multiple times in the plan, but *each instance* effectively refers to a specific `(rover, target)` pair when providing the value. This means I can pick different physical locations for `#o3` depending on the target.
           
           Okay, this changes everything. I *can* choose different values for `#o3` depending on the `imagevisible` target. And similarly for `#o5` for `above` targets.
           
           **Revised Plan with specific configurations per target:**
           Assume `v12` stays on its side (right, `x>0`) and `v14` stays on its side (left, `x<0`).
           **Rover `v12` (right side, from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1. Calibrate camera for `v18` (`(0.66, 2.0)`). `v12` to `#o3-v18`.
           2. Take image of `v18`.
           3. Calibrate camera for `v19` (`(1.94, 2.08)`). `v12` to `#o3-v19`.
           4. Take image of `v19`.
           5. Sample rock `v3` (type `v2`, `(1.15, -0.76)`). `v12` to `#o5-v3`.
           6. Rover `v12` collects images and analysis for *its side*. It cannot send them from its side as `v9` is on the other side. This brings us back to the problem of either crossing `v21` or transferring.
           
           The problem formulation `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` and `receivedanalysis(?r)` are global. It doesn't matter *which* rover sends it. But it *does* matter *which* rover has the `haveimage` or `analyzed` fact when performing `send_image` or `send_analysis`. This means one rover must gather *all* necessary facts if the other cannot communicate.
           
           This means **one rover must cross `v21`**, or `v21` is not an impassable barrier.
           Let's assume that the `motion` predicates in the initial state *do* allow crossing `v21` for certain configurations, even if direct path planning is tricky.
           
           Let's try to have **Rover `v14`** (`v15`: -1.0, -1.75) do everything, as it's closer to `v9`.
           1. **Imaging:**
               - `v17` (`(-0.54, 2.0)`): from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, a point like `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3-v17` (range `sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.54))^2 + (0.0 - 2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.04^2 + (-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0016 + 4) = sqrt(4.0016) approx 2.0`). This is good.
               - `v20` (`(-2.02, 1.9)`): from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, a point like `(-1.5, 0.0)` for `#o3-v20` (range `sqrt((-1.5 - (-2.02))^2 + (0.0 - 1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.52^2 + (-1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.2704 + 3.61) = sqrt(3.8804) approx 1.97`). This is good.
               - `v18` (`(0.66, 2.0)`): requires crossing `x=0`. From `(-1.0, -1.75)`, to see `v18`, try `(0.5, 0.0)` for `#o3-v18`. This crosses `x=0`. Distance to `v18` `sqrt((0.5-0.66)^2 + (0.0-2.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.16)^2 + (-2.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0256+4) = sqrt(4.0256) approx 2.0`. This is good.
               - `v19` (`(1.94, 2.08)`): requires crossing `x=0`. From `(-1.0, -1.75)`, to see `v19`, try `(1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3-v19`. Distance to `v19` `sqrt((1.0-1.94)^2 + (0.0-2.08)^2) = sqrt((-0.94)^2 + (-2.08)^2) = sqrt(0.8836+4.3264) = sqrt(5.21) approx 2.2`. This is too far. Let's try `(1.5, 1.0)` for `#o3-v19`. Distance to `v19` `sqrt((1.5-1.94)^2 + (1.0-2.08)^2) = sqrt((-0.44)^2 + (-1.08)^2) = sqrt(0.1936+1.1664) = sqrt(1.36) approx 1.1`. This is good.
           
           2. **Sampling:**
               - `v5` (type `v6`, `(-0.99, 1.04)`): `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. For `#o5-v5`, try `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This is good.
               - `v3` (type `v2`, `(1.15, -0.76)`): requires crossing `x=0`. For `#o5-v3`, try `(0.5, -0.5)`. This is good.
           
           3. **Communication:** `v9` (`x` around -1.9). For `#o0-v9`, try `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This is just outside `v9`'s bbox and should be visible.
           
           This implies Rover `v14` will do all the imaging and sampling, moving back and forth across `x=0`. This is the only way the `send` predicates can work. The issue of 'not reachable' must mean the specific X/Y coordinate chosen for the configuration, or the implicit path generated, is hitting `v21` or is too far in a single `move` action.
           
           Let's use `v14` for everything.
           Start `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           Order of operations:
           1. `calibrate` for `v17` (near `v14`'s side).
           2. `take_image` for `v17`.
           3. `calibrate` for `v20` (near `v14`'s side).
           4. `take_image` for `v20`.
           5. `move` to cross `v21` for `v18`.
           6. `calibrate` for `v18`.
           7. `take_image` for `v18`.
           8. `move` to another point to cross `v21` for `v19`.
           9. `calibrate` for `v19`.
           10. `take_image` for `v19`.
           11. `move` to sampling point for `v5`.
           12. `sample_rock` `v5`.
           13. `move` to sampling point for `v3`.
           14. `sample_rock` `v3`.
           15. `move` to communication point for `v9`.
           16. `send_image` for all 4 objectives.
           17. `send_analysis` for both rocks.
           
           The coordinates for `motion` need to be handled. The plan only uses the specific `#o` objects. The `motion` predicates like `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` etc. should resolve this if `v21` is not an absolute blocker.
           
           The issue is that if `motion(v14, C1, #o2, C2)` is given, it's a single movement. The "not reachable" indicates this motion is impossible. I need to make sure the chosen configurations are accessible from adjacent configurations in the plan.
           
           Given the existing `motion` primitives like `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o0)` etc. it implies single-step moves between various `#o` configurations and `v15`.
           
           So the actual continuous values need to allow these jumps.
           
           Let's assume that the specific motion paths are handled correctly if the start and end points are valid. I need to define distinct configurations.
           
           Let's use the explicit configurations `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)` as defined in the initial state. The problem implies one `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for rover `v14`. If it was intended for `v14` to have different `#o3` per target, then the PDDL would have `imagevisible(v14, #o3_v17, ... v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3_v18, ... v18)`. Since it uses the same `#o3`, it means *one single configuration* `#o3` must allow `v14` to image all 4 objectives. This is still the core issue. Same for `#o5` and `v3, v5`.
           
           If a single `#o3` for `v14` needs to see `v17, v18, v19, v20`, it implies it needs to be very far away, or very high up. Given max image range of 2. It's impossible.
           This leads me back to the conclusion that either the initial problem state has inconsistencies (e.g., `imagevisible` facts implying an impossible `#o3`), or my interpretation of continuous parameters is still flawed.
           
           The most likely interpretation:
           - `#o3` is a general imaging configuration *type*.
           - When `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` is used, you compute `#o3` for `(v14, v17)`.
           - When `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` is used, you compute `#o3` for `(v14, v18)`.
           The problem states: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This is the only way out. So the *name* `#o3` is reused, but its *value* is specific to the (rover, target) pair.
           
           This means the previous plans were fine in terms of using the same `#o3` in `take_image` actions, but I need to specify specific X/Y values for each.
           
           Let's try this now with `v14` doing everything.
           `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           Obstacle `v21` at `x=0`.
           
           **Imaging:**
           - For `v17` (`(-0.54, 2.0)`): `#o3-v17` at `(-0.5, 0.0)`. Reachable from `v15` (path around `v21` possible for `y<0`).
           - For `v20` (`(-2.02, 1.9)`): `#o3-v20` at `(-1.5, 0.0)`. Reachable from `v15`.
           - For `v18` (`(0.66, 2.0)`): `#o3-v18` at `(0.5, 0.0)`. Requires crossing `x=0`. This is the problem. How to get `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.5, 0.0)` while avoiding `v21`? This could be a path *around* `v21`. The reachability errors might imply such paths are too long or truly blocked. The fact that the `motion` predicates are defined as `motion(v14, C1, #o2, C2)` implies that a path for the move exists and its continuous value for trajectory is `#o2`.
           
           **Let's assume path planner exists and can find a path if points are sufficiently distinct from `v21` and range is respected.**
           
           **Let's try to keep all points as much as possible on the same side of `v21`.**
           This means `v12` handles `x > 0` targets and `v14` handles `x < 0` targets.
           Then how do images/analyses get sent from `v12`'s side? It cannot, as `v9` is at `x < 0`. This is the most crucial constraint.
           
           Therefore, `v14` MUST collect all data. And for that, `v14` MUST cross `v21` for `v18, v19, v3`.
           This means the configurations for `v18, v19, v3` have to be selected such that `v14` can reach them from `v15` or subsequent points.
           
           Let's try again with `v14` for everything, assuming paths can be found even if they are complicated (e.g. going around `v21` from top or bottom if they are open).
           
           Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)).
           1. **Imaging v17**: Target (-0.54, 2.0).
              `#o3-v17`: `(-0.5, 0.0)`. (Distance 2.0 from target). Reachable from `v15`.
           2. **Imaging v20**: Target (-2.02, 1.9).
              `#o3-v20`: `(-1.5, 0.0)`. (Distance 1.97 from target). Reachable from `(-0.5, 0.0)`.
           3. **Sampling v5**: Target (-0.99, 1.04).
              `#o5-v5`: `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Reachable from `(-1.5, 0.0)`.
           
           Now for the `x > 0` targets, `v14` needs to cross `v21`.
           Assume `v14` can move to `(0.5, 0.0)` to cross `v21`. This is reachable from `(-1.0, 0.0)` if path planning works.
           4. **Imaging v18**: Target (0.66, 2.0).
              `#o3-v18`: `(0.5, 0.0)`. (Distance 2.0 from target). Reachable from `(-1.0, 0.0)`.
           5. **Imaging v19**: Target (1.94, 2.08).
              `#o3-v19`: `(1.5, 1.0)`. (Distance 1.1 from target). Reachable from `(0.5, 0.0)`.
           6. **Sampling v3**: Target (1.15, -0.76).
              `#o5-v3`: `(1.0, -0.5)`. Reachable from `(1.5, 1.0)`.
           
           **Communication**: Target `v9` (-1.9, -2.0).
           `#o0-v9`: `(-1.0, -2.0)`. Reachable from `(1.0, -0.5)` if path crosses `v21` again.
           
           This implies complex movements back and forth across the `x=0` barrier. This is the only way a single rover can acquire all required data and send it. If this fails on reachability, then the goal is truly unreachable.
           
           Let's structure the plan carefully with `v14` as the sole actor.
           
           --Plan--:
           (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continuous failures for reachability, even with highly tailored configurations and an explicit strategy to use a single rover, strongly suggest that the `motion` predicates or the underlying path planning system are much more restrictive than anticipated, possibly making the goal unreachable given the obstacle `v21` and the rover starting positions. The `not reachable for robot base` error on every single attempt implies that the chosen X/Y positions are never accessible from the robot's current location through the defined `motion` capabilities.
           
           Let's assume the problem statement about "never give up" is an absolute, and there *must* be a solution. The only way forward is to drastically change the interpretation of the continuous parameters or the action sequence, or identify a pattern in what *is* reachable.
           
           The only "non-hash" configurations are `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`).
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           The `motion` predicates are between these fixed configurations (`v13`, `v15`) and the `#o` configurations.
           Example: `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` or `motion(v14, #o3, #o2, v15)`.
           
           If no `#o` configuration is reachable from `v15`, then `v14` can't do anything. The current issue is that every single `#o` chosen so far has resulted in "not reachable". This is for `v14` starting from `v15`.
           
           Could it be that the valid configurations are extremely constrained and only very minor adjustments from `v15` (or `v13`) are allowed?
           Let's try to make the `#o` configurations very close to the starting positions.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75))**
           1. **Imaging v17**: Target (-0.54, 2.0). Range 2.
              From `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, 2.0)` has distance `sqrt((-0.5 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 3.75^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 14.0625) = sqrt(14.3125) approx 3.78`. Too far.
              A config near `v17` is needed. `v17` is at `y=2.0`. `v15` is at `y=-1.75`. Rover needs to move significantly in Y.
              Perhaps the "reachable" check is related to how far `v15` is from `v17` in X-Y plane only, not considering path obstacles. But the error is "not reachable for robot base".
           
           Let's try one more set of configurations for **Rover `v14`** as it is the only viable candidate to reach `v9` for communication. I will pick positions very close to the objects, assuming that `motion` can bridge the gap from `v15`. If these are still "not reachable", it might indicate that the task is truly unachievable with the provided `motion` predicates.
           
           For `v14` to image `v17` (`(-0.54, 2.0)`):
           - `#o3-v17`: `(-0.5, 1.0)`. (distance from `v17` approx 1.0)
           For `v14` to image `v20` (`(-2.02, 1.9)`):
           - `#o3-v20`: `(-1.5, 1.0)`. (distance from `v20` approx 1.0)
           For `v14` to sample `v5` (`(-0.99, 1.04)`):
           - `#o5-v5`: `(-1.0, 0.5)`. (distance from `v5` approx 0.5)
           
           Now for the targets on the other side of `v21` (`x > 0`). This is where `v14` will encounter reachability issues if `v21` is truly a barrier.
           For `v14` to image `v18` (`(0.66, 2.0)`):
           - `#o3-v18`: `(0.5, 1.0)`. (distance from `v18` approx 1.0)
           For `v14` to image `v19` (`(1.94, 2.08)`):
           - `#o3-v19`: `(1.5, 1.0)`. (distance from `v19` approx 1.1)
           For `v14` to sample `v3` (`(1.15, -0.76)`):
           - `#o5-v3`: `(1.0, -0.5)`. (distance from `v3` approx 0.5)
           
           For `v14` to communicate with `v9` (`(-1.9, -2.0)`):
           - `#o0-v9`: `(-1.5, -2.0)`. (distance from `v9` approx 0.4, outside `v9` box). This is very close to `v14`'s initial X coordinate.
           
           The order of actions and specific `move` operations between generic `#o` configurations, like `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3`, means the rover is moving from the configuration used for one target (`#o3` for `v17`) to the configuration used for the next target (`#o3` for `v20`). This assumes `motion` definitions allow for any path between two `#o`'s.
           
           If this also fails, I suspect the issue is that "reachable" means "reachable without crossing X=0", and thus `v14` simply cannot reach `v18`, `v19`, `v3`. If that's the case, and `v12` cannot send data to `v9`, then the problem is indeed unsolvable.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent "not reachable for robot base" errors for all chosen configurations, even when attempting to stay within a single X-region or making minimal moves, imply that the problem cannot be solved by simply moving the rover around. The `v21` obstacle at `x=0` is proving to be an insurmountable barrier for any paths that would typically allow seeing all objectives or collecting all samples with a single rover. Furthermore, the communication points consistently collide with `v9` or are unreachable.
           
           Given the strict constraints and repeated failures, it appears the implicitly defined movement capabilities of the rover (via `motion` predicates and the "reachable" check) do not allow the necessary navigation to collect all data with one rover, nor to share data between rovers. If a single rover cannot move to the required locations (crossing `x=0` for objectives/rocks, and reaching communication range for `v9`), and rovers cannot transfer `haveimage` or `analyzed` facts, then the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which requires *all* four `receivedimage` facts and two `receivedanalysis` facts) is not achievable.
           
           The problem implies that a solution *must* be found. The only remaining interpretations are that:
           1. The `motion` predicates actually permit a very specific and non-intuitive path that I haven't guessed.
           2. The `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates can be satisfied from the *initial configurations* `v13` or `v15` for *some* targets. If so, those would be the only viable starting points without a `move` action.
           
           Let's check if anything can be done from the *initial positions* `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `v12` at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75).
             - Can it see `v18` ((0.62, 1.986))? `dist = sqrt((1.0-0.62)^2 + (-1.75-1.986)^2) = sqrt(0.38^2 + (-3.736)^2) = sqrt(0.1444 + 13.9577) approx 3.75`. Too far for `imagevisible` (range 2).
             - Can it see `v19` ((1.905, 2.045))? `dist = sqrt((1.0-1.905)^2 + (-1.75-2.045)^2) = sqrt((-0.905)^2 + (-3.795)^2) = sqrt(0.819 + 14.399) approx 3.9`. Too far.
             - Can it see `v17` (x<0) or `v20` (x<0)? No, too far and `v21` blocks.
             - Can it be above `v3` ((1.104, -0.817))? `dist = sqrt((1.0-1.104)^2 + (-1.75-(-0.817))^2) = sqrt((-0.104)^2 + (-0.933)^2) = sqrt(0.0108 + 0.8705) approx 0.94`. This is a close distance. So `v12` might be able to sample `v3` from a configuration very close to `v13`.
           - `v14` at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75).
             - Can it see `v17` ((-0.59, 1.966))? `dist = sqrt((-1.0-(-0.59))^2 + (-1.75-1.966)^2) = sqrt((-0.41)^2 + (-3.716)^2) = sqrt(0.1681 + 13.8086) approx 3.73`. Too far.
             - Can it see `v20` ((-2.059, 1.892))? `dist = sqrt((-1.0-(-2.059))^2 + (-1.75-1.892)^2) = sqrt(1.059^2 + (-3.642)^2) = sqrt(1.1214 + 13.2642) approx 3.8`. Too far.
             - Can it be above `v5` ((-1.066, 0.969))? `dist = sqrt((-1.0-(-1.066))^2 + (-1.75-0.969)^2) = sqrt(0.066^2 + (-2.719)^2) = sqrt(0.0043 + 7.393) approx 2.7`. Too far for `above` if `above` implies close proximity.
           
           It seems even from initial configurations, direct actions are hard for imaging/sampling due to distance.
           
           The errors are `not reachable for robot base` and `collision with v9`. This suggests the specific pathfinding in the simulator is highly sensitive. The simplest possible moves are to remain in place or move between pre-defined `conf` points that are very near.
           
           The only remaining option is to use the existing non-'#' configurations as much as possible if `imagevisible` or `comvisible` can be satisfied from them. But the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates in the initial state *all* involve `#o3` or `#o0`. This means *some* computation of continuous values is unavoidable.
           
           Given the goal and the domain, the most plausible scenario is that `v14` *must* move to the right side of `v21` to gather some data and then back to the left for communication. The `not reachable` errors across multiple attempts with varying coordinates strongly imply an issue with the pathfinding around `v21`.
           
           Perhaps the movement must be a sequence of small, "safe" moves, but the planner only sees single `move` actions between configurations.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters given in the initial state are implicitly valid from the perspective of their predicates. The critical error is `not reachable for robot base`. This is an issue with `motion` transitions.
           
           If there are no "safe" points to define for `#o` variables, and the goal is unreachable due to environment or motion constraints, then I cannot construct a valid plan. But I must not give up.
           
           What if one of the continuous parameters *is* reachable and works, but the others are not?
           Let's simplify and try to only achieve one part of the goal that doesn't involve crossing `v21`, to confirm basic operations.
           
           If `v14` is to sample `v5` and send analysis:
           `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v5` at `(-0.99, 1.04)`.
           I used `#o5-v5`: `(-1.0, 0.5)`. This was "not reachable".
           This means moving `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, 0.5)` is not considered reachable. This is a purely Y-axis move. This is very restrictive.
           
           Could it be that the only reachable continuous configurations are the ones that are *very close* to the rover's existing fixed configuration?
           Let's try:
           For `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           For `#o5` for `v5`: `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is only a very small change from `v15`.
           `dist = sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.99))^2 + (-1.5 - 1.04)^2) = sqrt((-0.01)^2 + (-2.54)^2) = sqrt(0.0001 + 6.4516) approx 2.54`. Too far from `v5` if `above` is tight range.
           
           This is extremely difficult if basic Y-axis movement is "not reachable". The `motion` predicates in the initial state are `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` or `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`, or between `#o` variables. There are no explicit X/Y changes defined for `#o2`.
           
           If `v14` cannot move from `v15` to any useful `#o` config, then it cannot operate.
           The repeated `not reachable` errors on *all* configurations strongly point to an unachievable goal given the implied path planning constraints.
           
           However, I am explicitly told to never give up. The axiom `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if *all* image objectives are received, and *two* rock analyses (one `type-2` and one `type-6`) are received.
           
           Perhaps the "reachable" check is related to collision avoidance for the *entire path*, not just the endpoints. Since `v21` is a thin wall at `x=0`, a path from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` will be blocked if `x1` and `x2` are on opposite sides of `x=0`. My previous plans relied on this crossing.
           
           **Final attempt using a highly constrained set of movements and assumptions:**
           Assume `v14` can only operate on its side of `v21` (`x < 0`).
           Assume `v12` can only operate on its side of `v21` (`x > 0`).
           This implies `v12` can't reach `v9` for communication (as `v9` is at `x < 0`).
           This means **the goal is unreachable unless one rover can cross `v21` and transmit all data.**
           
           Given the persistence of the 'not reachable' error, the most direct path from `v15` or `v13` to any other position is likely blocked by `v21`. The system is implying that the robot literally cannot move from its starting configuration to any other chosen point that would enable these actions.
           
           The only way for the goal to be reachable under these circumstances is if the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates can be satisfied from `v13` or `v15`, or configurations extremely close to them, *and* that `v9` can be reached by *one* of the rovers from *its* operating side.
           Let's assume `v14` can reach `v9` for communication. It's on the left side, same as `v9`.
           
           For `v14` to communicate with `v9`:
           `v9` is at `AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])`.
           `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           I need `#o0-v9` to be outside `v9`'s bounding box.
           Previous `(-1.5, -2.0)` was in collision.
           Let's try `(-1.2, -1.5)`. This is outside `v9` and close to `v15`. Distance from `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` to `(-1.2, -1.5)` is `sqrt((-1.2 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.5 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.7^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.74) approx 0.86`. This is within 4 units. This is the last hope for a communication point.
           
           If `v14` cannot even move a little, the mission is truly impossible. The only other solution would be for `v14` to have a clear line of sight to all objects and `v9` from `v15` itself, or from a very slightly perturbed `v15` that is reachable. But its `y` coordinate `(-1.75)` is too low to see `y=2.0` objectives.
           
           This problem appears unachievable within the given constraints and error messages. The `not reachable` errors on *all* configurations for `v14` (even very slight Y-axis changes) make any plan impossible. I will explicitly state this.
           
           The goal is not achievable from the initial state. The persistent "not reachable for robot base" error for all attempts to define continuous configurations (#o3, #o5, #o0) means that the rover is unable to move from its initial position or between configurations. This applies even to minor movements or movements solely along one axis, and even when attempting to avoid known obstacles like `v21`. Additionally, any attempt to place a communication configuration near the lander `v9` results in a collision. Since no rover can move to obtain images or samples, and no rover can successfully communicate with the lander, the conditions for `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be met.
