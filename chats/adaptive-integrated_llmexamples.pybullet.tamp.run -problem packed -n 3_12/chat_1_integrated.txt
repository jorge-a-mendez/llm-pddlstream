User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.052, 0.322, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.259, 0.966).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.052, 0.396), (0.151, 0.495)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.293, -0.197), (-0.209, -0.113)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.102, 0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.36, 0.933).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.1, 0.274), (-0.004, 0.37)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.251, -0.155, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.624, 0.781).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v14, v8, and v12. All three are currently supported by v11, which represents a surface. The goal is to place all three objects on surface v16.
           
           The initial state provides that `atbconf(v3)` is true and `canmove()` is true. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which will not change the base configuration and thus is not useful for picking or placing unless the base configuration doesn't need to change to perform the pick or place.
           
           The goal is to have `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. This means that for each object, `atpose` of the object must be true with a pose supported by `v16`. The only available pose for placement on `v16` is `#o2`.
           
           The problem specifies `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, and `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. This implies that arm v4 can place v14, v12, and v8 at pose #o2 using grasp #o1.
           
           First, let's look at picking up object v14.
           `atpose(v14, v15)` is true, and `handempty(v4)` is true. There is a `kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)` available, which describes the kinematics to pick up v14 from v15 using arm v4 and grasp #o1, resulting in arm configuration #o3 and trajectory #o4. We also have `atbconf(v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`. The `move_base` action would just put the robot in the same base configuration. We do not have any other `basemotion` in the initial state so we assume that picking and placing the objects will be performed from `v3`.
           
           After picking v14, we need to place it on v16 at pose #o2. The `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` is provided to enable this.
           
           Then, we repeat the process for v12, which is at v13, and v8, which is at v9.
           `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` allows picking v12.
           `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` allows placing v12.
           `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` allows picking v8.
           `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` allows placing v8.
           
           The actions do not have any unsafe predicates, so we can assume they are collision-free. The `handempty(v4)` and `ataconf(v4, v5)` are relevant for the arm v4. The `kin` relations indicate that the arm can reach the objects from the base configuration `v3` and current arm configuration `v5` (or some other implicit arm configuration for the trajectory #o4), and the base remains at `v3`.
           
           The plan will involve picking each object from its initial pose and placing it at the target pose #o2 on surface v16. Since multiple objects are being placed at the same abstract pose #o2, distinct physical poses must be provided for each object.
           
           For placing v14 on v16:
           I will choose a pose for v14 slightly offset from the center of v16.
           v16 AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Center of v16 is (0, 0, 0).
           A reasonable pose for v14 (AABB = ((-0.293, -0.197), (-0.209, -0.113))) could be (0, 0, 0.781) on v16. Let's make it more specific. Considering the AABB, v14 is a long rectangular object. For placing it on v16, a good position would be around the center of v16. Let's use x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.781 (assuming v16 is at z=0.781 and the object is placed on top of it).
           
           For placing v12 on v16:
           v12 AABB = ((-0.1, 0.274), (-0.004, 0.37)).
           I will place v12 slightly to the side of v14 on v16. Let's choose x = -0.05, y = -0.05, z = 0.781.
           
           For placing v8 on v16:
           v8 AABB = ((0.052, 0.396), (0.151, 0.495)).
           I will place v8 slightly to the other side of v14 on v16. Let's choose x = 0.05, y = 0.05, z = 0.781.
           
           All z values are set to 0.781, assuming this is the surface height on `v16`. The x,y are chosen such that the objects are within `v16`'s bounds and do not overlap with each other, assuming the objects are roughly centered at the provided coordinates.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of the objects or the robot's ability to manipulate objects. The goal is to move three objects to a specific surface. Without any `pick` or `place` actions, or any other `kin` predicates that involve different `bconf` or `aconf` parameters, it is impossible to achieve the goal of changing the `on` predicate for any object. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given actions.
