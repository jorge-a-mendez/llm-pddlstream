(Thoughts: **Summary of Thoughts on Finding Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on this task: I need to find 25 valid base positions for a robot, all within a 4-unit radius of a target point, and within the room's confines (x and y between -2.5 and 2.5). The robot's orientation will be set automatically. I'm given a set of fixed obstacles, which are defined as AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes), and I need to avoid collisions with them and ensure line-of-sight to the target. I'll also try to learn from past failures, though I don't have any yet, as this is the first request.
           
           First, I'm analyzing the geometry of the scene.  The AABBs help me understand the space. I note that the walls of the room are defined by the obstacles. The room's dimensions are x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5], so my robot must stay within that. There's a central pillar obstacle along the y-axis, defined by `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, which will be a significant challenge. I also have smaller obstacles to keep in mind, too.
           
           My strategy is this: I'll generate a set of candidate points around the target, ensuring they're within the 4-unit range and the room boundaries. I'll filter the points to avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles, and then prioritize diversity in the chosen positions.  
           
           My main concern is the central pillar. For the current target point, I'll need to keep it in mind.
           
           Since I don't have any past failure data, I'll focus on generating diverse positions first. It means generating points around the target, and filtering according to the given constraints.
           
           Here's where it gets interesting: the target point is `(0, 0)`. The central pillar, with its x-range of [-0.05, 0.05], makes this tricky. If the robot's base is anywhere *but* near the target, the pillar will likely block line-of-sight. The target itself is *inside* an obstacle, but I'll make an initial assumption that the target is still visible with some rules in place.
           
           I think a combination of grid-based and concentric circle generation will cover all areas well.
           I can generate points in 8 directions at varying radii around the target within the max range and then filter by the room boundaries and obstacle constraints.  The `x_coords` should be carefully chosen.  In general, if the robot base is inside, it's colliding.  If there's an obstacle between the robot and target, it's blocked.
           
           Let's test all these assumptions with `(0, 0)`.
           
           I can see that, given the target position at `(0, 0)` and the presence of the pillar, almost every position I generate *will* be occluded. Because the line segment from any point to `(0, 0)` will pass through an obstacle. My strategy should be to generate points and then let the system handle the line-of-sight validation. If it turns out that all positions are invalid, I did my best.
           In my `is_valid_position`, I check if `(px, py)` collides with obstacle 5. I will make sure the base is collision-free.
           
           I'll generate radii and angles.
           * `r = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.45]` (8 radii).
           * `theta = [0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270, 285, 300, 315, 330, 345]` (24 angles).
           I'll also generate an x-y grid and filter from this, with the central pillar in mind.
           I'll use `is_valid_candidate_position`.
           
           I'll filter out the points based on a strict criteria: Room bounds, range from target, and collision checks. I will also make sure the base is clear of collision. I round numbers to account for floating point comparisons.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for New Positions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. I've got a new target point: `(0.0, 0.0)`. This is a tricky one because, unlike the *previous* target point, this one is *inside* obstacle 5, the central pillar `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. The feedback on the last request is helpful but irrelevant here, as that was about a different location with different potential occlusions. I have to stay focused.
           
           Given the instructions, I need to come up with 25 new positions, despite the high likelihood of them failing the line-of-sight check due to the target's location within the pillar. I understand that, in a typical scenario, I'd want to avoid fixed obstacles. However, the unique situation of the target being *inside* a fixed obstacle fundamentally changes the strategy.
           
           My initial approach, which involved trying a circle of points around (0,0) with a radius of 0.5 and one point at (1.0, 0.0), is unlikely to work. So I need to go a bit further. It's safe to assume that every point outside obstacle 5, *including* the previous points and positions very close to the obstacle, will fail the line-of-sight test, because the pillar is physically in the way.
           
           I'm thinking: The system could have special rules, or my understanding of "line-of-sight" might not be precise here. But, since I'm told to generate regardless, I'm going to focus on generating positions that are as far from any object as I can whilst staying in the allowed boundary.
           
           I need to keep in mind a few constraints:
           1.  **Room Limits:** `[-2.5, 2.5]` for both x and y.
           2.  **Max Range:** A distance of 4 units from the origin (0,0), although the room limits make this a non-issue in this specific scenario.
           3.  **No Collisions:** Avoid fixed obstacles, mainly obstacle 5 (the pillar), which requires staying outside the `x` range of `(-0.05, 0.05)`. I also have to check that none of the coordinates I give will collide with any of the other, fixed obstacles.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           *   I'll propose positions with x `> 0.05` or `x < -0.05` (to avoid the pillar) and with `y` ranging from -2.4 to 2.4. I'll make sure they don't collide with the other obstacles.
           *   More specifically, I'll generate points and then check each of them against all the fixed obstacles, using a helper function `is_colliding_with_fixed_obstacle` I wrote for this. This will keep them within the right area.
           *   I will try to distribute points widely, ensuring x is outside the range of the central pillar.
           
           I considered points near, but *not inside* the pillar, in the initial round.
           I'm now checking these more thoroughly and re-evaluating the feedback that I've previously been given.
           
           For my chosen points, I had a total of 25 proposed locations. I verified each proposed location by hand. After careful consideration, I'm ready to submit these, knowing that it's highly likely they'll all report occlusion.
