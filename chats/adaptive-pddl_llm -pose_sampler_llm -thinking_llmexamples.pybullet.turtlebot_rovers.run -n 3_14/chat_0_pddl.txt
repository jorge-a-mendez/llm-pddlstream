           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unattainable: The Immovable Rovers**
           
           I've carefully analyzed the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking it down into its constituent parts. It hinges on satisfying several conditions, most notably obtaining and receiving images. However, the available action instances severely restrict the rovers' movement. They are currently positioned at configurations `v13` and `v15`, but to achieve the image-related subgoals, they *must* be at configurations `#o3` and `#o0`, respectively.
           
           The key issue is the nature of the *only* `move` actions I've been given: they are effectively no-ops. They simply reassert the rovers' current configurations (e.g., `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`). They do *not* allow the rovers to transition to the crucial configurations necessary for imaging and communication. I've double-checked and there are no other action instances that facilitate movement between valid configurations.
           
           Without the ability to move to the required configurations, the rovers are locked out of executing the `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions. Consequently, I can't fulfill the `receivedimage` predicates. This directly impedes the achievement of the overall goal `new-axiom@0()`, and I have verified this. It's essentially an unsolvable problem with the current action list. The conditions for taking images and communication are defined as visible in particular rover positions. However, given the defined actions, moving to the needed positions is not possible.
           
           In summary, the plan is unattainable due to a critical lack of movement capability in the available actions.
