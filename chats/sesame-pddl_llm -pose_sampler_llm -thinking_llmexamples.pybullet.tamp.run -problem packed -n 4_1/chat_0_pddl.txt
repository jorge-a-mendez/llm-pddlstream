(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a given surface.  The object's dimensions are almost square (approximately 0.081 x 0.081), and the surface is a square of size 0.27 x 0.27, centered at the origin.
           
           The core challenge is ensuring that the *rotated* object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface. I need to calculate `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` for each placement. Since this is a new request, I don't need to worry about colliding with other objects that *aren't* the surface itself; there are no prior placements to consider.
           
           First, I figured out the constraints based on the dimensions and rotations. For `theta = 0`, I can easily calculate `x` and `y` bounds, centering the object within the surface. Since this object is nearly square, rotation changes its effective bounding box very little. Rotating it by pi/2 just switches the x and y bounds relative to rotation by 0.
           
           However, since the prompt specifies that the object can be rotated, I have to ensure that the bounding box of the *rotated* object fits within the surface. So, the key is calculating the effective half-width/height of the object's axis-aligned bounding box after rotation. I know that the maximum bounding box will occur at `pi/4` (45 degrees), so I calculated it as `sqrt(2) * (object dimensions)/2`. So the maximal x/y offset is about 0.057.
           
           To cover all possible rotations, I'll strategically choose two sets of placements: one with `theta = 0`, and the second with `theta = pi/4`. I know I can easily get 25 points for `theta = 0`. For `x` and `y` coordinates, I'll start with 5 evenly spaced values from -0.09 to 0.09. Then I will generate a corresponding 25 for `theta = pi/4`, where I will sample the coordinates from -0.07 to 0.07.
           
           Combining these two sets of placements provides a good coverage of possible rotations and positions, and it gives me exactly the 50 placements I need. I'm confident these placements will be stable and fully contained within the surface.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Object Placements**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object ID 4 has been successfully placed at `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09`. Now, I need to place object ID 5 on the same surface, ensuring I avoid any collisions with object 4, which is crucial.
           
           First, I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, while keeping it free from collisions with object ID 4. To do this, I need to calculate the bounding boxes and account for any rotational variations. I’ve started by calculating the AABB of object 4: `[-0.1305, -0.0495] x [-0.1305, -0.0495]`.
           
           Object ID 5 has similar dimensions, so I’ll use both a 0-degree and a pi/4 rotation strategy. For the 0-degree rotation, the AABB bounds are straightforward.
           - Surface bounds at `theta = 0` are `x,y` in `[-0.0936, 0.0936]`.
           
           Now, I analyze object overlap to build an AABB to check for overlap, and I determine that object-5 must have `x >= -0.00813` or `y >= -0.00813` for no collision. This gives an approach that prioritizes placing the object.
           
           I'm checking a grid of coordinates and selecting those that meet my criteria. With `theta=0`, I use grid coordinates with  `x >= -0.008` OR `y >= -0.008`, and pick 21 valid placements.
           - I then reuse the same 21 placements with `theta = pi/2`, adding another 21 valid placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, I can use the same approach: place object `(x, y)` so that I fulfill `x_center_obj5 >= 0.00903577743141505` OR `y_center_obj5 >= 0.00903577743141502`.
           I then select 8 valid placements for `pi/4`, ending with a final strategy that combines.
           
           My final approach is to combine placements:
           - 21 placements for theta=0,
           - 21 placements for theta=pi/2.
           - 8 placements for pi/4.
           
           This gives a total of 50 stable placements. I'm confident this method will satisfy the collision-free placement requirements, and I’ll proceed to implement these calculations to ensure the accurate and safe placement of object ID 5.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem.** I've been tasked with finding 50 stable positions for Object ID 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 4 and 5. Surface 0 is a square space, and the other objects are already in place. Object 6 is a square, which simplifies things. The challenge is: *where* can I place this new object while keeping it stable?
           
           My strategy here is pretty standard: first, figure out the usable space on the surface. Taking into account the size and any rotations, I calculate the boundaries. Next, I mark out the areas occupied by Objects 4 and 5—they're obstacles, so I need to avoid them.  
           
           Since Object 6 is square,  the biggest rotation angle will be at 45 degrees. Then, I calculate the safe zone.
           
           I'm starting by looking at `theta = 0`, but the placement conditions at pi/2 are the same. After computing, it is confirmed. From there, I will start to generate points for valid positions.
           
           I'm aiming to generate 50 points by making sure valid coordinates work. The center can't be too close to either object; I've calculated the minimum distances I need to maintain.
           I know the region around the origin will be tight.
           
           I calculated if each pair of coordinates should be valid. The regions are defined by collision with obstacles. Using these calculations, I can generate enough. I'll need to do more analysis to see how exactly I can position all 50 objects and maintain their stability.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Alright, I need to come up with 50 stable locations for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with the existing objects: 4, 5, and 6. Surface 0 is a square with boundaries at (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 7 is a near-perfect square with dimensions of roughly 0.091 units on each side.
           
           To figure out where to put Object 7, I have to consider the bounding boxes (AABBs) of the existing obstacles. I've calculated the AABBs for objects 4, 5, and 6, and I know I can't let Object 7's AABB overlap with any of them. I'm focusing on trying to place Object 7 with no rotation.
           
           First, I defined the valid regions. I calculated that the center of Object 7 has to be between -0.0895 and 0.0895 for both x and y to stay inside Surface 0. Then, I wrote a function to check collisions.  The function takes the proposed center coordinates (x,y) and the rotation angle (theta) of the new object.
           
           Next, I created a 17x17 grid of potential center points for Object 7, ranging from -0.08 to 0.08 in both x and y.  I check if these center points will create any collisions with any of the obstacles.
           
           After checking each point on the grid, it seems there's a good region on the right side of the surface. So, I will take these 50 placements.
