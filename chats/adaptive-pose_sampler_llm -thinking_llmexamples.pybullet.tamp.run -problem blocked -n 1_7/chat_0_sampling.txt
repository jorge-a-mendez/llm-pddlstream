           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm planning to solve this placement problem.**
           
           First, I've got to understand the constraints. I need to place an object (ID 5, with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) 50 times on a surface (Surface 0, an AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)).  That means my x-coordinate must be between 4.2 and 4.8, and my y between -0.6 and 0.0.
           
           Since it's a square, rotation simplifies things but complicates things a bit. I know a *stable* placement means the object is fully *within* the surface bounds.  For no rotation (0 degrees), the x and y values for the center are easily calculated. I need to determine my valid x and y placement. I know that size of the object is 0.07. Then calculate the maximum and minimum point for the centers.
           
           Now, rotation adds a layer of complexity. With a square, any rotation is fine as long as object dimensions are considered.  I can use the object dimensions to place the center in all cases. In most cases the bounding box will expand.
           
           If I'm using no rotation, 0 degrees, the valid range for the center of my square, as determined,  is  `[4.235, 4.765]` for x and `[-0.565, -0.035]` for y. That should be my default for this object.
           
           For a rotation (theta pi/4) the AABB is 0.07 * sqrt(2) or, approximately, 0.09899. If I go with these values, my new min-max would be `x_center = [4.249497, 4.750503]` and `y_center = [-0.550503, -0.04950]`.
           
           To hit the 50 placements, I'll be using this approach:
           First, I'll place 25 of the objects with no rotation. I will grid the space so that I can use the existing dimensions. Then, 25 placements with rotation.  The result should be 50 diverse placements to place the objects as required.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object ID 10 on surface 0, and I need to come up with 50 stable, collision-free positions.  I've got the dimensions of object 10: approximately 0.0977 x 0.0977.  I'm also given the placement details of the existing object 5: `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565`, with a size of 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           First things first: I need to calculate the valid placement ranges, considering the surface boundaries and the need to avoid collisions with object 5.  I need to consider two cases for the rotation of the new object, theta = 0, and theta = pi/4 (45 degrees).
           
           For theta = 0, the object remains aligned with the coordinate axes, so I can directly use its half-extents (0.04885) to calculate a bounding box and create the range. The Surface is: `0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, and so X is: `[4.24885, 4.75115]` and `Y` is: `[-0.55115, -0.04885]`.
           
           For theta = pi/4, because the object is now diagonal and will fit more places, the effective half-extent gets larger, (0.06908); this is 0.0977 * sqrt(2) / 2.
           My calculations give X range of `[4.26908, 4.73092]` and a Y range of `[-0.53092, -0.06908]`.
           The bounding box calculation gives `X = [4.26908, 4.73092]` and `Y = [-0.53092, -0.06908]`
           
           Now, I need to account for collision avoidance with object 5, which is centered at (4.235, -0.565).  Object 5's effective half-extent is 0.035. For both rotations I will have to create a "forbidden zone" around object 5.
           I create the `collision condition`: `abs(x_10 - x_5) < (s_eff_10_half + s_eff_5_half)` AND `abs(y_10 - y_5) < (s_eff_10_half + s_eff_5_half)`
           
           For object 10 at 0 rotation, the collision zone `(x_forbidden_range, y_forbidden_range) = ([4.15115, 4.31885], [-0.64885, -0.48115])`. For placement, X must be in  `[4.24885, 4.75115]` and `Y` in `[-0.55115, -0.04885]` so those are my boundaries. It's a matter of logic to avoid the intersection of those two regions, which is where the placement can not occur.
           Then, I define a placement zone, which is either, within  `[4.24885, 4.31885] (above -0.48115)` OR  `(-0.48115 -0.04885]` for x to avoid collision.
           
           For object 10 at pi/4, the collision zone `(x_forbidden_range, y_forbidden_range) = ([4.13092, 4.33908], [-0.66908, -0.46092])`. With this, I have a placement zone, that is either, within  `[4.26908, 4.33908] (above -0.46092)` OR  `(-0.46092, -0.06908]` for x to avoid collision.
           
           I will use 25 placements at theta = 0, and 25 placements at pi/4. I define safe regions for each and choose appropriate combinations of X and Y values.
           
           So, I'm setting up a methodical
