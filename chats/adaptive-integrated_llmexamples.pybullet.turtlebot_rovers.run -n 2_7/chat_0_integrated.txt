           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires us to reach a state where:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true. These are true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true. These are true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true.
           
           We need to analyze rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil), and send their analysis. We also need to take images of `v17` and `v18` and send them to the lander.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           - **`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`**: This means we need to take images of `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` using camera `v10` and then send those images.
               - To `take_image`, the rover must be at a configuration where the objective is visible, the camera is onboard and supports the mode, and the camera is calibrated.
               - To `send_image`, the rover must be at a configuration where it has the image and can communicate with the lander.
               - We have `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This means both rovers can potentially see `v17` and `v18` from configuration `#o3`.
               - We also have `onboard(v10, v12)`, `onboard(v10, v14)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
               - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true.
               - We need to calibrate the camera before taking an image.
               - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` are given, meaning both rovers can communicate with the lander `v9` from configuration `#o0`.
           
           - **`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`**: This means we need to sample rocks of type stone (`v2`) and soil (`v6`), then send their analysis.
               - To `sample_rock`, the rover must be above the rock, have a free store, and be at the correct configuration.
               - To `send_analysis`, the rover must have analyzed the rock, be at a configuration where it can communicate with the lander.
               - Rocks of type `v2` (stone) are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`. Rocks of type `v6` (soil) are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
               - `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`. This means both rovers can be above all the rocks at configuration `#o5`.
               - `store(v16)` is available and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true initially.
           
           Available actions are only `move` and `drop_rock`. This is highly restrictive.
           The provided action instances are:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           None of the provided actions allow us to take images, calibrate cameras, send images, sample rocks, or send analysis.
           Since the goal predicates `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` can only be achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions respectively, and these actions are not in the list of available actions (nor are `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`), it is impossible to achieve the goal from the initial state given the allowed actions. The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions. The goal predicates `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` can only be achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. However, these actions (and their prerequisite actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`) are not present in the list of allowed action instances provided in the problem description.
