User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.088, 0.338), (0.172, 0.422)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.102, -0.528), (-0.014, -0.44)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.146, 0.445), (-0.047, 0.544)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.13, 0.38, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.62, 0.785).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.065, 0.5), (0.141, 0.577)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.058, -0.484, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.807, 0.591).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.096, 0.495, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.398, 0.917).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.103, 0.538, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.049, 0.999).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan's Unreachability**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. I'm tasked with devising a plan to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) from surface v11 to surface v18. The robot's base is fixed at v3, and it has two empty arms, v4 and v6. Standard planning dictates that to achieve this, I'd need a sequence of pick-and-place actions. The goal clearly states that the objects need to be *on* v18.
           
           Initially, each object is *on* v11, supported by their respective poses. To get them to v18, I'd need to pick them up (e.g., using arm v4 or v6, picking from pose v9 for object v8), and place them down *on* v18, at new poses.
           
           However, the problem throws a major wrench into the works. The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action instance does *nothing*. It just says "move the base from v3 to v3". In other words, I'm restricted to moving the robot's base to its current location.
           
           The fundamental issue is this: *I need to manipulate objects, but I'm only given an action that doesn't manipulate anything*.  I can't pick up, place, or otherwise change the *atpose* or *supported* predicates, which are crucial for achieving the goal.
           
           The initial state shows each object at a specific pose on v11:
           *   v8 at pose v9
           *   v12 at pose v13
           *   v14 at pose v15
           *   v16 at pose v17
           
           The goal demands that they all be *on* v18. To make this change, pick and place actions must be employed.
           
           The instruction explicitly states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that pick and place actions, *are prohibited*.
           
           Because I am only allowed to use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not impact object positions or support, the objective is **impossible** to achieve.  It's a straightforward conclusion: With no actions that *move* objects, I can't move the objects, and thus the goal is unreachable.
