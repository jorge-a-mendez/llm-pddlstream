User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.137, 0.194), (-0.054, 0.277)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.152, 0.45), (-0.077, 0.525)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.096, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, -0.107).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.026, 0.275), (0.072, 0.373)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.114, 0.488, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.734, 0.68).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.023, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.948, -0.317).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **The Path to Placement: A Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Currently, these objects rest on `v11` at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15`, respectively. The plan is straightforward: use the available robot arm, `v4`, to pick each object from `v11` and place it onto `v16`. Since the robot's base is static at configuration `v3`, the movements are solely arm-based.
           
           The plan hinges on a sequence of pick-and-place actions, utilizing the robot's kinematic capabilities as specified by the `kin` predicates. The challenges are (1) collision avoidance during placement on `v16`, a relatively small surface, and (2) ensuring stable placements. To address this, I've strategically chosen placement locations on `v16`:
           
           *   `v8`: Placed at (0, 0.08, 0.781) with a theta of 0
           *   `v12`: Placed at (0, -0.08, 0.781) with a theta of 0
           *   `v14`: Placed at (0, 0, 0.781) with a theta of 0
           
           These poses ensure each object fits within the bounds of `v16` without overlap.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating the Problem: An Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user's right. My previous plan was DOA. I was relying on `pick` and `place`, which aren't even *valid actions* according to the provided list. All I've got is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which is essentially a no-op, moving the base from its current position `v3` to, well, the same `v3` with trajectory `#o0`.  Not exactly ambitious.
           
           Let's recap the starting situation and the target. Right now, I've got three objects, v8, v12, and v14, all resting on surface v11. The target is to get them all *onto* a new surface, v16.  The `on` predicate requires *both* support and the correct position.  So, I need to manipulate the `supported` and `atpose` predicates for each object to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           The problem? I can't *do* anything that changes their positions.  `pick` and `place` are out.  I'm stuck with a base movement that gets me... nowhere.  Since I lack the means to alter `supported` or `atpose` for v8, v12, or v14, the target state is simply *unattainable*. I cannot physically achieve this goal with the available resources. This constraint forces me to conclude that achieving the target state is logically impossible under the provided constraints.
