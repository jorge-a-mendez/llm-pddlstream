User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.096, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, -0.107).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.026, 0.275), (0.072, 0.373)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.137, 0.194), (-0.054, 0.277)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.114, 0.488, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.734, 0.68).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.152, 0.45), (-0.077, 0.525)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.023, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.948, -0.317).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to move objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  The initial state reveals they are currently situated on surface `v11`.  The task calls for a TAMP (Task and Motion Planning) solution, leveraging actions that involve continuous parameters.  Crucially, I'm interpreting the prompt as implying that action instances are *implicitly* generated; that is, the *discrete* components of the actions must exist in the given list, but the continuous parameters are calculated.
           
           The robot in this scene has two arms: `v4` and `v6`, both currently unoccupied ( `handempty` ).  The robot's base is positioned at `v3`. The only explicitly provided action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which results in zero cost and is essentially a "no-op" since it doesn't move the base. Therefore, I will need to use `pick` and `place` actions which require continuous parameters, like kinemtics (`kin`) and trajectories (`atraj`). I'm going to assume I'm allowed to use them.
           
           The planning problem boils down to placing `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Since I'm confined to the provided action primitives plus implicitly generated ones, a sequential pick-and-place strategy presents itself as the most direct solution.
           
           Each object needs to be moved individually.  The plan involves the following steps:
           
           1.  Pick up `v8` from its pose `v9`.
           2.  Place `v8` onto `v16`.  I will need to create a new `pose` object (a placeholder object, indicated by #), which I'll call `#o2_v8_v16` for where `v8` goes.
           3.  Pick up `v12` from its pose `v13`.
           4.  Place `v12` onto `v16` at a distinct target pose; I'll call it `#o2_v12_v16`.
           5.  Pick up `v14` from its pose `v15`.
           6.  Place `v14` onto `v16` at a distinct target pose; I'll call it `#o2_v14_v16`.
           
           The total cost of this plan is, therefore, the sum of the pick and place costs, which is 6. The motion cost of `move_base` is zero.
           
           The success of the plan hinges on two critical aspects:
           *   Successfully calculating the poses for object placement onto `v16`.
           *   Generating valid arm trajectories for the `pick` and `place` operations.
           I will have to calculate a valid `pose` for `#o2` so that I can provide that as a continuous parameter for the `place` action. These values will be calculated. I will determine these placement coordinates based on the dimensions of the objects and the available space on `v16`. These continuous object parameters (kin and traj) are typically "computed" by a separate algorithm in a TAMP planner.
           
           The final consideration is the risk of collision or unsafe positioning. I need to ensure there are no occlusions or collisions during each step of the plan. I've considered this in the calculation of `placement`. The provided facts related to the initial placement and the prompt's specifications regarding continuous object parameters suggest that the trajectory generation and safety checks are integrated components of the planner.
           
           Finally, the structure of the plan relies on interpreting implicit action instances and their continuous components. The cost of the plan is the pick and place costs of each object.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #atraj1) , (place v4 v8 #o2_v8_v16 #o1 v3 #atraj4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #atraj2) , (place v4 v12 #o2_v12_v16 #o1 v3 #atraj5) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #atraj3) , (place v4 v14 #o2_v14_v16 #o1 v3 #atraj6)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, so the initial plan was rejected – no surprise there, it seems the system's expecting only a *very* specific action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's my only allowed move, and it's constrained by `basemotion`, `atbconf`, and `canmove` preconditions, all of which are initially true. The action's effects are a bit of a head-scratcher: it modifies `atbconf`, but it cancels and immediately re-establishes the truth, so it's a no-op. It also sets `canmove` to false.  
           
           My goal, as you know, is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  The system's definition of `on` tells me I need to ensure both `supported` and `atpose` predicates hold true for each of those objects with respect to `v16`. Right now, I can see that none of those objects are at pose on `v16`.
           
           The initial state reveals a bit of the current reality:  `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are supported by `v11`, and `v14` is supported on `#o2`, and `v12` is supported on `#o2`, and `v8` is supported on `#o2`. I can see all of these are currently on the pose of `v11`.
           
           Here's the problem: The permitted action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, *doesn't* touch the `atpose` predicate.  It just... moves the base? At best, it's a system state toggle and is not a plan toward the goal. And it *certainly* doesn't allow for manipulating objects, picking them up, placing them down, or doing anything to change their `atpose` status.  Given these constraints, there's absolutely no way to reach the desired state, at least with the *current* set of valid actions. This has to be an issue of action granularity.
