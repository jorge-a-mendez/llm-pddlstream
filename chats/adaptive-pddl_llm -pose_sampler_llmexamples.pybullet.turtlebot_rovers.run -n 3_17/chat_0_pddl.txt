           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. Both rovers are at specific configurations, v13 and v15 respectively, and their storage units are free. There are several objectives (v17, v18, v19) and various rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of different types (v2 for v1, v3, v4 and v6 for v5, v7, v8). A lander v9 is also present for communication. The rovers have the capability to move, take images, calibrate cameras, send images, sample rocks, send analysis, and drop rocks.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be expanded based on the axiom definition to:
           `atconf(v12, v13)` AND `atconf(v14, v15)` AND `free(v12, v16)` AND `free(v14, v16)` AND `receivedimage(v17, v11)` AND `receivedimage(v18, v11)` AND `receivedimage(v19, v11)` AND `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)` AND `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This requires taking images of objectives v17, v18, v19 using mode v11 and camera v10 (which supports v11), and then sending them to lander v9.
           3. `type(?stone, v2)` AND `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type v2 (e.g., v1, v3, or v4) and send its analysis.
           4. `type(?soil, v6)` AND `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze a rock of type v6 (e.g., v5, v7, or v8) and send its analysis.
           
           We only have `move` and `drop_rock` as allowed actions. However, looking at the goal and initial state, `move` actions are already tautological as the rovers are already at the target configurations (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13` does not change `atconf(v12,v13)`). The `drop_rock` actions are also not relevant as the stores are already free.
           The core of the goal involves `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These are achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, which in turn require `haveimage` (from `take_image`) and `analyzed` (from `sample_rock`). These actions are *not* provided in the list of allowed actions. Since only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are allowed and they cannot achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The allowed actions are `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.
           The initial state already satisfies `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`.
           To satisfy the rest of the goal, we need to:
           - Receive images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` in mode `v11`. This requires `take_image` and `send_image` actions.
           - Receive analysis for a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`. This requires `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           None of these necessary actions (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are present in the list of allowed actions. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved with the given allowed actions.
