           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan:**  I've got a target point and need to find three suitable robot base locations. The coordinates must be within 2 units of the target, and the robot's x and y must be within -2.5 and 2.5. I've got to watch out for those pesky fixed obstacles too. Since the robot's orientation is automatically set to face the target, line-of-sight is critical.
           
           First, I looked over the AABBs to get a handle on the workspace.  The outer boundaries are straightforward. There's this vertical wall at x=0 that's going to be a problem. It effectively splits my workspace in half. The target point is at (0.009, 1.341), which is *inside* that pesky vertical wall!  That's a head-scratcher.  Typically, target points *aren't* inside obstacles.
           
           So, here's my thinking: Either there's a slight error, or line-of-sight means something different here.  Perhaps the target is *at the surface* of the wall, and I need to position the robot so it can "see" over/around. Since the target's x is positive, I'm assuming it's on the positive-x side of the wall. Thus, I'll treat my effective target point as being *on the right side* of the wall at x=0, which means an effective target of x = 0.05.
           
           Now, my strategy: The robot should be positioned *to the right* of the wall (x > 0.05) to avoid a collision, keeping in mind my distance-to-target constraint and workspace limits. Given that this problem wants me to provide some diversity, my strategy is to provide positions at different angles from the *effective* target (x=0.05, y = 1.341). This should ensure the algorithm finds three locations and it also provides diverse locations.
           
           I've carefully considered these locations and concluded the following, and will provide them:
           
           **P1: (1.05, 1.341)**  - This position is to the right of the effective target.
           
           **P2: (0.1, 2.341)** - This position is above and to the right of the effective target.
           
           **P3: (1.55, 0.341)** - This position is below and to the right of the effective target.
           
           I will also make sure the effective distance calculation is less than two and the x and y coordinates fall within the boundaries of the workspace.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Target and Generating New Positions**
           
           Alright, this is the second time I'm dealing with this target point: `(0.00949439115781448, 1.341103683679165)`. It's the same as the previous request, which means the previous suggestions might have failed, though I don't know *why*. The problem mentions "non-fixed obstacles" and the need to learn from previous failures, but without knowing *which* position failed or the specific reason, I'm at a bit of a disadvantage.
           
           My previous analysis correctly identified that the target lies within obstacle 5: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. Given that the target's X-coordinate is `0.009494`, this is clearly true. This leads me to believe the most logical approach is to treat the effective target as `(0.05, 1.341103683679165)` and aim for positions with `x > 0.05` to get a line-of-sight. I checked the previous positions: `(1.05 1.341)`, `(0.1 2.341)`, and `(1.55 0.341)`, all of which met the `x > 0.05` criterion and fell within the maximum range of 2.
           
           Since the old positions are within spec, I will assume those positions might have collided with a dynamic obstacle, and generate new and diverse positions based on the same reasoning.
           
           Let's start by reconfirming the effective target point and maximum range:
           *   Effective Target: `T_eff = (0.05, 1.341)`
           *   Max Range: 2
           
           Now, let's craft a new set of positions:
           1.  **To the Right and Further Out:** `(1.85, 1.341)`. This provides a good view of the target. The distance is 1.8 units, valid.
           2.  **Below and to the Right:** `(1.05, -0.159)`. The distance to `T_eff` is about 1.8 units and is far enough away from the target that it should not be obstructed by obstacle 5. Valid.
           3.  **Above and to the Right:** `(1.65, 2.4)`. The distance to `T_eff` is approximately 1.918 units. This will provide a more angled view. Valid.
           
           These new positions are distinct, diverse, meet the `x > 0.05` criteria, and are within the maximum range. They maintain the same critical understanding that the target is inside obstacle 5. I am ready to evaluate these new positions and iterate if needed.

(Thoughts: **Revised Approach for Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so we're back at it. It's the third time I've been asked for robot base positions for this target `(0.00949439115781448, 1.341103683679165)`. Based on my analysis, it appears to be behind or *near* a vertical wall (Obstacle 5: `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`). My strategy so far has been to consider the target as if it were at `(0.05, 1.341)` (the "effective" target) and place the robot base on the positive x-side (`x_b > 0.05`) to maintain line of sight. I've been aiming for positions within a distance of 2 from the effective target.
           
           I've already provided a total of six positions across two rounds, but they haven't worked, which strongly suggests a more complex issue. It's time to re-evaluate. I'm now considering the possibility that the target is *actually* intended to be on the other side of the wall (`x < -0.05`). I started exploring potential robot base positions on this side, accounting for new obstacles, but these proved more complex due to numerous obstacles.
           
           Given the past failures, I'm returning to my initial, more common, assumption of viewing from x > 0.05 for now. I'll stick with the `x_b > 0.05` constraint and adjust my approach to vary positions to see if the robot can see the target.
           
           I've decided to provide the following three new robot base positions:
           
           1.  **(2.05, 1.341)**: This position is at the maximum range (distance = 2) from the effective target, directly to the right, and clear of the known obstacles.
           
           2.  **(0.1, -0.65)**: This position is close to the wall (x = 0.1, the same distance away) but at a lower y-value and distance = 2 from the effective target.
           
           3.  **(1.5, -0.036)**: This is in the right, bottom sector, at a distance of 2.
           
           I've re-checked all positions against the known obstacles and believe these are valid and offer new perspectives. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider an even deeper re-evaluation. The persistent failures suggest more complex dynamics, such as dynamic obstacles or specific occlusion. I'll have to analyze if there are any other possible scenarios. The task is to find a solution.

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Addressing a Persistent Obstacle**
           
           I'm revisiting this target point: `(0.00949..., 1.3411...)`. This is the fourth time I've been asked for robot base positions, and, frankly, the repeated failures are concerning. The target's x-coordinate being *inside* obstacle 5, a vertical wall (`(-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)`), is key. I've been interpreting this as the target being *on the edge* of the wall at `x=0.05`, leading me to propose positions *outside* the wall (i.e., with `x_b > 0.05`).  This approach, while initially logical, hasn't worked.
           
           Nine failed attempts strongly suggest a deeper issue. Could the target be on the *other* side of the wall?  I'm now re-evaluating the possibility that the *intended* view is from the `x < -0.05` side. Despite the target's positive `x` coordinate, perhaps the "viewable" side is the reverse, or the intended view point is from within the fixed obstacles. This is the only reasonable conclusion given the repeated failures from the other viewpoint.
           
           **Rethinking the Approach for a New Set of Locations**
           
           I'm going to adopt a new strategy. My new effective target point will be `(-0.05, 1.341...)`,  assuming the intention is to view it from the other side. This means all base positions must now have `x_b < -0.05`, staying outside obstacle 5. I will maintain a maximum distance of 2 from the target and adhere to the workspace bounds of `x, y = [-2.5, 2.5]`.
           
           Here's my rationale, and three proposed positions:
           
           1.  **Left and clear:** `(-1.05, 1.341)`: Directly left of the effective target. Straight path and distance is 1.0.
           
           2.  **Max left:** `(-2.05, 1.341)`: Furthest distance to the effective target `(-0.05, 1.341)`,  distance 2.0. This will allow for maximum distance exploration, and stays clear.
           
           3.  **Left and down:** `(-1.05, 0.341)`:  1.414 distance. Also stays clear.
           
           These positions are designed with the new perspective, and should avoid the line-of-sight issues I've been facing.  I am hoping this drastic shift in approach - switching sides - will finally yield results.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I'm staring at this target point `(0.009494..., 1.341...)` again, and it's inside this pesky obstacle 5, a vertical wall centered at x=0. I've tried putting the robot on both sides of that wall, but no dice. This is now the fifth request, so something's definitely off.
           
           I've got a few theories:
           
           *   **Floating point error:** Maybe the target is *slightly* off, and it's actually supposed to be right next to the wall. I've tried assuming this and aiming at the effective target points `x=0.05` or `x=-0.05` (with y=target). Both have failed for several attempts.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** The problem said to avoid collision with any obstacle or the workspace boundary. Obstacle 5 means I can't put the robot on the wall directly.
           *   **The Problem Itself:** "You are given a target point" and not an object - no other interpretation other than assuming the coordinates provided, therefore all my attempts are bound to fail.
           
           The target seems *inside* the wall, which makes no sense. If the target is at `(0.009494, 1.341)` and the wall is at `x=[-0.05, 0.05]`, it means the target is within the wall, thus the target cannot be viewed from the positive x-side nor the negative x-side of the wall.
           
           So, I'm thinking I need a new approach. Since the target must be visible, I'm going to continue with the effective target at `x=-0.05` since I only have three positions there, and I want to diversify it. I'm focusing on trying positions closer to and further from the assumed obstacle boundary, trying to find open LOS positions while also staying within the 2-meter range. These are my proposed coordinates: `(-0.1, 0.0)`, `(-1.05, -0.391)`, and `(-1.5, 2.44)`. Hopefully, this gives me some insight into where it can succeed.

           Okay, here's the deal: I'm staring at this target point `(0.009494..., 1.341...)` again, and it's inside this pesky obstacle 5, a vertical wall centered at x=0. I've tried putting the robot on both sides of that wall, but no dice. This is now the fifth request, so something's definitely off.
           
           I've got a few theories:
           
           *   **Floating point error:** Maybe the target is *slightly* off, and it's actually supposed to be right next to the wall. I've tried assuming this and aiming at the effective target points `x=0.05` or `x=-0.05` (with y=target). Both have failed for several attempts.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** The problem said to avoid collision with any obstacle or the workspace boundary. Obstacle 5 means I can't put the robot on the wall directly.
           *   **The Problem Itself:** "You are given a target point" and not an object - no other interpretation other than assuming the coordinates provided, therefore all my attempts are bound to fail.
           
           The target seems *inside* the wall, which makes no sense. If the target is at `(0.009494, 1.341)` and the wall is at `x=[-0.05, 0.05]`, it means the target is within the wall, thus the target cannot be viewed from the positive x-side nor the negative x-side of the wall.
           
           So, I'm thinking I need a new approach. Since the target must be visible, I'm going to continue with the effective target at `x=-0.05` since I only have three positions there, and I want to diversify it. I'm focusing on trying positions closer to and further from the assumed obstacle boundary, trying to find open LOS positions while also staying within the 2-meter range. These are my proposed coordinates: `(-0.1, 0.0)`, `(-1.05, -0.391)`, and `(-1.5, 2.44)`. Hopefully, this gives me some insight into where it can succeed.
