           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Feasibility Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto region v16.  Essentially, I need to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Currently, these objects are all sitting on v11.
           
           To get an object `?o` onto a region `?r`, I've got to ensure it's both `supported` on `?r` *and* at the appropriate `atpose`. I'm also given the information that the objects in question can indeed be stacked on v16, so the physical stacking is feasible.  Specifically, I know I've got a pose, `_o2`, where these objects *could* be on v16.
           
           My available actions are `pick`, `place`, `move_base`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Right away, I can dismiss `clean` and `cook` – they're irrelevant to moving objects.  `move_base` just shifts the robot's base without affecting object poses, and it looks like a no-op given the current problem description.  Therefore, I'm thinking the way to achieve this involves picking each object off v11, and then placing it down on v16.
           
           Now, looking at the `pick` action: It requires a suitable kinematic solution (kin), that the robot has an empty hand, that the object is at its designated pose, and that the robot is at the right base configuration. Place is similar, but requires having the object in hand and that the object not be in an unsafe pose (or approach and trajectory). The available actions are predicated on kinematic solutions.
           
           I've got the necessary *kin* facts (e.g., `pose(v8, #o2)`, `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, etc.). This means I have valid `pick` and `place` possibilities in principle. However, I'm constrained: I can *only* use action instances explicitly listed.  And here's where the problem arises: **The only action instance I'm given is a `move_base` action.** No `pick` or `place` instances are provided.
           
           The crucial issue is the action instance constraint. If `pick` and `place` are not in the valid actions list, I have no way to pick up an object and then place it on v16. The goal states require changing the `on` facts, which cannot be done without the ability to pick and place. Without `pick` and `place`, I can't move the objects, and thus, I can't fulfill the goal. Given the constraints, I must conclude that the goal `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` is simply **unachievable** with the provided action instances.
