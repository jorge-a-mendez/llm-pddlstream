           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.087, 0.492, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.975, -0.22).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.13, -0.261, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.595, 0.804).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, 0.369), (0.078, 0.465)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.133, 0.446), (-0.04, 0.539)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.087, -0.304), (0.174, -0.217)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.03, 0.417, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.965, -0.262).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I need to get three objects – v8, v12, and v14 – onto surface v16. Currently, they're sitting on v11, supported by it. My robot has one arm that's empty and ready to go. The challenge is clear: pick, move, and place each object individually onto v16.
           
           My approach is straightforward: since I can only carry one object at a time, I'll execute a sequential process of *pick* and *place* for each object. I'll need to figure out appropriate positions for placement on v16 without collisions. Given that v16 has an AABB defined, it's not a dummy surface, so I'll position the objects directly on it. Furthermore, I will use my current base configuration v3, which has the coordinates (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0), which I am confident is sufficient for the pick/place actions and minimizes cost by avoiding base movements.
           
           To be specific about the steps, let's detail the plan. First, I'll pick v8 from its current pose v9 and place it at a suitable pose on v16, which I'll call '#o2_v8'. Then, I will pick v12 from its current pose v13, and place it at '#o2_v12'. Finally, I will pick v14 from v15, and place it at '#o2_v14' on v16. This approach will adhere to the provided kinematic constraints and reach the goal condition of all three objects on v16.
           
           Since I have full information about the object sizes and the v16 surface's AABB, I'll place the objects adjacent to each other on v16 to avoid collisions. I am careful to ensure their AABBs don't overlap. Since the AABBs are relative to the objects' center, I'll provide slightly different x,y coordinates for each object to satisfy the preconditions of `place`.
           
           Here is the plan.

           ```

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan Revision**
           
           Initially, the planner failed because the precondition `atbconf(v35)` wasn't satisfied. Analyzing the previous plan, it became clear that the base configuration used in `pick` and `place` actions was represented by `#o3`, which was being replaced by a specific continuous value, `v35`.  The initial state had `atbconf(v3)`, but not `atbconf(v35)`.  The problem: the planner assumed `#o3` equaled `v3`, but that's not true, it's a *parameter* that the planner will have to instantiate.  The way to adjust base configuration is through `move_base`.
           
           My revised strategy includes a `move_base` action *before* any `pick` or `place`.  Specifically, I'll execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This should ensure `atbconf(#o3)` is true before initiating any `pick` or `place` operations.  I checked the preconditions for the `move_base` action and verified that they are satisfied. Specifically, `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `atbconf(v3)` are both true initially. This will change the base configuration to the needed value. The effects of the action are `atbconf(#o3)` and will negate `atbconf(v3)`, as well as `canmove()`.
           
           The plan structure now becomes:
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7.  `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           I have confirmed the correct usage of different continuous values for the `#o2` poses of the objects being placed. The kinematics relations for pick and place all use the base configuration `#o3`.  This confirms that one `move_base` at the start, to get `#o3`, will suffice.
           
           Checked and verified that the preconditions and effects for pick and place are valid and consistent with the problem constraints. I also need to ensure that the `#o2` pose values are within the bounds of the target surface `v16`. I have rechecked that the values are feasible for a square target.
           
           Final plan should work correctly. The initial move will get the base configuration correct before any of the pick or place steps are executed.
