           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* object v16.  Essentially, I need to move these three blocks from their current positions (supported by v11) to v16.  My initial thought process immediately jumped to using `pick` and `place` actions because, in this kind of problem, that's the obvious approach for manipulating objects.
           
           I broke down the problem: I have `atpose` and `supported` predicates that define the initial state, and my goal hinges on achieving those same predicates with v16 as the support.  That means I need to pick up the objects, move them, and then put them down, all while ensuring everything remains stable.
           
           I checked the preconditions for `pick` and `place` actions, and quickly saw I'd need *kin* relationships, grasp poses, and base configurations.  I checked what I had available. I could see two potential arm instances (v4 and v6) and a base configuration (v3).  However, the most crucial thing I noticed *was missing* are any action instances for *pick* or *place*.
           
           Now, the problem statement is very clear: I'm only allowed to use the actions provided in the list.  And the *only* action provided is a `move_base` action that simply moves the base from v3 to v3.  This means I *cannot* pick up and place objects.  And that is the only way I can achieve the goal, as no other predicates are available to satisfy the `on` axiom.  Therefore, I conclude that the goal is currently *unreachable* with the given set of available actions. I double-checked the logic and confirmed that I couldn't achieve `on` without `pick` and `place`. So, the problem can't be solved as the required actions are not given.
