           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Conclusion**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The objective is to arrange objects v8, v12, and v14 on surface v16. Currently, they're all resting on v11. The core challenge is that I'm limited to a single action: moving the robot's base using `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This base movement action is a problem. My analysis shows that I need to utilize `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects. To perform these pick and place actions, the robot's base configuration must be at `#o3`. However, the only available `move_base` instance keeps the robot at `v3`, which is not the same as `#o3`.
           
           Furthermore, all the available "kinematic" facts concerning how the robot interacts with the objects use the base configuration `#o3`. Thus, I can't even get started to pick anything up.
           
           In detail, to move an object, like `v14`, I'd need the following: the appropriate `kin` fact (which I have), `atpose` (I've got it, v14 is currently in the correct pose), `handempty` (I have that too), `atbconf(#o3)` (this is where things fall apart), and no collision risks. Because the condition `atbconf(#o3)` is false, and there's no way to make it true using the provided action, I am unable to pick up `v14`. This is also true for `v12` and `v8`, because all those objects require the action `atbconf(#o3)`. Therefore, since the preconditions for picking up the objects aren't satisfied, I can't place them either. Consequently, with the given action instance, the goal is unattainable.
