(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with dimensions 0.08284205994080562 x 0.08284205994080562, on a surface defined by the AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to produce a set of (surf_idx, theta, x, y) tuples.
           
           Since the object is square, the rotation (theta) fundamentally affects the bounds of where the object can be placed. The dimensions of the square are used to calculate the area of the object, and this geometry must fit completely within the surface, or there will be an unstable placement.
           
           I've determined the AABB bounds for the surface (0) and for my object.
           
           To calculate if an object will fit on the surface, I can use the AABB of both the surface and the object. An object can fit on the surface if the center of my object can sit anywhere on the surface, accounting for the object's dimensions and the object's rotation (theta). My plan is to start by generating the AABB of the object if theta is 0, and then generate the AABB again, this time with theta = pi/4 to create a more diverse and complete list of placements.
           
           Since this is a square object, I'll need to define `S_eff` (the effective size) accounting for the rotation.
           
           For example, when `theta = 0`, the effective size is just `size_x`. For `theta = pi/4`, I must rotate the bounding box to see the maximum effective size of the square object and make sure the bounds of the object are fully inside the surface.
           
           I've determined that the valid ranges for `x` and `y` are the same for the non-rotated object since it's a square. I'll need to grid these values for x and y to produce a 5x5 grid of values.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, I also found the valid x and y range and plan to grid these to create my list of placements.
           
           After reviewing the process of creating the ranges, I'm ready to produce the list of tuples.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 5: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 4, and now I need to figure out where to put object ID 5 without any collisions. Object ID 4's location is now a fixed constraint in the scene. I know object ID 5 is a square with specific dimensions and a target surface to work with. My goal: find 50 stable, collision-free placements for it.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** Object 5's size and the surface it needs to fit on, and object 4 is now a fixed obstacle.
           
           2.  **Calculate Valid Placement Ranges:** I need to find the workable boundaries on the surface for object 5, considering its size. To make it easier for calculation, I'm going to create a range of placements for object 5 based on some specific angles of rotation, like 0 (or some multiple of pi/2), pi/4 (or some multiple of pi/4), and some other values (like pi/8) between them.
               *   **Case 1: No Rotation (theta = 0):** Straightforward, I just have to move object 5 along valid range.
               *   **Case 2: 45 Degree Rotation (theta = pi/4):** Now, the object's size changes. I'll need to use a slightly different range for placements.
               *   **Case 3: 22.5 Degree Rotation (theta = pi/8):** Similar to the previous one, and I'll adapt the valid range accordingly.
           
           3.  **Account for Obstacles:** To prevent any collisions with object 4, I will use its AABB, which is basically its bounding box. I'll need to check the placements of object 5 and make sure the boxes don't intersect.
           
           4.  **Collision Detection:** For each candidate position (surface index, rotation angle, X-coordinate, Y-coordinate) of object 5, I will compute a bounding box. Then I must compare it to the existing AABB of the fixed object ID 4. If they overlap, it's a no-go. If they do not overlap, this is a possible solution.
           
           5.  **Generate Candidate Placements:** I plan to build a grid of candidate placements on the surface for each of the rotation angles, starting with theta = 0, followed by theta = pi/4, and finally theta = pi/8. Then I will test them against my collision rule.
           
           6.  **Refine Collision Checks:** It seems like the 45 degree rotation will be a problem so I need to make some extra adjustments. I will identify the placements and apply some exclusion rules on the points in the grid.
           
           7.  **Choose the Positions to Return:** I will select the valid solutions to create the total of 50 solutions for object 5.
               I am going to take all the points for the rotation = 0, and then I will mix the other 2 rotations and the total number of non-colliding locations.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 6) on a surface (surface 0), avoiding two existing square obstacles (ID 4 and ID 5). My approach involves a systematic search, considering different orientations and collision checks.
           
           First, I define the rectangular bounding box (AABB) for each obstacle (ID 4 and ID 5) using the provided size (S), rotation angle (theta = 0), and position (x, y).  I determine the allowed range for the center of the new object on the surface, ensuring that the entire object stays within the bounds of the surface and does not overlap with existing obstacles.
           
           I'm planning to use a grid-based search within this allowed range, but I'll need to account for three different orientations (theta = 0, pi/4, and pi/8 radians) for the new square object. For each orientation, I calculate an effective half-extent value, which depends on the object's size and the rotation angle. This value helps me define the allowable region for the center of the object.
           
           I construct a grid with a 5x5 array for each rotation, and for each grid point, I check if the object's bounding box at that point collides with either obstacle. A collision means that the x or y intervals for any axis must overlap. To determine if the current point results in a collision, I calculate the object's bounding box and check for overlap with the pre-calculated bounding boxes of obstacles 4 and 5. This check will be repeated for several other grid points.
           
           For the first rotation (theta=0), I will iterate across a grid, and perform collision checks. Then, I move onto the next rotation (theta = pi/4), and repeat my check for the allowable x,y values. Finally, the third rotation (theta = pi/8) will be evaluated in the same method. I'll continue this process for all possible rotations, and will stop once I find a total of 50 valid, non-colliding locations.
