           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Analysis and Action Planning**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`. I need to figure out how to get this done, considering the initial state and the available actions.
           
           From the provided objects, I see that I have two candidates of type `v17`: `v12` and `v8`. Both are supported by a surface (v14 for v12, v11 for v8). The goal condition means I need to get one of these objects `on(v18)`. This in turn means the object should be both `atpose` of a pose supported by `v18` at that pose.
           
           Looking at the available objects in the environment, I observe that `v12` is initially `atpose` of `v13` and `supported` by `v14` (so, currently `on(v14)`).  Similarly, `v8` is `atpose` of `v9` and `supported` by `v11` (so `on(v11)`). There is also a pose `#o2` supported by `v18` such that both `v12` and `v8` can be supported by it.
           
           The plan should probably involve moving either `v12` or `v8` to that pose, `#o2`, which in turn would make them `on(v18)`.
           So my plan would be to `pick` and then `place`.
           
           The problem is the actions provided. I only see a single action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The description explicitly states that *only* the provided actions are allowed. That means I can only move the robot's base configuration from `v3` to `v3`, which... does nothing useful towards the goal.
           
           The key to achieving this `on(v18)` condition is to perform a `pick` and `place` action. I need to get `v12` or `v8` supported on `v18`. But, since no instances of `pick` or `place` are available, this goal is unreachable.
