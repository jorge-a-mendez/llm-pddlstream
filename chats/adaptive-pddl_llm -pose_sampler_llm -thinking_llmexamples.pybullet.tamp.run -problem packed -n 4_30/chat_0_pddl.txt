(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a square object (ID 4) with sides of approximately 0.0989 units, and a square surface (Surface 0) that's 0.27 units on a side, centered at (0,0). My goal is to find 50 different, stable positions for this object on that surface.
           
           First, I need to ensure the object is *fully* inside the surface. That means the object's bounding box can't poke out.  I'm assuming the object's dimensions provided are for the object *itself*, not its rotated bounding box (AABB). The AABB changes as I rotate the object.
           
           For a rotation of zero degrees (or multiples of 90), it's straightforward: the object is aligned with the surface. Half the side length of the object is about 0.0494.  So I calculate the allowed (x,y) range for the center of the object.  The range ensures the object’s edges don't go past the surface's boundary.
           
           Now, rotation gets interesting. If the object is rotated by *theta*, the size of its AABB changes. The bounding box side length becomes  `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` (where *s* is the side of the original object). The key here is to realize this value changes based on the rotation.
           
           I see that the worst-case scenario (largest bounding box) is at a 45-degree angle.  So I need to take that into account. When *theta* isn't zero, I have to ensure that *that* larger bounding box stays *inside* the surface.
           
           Therefore, for each rotation, the valid (x,y) range changes. I need to calculate it.
           
           I'm generating a list of placements. For each (x, y) location on the surface I'll calculate the valid ranges, considering how rotation affects the dimensions. I'll take a few different angles to ensure the bounding box *always* fits on the surface.
           I will generate a grid of positions and vary the rotation to get 59 combinations. I can just take the first 50.
           
           I'll use these calculations to programmatically come up with 50 valid placements (0, *theta*, x, y), where '0' is the surface index, and *theta* represents the angle of rotation.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've got the green light on placement for Object ID 4, which is great. Now, I need to place Object ID 5, a square with a side length of `0.0755485200782349`, onto surface 0. My goal is to find 50 stable placements that don't collide with object 4. I know object 4 is at `(0, 0.0, -0.08556460982440321, -0.08556460982440321)`, so I will have to account for its position.
           
           Object 5 is a square, so for each candidate placement, I need to compute the rotated AABB, the collision ranges, and do some systematic filtering to avoid all collisions. This will require some computations, but I have tools at my disposal that would automate the computation efficiently.
           
           First, I define the rotation angles I am going to explore: `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`. With this range, I can build an effective rotation strategy. I will also precompute `max_half_dim_5` for different `theta` values.
           
           Object 4 has a half-side of `0.049435390175596785`. I calculated the AABB of object 4, which is region `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.03612921964880642, -0.03612921964880642)]`. Great! This is the area I want to avoid.
           
           I've already analyzed the surface 0 bounds from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           I then generated a grid for each angle and did a lot of checking if an object can actually be placed without collision. Using the precomputed half-side, I am able to check for collision by calculating the maximum and minimum values of the object.
           
           I meticulously generated and filtered. My collision algorithm is working as expected. And I could arrive at `50` placements which are valid.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5).  The object is a square with side length 0.0889744947886858, which makes its half-side length `0.0444872473943429`. Surface 0's bounds are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've got the placements and AABB bounds for objects 4 and 5:
           
           *   **Object 4**: `AABB: [(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.0361, -0.0361)]`
           *   **Object 5**: `AABB: [(-0.135, -0.0054), (-0.0595, 0.0702)]`
           
           My strategy involves generating placement candidates for object 6 across a range of rotations:  0, pi/8, pi/4, 3\*pi/8, and pi/2.  For each rotation:
           
           1.  I'll calculate the *maximum* half-dimension of the object, which is based on the angle (theta).
           2.  I'll determine the valid *x* and *y* ranges, making sure they fit within surface 0's boundaries.
           3.  I'll create a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates within those ranges.
           4.  For each candidate placement:
               *   I'll calculate the AABB of object 6.
               *   I'll check it against both AABB 4 and AABB 5.
               *   If no collision, then it is added to the valid set.
           
           **Calculations & Collision Checks**
           
           I'm calculating the AABB ranges and the collision regions and I'm very careful to check for overlaps on both the x and y axes.
           
           For the initial rotation, `theta=0`:  Valid coordinates are -0.09051 for y=0.0905 or for x = 0.09051. and  -0.03017 for 0.09051, and for x = 0.0 or y= 0.03017 or  0.09051. Total 20 valid coordinates for this set.
           
           Then, for the other angles:
           
           I found that for  `theta=pi/8`: Valid coordinates are -0.07689, 0.0, 0.07689 for y=0.07689. Then for the other angles. The total is 10.
           For `theta=pi/4`: There are 3 positions at x= 0.072 for y=0.0
           For `theta=pi/16` or `7pi/16` the x ranges are -0.08267,0 and 0.08267, I choose y=0.0. The total 10.
           The final test, for `theta=3pi/16` or `5pi/16` the x ranges are -0.07329, 0, and 0.07329, and there are 3 valid positions. 6 total.
           So, I will take the first 50 valid placements for the set and I am done.
