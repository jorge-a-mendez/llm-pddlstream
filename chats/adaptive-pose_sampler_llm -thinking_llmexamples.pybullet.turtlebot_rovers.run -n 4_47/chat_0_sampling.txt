User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Complexities of Target Localization**
           
           Alright, let's dive into this challenging scenario. I'm tasked with pinpointing three suitable base positions for a robot, given a target point at (0, 0). The catch? The target is nestled *inside* a vertical pillar at x = 0, a classic "line of sight" puzzle.  
           
           My primary concern is ensuring a clear line of sight to the target. However, because the target is embedded within an obstacle, the usual rules of occlusion become fuzzy.  I have to assume that in this specific problem context, the pillar doesn't obstruct visibility *to* the target. 
           
           I've got a comprehensive set of obstacles to contend with – walls, pillars, and various other objects, all defined as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). My first move is to identify the crucial obstacle: the pillar containing the target. Then, I must ensure that the proposed robot base positions:
           
           *   Are within a radius of 2 from the target.
           *   Are *not* inside any obstacle.
           *   Maintain a clear view to the target.
           
           To generate valid positions, I systematically explore points around the target, avoiding the central pillar (x = 0). I prioritize candidates on either side of this pillar, understanding that points directly on the x=0 line will be invalid due to the obstacle. I'm also careful to enforce the room boundaries of approximately [-2.45, 2.45] for both x and y to account for the thickness of the walls and ensure the base doesn't collide with the fixed obstacles. This ensures that the robot base can see the target (inside the pillar) without line-of-sight obstruction from the external environment.
           
           In the case where I don't readily find suitable positions through the primary search, I have a fallback strategy: I use a set of basic points likely to pass the checks, which are placed deliberately to the sides of the central pillar. I've designed this approach to guarantee the identification of three positions.
           
           Given these constraints and strategies, the solution will provide three base locations that allow the robot to maintain a line of sight to the target.
