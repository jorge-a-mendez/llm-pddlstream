User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding Safe Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three suitable (x, y) positions for the robot's base, given a target point and a bunch of fixed obstacles. The key constraints are: these positions must be within 2 units of the target, within the world boundaries (-2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y), and, crucially, collision-free. The robot's orientation will be automatically adjusted to face the target.
           
           I began by mentally mapping the scene, using the provided AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) as my guide. A large rectangular region, which coincidentally matches the allowed robot placement limits, is defined. Then, there's a vertical wall at x=0 (Obstacle 5), and a few smaller obstacles scattered about in the top-left, bottom-left, and top-right quadrants. The target point itself is at (-1.996, 0.506), nestled in the left half of the space and slightly north of center.
           
           My first thought was to systematically explore positions around the target point, creating a virtual circle with a radius slightly less than the maximum allowed distance of 2. I need to be careful to avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles, especially Obstacle 5 (the vertical wall) and Obstacle 8, which is just above the target.
           
           I meticulously checked potential positions, keeping in mind that the robot base is best considered a point for this exercise (as no dimensions are provided). The code generates several candidate positions and then checks each one for collision with any obstacle using the `is_collision` function. It accounts for a robot "radius" by expanding the obstacle boundaries just a bit.
           
           I've decided to prioritize positions on the right, below, and above the target, which seems to provide good spatial coverage. One point to the right avoids that vertical wall. A point below the target is good, away from Obstacle 6. Another, slightly to the left, clears Obstacle 8.
           
           The chosen positions are designed to not have collisions.
           These are my starting points for the robot's base.
