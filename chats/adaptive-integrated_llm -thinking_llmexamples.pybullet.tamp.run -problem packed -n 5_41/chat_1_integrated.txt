           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.298, -0.097), (-0.204, -0.002)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.137, -0.495), (0.235, -0.397)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.038, -0.386), (0.038, -0.311)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, 0.306), (-0.035, 0.401)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.467), (0.156, 0.553)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.251, -0.05, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, 0.234).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.186, -0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.445, 0.896).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.0, -0.348, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.736, 0.677).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.082, 0.354, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.969, 0.248).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.113, 0.51, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.137).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Planning the Object Placement Task**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get these five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – all situated on surface v20. This translates to each object needing to be both "supported" by v20 and at a specific pose.
           
           My current understanding is this: I need to move these objects from their current resting places on surface v11 to this *other* surface, v20.  All five objects are "graspable" and can be picked up with arm v4.  Arm v6 is basically out of the running because I only have kin relations for arm v4.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: surface v20 doesn't have a pose defined in the initial state. According to the rules, v20 is what we call a "dummy surface." This means, instead of actually placing objects on v20, I need to place them on a *real* surface (v11, which has a continuous value, ie, it's defined position), and conceptually, they'll be considered "on" v20. So, I need to find a way to make these objects supported by v20 while they physically reside on v11.
           
           So the plan is:
           1.  **Grasp, Position and Release, Repeating.** For each object, the plan is a simple sequence of Pick and Place operations. I can leverage the existing `kin` predicates to facilitate the picking/placing movements of v4 with each object. This will be repeated for all the objects and the robot will always be in the same configuration.
           2.  **No robot movement.** The available 'move_base' action isn't going to contribute anything here since it results in no movement and no cost. I'm going to set it aside.
           
           The critical piece here is deciding where to *actually* put the objects on surface v11. These objects can't collide with each other, so I will need distinct locations within `v11` for the objects.
           
           So, I need to pick coordinates for each object to define placement locations on v11, for example,
           *   **v8:** (-0.2, -0.5, 0.781)
           *   **v12:** (0.2, -0.5, 0.781)
           *   **v14:** (-0.2, 0.0, 0.781)
           *   **v16:** (0.2, 0.0, 0.781)
           *   **v18:** (0.0, 0.5, 0.781)
           
           With these placements planned, all the constraints should be satisfied to achieve the final state.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of an Impossible Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan that's been flagged as using actions that aren't allowed. The only action at my disposal is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's a bit limiting, to say the least.  Let's see what we're actually trying to achieve here. The goal is to get objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 all on the surface v20. Looking at the initial state, they're currently on v11.
           
           Normally, this is a pick-and-place situation, right?  I'd need `pick` to transition from `atpose(o, p)` to `atgrasp(a, o, g)`, then `place` to go back to `atpose(o, p)` at the desired location. That's the straightforward approach.
           
           But the only action I'm given is `move_base`. It's all about moving the robot's base configuration – doesn't affect the state of any of the objects!  It looks like this action only modifies `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates. So it's effectively useless for this goal.  I can't pick up, I can't place.  
           
           Given *only* this action, and the initial and goal states, I'm forced to conclude the goal is **unreachable**.  There's no way to move these objects from v11 to v20 with *this* set of constraints. It's a fundamental mismatch between the allowed actions and the desired outcome.
