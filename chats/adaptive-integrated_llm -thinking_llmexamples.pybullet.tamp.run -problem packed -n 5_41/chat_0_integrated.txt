User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.298, -0.097), (-0.204, -0.002)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.137, -0.495), (0.235, -0.397)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.038, -0.386), (0.038, -0.311)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, 0.306), (-0.035, 0.401)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.069, 0.467), (0.156, 0.553)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.251, -0.05, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.972, 0.234).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.186, -0.446, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.445, 0.896).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.0, -0.348, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.736, 0.677).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.082, 0.354, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.969, 0.248).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.113, 0.51, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.137).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           The task is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current surface (v11) to a new surface (v20). This requires using `pick` and `place` actions. However, the initial state lacks the necessary `kin` predicates to satisfy the preconditions of `pick` and `place`. Also, the problem strictly limits the valid action instances to only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Because neither the necessary `kin` predicates for pick/place actions exist in the initial state nor are any `pick` or `place` instances provided, it's impossible to perform the moves and achieve the goal. Therefore, the task is unsolvable.
