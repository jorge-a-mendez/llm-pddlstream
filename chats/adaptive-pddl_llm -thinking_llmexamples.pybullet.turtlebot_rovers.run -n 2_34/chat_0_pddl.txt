(Thoughts: **Strategic Action Plan for New Axiom Application**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a complex problem: achieving `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to ensuring several conditions are met, primarily involving imagery and analysis of specific rock types. Let's break it down.
           
           First, I identified the crucial pre-existing states that are satisfied in the initial state. Specifically `atconf(v12,v13), atconf(v14,v15), free(v12,v16), free(v14, v16)`. Then I honed in on the missing pieces: capturing and sending images, and acquiring and receiving analyses of rock samples.
           
           The current state of play dictates that I need to capture two images (`v17` and `v18` using mode `v11`) and analyze two rock samples (one of type `v2`, the other of type `v6`). Since the initial state provides me with rovers at their respective configurations I will be able to start the imaging and analysis missions.
           
           My plan of attack centers around using rover `v14` as the initial state allows for this rover to perform its tasks. In this scenario, I have made an assumption that the continuous parameter locations correspond to `v15`, as no movements exist in the plan. My specific steps include:
           
           1.  **Calibration:** Calibrating `v10` against the locations of `v17` and `v18`.
           2.  **Imaging:** Rover `v14` will take images of objectives `v17` and `v18`.
           3.  **Sending Images:** Sending those images (mode `v11`) to the lander `v9`.
           4.  **Sampling and Analysis (Type v2):** Rover `v14` will sample rock `v3` and analyze it. This action will cause `full(v14,v16)` to be true, and will cause `free(v14,v16)` to become false.
           5.  **Sending Analysis:** Sending the analysis of `v3` to the lander `v9`.
           6.  **Freeing the Store:** Rover `v14` will then drop `v3` to free up store `v16`.
           7.  **Sampling and Analysis (Type v6):** Rover `v14` will sample rock `v5` and analyze it. This action will cause `full(v14,v16)` to be true.
           8.  **Sending Analysis:** Sending the analysis of `v5` to the lander `v9`.
           9.  **Freeing the Store:** Rover `v14` will then drop `v5` to free up store `v16`.
           
           The final `drop_rock` action in my plan is crucial; without this, the final condition, `free(v14, v16)`, required for `new-axiom@0()`, would be unmet. With these steps, every requirement is met. Therefore I can implement this plan.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v3 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v3), (sample_rock v14 v15 v5 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v5)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Problem with Strict Action Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user pointed out a crucial oversight: I was using actions, specifically related to image and sample analysis, that *weren't* in the provided list of valid action instances. That changes everything.  I need to completely re-evaluate this planning problem, given these extremely restrictive constraints.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` still holds, but now, with only `move` and `drop_rock` as my tools, it seems impossible to achieve. Let's break it down:
           
           *   **Initial State:**  I can still verify that the initial state satisfies the `atconf` and `free` conditions for the rovers. That part hasn't changed.
           *   **The Problem:** The crux of the issue lies with those image and analysis conditions: `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. I need to *take* images, *send* them, *sample* rocks, and *send* the analysis. But with only `move` and `drop_rock`, I'm completely hamstrung.  Those required actions simply *aren't* available.
           *   **Drop Rock Dilemma:**  Even the `drop_rock` action is a dead end initially.  It requires the stores to be *full* (`full(v, s)`). But in the initial state, the stores are *empty* (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`).  So, I can't even drop a rock!
           *   **Conclusion:**  Given this extremely limited action set, I am forced to conclude that the goal is simply *unreachable*. It's impossible to satisfy those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions without the necessary actions for image and sample processing.  This is a critical oversight on my part. I need to be *far* more attentive to the provided constraints in the future.
