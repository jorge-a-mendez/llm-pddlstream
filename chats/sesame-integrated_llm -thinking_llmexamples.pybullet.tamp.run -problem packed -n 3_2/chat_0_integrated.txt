           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.039, -0.266, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.372, 0.928).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.259, 0.035, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.051, 0.999).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to devise a plan to stack three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16, each achieving the state `on(object, v16)`.  The initial state provides the starting positions of these objects: v8 rests on v9, v12 on v13, and v14 on v15, all supported by v11.  The only available actions for moving these objects are `pick` and `place`, carried out by the robot arm v4 (v6 is present, but unused). The available actions are listed as instances. The key is to correctly use and interpret the given facts about `kin` (kinematics), grasping, base configuration, and trajectories to construct a valid and feasible plan using those actions, subject to collision constraints.  `v16` has AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           **Action Analysis and Precondition Derivation**
           
           The `pick` action requires the arm to be handempty, the object to be at the specified pose, the robot base to be at the base configuration (#o3) for picking/placing, the trajectory to be safe (`~unsafeapproach`), and no trajectory collision (`~unsafeatraj`). The `place` action has similar requirements -  base at #o3 and collision free. To start the plan, I need to move the robot base from its initial configuration (at v3) to #o3 via `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`, which will use the motion planning information and incur a cost of `distance(v3, #o3)`. The `kin` facts tie the objects to the base. The plan will be to pick each item at its location and place it to the final pose on `v16`.
           
           The given actions `((pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))` and  `((place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))` can be similarly formulated for v12 and v14.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Instantiation and Geometry Constraints**
           
           To fully define the plan, I must handle the continuous parameters involved.  `#o1` (grasp), `#o3` (base configuration), and `#o4` (trajectory) are not pose-related, so no explicit values are required from me. The crux lies in instantiating `#o2`, a pose *on* `v16`, with a valid, collision-free, and stable placement for each of the objects. Since all the places and poses are referred to with the same `"#o2"`, I'm going to have to make 3 different "#o2" values each bound to `v8`, `v12`, `v14`.  I need to provide distinct placement values for *each* object at pose `#o2` to achieve `on(object, v16)`. The phrasing here indicates the same symbol `#o2` will be bound differently to create a unique place for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. This also implies there will be no action that puts two objects simultaneously in the same `"#o2"` location.
           
           Given the geometry (AABBs) of the objects and v16, their poses need to be planned to avoid overlaps and ensure that each object is fully contained within the surface boundaries.  The Z height should be the initial Z value of `v9`, `v13`, `v15` which is `0.781`.
           
           **Continuous Value Calculation and Constraints Enforcement**
           
           The strategy involves finding a feasible layout. After a thorough analysis of all constraints, I computed that the valid footprint region for v8, v12, and v14 on v16 are disjoint to prevent collision. After a detailed consideration of the provided bounding boxes, I arrived at distinct x-y placements for the pose value of `#o2`.
           
           **Plan Generation**
           
           The plan will be the following:
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`  (Robot base movement)
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` (Pick v8)
           3.  `(place v4 v8 (x_v8, y_v8, 0.781, 0) #o1 #o3 #o4)` (Place v8 at calculated pose)
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)` (Pick v12)
           5.  `(place v4 v1
)

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Stability: Ensuring Placement Success**
           
           Okay, so the feedback I got indicates some issues with the stability of three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) when placed on surface `v16`. Specifically, their current placements aren't stable, meaning their projected 2D footprints exceed the bounds of `v16`.  This is a critical failure, and I need to address it.  Let's dive in.
           
           The surface's AABB (`v16`) is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  That gives us a clear area: *x* and *y* coordinates of any object placed here must fall between `-0.135` and `0.135`.
           
           Now, the object AABBs...  Initially, I had some specific AABBs for each object, but the simulation's feedback is throwing me a curveball. The error messages strongly suggest the simulator is treating all three objects as if they have an *effective* 2D AABB of `0.07 x 0.07` centered at their pose's *x* and *y* coordinates. This overrides the initial AABB data.
           
           So, I'm going with that. If the objects are, essentially, 0.07 units wide and 0.07 units tall, I can calculate stable positions on `v16`. To ensure stability, I need to make sure the pose of each object stays within the bounds of `v16`. Since the object's footprint is *centered* on the pose *x* and *y*, I need to shift these bounds inward by half the footprint's size (0.035).
           
           This means the *x* and *y* coordinates of the object pose need to be within `-0.1` and `0.1`.  That's a square region on the surface, which is a key insight from the prior error messages!
           
           Now for positioning those objects: I need to fit three of those `0.07 x 0.07` footprints into the surface's usable region without overlap. The available region for positioning the center of an object is `-0.1` to `0.1` in *x* and *y*.
           
           I think I have a solution. Let's arrange them in a line along the *x*-axis:
           *   **v8:** Center at *(-0.06, 0.0)*. This gives an *x* range from -0.095 to -0.025 and a *y* range of -0.035 to 0.035. All within bounds.
           *   **v12:** Center at *(0.02, 0.0)*. Range is *x* from -0.015 to 0.055, and *y* is from -0.035 to 0.035. Good. I need to space them at least by the footprint dimensions.
           *   **v14:** Center at *(0.1, 0.0)*. Range is *x* from 0.065 to 0.135, and *y* is from -0.035 to 0.035. Also, within bounds, and non-overlapping with the others.
           
           So, here are my proposed new poses:
           *   `v8`:  (-0.06, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `v12`: (0.02, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `v14`: (0.1, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these coordinates, the `x` values all reside in the given range of `[-0.1, 0.1]` for object *centers*.  The *y* is also okay. And because the footprint is effectively centered at the pose location, the bounds from *x* and *y* will fall completely within the boundaries of `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           I will make this change, and keep the logic exactly the same, but with these new poses to ensure they don't overlap.

Model:     **Rethinking Stability: Ensuring Placement Success**
           
           Okay, so the feedback I got indicates some issues with the stability of three objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) when placed on surface `v16`. Specifically, their current placements aren't stable, meaning their projected 2D footprints exceed the bounds of `v16`.  This is a critical failure, and I need to address it.  Let's dive in.
           
           The surface's AABB (`v16`) is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  That gives us a clear area: *x* and *y* coordinates of any object placed here must fall between `-0.135` and `0.135`.
           
           Now, the object AABBs...  Initially, I had some specific AABBs for each object, but the simulation's feedback is throwing me a curveball. The error messages strongly suggest the simulator is treating all three objects as if they have an *effective* 2D AABB of `0.07 x 0.07` centered at their pose's *x* and *y* coordinates. This overrides the initial AABB data.
           
           So, I'm going with that. If the objects are, essentially, 0.07 units wide and 0.07 units tall, I can calculate stable positions on `v16`. To ensure stability, I need to make sure the pose of each object stays within the bounds of `v16`. Since the object's footprint is *centered* on the pose *x* and *y*, I need to shift these bounds inward by half the footprint's size (0.035).
           
           This means the *x* and *y* coordinates of the object pose need to be within `-0.1` and `0.1`.  That's a square region on the surface, which is a key insight from the prior error messages!
           
           Now for positioning those objects: I need to fit three of those `0.07 x 0.07` footprints into the surface's usable region without overlap. The available region for positioning the center of an object is `-0.1` to `0.1` in *x* and *y*.
           
           I think I have a solution. Let's arrange them in a line along the *x*-axis:
           *   **v8:** Center at *(-0.06, 0.0)*. This gives an *x* range from -0.095 to -0.025 and a *y* range of -0.035 to 0.035. All within bounds.
           *   **v12:** Center at *(0.02, 0.0)*. Range is *x* from -0.015 to 0.055, and *y* is from -0.035 to 0.035. Good. I need to space them at least by the footprint dimensions.
           *   **v14:** Center at *(0.1, 0.0)*. Range is *x* from 0.065 to 0.135, and *y* is from -0.035 to 0.035. Also, within bounds, and non-overlapping with the others.
           
           So, here are my proposed new poses:
           *   `v8`:  (-0.06, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `v12`: (0.02, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `v14`: (0.1, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these coordinates, the `x` values all reside in the given range of `[-0.1, 0.1]` for object *centers*.  The *y* is also okay. And because the footprint is effectively centered at the pose location, the bounds from *x* and *y* will fall completely within the boundaries of `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           I will make this change, and keep the logic exactly the same, but with these new poses to ensure they don't overlap.
           

User:      Pose #o2 = (0.1 0.0 0.781 0.0) for object v14 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(0.06500000149011612, -0.035), upper=(0.13500000149011612, 0.035))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Stability and Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm receiving feedback indicating instability for a pose, specifically that the object's 2D AABB isn't fully contained within the surface's 2D AABB. The error message gives me the object AABB at the problematic pose, and the surface AABB, which are the basis of the issue.
           
           I've got to take this feedback seriously and figure out why. The crucial thing is that the object's upper x-bound is *exactly* the surface's upper x-bound. This suggests that strict inequality is probably being enforced, or that there are some floating-point precision issues to account for.
           
           To fix this, I have to recalculate the permissible range for the object's center coordinates (px, py) to ensure complete containment. The surface AABB is given as  ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The error message implies that each object is treated as a square of 0.07 x 0.07, centered at its (px, py). So, I know I must be strictly inside.
           
           Thus, for each object, their center coordinates (px, py) must be strictly between -0.1 and 0.1 in both x and y. This will assure a strict containment condition. To be extra safe, I need to introduce a tiny margin, so I'll shoot for a  [-0.09, 0.09] x [-0.09, 0.09] region for placement of the objects' centers.
           
           However, I'm trying to place three 0.07-wide objects on the surface. That's 0.21 total. Now, the surface's available width (or height) is 0.18. Clearly, I can't put them side-by-side without some gaps in a straight line.
           
           I'm revisiting my previous calculations, keeping the need for *strict* inclusion. Now,  I need to pick values between -0.09 and 0.09 for each coordinate (x and y). Since the plan uses `0.781` for the Z-coordinate, then it can't be set to any other values. Also, from the prompt, only poses should be considered; I have `px` and `py` for three objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`.  So the plan may fail because the positions of the objects are overlapping.
           
           I was getting a bit stuck and had to rethink a little bit. Now I'm taking the conservative approach of ensuring strict inclusion with a very small `epsilon` to accommodate potential floating-point precision issues. The plan is the same, and the placement of the objects on the surface will be as follows:
           - `v8`: at `(-0.06, 0.06)`
           - `v12`: at `(0.06, 0.06)`
           - `v14`: at `(0.0, -0.06)`
           
           These positions ensure mutual exclusion, and strictly fit within the area, without any problems. These objects at their respective `px, py` locations are strictly within the AABB.
           
           I've also verified this solution by making sure the object AABBs (now as the `0.07 x 0.07` squares) with each object being centered in those coordinates. They are all fully contained in the surface AABB.
           
           Now that the placements are strictly contained, and the constraints are met, the plan should work!
