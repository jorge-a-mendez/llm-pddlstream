           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the `new-axiom@0()` goal, and I need to devise a plan to achieve it. Let's break down the axiom itself. Looking at the conditions, I see that I already have several initial truths: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. That's a good start.
           
           The real challenge lies in the remaining conditions: the `receivedimage` predicates for `v17, v18, v19` and `v11`, and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for both the stone and soil types. These are the actionable parts. I have to acquire images and analyses of certain stone and soil samples.
           
           Now, I analyze my available actions. I'm limited to `move` actions and `drop_rock` actions. The `move` actions are basically no-ops because they don't actually change anything relevant to the goal. The `drop_rock` actions are contingent on having a `full` storage, but the initial state shows `free` storage. That is a problem.
           
           The problem specifically says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Unfortunately, it appears that the available actions provide no method to obtain the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required for the goal. There's no way to perform image taking, calibration, or sample analysis. Given that the only actions allowed are no-ops and actions that require an initial false condition, the goal is unreachable with the actions permitted.
