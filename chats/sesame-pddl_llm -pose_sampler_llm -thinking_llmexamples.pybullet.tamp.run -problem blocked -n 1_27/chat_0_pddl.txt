(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to place an object, ID 5, which is a square with sides of 0.07, onto a surface, specifically Surface 0 with the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation (theta), and the x, y coordinates of the object's center.  For a stable placement, the object's AABB must be *fully* contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           The object's geometry is described by the dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), and this key phrase usually implies the local AABB dimensions *before* any rotation is applied. Since the problem mentions that it's the AABB we care about.  Because the object is square (0.07 x 0.07), its effective AABB dimensions *won't* change with rotation. That means regardless of the rotation, the dimensions of the box will be 0.07 by 0.07, which is helpful.
           
           The x-coordinate of the object's center must be between `4.2 + 0.035` and `4.8 - 0.035`, which yields `4.235 <= x <= 4.765`.
           Similarly, the y-coordinate must be between `-0.6 + 0.035` and `0.0 - 0.035`,  which is `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.  Any rotation angle, *theta*, is fine because the square's AABB extents are not affected by rotation.
           
           To generate a diverse set of 50 placements, I'm going to create a 7x7 grid of x,y coordinates within these valid ranges, giving me 49 unique positions.  For these 49 placements, I will assign different `theta` values by cycling through 8 different angles: `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi, 5*pi/4, 3*pi/2, 7*pi/4`. The first seven positions will have the first seven angles. Then the process continues. This will provide a good distribution across all orientations (even if it's less necessary for a square) for diversity. For the 50th placement, I'll reuse the first (x, y) pair and use the 1st theta value in the list (or simply the 8th). This guarantees exactly 50 distinct positions and orientations. This meets the criteria for stable and varied placement.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Revised Approach**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. Based on the insightful feedback regarding Object ID 5, I've had a fundamental epiphany about how I've been calculating bounding boxes for rotated squares. My previous assumption that a square's rotated AABB always remains the same size was, shall we say, a bit naive.  The critical takeaway is that the AABB's dimensions *do* change with rotation, unless it's a multiple of pi/2.
           
           To recap, for a square with side length *s*, the AABB dimensions are:
           
           *   For rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, or 3pi/2:  AABB is *s x s* (half extent s/2)
           *   For rotations of pi/4, 3pi/4, 5pi/4, or 7pi/4: AABB is *s* * sqrt(2) by *s* * sqrt(2)* (half extent *s* * sqrt(2)/2)
           
           With this fresh perspective, I'm now ready to tackle Object ID 10, a square with a side length of approximately 0.0842494. The surface in question, Surface 0, has boundaries at (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  My prior approach to positioning objects was flawed in the detail, but now, with a correct geometric model, I have the data that I need.
           
           To generate 50 stable placements, I will be prioritizing placements that are safe in all cases, which correspond to those rotations multiple of *pi/2*. I will use the *tighter* constraints dictated by the *pi/4* rotations to guide the grid, in a `7x7` grid.
           
           Therefore, for this particular case, I will apply a grid centered around `(4.5, -0.3)` that extends by half the size *sqrt(2) * s* from the bounding point.
           
           I will define the theta values as `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, 7pi/4`, and cycle them as I place the objects.
           
           The exact dimensions for the placements will be:
           
           **x-bounds** `[4.2595605, 4.339707, 4.4198535, 4.5, 4.5801465, 4.660293, 4.7404395]`
           **y-bounds** `[-0.5404395, -0.460293, -0.3801465, -0.3, -0.2198535, -0.139707, -0.0595605]`
           
           I anticipate that using the method above, I will generate an accurate set of stable positions that can be validated, in the range specified.
