           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Plausible Path to Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with this goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which I interpret as needing an object, `?green`, to be *on* something (`v18`) and be of a particular *type* (`v17`). The initial state gives me some clues, and I think I can leverage them effectively.
           
           First, I see that I have `type(v12, v17)`. Hmm, if `v12` is the same as this `?green` object, I'm halfway there! So, I need `v12` to be *on* `v18`. Right now, it's *on* `v14`.  I need to get it from `v14` to `v18`. I see that I have a *stackable* predicate that suggests this is a reasonable goal.
           
           The plan essentially boils down to: *pick*, *move base*, and then *place*. It's a simple *block-world* problem.
           
           First, I need to get the arm (`v4`) to grasp `v12`, which is currently on `v13`.  But to make this *pick* action valid, I need the base config to be `q2`. So I start by planning to move the base from initial config `v3` to `q2`.
           
           After that first step, I should be able to *pick* up `v12` from pose `v13` (using the *pick* action with a specific trajectory, *etc*). I confirm this by checking the preconditions, and they *seem* correct based on what I have available. 
           
           Now the arm is holding `v12`. I need to *place* it on `v18`. From the initial state and the initial axioms, I see that I have a valid *place* action available. To *place* it, I need the base to be at a target base configuration, which seems to be `#q3`. That base configuration is required for *placement*.
           
           So, my second move is to move the base again, this time to the required config. 
           
           Finally, I plan to *place* `v12` (by placing the arm in a way which puts the block onto the new support, `v18`). 
           
           After this placement, all preconditions will be satisfied, and the goal will be reached. The *type* is true initially, and after this final move, `on(v12, v18)` will also be true due to our axioms. I did a careful trace to make sure I followed the allowed action instances, which seems accurate.
