(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The goal is to get 50 stable placements for object ID 4, which is almost square (dimensions roughly 0.098 x 0.098) on a square surface of size 0.27 x 0.27. The key is to find valid combinations of rotation (theta) and center coordinates (x, y) such that the object stays completely inside the surface.
           
           First, I need to understand how the object's effective dimensions change with rotation. Because the object is almost square, the effective width and height don't fluctuate much. I have to account for that.
           
           The plan is to generate a few well-spaced angles for `theta`. I'll start with 0, and pi/6, pi/3. These angles are sufficient to create a diverse range of placements given that the object is rectangular.
           
           For each `theta`, I'll figure out the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates. These ranges depend on the effective dimensions of the rotated object. To be conservative, I'll use `max_half_dim = 0.069353`. The maximum valid range for `x` and `y` will be between -0.065 and 0.065.
           
           Now for the placements. I'll make a grid in the valid ranges. For `theta = 0`, I'll generate a grid of x,y coordinates in a 5x5 matrix within [-0.08, 0.08]. For `theta = pi/6`, I'll generate another 5x5 grid in the x and y dimensions ranging in the interval [-0.06, 0.06]. I will vary the grid coordinates slightly to account for the rotations.
           
           That’ll give 25 placements at `theta=0` and another 25 at `theta=pi/6` making 50 total. This will give enough variety to ensure that I get stable, valid placements.
           
           No previous objects were placed, so no collisions to worry about... yet! Once I start placing more objects, I'll have to consider collision checks. But for now, this grid approach should do the trick.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Placement Strategy for Object 8**
           
           Alright, I've got a solid plan for placing the new object (ID 8) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into object 4, which is already placed.  I've reviewed the dimensions of both objects, including their almost square shapes, and I've carefully calculated the bounding boxes and safe zones. Object 4 is in the lower-left, so I'll position Object 8 primarily in the upper-right or upper left or right sides of the surface.  I'll also keep in mind different rotations to add a bit of variety in the positions.
           
           I'm aiming for 50 diverse, but stable, placements, so I'm leveraging several techniques to ensure diversity while avoiding collisions:
           
           *   **Rotation:** I'll use 0 radians and `pi/6` radians, and `pi/2` to give some variety.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** I'll ensure Object 8's center is sufficiently far from Object 4's bounding box to avoid overlap, based on how the objects' effective dimensions change with rotation.
           
           Here's how I will proceed to generate the final 50 placements. I'll utilize a few formulas to check all possible placements. This will ensure my approach is collision-free and robust. The math is simple, but necessary.
           
           1.  **Placement Coordinates:**
               *   **theta = 0:** I will place object 8 primarily to the right or above Object 4.
               *   **theta = pi/6:** I will put Object 8 in the safe areas to the left or above and also to the right and above Object 4.
               *   **theta = pi/2:** Object 8 will be rotated by pi/2. I'll make sure those points are valid in the same way.
           
           2.  **Safety Calculations:** I'll be rigorous.
               *   I'll calculate the *effective* bounding box (AABB) of object 8 for each rotation using basic trigonometry to find the rotated object dimension.
               *   I'll then determine the region on the surface where the *center* of object 8 needs to be positioned to guarantee non-collision.
           
           **Final Coordinates (in surface coordinate system, (x, y, theta)):**
           
           1.  **Theta = 0:**
               I will pick 20 points above, and 12 points to the right.
           
           2.  **Theta = pi/6:**
               I'll pick 10 placements above or to the left, 6 placements to the left.
           
           3.  **Theta = pi/2:**
               I'll pick 2 placements to get to 50.
           
           I've ensured to check for potential collisions, to avoid any errors. I've covered the surface. I will now run these placements!
