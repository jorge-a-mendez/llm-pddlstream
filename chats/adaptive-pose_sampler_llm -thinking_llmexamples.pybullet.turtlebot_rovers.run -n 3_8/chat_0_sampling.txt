(Thoughts: **Strategic Base Position Planning for Robot Navigation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find three strategic base positions for a robot, all within a maximum range of 2 units from a given target point. Crucially, I've got to navigate around obstacles and adhere to the scene boundaries. The robot's orientation, facing the target, will be automatically set.
           
           First off, I've got a layout to consider.  The scene is bounded by these walls at x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Essentially, I'm working in a slightly smaller space due to the physical walls which are x: [-2.45, 2.45] and y: [-2.45, 2.45]. I'm given several rectangular obstacles to avoid, with some small ones scattered around. The tricky element here is the central vertical wall (obstacle 5) running along the x-axis from -0.05 to 0.05.
           
           Since collision detection and line-of-sight are handled by another process, I'll aim for open areas.
           
           My plan of attack:
           
           1.  Identify the target point. I have an example, which I will test with: (-0.00557, 0.49051). I will treat this as an approximation: (0, 0.5) to keep it simple.
           2.  Imagine a circle of radius 2 centered on the target point. This defines the possible positions.
           3.  Propose spots on (or within) this circle, keeping in mind the need for diversity. I want to spread the positions out at different angles.
           4.  Priority is on open spaces. The positions must avoid getting too close to that central wall (obstacle 5), or any of the large obstacles.
           5.  All proposed positions must stay within the main room.
           
           The trick with the target (-0.00557, 0.49051): Its x-coordinate, -0.00557, is *inside* the central wall, whose x-range is [-0.05, 0.05]. This means the target is occluded from *any* robot position, if no other action is taken.
           
           Now, the question is how to interpret "avoid occlusions" when the target is essentially behind a wall.  In line of sight navigation, I need to place the robot in a way that allows it to "see" the target without any physical obstruction. The implication here is that I need to be on the same side of the central wall as the target or the geometry of the target and the wall might be considered as being "on the same level". Otherwise the target would be unseen. I interpret this to mean that the central wall is effectively a thin plane and the target is on that plane. If the goal is truly to avoid occlusion, the robot must be on the same side of `x = 0` as the target (the left in this case) and, to physically be able to "see" the target, I need to keep the robot position outside the actual x-extent of the wall itself. The x-coordinate has to be less than -0.05. To be clear: the robot's *x* position has to be < -0.05 so there are *no* obstacles between it and the target.
           
           I will work from the same point using the same logic to calculate 3 points.
           
           Proposed positions P(x, y):
           
           1.  Directly to the left of the target: To be outside the obstacle, the robot will be to the left of the obstacle by using a distance of 0.5. `P1 = (-0.505, 0.49051)`.
           2.  Left and down: Place the robot at 1.0 units distance. An angle of 200 degrees (to go left and down) relative to the target's position. This gives me `P2 = (-0.945, 0.148)`.
           3.  Left and up: Similar logic, but the polar angle here is 160 degrees. Same distance of 1.0. This gives me `P3 = (-0.945, 0.832)`.
           
           These three points are the proposed solutions, spread at three different polar angles. All these points are outside the vertical wall and no other significant obstacles. The total distance is less than 2 units. The positions are valid according to the problem restrictions.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Position Selection for Robot Bases**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new target point: `(1.579, -1.919)`. My primary goal here is to determine three viable positions for the robot bases, keeping them within a 2-unit radius of this new target while navigating around obstacles and ensuring a clear line of sight to the target itself. The robot orientations will adjust automatically, so the position is the crucial piece.
           
           First, I had to get a clear picture of the environment. I started by mapping out the significant obstacles: the outer boundary walls (which aren't obstacles for movement, strictly), central vertical wall (which poses a line-of-sight challenge), and various smaller AABBs scattered around the space. With these obstacle positions stored, I then examined the placement of my target within the confines of the room, as this will influence which positioning options work and which do not.
           
           The target’s location in the bottom-right quadrant immediately drew my attention to its proximity to the bottom and right walls, which limits the available movement space. I need to make sure the robot bases have enough room. Additionally, the target's relative position with the central vertical wall must be taken into account; I need to ensure that the robot is on the "correct" side of that wall to maintain a clear line of sight.
           
           With the environment visualized, I thought about potential positions. My goal was to come up with three positions that are reasonably distanced from each other to ensure a wider coverage of the area. I began by considering a position directly left of the target, and immediately rejected this because the robot's placement would result in obstruction by the central wall. Therefore, I had to ensure that any robot position to the left of the target also resides in the positive X coordinate, or that it is to the right. I also have to keep in mind the bounding box restriction that limits the robot movement to within `x: [-2.45, 2.45]` and `y: [-2.45, 2.45]`.
           
           After a bit of mental geometry and constraint checking, I identified my three promising positions:
           
           *   **P1: (1.579, -0.919)**. Located directly above the target within the room boundaries, it sits at a distance of 1 unit. There's plenty of space around this target, as there are no collisions.
           
           *   **P2: (2.379, -1.919)**. This location is positioned directly to the right of the target at a distance of 0.8 units. The x and y values satisfy the range constraints, and there are no objects in the way.
           
           *   **P3: (0.579, -1.919)**. This is to the left of the target at a distance of 1 unit. I also validated that the x-coordinate does not cross the x = 0 border.
           
           All of these positions adhere to the distance constraint, stay within the defined boundaries, and, crucially, avoid any obstruction of the line of sight to the target point, and none of them would collide with obstacles. So, I think I've got a solid set of options here.
