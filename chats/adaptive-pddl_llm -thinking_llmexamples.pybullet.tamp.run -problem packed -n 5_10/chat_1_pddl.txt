(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis: An Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a stacking problem. I need to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) all "on" a surface (v20).  The initial state says they're all supported on another surface (v11).  This means I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions to move each object to the target pose (#o2) on v20.  I have two robot arms, v4 and v6, which are both handempty.
           
           The core of the problem, according to the PDDL description, is that for each object to be "on" v20, I need to make sure that it's at the correct target pose #o2, and that #o2 is supported by v20.  The good news is that those support facts are already provided in the initial state.  So far, so good.
           
           Now, here's where it gets complicated.  The crucial part is the `pick` and `place` action definitions, specifically the preconditions. For the `pick` and `place` actions to succeed, I need the `kin` fact, the `atpose` or `atgrasp` facts, and the `atbconf` facts. The `kin` facts are there, I know where each object is, and the arms are currently empty.
           
           But, and this is a big but, there's a problem with the `atbconf` predicate in the `kin` facts.  All the `kin` facts, which define how to pick and place the objects, require the robot base to be at configuration `#o3`. However, the robot is *currently* at base configuration `v3`.  And here's the kicker: *there are no provided actions to move from v3 to #o3*. There's the `move_base` action, but it just moves the base from `v3` to `v3` via a trajectory (#o0). The robot just stays where it is.  And the initial state explicitly says that base configuration starts at `v3`.
           
           I need to be very precise here:  The planner uses distinct symbols, in the initial state and in the preconditions. The initial state says `atbconf(v3)`.  The `kin` facts that are used as preconditions for my action state `atbconf(#o3)`. Therefore, `#o3` is a continuous parameter that needs to be "instantiated" by the base motion planner, and `v3` is a specific known configuration. These two configurations are not the same, and PDDL symbols must be unified, not substituted, so that all the symbols are the same. Since that is not achieved in this instance, it seems that the goal is now unreachable.
           
           So basically, I can't pick up or place any of the objects because I can't satisfy the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition.  No `pick`, no `place`, no movement.  Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the current action definitions and initial state.  I can't manipulate the objects to get them "on" the target surface (v20) at pose #o2.  The solution is impossible.
