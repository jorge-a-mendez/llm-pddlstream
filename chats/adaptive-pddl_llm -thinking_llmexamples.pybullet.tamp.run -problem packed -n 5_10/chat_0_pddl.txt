           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. My objective is to get objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 all *on* object v20.  The system defines 'on' as something being supported and at a particular pose relative to another object. Let's first check the initial state. Hmm, it appears all those target objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) are currently *on* v11, according to the provided facts regarding the `supported` and `atpose` predicates.
           
           The obvious strategy to achieve the goal would be to move these objects from v11 to v20.  My plan, in theory, would involve a series of *pick* and *place* actions for each object. That seems the most logical approach in this sort of robotic manipulation problem.
           
           Now, let's look at the available actions.  It's clear from a quick scan that only a single action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, is available. It just moves the base but doesn't actually interact with any objects, and crucially it changes the `canmove()` predicate. More importantly, it doesn't give me any way to *pick* or *place* objects. It has preconditions I can easily meet, but it seems completely irrelevant to the central task.
           
           I've re-examined the available action list a few times, just to be sure.  No, still the same, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is all I have.  The problem statement specifically limits me to the given actions. Since `pick` and `place` actions are required to alter the `on` predicate and they aren't available, I must conclude that the goal is unattainable with the current action set. This is a classic example of a problem where the action space is insufficiently expressive to achieve the goal state.  I can't manipulate the objects, so I can't reach the target configuration.  The problem is *unsolvable* given the constraints.
