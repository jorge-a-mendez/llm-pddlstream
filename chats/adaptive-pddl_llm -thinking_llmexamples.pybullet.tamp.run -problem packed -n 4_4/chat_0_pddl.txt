               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal state where objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all located on region `v18`. From the initial state, I see that these objects are currently supported on `v11`.  My analysis reveals the following critical points:
           
           1.  **Action Availability is the Bottleneck:**  The system explicitly states that only the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted. This single action moves the robot's base but does *nothing* to alter the positions of the target objects. It is essentially an idle action, consuming the `canmove()` predicate. I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects' positions, but I don't have them.
           
           2.  **Required vs. Available Actions:** To satisfy the goal, I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions. However, with only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` action instance allowed, I cannot pick up and place the objects.
           
           3.  **Goal State Requirements:** To achieve the `on(vX, v18)` goal, the facts `atpose(vX, p_vX)` and `supported(vX, p_vX, v18)` would need to be true. I can see from the available facts that `supported(vX, #o2, v18)` could be potentially true, but this means that `#o2` is a pose that could support `vX` on `v18`, it does not mean that the target object is already on it. The initial state shows `atpose(vX, vY) and supported(vX, vY, v11)`. The provided actions can't change these `atpose` facts to satisfy my goal.
           
           4.  **Inference:** Since I can't move the objects due to the lack of necessary actions and only `move_base` action instance is provided, and the initial state clearly indicates the objects supported on `v11`, then the goal state to place all objects on `v18` is demonstrably unachievable within the given constraints.
