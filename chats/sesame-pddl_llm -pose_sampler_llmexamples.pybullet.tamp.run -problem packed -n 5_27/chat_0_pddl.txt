           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0977x0.0977. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's a large area for stable placements. The object can be placed at various positions and orientations on the surface. Since it's a square object on a square surface, the orientation (theta) doesn't affect stability in terms of bounding box containment as long as the center is within the bounds. However, to provide a diverse set of placements, I will vary both the position and the orientation. I will choose angles that are multiples of pi/4 for variety, though for a square object, rotations by multiples of pi/2 would yield the same bounding box. I will also distribute the x and y positions across the surface, ensuring the object's full extent remains within the surface's boundaries. The surface spans from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object's half-extent is approximately 0.0488. Therefore, the center of the object can range from -0.135 + 0.0488 to 0.135 - 0.0488, which is approximately -0.0862 to 0.0862.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID: 4) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0884x0.0884. This object is slightly smaller than the previous one (ID: 6). We have one previously placed object (ID: 6) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), which means its bounding box is centered at (0,0) and its half-extents are approximately 0.0488. So it occupies the region from roughly -0.0488 to 0.0488 in x and y.
           
           The new object (ID: 4) has half-extents of approximately 0.0442. Its placement must avoid collision with object 6. The valid range for the center of object 4 on the surface is approximately -0.135 + 0.0442 to 0.135 - 0.0442, which is approximately -0.0908 to 0.0908.
           
           To avoid collision with object 6 at (0,0), the new object's center must be far enough away. If object 6 is centered at (0,0) with half-extents `h6_x`, `h6_y`, and object 4 has half-extents `h4_x`, `h4_y`, then to avoid collision along the x-axis, `abs(x_4)` must be greater than or equal to `h6_x + h4_x`. Similarly for y.
           `h6_x` = `h6_y` = 0.09768721794166726 / 2 = 0.04884.
           `h4_x` = `h4_y` = 0.08836076416093952 / 2 = 0.04418.
           So, to avoid collision, `abs(x_4)` >= 0.04884 + 0.04418 = 0.09302, and `abs(y_4)` >= 0.09302.
           
           Therefore, placements centered at (0,0), or too close to (0,0) will likely collide. I will focus on placements near the edges and corners of the surface, outside the central region occupied by object 6.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0987x0.0987. This object is slightly larger than object 6 and object 4.
           We have two previously placed objects:
           - Object 6: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-extents `h6` = 0.09768721794166726 / 2 = 0.04884.
           - Object 4: (0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.091). Half-extents `h4` = 0.08836076416093952 / 2 = 0.04418.
           
           The new object (ID: 5) has half-extents `h5` = 0.09867013170384054 / 2 = 0.049335.
           The valid range for the center of object 5 on the surface is approximately -0.135 + 0.049335 to 0.135 - 0.049335, which is approximately -0.085665 to 0.085665.
           
           Collision avoidance:
           1. With Object 6 (at (0,0)): `abs(x_5)` >= `h6` + `h5` = 0.04884 + 0.049335 = 0.098175. Similarly for `abs(y_5)`.
           2. With Object 4 (at (0.091, 0.091)):
              `abs(x_5 - 0.091)` >= `h4` + `h5` = 0.04418 + 0.049335 = 0.093515.
              `abs(y_5 - 0.091)` >= `h4` + `h5` = 0.04418 + 0.049335 = 0.093515.
           
           This means object 5 must be outside a circle of radius 0.098175 centered at (0,0), and also outside a square region around (0.091, 0.091). The corner placement of object 4 at (0.091, 0.091) makes it difficult to place another object in that quadrant.
           The center of object 4 is at (0.091, 0.091). Its bounding box extends from (0.091 - 0.04418, 0.091 - 0.04418) to (0.091 + 0.04418, 0.091 + 0.04418), which is (0.04682, 0.04682) to (0.13518, 0.13518). Since the surface upper bound is 0.135, object 4 is effectively occupying the upper-right corner.
           
           Given the existing objects, the available space is becoming quite constrained. Object 6 covers the center. Object 4 covers the top-right corner.
           The valid x and y range for object 5 is approximately [-0.085665, 0.085665].
           However, the collision check with object 6 forces `abs(x_5)` >= 0.098175 and `abs(y_5)` >= 0.098175. This is outside the valid range for object 5's center. This means that if the orientation is 0 or pi/2, object 5 CANNOT be placed on surface 0 without colliding with object 6.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision logic for square objects. For an object centered at (x,y) with half-extent h, its AABB is [x-h, x+h] and [y-h, y+h].
           Object 6: center (0,0), h6 = 0.04884. AABB: [-0.04884, 0.04884] x [-0.04884, 0.04884].
           Object 4: center (0.091, 0.091), h4 = 0.04418. AABB: [0.091-0.04418, 0.091+0.04418] x [0.091-0.04418, 0.091+0.04418] = [0.04682, 0.13518] x [0.04682, 0.13518]. Effectively limited by surface to [0.04682, 0.135] x [0.04682, 0.135].
           
           New Object 5: h5 = 0.049335.
           Surface bounds: [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135].
           Allowed center range for object 5: [-0.135+h5, 0.135-h5] = [-0.085665, 0.085665] in x and y.
           
           Collision with Object 6:
           If `x_5` is between -0.04884 - h5 and 0.04884 + h5, there's an x-collision.
           If `x_5` is between -0.098175 and 0.098175, there's an x-collision.
           Since the allowed center range for object 5 is [-0.085665, 0.085665], any x-placement within this range WILL collide with object 6.
           This implies it's impossible to place object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with object 6, given the current orientation strategy (0 or pi/2).
           
           However, the object's *rotated* bounding box is what matters for collision. Since the object is square, its AABB is the same regardless of rotation by 0 or pi/2. Rotations by pi/4 (0.785 rad) would make the effective AABB larger. Given the problem statement, I must find a stable placement. If no placement works with 0 or pi/2, I should try other angles or re-evaluate. The problem implies "fully contained within the bounds of the surface" means the object's AABB when placed (which can be rotated) must be within the surface's AABB.
           
           Let's assume the collision check uses the object's AABB *after* rotation. For a square object of side `s`, if rotated by `theta`, the effective AABB dimensions are `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           For a square object, `s_x = s_y = s`.
           `s5 = 0.09867013170384054`.
           If `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, effective size is `s5 = 0.09867`. Half-extent `h5 = 0.049335`.
           If `theta = pi/4`, effective size is `s5 * sqrt(2)`. No, it's `s5 * (cos(pi/4) + sin(pi/4))` = `s5 * (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2))` = `s5 * 2/sqrt(2)` = `s5 * sqrt(2)`.
           Effective half-extent `h5_rot = s5 * sqrt(2) / 2 = s5 / sqrt(2)`. No this is incorrect. The rotated bounding box of a square of side `s` at 45 degrees has a side length of `s * sqrt(2)`. This means its half-extent from center to edge is `s * sqrt(2) / 2`.
           Let's verify. A square with corners at (s/2, s/2), (-s/2, s/2), etc. has an AABB of side `s`. If rotated by 45 degrees, the corners become (0, s/sqrt(2)), (s/sqrt(2), 0), (0, -s/sqrt(2)), (-s/sqrt(2), 0). The AABB of this rotated square has side length `s * sqrt(2)`.
           So, for object 5, `s5 = 0.09867`. At `theta=pi/4`, the effective AABB dimensions are `0.09867 * sqrt(2) = 0.1395`.
           The effective half-extent `h5_rot` = `0.1395 / 2 = 0.06975`.
           
           Maximum allowed center for object 5 on surface 0: `0.135 - h5_rot = 0.135 - 0.06975 = 0.06525`.
           So if `theta = pi/4`, the valid center range is `[-0.06525, 0.06525]`.
           
           Now, check collision again for `theta = pi/4`:
           - With Object 6 (at (0,0), h6 = 0.04884): Collision if `abs(x_5)` < `h6` + `h5_rot` = 0.04884 + 0.06975 = 0.11859.
             This means if `x_5` is in `[-0.11859, 0.11859]`, it collides.
             Since the valid range for `x_5` is `[-0.06525, 0.06525]`, any placement will collide with object 6.
           
           Conclusion: Given the current positions of object 6 (at the center) and object 4 (in the upper-right corner), and the relatively large size of object 5, it seems impossible to place object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with either object 6 or object 4, or going out of bounds. The only way this would be possible is if the collision check function is simplified and only considers the *object's* dimensions (size_x, size_y) regardless of rotation, which would mean that rotation does not change the effective AABB. The problem statement says "x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)", which implies these dimensions are fixed regardless of rotation if not explicitly mentioned otherwise. If that is the case, `h5 = 0.049335` is always the half-extent.
           
           Let's assume the common interpretation: an object is described by its AABB *in its own coordinate system*, and when placed with `theta`, the rotated AABB is used for scene collision/containment. My previous calculation for `h5_rot` should be correct if `theta = pi/4`.
           The fact that `abs(x_5)` needs to be greater than 0.11859 for a placement not to collide with object 6, but the maximum allowed `abs(x_5)` is 0.06525 (due to surface bounds), means there is NO stable placement for object 5 on this surface that avoids object 6, regardless of its rotation.
           
           This is a tricky situation. I must provide 50 placements. Could it be that object 6 is allowed to be picked up and moved if a new object is placed in its spot? The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". And for successful placements, they "did not collide with fixed obstacles". This implies object 6 and 4 are fixed obstacles now.
           
           Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the problem or my geometric reasoning is flawed. I'm assuming fixed AABBs for objects and surfaces.
           
           Let's re-read: "The geometry of the surfaces will be described as a list of axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), while the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)." This phrasing for the object could be interpreted as the object *always* having those AABB dimensions, irrespective of its rotation. This is a common simplification in some systems where rotation only rotates the internal geometry but the external collision envelope (AABB) remains fixed.
           
           If the object's AABB dimensions (0.09867, 0.09867) *always* apply, regardless of rotation, then its half-extent is `h5 = 0.049335`.
           Valid center range for object 5: `[-0.085665, 0.085665]`.
           
           Collision with Object 6 (center (0,0), h6 = 0.04884):
           `abs(x_5)` needs to be >= `h6` + `h5` = 0.04884 + 0.049335 = 0.098175 to avoid x-collision.
           But the maximum allowed `abs(x_5)` is 0.085665.
           This still leads to the conclusion that object 5 cannot be placed without colliding with object 6.
           
           Is there any other surface? No, just surface 0.
           
           Could it be that the previous placements were not 'stable' if another object is placed and causes a collision? No, it says "did not collide with fixed obstacles". Non-fixed obstacles are other objects. "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle". This means new placements might collide with previously placed objects.
           
           The situation seems impossible with a strict interpretation of AABB collision and containment. However, I must provide 50 placements. I will try to place the object as far away as possible from objects 6 and 4, which are essentially occupying the center and the top-right corner.
           
           I will attempt to place object 5 in the other corners, specifically the bottom-left, top-left, and bottom-right. I'll use the maximum allowed center coordinates `0.085` and `-0.085` (slightly rounded from 0.085665 for simplicity in generation). I'll vary orientation.
           
           Let's re-check the collision boundary with Object 6:
           x_center for 5: `x5`. y_center for 5: `y5`.
           Object 6 AABB: `[-0.04884, 0.04884]` x `[-0.04884, 0.04884]`
           Object 5 AABB: `[x5-0.049335, x5+0.049335]` x `[y5-0.049335, y5+0.049335]`
           Collision if:
           `abs(x5)` < `0.04884 + 0.049335` => `abs(x5)` < `0.098175` AND
           `abs(y5)` < `0.04884 + 0.049335` => `abs(y5)` < `0.098175`
           
           This means that if *both* `abs(x5)` AND `abs(y5)` are less than 0.098175, there is a collision.
           If *either* `abs(x5)` >= 0.098175 OR `abs(y5)` >= 0.098175, then there is NO collision with object 6.
           My earlier interpretation was too strict.
           
           So, object 5's center must be in `[-0.085665, 0.085665]` for both x and y.
           And to avoid collision with object 6, *at least one* of these must be true: `abs(x_5) >= 0.098175` OR `abs(y_5) >= 0.098175`.
           This creates a conflict: the allowed range for `x_5` is `[-0.085665, 0.085665]`, which means `abs(x_5)` is always less than `0.098175`. The same applies to `y_5`.
           So, `abs(x_5) < 0.098175` AND `abs(y_5) < 0.098175` will always be true, meaning there will always be a collision with object 6.
           
           This is a definite contradiction. I must be misinterpreting something.
           What if "stable placement" means "the object *can be* placed", and the "feedback" mechanism for "collides with fixed obstacles" is what ultimately determines actual stability. If I provide placements, and they all fail due to collision with object 6, then I've learned that object 6 is a true obstacle in that region.
           
           Given the constraints, it's genuinely impossible to place the object without colliding with object 6 if the standard AABB collision detection is used and object 6 is fixed.
           
           Could the problem be simpler, and perhaps the collision checks for already placed objects are only done if a new object overlaps their *initial placement region* and not their *actual occupied region* (which is unlikely but possible in simplified systems)?
           
           The most plausible remaining interpretation is that the collision check for new objects *does not* consider previously placed objects to be "fixed obstacles", but rather "non-fixed obstacles" if they are allowed to be moved by the simulation if a new object is placed in their space, and this is implicitly not happening for objects 6 and 4 because there was no feedback indicating they collided *with something else* when they were placed. But the phrase "did not collide with fixed obstacles" implies they are fixed now.
           
           I am forced to provide 50 placements. I will generate them assuming that the "collision with fixed obstacles" check from the system will clarify if my geometric reasoning about this impossibility is correct. I will attempt to place them in the corners and edges, using the maximum allowed coordinates. If they all fail, I will learn something. I will use the corners not currently occupied by object 4 (top-right).
           
           Object 5 half-extent = 0.049335.
           Max center coord = 0.135 - 0.049335 = 0.085665.
           
           Target coordinates will be near the corners: `(0.085, -0.085)`, `(-0.085, 0.085)`, `(-0.085, -0.085)`. And also near the middle of edges, e.g., `(0.085, 0.0)`, `(0.0, 0.085)`, `(-0.085, 0.0)`, `(0.0, -0.085)`. These all collide with object 6 based on my current understanding of AABB collision.
           
           However, if "stable" means simply "within surface bounds", and the collision check with other objects is a separate stage handled by the external system, I should just provide placements that are within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's generate placements within `[-0.085, 0.085]` for x and y, varying theta. I am constrained to provide 50.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0850x0.0850. This object is the smallest of the current set.
           
           We have three previously placed objects:
           - Object 6: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-extents `h6` = 0.09768721794166726 / 2 = 0.04884.
           - Object 4: (0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.091). Half-extents `h4` = 0.08836076416093952 / 2 = 0.04418.
           - Object 5: (0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085). Half-extents `h5` = 0.09867013170384054 / 2 = 0.049335.
           
           The new object (ID: 7) has half-extents `h7` = 0.08503119462194561 / 2 = 0.042515.
           The valid range for the center of object 7 on the surface is approximately -0.135 + 0.042515 to 0.135 - 0.042515, which is approximately -0.092485 to 0.092485.
           
           Let's check for collisions with the three existing objects, assuming their AABBs are fixed and are non-rotational (as per my refined interpretation from the last turn, which turned out to be successful).
           
           Collision avoidance strategy:
           Object 6 is at (0,0). Its AABB is `[-0.04884, 0.04884]` x `[-0.04884, 0.04884]`.
           Collision with O6 if `abs(x7)` < `h6 + h7` = 0.04884 + 0.042515 = 0.091355 AND `abs(y7)` < `h6 + h7` = 0.091355.
           Object 4 is at (0.091, 0.091). Its AABB is `[0.04682, 0.13518]` x `[0.04682, 0.13518]`.
           Collision with O4 if `abs(x7 - 0.091)` < `h4 + h7` = 0.04418 + 0.042515 = 0.086695 AND `abs(y7 - 0.091)` < `h4 + h7` = 0.086695.
           Object 5 is at (-0.085, -0.085). Its AABB is `[-0.085 - 0.049335, -0.085 + 0.049335]` x `[-0.085 - 0.049335, -0.085 + 0.049335]` = `[-0.134335, -0.035665]` x `[-0.134335, -0.035665]`.
           Collision with O5 if `abs(x7 - (-0.085))` < `h5 + h7` = 0.049335 + 0.042515 = 0.09185 AND `abs(y7 - (-0.085))` < `h5 + h7` = 0.09185.
           
           Available space:
           The center of object 7 must be in `[-0.092485, 0.092485]` for both x and y.
           
           From object 6:
           To avoid collision with O6, `abs(x7) >= 0.091355` OR `abs(y7) >= 0.091355`.
           Since the max `abs(x7)` and `abs(y7)` is 0.092485, there is a very narrow band along the edges of the central region that is free from object 6. For example, if `x7` is 0.092, then `y7` can be anywhere from `-0.092485` to `0.092485`.
           
           From object 4 (top-right corner):
           `x_center_4 = 0.091`, `y_center_4 = 0.091`.
           To avoid collision with O4: `abs(x7 - 0.091) >= 0.086695` OR `abs(y7 - 0.091) >= 0.086695`.
           This means `x7 - 0.091 >= 0.086695` (so `x7 >= 0.177695`) OR `x7 - 0.091 <= -0.086695` (so `x7 <= 0.004305`).
           And `y7 - 0.091 >= 0.086695` (so `y7 >= 0.177695`) OR `y7 - 0.091 <= -0.086695` (so `y7 <= 0.004305`).
           Effectively, object 7 needs to be significantly away from (0.091, 0.091). Since `x7, y7` max out at ~0.092, `x7 >= 0.177695` is impossible. So, `x7 <= 0.004305` AND `y7 <= 0.004305` is needed to avoid object 4 if object 7 is in the upper right. This means object 7 has to be in the bottom-left of object 4.
           This means for the upper-right quadrant, `x7` and `y7` must be small (near zero) to avoid object 4. But if they are small, they collide with object 6. So the top-right quadrant is pretty much out of bounds for object 7.
           
           From object 5 (bottom-left corner):
           `x_center_5 = -0.085`, `y_center_5 = -0.085`.
           To avoid collision with O5: `abs(x7 - (-0.085)) >= 0.09185` OR `abs(y7 - (-0.085)) >= 0.09185`.
           This means `x7 + 0.085 >= 0.09185` (so `x7 >= 0.00685`) OR `x7 + 0.085 <= -0.09185` (so `x7 <= -0.17685`).
           And `y7 + 0.085 >= 0.09185` (so `y7 >= 0.00685`) OR `y7 + 0.085 <= -0.09185` (so `y7 <= -0.17685`).
           Effectively, object 7 needs to be significantly away from (-0.085, -0.085). Similar to object 4, this means `x7 >= 0.00685` AND `y7 >= 0.00685` is needed to avoid object 5 if object 7 is in the bottom-left.
           
           Summary of available regions:
           - For O7 center `(x,y)`: `x,y` in `[-0.092485, 0.092485]`
           - Avoid O6: `abs(x) >= 0.091355` OR `abs(y) >= 0.091355`. This means `x` must be in `[-0.092485, -0.091355]` or `[0.091355, 0.092485]` OR `y` must be in `[-0.092485, -0.091355]` or `[0.091355, 0.092485]`. This creates very thin strips along the outer boundary of the allowed region.
           - Avoid O4 (upper-right): `x <= 0.004305` or `y <= 0.004305`.
           - Avoid O5 (bottom-left): `x >= 0.00685` or `y >= 0.00685`.
           
           Combined, to avoid O6, O4, and O5:
           Let's try the top-left corner region.
           `x` needs to be in `[-0.092485, -0.091355]`.
           `y` can be in `[-0.092485, 0.092485]`.
           If `x` is in `[-0.092485, -0.091355]` (e.g., `x = -0.092`), then object 7 avoids object 6 (because `abs(x)` is sufficiently large).
           Now, check collision with object 4 and 5 in this top-left region.
           For `x = -0.092`:
           - Collision with O4 if `(-0.092 - 0.091) < 0.086695` and `(y - 0.091) < 0.086695`. `-0.183` is already less than `0.086695`, so the first condition is met. So if `y` is in the range `[0.091 - 0.086695, 0.091 + 0.086695]` (i.e., `[0.004305, 0.177695]`), it collides with O4. The allowed y for O7 is `[-0.092485, 0.092485]`. So if `y` is in `[0.004305, 0.092485]`, it collides with O4.
           - Collision with O5 if `(-0.092 - (-0.085)) < 0.09185` and `(y - (-0.085)) < 0.09185`. `-0.007` is less than `0.09185`, so the first condition is met. So if `y` is in the range `[-0.085 - 0.09185, -0.085 + 0.09185]` (i.e., `[-0.17685, 0.00685]`), it collides with O5. So if `y` is in `[-0.092485, 0.00685]`, it collides with O5.
           
           So, if `x = -0.092`:
           - To avoid O4, `y` must not be in `[0.004305, 0.092485]`.
           - To avoid O5, `y` must not be in `[-0.092485, 0.00685]`.
           
           This leaves a very narrow sliver of available y values.
           A `y` value that avoids O4 is `y < 0.004305`.
           A `y` value that avoids O5 is `y > 0.00685`.
           These are contradictory. If `x = -0.092`, it cannot avoid both O4 and O5 in the y direction.
           
           This is even more constrained than the previous object. It seems that given the positions of the three existing objects (center, top-right, bottom-left), there is virtually no space left for this new object (ID: 7).
           The only remaining "free" areas (narrow strips) are `x` in `[0.091355, 0.092485]` (right edge) or `[-0.092485, -0.091355]` (left edge), OR `y` in `[0.091355, 0.092485]` (top edge) or `[-0.092485, -0.091355]` (bottom edge).
           
           Let's pick `x = 0.092` (right edge).
           - Avoids O6 because `abs(x)` is `0.092 > 0.091355`.
           - Check O4 (`x_center_4 = 0.091`, `y_center_4 = 0.091`). Collision if `abs(0.092 - 0.091)` < 0.086695 (i.e. `0.001 < 0.086695`) AND `abs(y - 0.091)` < 0.086695.
             The `0.001 < 0.086695` is TRUE, so it will collide with O4 in x if y is in collision range.
             So if `y` is in `[0.091 - 0.086695, 0.091 + 0.086695]` (i.e., `[0.004305, 0.177695]`), it collides with O4.
             Since the allowed y range for O7 is `[-0.092485, 0.092485]`, if `y` is in `[0.004305, 0.092485]`, it collides with O4.
           - Check O5 (`x_center_5 = -0.085`, `y_center_5 = -0.085`). Collision if `abs(0.092 - (-0.085))` < 0.09185 (i.e. `0.177 < 0.09185`) AND `abs(y - (-0.085))` < 0.09185.
             The `0.177 < 0.09185` is FALSE, so it does NOT collide with O5 in x, and thus cannot collide with O5 regardless of `y`.
           
           So, for `x = 0.092`, we need to avoid O4. This means `y` must be outside `[0.004305, 0.092485]`.
           Therefore, valid `y` for `x = 0.092` is `[-0.092485, 0.004305)`.
           Let's try a placement: `(0, 0.0, 0.092, 0.0)`.
           This seems to work. `x=0.092` avoids O6. `x=0.092` avoids O5. `y=0.0` avoids O4. And the object is within surface bounds.
           
           Let's try another one: `(0, 0.0, 0.092, -0.092)`.
           `x=0.092` avoids O6 and O5. `y=-0.092` avoids O4. Within surface bounds.
           
           Similarly, by symmetry, we can use `x = -0.092`:
           - Avoids O6.
           - Check O4 (`x_center_4 = 0.091`, `y_center_4 = 0.091`). Collision if `abs(-0.092 - 0.091)` < 0.086695 (i.e. `0.183 < 0.086695`) AND `abs(y - 0.091)` < 0.086695.
             `0.183 < 0.086695` is FALSE. So does NOT collide with O4.
           - Check O5 (`x_center_5 = -0.085`, `y_center_5 = -0.085`). Collision if `abs(-0.092 - (-0.085))` < 0.09185 (i.e. `0.007 < 0.09185`) AND `abs(y - (-0.085))` < 0.09185.
             `0.007 < 0.09185` is TRUE. So it will collide with O5 in x if y is in collision range.
             So if `y` is in `[-0.085 - 0.09185, -0.085 + 0.09185]` (i.e., `[-0.17685, 0.00685]`), it collides with O5.
             Since the allowed y range for O7 is `[-0.092485, 0.092485]`, if `y` is in `[-0.092485, 0.00685]`, it collides with O5.
           
           So, for `x = -0.092`, we need to avoid O5. This means `y` must be outside `[-0.092485, 0.00685]`.
           Therefore, valid `y` for `x = -0.092` is `(0.00685, 0.092485]`.
           Let's try a placement: `(0, 0.0, -0.092, 0.092)`.
           This seems to work. `x=-0.092` avoids O6 and O4. `y=0.092` avoids O5.
           
           This means we have two small "pockets" along the edges:
           1. `x` near `0.092`, `y` from `-0.092` up to `0.004`.
           2. `x` near `-0.092`, `y` from `0.007` up to `0.092`.
           
           I will generate placements in these two regions, varying theta.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID: 8) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0784x0.0784. This object is the smallest one so far.
           
           We have four previously placed objects:
           - Object 6: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-extents `h6` = 0.09768721794166726 / 2 = 0.04884.
           - Object 4: (0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.091). Half-extents `h4` = 0.08836076416093952 / 2 = 0.04418.
           - Object 5: (0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085). Half-extents `h5` = 0.09867013170384054 / 2 = 0.049335.
           - Object 7: (0, 0.0, 0.092, 0.0). Half-extents `h7` = 0.08503119462194561 / 2 = 0.042515.
           
           The new object (ID: 8) has half-extents `h8` = 0.0783940330760178 / 2 = 0.039197.
           The valid range for the center of object 8 on the surface is approximately -0.135 + 0.039197 to 0.135 - 0.039197, which is approximately -0.095803 to 0.095803.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the free space considering all placed objects.
           
           Collision avoidance strategy (assuming non-rotational AABB fixed):
           1. Object 6 (O6): center (0,0), h6 = 0.04884.
              Collision if `abs(x8)` < `h6 + h8` = 0.04884 + 0.039197 = 0.088037 AND `abs(y8)` < `h6 + h8` = 0.088037.
              To avoid O6: `abs(x8) >= 0.088037` OR `abs(y8) >= 0.088037`.
           
           2. Object 4 (O4): center (0.091, 0.091), h4 = 0.04418.
              Collision if `abs(x8 - 0.091)` < `h4 + h8` = 0.04418 + 0.039197 = 0.083377 AND `abs(y8 - 0.091)` < `h4 + h8` = 0.083377.
              To avoid O4: `abs(x8 - 0.091) >= 0.083377` OR `abs(y8 - 0.091) >= 0.083377`.
              This means `x8 >= 0.091 + 0.083377 = 0.174377` (impossible) OR `x8 <= 0.091 - 0.083377 = 0.007623`.
              And `y8 >= 0.174377` (impossible) OR `y8 <= 0.007623`.
              So, to avoid O4, `x8 <= 0.007623` OR `y8 <= 0.007623`.
           
           3. Object 5 (O5): center (-0.085, -0.085), h5 = 0.049335.
              Collision if `abs(x8 - (-0.085))` < `h5 + h8` = 0.049335 + 0.039197 = 0.088532 AND `abs(y8 - (-0.085))` < `h5 + h8` = 0.088532.
              To avoid O5: `abs(x8 + 0.085) >= 0.088532` OR `abs(y8 + 0.085) >= 0.088532`.
              This means `x8 >= -0.085 + 0.088532 = 0.003532` OR `x8 <= -0.085 - 0.088532 = -0.173532` (impossible).
              And `y8 >= 0.003532` OR `y8 <= -0.173532` (impossible).
              So, to avoid O5, `x8 >= 0.003532` OR `y8 >= 0.003532`.
           
           4. Object 7 (O7): center (0.092, 0.0), h7 = 0.042515.
              Collision if `abs(x8 - 0.092)` < `h7 + h8` = 0.042515 + 0.039197 = 0.081712 AND `abs(y8 - 0.0)` < `h7 + h8` = 0.081712.
              To avoid O7: `abs(x8 - 0.092) >= 0.081712` OR `abs(y8) >= 0.081712`.
              This means `x8 >= 0.092 + 0.081712 = 0.173712` (impossible) OR `x8 <= 0.092 - 0.081712 = 0.010288`.
              And `y8 >= 0.081712` OR `y8 <= -0.081712`.
              So, to avoid O7: `x8 <= 0.010288` OR `abs(y8) >= 0.081712`.
           
           Summary of conditions for center `(x,y)` of Object 8:
           - Surface bounds: `x,y` in `[-0.095803, 0.095803]`.
           - Avoid O6: `abs(x) >= 0.088037` OR `abs(y) >= 0.088037`.
           - Avoid O4: `x <= 0.007623` OR `y <= 0.007623`.
           - Avoid O5: `x >= 0.003532` OR `y >= 0.003532`.
           - Avoid O7: `x <= 0.010288` OR `abs(y) >= 0.081712`.
           
           Let's try to place O8 in the top-left quadrant (where `x < 0`, `y > 0`).
           Allowed `x` range for O8 is `[-0.095803, 0.095803]`.
           Allowed `y` range for O8 is `[-0.095803, 0.095803]`.
           
           Consider `x` in `[-0.095803, -0.088037]` (e.g. `x = -0.09`) to satisfy O6 condition.
           If `x = -0.09`:
           - Avoids O6 because `abs(-0.09) = 0.09 > 0.088037`.
           - Check O4: `x = -0.09 <= 0.007623`. This condition is satisfied, so O8 avoids O4.
           - Check O5: `x = -0.09`. Condition `x >= 0.003532` is FALSE. So `abs(y + 0.085) >= 0.088532` must be true.
             This means `y + 0.085 >= 0.088532` (so `y >= 0.003532`) OR `y + 0.085 <= -0.088532` (so `y <= -0.173532`).
             Since `y` must be in `[-0.095803, 0.095803]`, to avoid O5, we need `y >= 0.003532`.
           - Check O7: `x = -0.09 <= 0.010288`. This condition is satisfied, so O8 avoids O7.
           
           So, if `x = -0.09`:
           - `y` must be in `[-0.095803, 0.095803]`.
           - `y >= 0.003532` to avoid O5.
           
           Thus, if `x = -0.09`, `y` must be in `[0.003532, 0.095803]`.
           Let's try: `(-0.09, 0.005)`, `(-0.09, 0.05)`, `(-0.09, 0.09)`. These are in the top-left quadrant.
           
           Consider `y` in `[-0.095803, -0.088037]` (e.g. `y = -0.09`) to satisfy O6 condition.
           If `y = -0.09`:
           - Avoids O6 because `abs(-0.09) = 0.09 > 0.088037`.
           - Check O4: `y = -0.09 <= 0.007623`. This condition is satisfied, so O8 avoids O4.
           - Check O5: `y = -0.09`. Condition `y >= 0.003532` is FALSE. So `abs(x + 0.085) >= 0.088532` must be true.
             This means `x >= 0.003532`.
           - Check O7: `abs(y) = 0.09 > 0.081712`. This condition is satisfied, so O8 avoids O7.
           
           So, if `y = -0.09`:
           - `x` must be in `[-0.095803, 0.095803]`.
           - `x >= 0.003532` to avoid O5.
           
           Thus, if `y = -0.09`, `x` must be in `[0.003532, 0.095803]`.
           Let's try: `(0.005, -0.09)`, `(0.05, -0.09)`, `(0.09, -0.09)`. These are in the bottom-right quadrant.
           Note that the actual successful placement of object 7 was at `(0.092, 0.0)`, which itself is near this region `(0.09, -0.09)`.
           Let's verify `(0.09, -0.09)` given O7 at `(0.092, 0.0)`.
           `abs(0.09 - 0.092)` = 0.002. This is less than `h7 + h8 = 0.081712`. So x collides with O7.
           `abs(-0.09 - 0.0)` = 0.09. This is greater than `h7 + h8 = 0.081712`. So y avoids O7.
           Since it avoids in y, `(0.09, -0.09)` should be okay relative to O7.
           
           This suggests the strategy from the previous object (placing near the edge, or 'corner' regions) is still viable.
           
           I will focus on:
           1. Top-left 'corner' (e.g., `x=-0.09`, `y` from `0.005` to `0.09`).
           2. Bottom-right 'corner' (e.g., `y=-0.09`, `x` from `0.005` to `0.09`).
           3. Small gaps between existing objects and surface edges.
           For example, the region just below object 7. `y` values slightly below 0. `x` needs to avoid O6 and O7.
           If `x` is in `[0.01, 0.08]`, then `abs(x)` is less than `0.088037`, so it collides with O6 in x. To avoid O6, `abs(y)` must be `>= 0.088037`. This would put it far from O7.
           So it seems the best strategy is to fill out the remaining corners.
