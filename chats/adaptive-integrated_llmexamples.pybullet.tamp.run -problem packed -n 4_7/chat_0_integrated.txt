User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.123, 0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.586, 0.81).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.139, -0.348, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.822, 0.569).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.198, 0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.551, 0.835).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).

           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.054, -0.403), (0.04, -0.309)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.167, 0.24), (-0.079, 0.329)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.094, -0.393), (0.184, -0.302)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.007, -0.356, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.973, 0.233).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.152, 0.385), (0.244, 0.477)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains a base configuration `v3`, two arms `v4` and `v6` with arm configurations `v5` and `v7` respectively, and several objects: `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. There are also some surfaces: `v10`, `v11`, and `v18`. The goal is to place all objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` on surface `v18`.
           
           Currently, all objects are on `v11`:
           - `v14` is at `v15` on `v11`.
           - `v12` is at `v13` on `v11`.
           - `v16` is at `v17` on `v11`.
           - `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`.
           
           The initial state also provides various stackable relations and grasps:
           - `v14` can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`.
           - `v12` can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`.
           - `v16` can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`.
           - `v8` can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`.
           
           The task requires moving all four objects from `v11` to `v18`. Since `v18` is a dummy surface and no specific pose for `v18` is given, I will place the objects on `v11` in a new pose that allows them to be 'on' `v18` according to the supported predicates. The given continuous pose `#o2` is the only option for placing objects on `v10` or `v18`. Therefore, all objects will need to be placed at `#o2` on `v18`. This is impossible, as each object needs a unique pose. However, the problem statement says "if the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all)". This means I can provide four distinct continuous values for `#o2`, one for each object.
           
           Since there are no pick or place actions in the provided action instances, and no kin, atraj, or armmotion predicates, the goal is unreachable. The only available action is `move_base`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom on(v8, v18)`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` on `v18`. The initial state indicates that these objects are on `v11`. The previously provided plan only contained a `move_base` action, which does not modify the `on` predicates. To achieve the goal, `pick` and `place` actions are required.
           
           However, examining the provided initial state and available action instances, there are no `pick` or `place` action instances given. The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Without `pick` and `place` actions, it is impossible to move the objects from `v11` to `v18` and thus achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed action instances.
