(Thoughts: **Revised Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, after meticulously dissecting the problem, I've constructed a plan to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The crux of this problem lies in the constrained movements of the rovers, which heavily influence how we interpret the visibility and proximity predicates. Since the only available `move` actions are essentially no-ops, the configurations referenced in predicates like `imagevisible` and `comvisible` *must* correspond to the initial `atconf` positions of the rovers.
           
           My strategy involves exploiting the strengths of each rover. Rover `v14`, already at configuration `v15`, will handle capturing and transmitting images of objectives `v17` and `v18`, utilizing its calibrated camera `v10`. Concurrently, it'll sample and analyze a stone rock (`v4`) which it is already above in configuration `v15` for the purpose of getting to `receivedanalysis(v4)`. Then it will drop the sample in order to satisy the final goal conditions which need it to have `free` storage.
           
           Meanwhile, rover `v12`, stationary at `v13`, will take on the task of sampling and analyzing a soil rock (`v7`) which it is already above in configuration `v13`. It will then transmit the analysis and also drop its sample to satisfy the goal predicate that it also must have free storage.
           
           Here's the detailed breakdown:
           
           **Rover v14's Actions:**
           
           1.  **Calibrate camera (v14):**
               Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v14` for objective `v17` and later for objective `v18`. This step ensures the camera is ready.
           
           2.  **Take image of objectives (v14):**
               Use `take_image` to acquire the images of both `v17` and `v18` from `v14`
           
           3.  **Send images of objective (v14):**
               Use `send_image` to relay the images to the lander `v9`.
           
           4.  **Sample rock `v4`:**
               Use `sample_rock` to collect a stone sample.
           
           5.  **Send analysis of `v4`:**
               Use `send_analysis` to transmit the rock's analysis to `v9`.
           
           6.  **Drop the rock (v14):**
               Now use `drop_rock` to release the sample and ensure that the storage is `free` to satisfy the goal.
           
           **Rover v12's Actions:**
           
           7.  **Sample rock `v7`:**
               Use `sample_rock` to collect a soil sample.
           
           8.  **Send analysis of `v7`:**
               Use `send_analysis` to transmit the rock's analysis to `v9`.
           
           9.  **Drop the rock (v12):**
               Use `drop_rock` to release the sample and ensure that the storage is `free` to satisfy the goal.
           
           This sequence meticulously addresses each condition of `new-axiom@0()`, guaranteeing that all predicates are true in the final state.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Goal and Action Space**
           
           Okay, the user flagged my previous attempt, and rightly so. I need to focus *only* on the actions provided, which are a very limited set: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13)) ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15)) ((drop_rock v12 v16)) ((drop_rock v14 v16))`.  Let's break this down meticulously in the context of the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           The expanded goal, as the problem describes, is a conjunction of several atoms.  I've got `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `type(?stone, v2)`, and finally `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and  `type(?soil, v6)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The initial state, however, tells a different story.  I'm starting with `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` already being TRUE.  Critically, `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are FALSE.
           
           Now, let's look at the actions. The `move` actions are basically no-ops, as they just "move" something to the location it already occupies. The `drop_rock` actions have a precondition `full(v12,v16)` and `full(v14,v16)`.  The initial state says `free(v12,v16)` and `free(v14,v16)`.  Therefore, neither drop rock action is initially feasible. The system needs something to be *full* of rocks before it can drop the rocks. So, these actions are only possible if some rocks have been sampled.
           
           Here's the rub: **None** of these actions can achieve the *required* goals. They can't do things like taking images, sending them, analyzing the samples, or anything else to satisfy the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` atoms.  These actions are utterly insufficient to modify the state to make `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` true. The logic is clear: because the actions that could potentially fill the storage don't exist, I can't achieve any image or analysis requests.
           
           Therefore, given *only* these actions, the goal is simply **unreachable**.  I should state this fact, clearly explain the discrepancy between the actions and the goal, and leave it at that. I can't construct a plan because the plan can't exist within the allowed action space.
