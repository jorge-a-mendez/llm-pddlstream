           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My approach to finding 50 stable placements is to systematically vary the object's rotation and position within the surface.**  The surface is a square, and I know the object's dimensions and the stability constraint (AABB containment).  I started by calculating the valid range for the object's center based on its rotated dimensions, considering rotations from 0 to pi/2, and beyond, since the AABB repeats every pi/2.  I then evenly sampled rotations, picking six angles (0, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2*pi/3, 5*pi/6). For each angle, I calculated the valid x and y ranges and generated 9 placements by using the center, corners and midpoints of the valid range. In all, I produced 54 stable placements, and will return the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 4 in the scene, and now I need to figure out where to put Object 5 without them overlapping.  I'm given the dimensions and the surface area, and I need to generate 50 valid placements.
           
           First, I need to calculate the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for Object 4 in its current position to determine the area I need to avoid. I’ve already done that calculation.  Then, I'll figure out the AABB of Object 5 for all rotations.  Since Object 5's dimensions and rotation are known, this step involves calculating the valid ranges where I can place the center of Object 5 on the surface, making sure to consider the object's rotation.
           
           The core of the strategy is this:  I'll test several rotation angles for Object 5, calculate the valid regions on the surface for each rotation, and generate a grid of potential center points within those regions.  For each potential placement, I'll calculate Object 5's AABB and check for a collision with Object 4's AABB.  If there's no collision, I'll keep the placement; otherwise, I'll discard it.
           
           I'm starting with a 5x5 grid for each angle, which should give me plenty of candidate points.  If I don't get 50 valid placements with that, I can try a denser grid or more angles.  The key is to use the AABB collision check; it’s a quick and efficient way to rule out overlapping placements. I have an efficient collision check that I verified with some test points.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0.  The main challenge here is to avoid collisions with the objects I've already placed: objects 4 and 5. I've got the surface boundaries: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Object 6 is essentially a square, roughly 0.073 units on each side.  
           
           My strategy will involve exploring various rotations. I'll pick several angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, and 5pi/6 radians). For each angle, I will determine the effective size and valid center point ranges on the surface. Within these bounds, I'll set up a grid of potential center points for the object.  
           
           The collision checks are critical. For each candidate position, I'll calculate the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of object 6.  Then I'll check if this AABB overlaps with the AABB of object 4 or object 5.  If there's no overlap, meaning the new object does not collide with the previously placed ones, I'll add that position to my list of valid placements. The AABB overlap test is quick and efficient.
           
           I'm making sure to consider the object's dimensions relative to the surface boundaries to calculate the valid placement zones. I'll need to create a collision check function to make things easier, and I'll pre-calculate the AABBs for the fixed objects (4 and 5) for efficiency.
           
           The AABB check is simply: do the intervals overlap on X?  If yes, do the intervals overlap on Y?  If both are true, collision!  I will ensure to find a diverse set of collision free locations using this method. I'll make sure there are enough candidate placements. This method is the best way.
