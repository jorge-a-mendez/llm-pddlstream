(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on surface 0. The object is nearly square, with dimensions approximately 0.07436 x 0.07436. Surface 0 is a square region defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           To ensure stability, the object must be fully contained within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation. Since the object is almost a perfect square, I can use the maximum dimension (0.07436) for AABB calculations. This results in an effective half-width of approximately 0.03718. The valid range for the center of the object (x, y) becomes [-0.09782, 0.09782] in both the x and y directions.
           
           To generate 50 diverse placements, I will create a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates within this valid region, using two different rotation angles: 0 radians and pi/2 radians. This will give me a total of 50 stable placements. I will generate these placements by using the calculated bounds:
           
           x_coords = [-0.097819241788950175, -0.04890962089447509, 0.0, 0.04890962089447509, 0.097819241788950175]

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put this new square object, object 7, on surface 0, without them colliding. I need 50 stable placements. I'm going to leverage my expert knowledge to efficiently calculate this.
           
           First, I analyze object 7.  It's a square with extents of about 0.087. I also know surface 0's dimensions. To ensure stability for *any* rotation, I first calculate the maximum half-dimension of the square, which comes out to be about 0.0437.  This gives me the valid placement range on the surface, ensuring object 7 stays within bounds.
           
           Next, I have to take object 5's placement into account: it's already on the surface. I represent it as an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) using its center and extents, resulting in a region that the new object must avoid.  I then determine the AABB for object 5, which sits in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           Now, considering both the surface bounds and avoiding object 5, I set up a grid for potential placements for object 7. I'll need to check for collisions. I'll use the AABB collision check, meaning I'll need to use the bounds of both objects to determine if the minimum and maximum X/Y coordinates overlap.
           
           For simplicity, I'll first check at two rotation angles: 0 and pi/2. Since object 7 is a square, these two rotations cover most extremes. I define a function to check for collisions between object 7 (AABB) and object 5 (AABB). To create variety, I will add an additional rotation of pi/4 for 8 placements.
           
           I am now going to generate my placements. I'll iterate through this grid, check for collision, and if no collision I'll add them to the list, while adding points and their rotation to maintain variety until I have reached 50, at which point the calculation will be complete.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Plan for ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan I've cooked up to place this almost-square object (ID 4) on surface 0 without any collisions, generating the required 50 stable placements. I'll need to work with the provided coordinates: the surface itself is defined by the range `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and ID 4 has dimensions of `(size_x: 0.07778049403555254, size_y: 0.07778049403555248)`.  I also have to account for obstacles.
           
           First, let's nail down these obstacles. I'm avoiding two already-placed objects: ID 5 (centered at `(-0.0978, -0.0978)` with dimensions `(0.07436, 0.07436)`) and ID 7 (centered at `(-0.0913, 0.0)` with dimensions `(0.08735, 0.08735)`). I've got their bounding boxes and have calculated the min/max extents in both x and y.
           
           To ensure stability, I'll calculate rotations for ID 4 and I've come up with two cases: `theta = 0` (or 90 degrees) which is axis-aligned, and `theta = 45 degrees` using the grid approach for `Cx, Cy` which is diagonal and rotated by 45 degrees. I calculate the min/max valid center of object 4 based on these cases and calculate these ranges in case of object 4. Then, I define a collision check function to check any point `Cx, Cy` of object 4 against the ranges occupied by object 5 and 7.
           
           Now, the collision check function is ready! I'll test all the grid points for collisions against the bounding box of object 5 and 7, and the 50 placements can be safely generated.
           
           In more detail:
           I will iterate through all possible placements with two distinct rotations. These are:
           1. `theta = 0` or 90 degrees.
           2. `theta = 45 degrees`.
           
           For the first case, there are 15 points that can be placed to make 30 possible stable placements. For the second case, I'll test each point to check the safety of making a possible stable placement. Then, I can add `theta = 135` degrees as a check too. Since the collision test function will detect whether or not objects collide, this is not an issue.
           
           I've tested all of these centers and rotations to check for collision with the previous obstacles. All is checked, and all requirements are met!

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new, square-ish object (ID 6) on surface 0, and I need to come up with 50 stable, collision-free placements. The surface is defined by a 0.27-unit square, centered at the origin. I've got to avoid bumping into three existing objects (IDs 5, 7, and 4), each with their own positions, dimensions, and orientations.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Understanding the Constraints:** Object 6 is about 0.08 units on each side. The maximum extent for the rotated object is 0.055.
           
           2.  **Creating a Grid:** I'm going to set up a 5x5 grid of potential center points, covering a 0.16x0.16 square centered at the origin, within the bounds of surface 0, to make sure I consider a good range of options.
           
           3.  **Rotation Strategy:**
               *   I'll start by checking all 25 grid points for `theta = 0`. This will give me a base AABB.
               *   Then, I'll check these same 25 points at `theta = pi/2`. Since this is a square, the AABB will remain the same.
               *   Next, I'll repeat for `theta = pi/4`, which means recalculating the AABB using the diagonal extents.
               *   Then, I'll repeat for `theta = 3*pi/4` because the AABB for these angles is also the same for a square.
               *   To boost diversity, I'll try out some intermediate angles, `theta = pi/8` and `theta = 3*pi/8`.  This has a slightly larger AABB, so I'll need a new collision check.
           4.  **Collision Detection:** I've got to meticulously calculate each object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for each potential placement (center point, and rotation). Then I will test each AABB combination to ensure no collisions. The code will return True (collision detected) or False (no collision)
           5.  **Iteration:**  I'll iterate through all center positions in my grid, and all the orientations for object 6. Then check collisions for `theta = 0, pi/2, pi/4, 3*pi/4, pi/8, 3*pi/8` .
           
           My initial checks, (without the collision check yet) show there are 25 candidate locations, and 4 orientations I'm exploring. After those checks I ended up with a list of 16 valid placements. I am considering these 16 as locations. I know my placement must equal 50, but let's go over how the numbers add up.
           
           I will use 16 placements for `theta = 0`, plus 16 placements for `theta = pi/2`. 4 valid locations will be placed at `theta = pi/4`, and 4 will be placed at `theta = 3*pi/4`. Then I am taking 10 new locations for `theta = pi/8`.
           By doing it this way I have met the required 50 placements.
