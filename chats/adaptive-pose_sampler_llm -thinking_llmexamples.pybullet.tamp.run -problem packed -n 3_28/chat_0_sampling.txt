(Thoughts: **Understanding Object Placement on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5 and dimensions (0.0712 x 0.0712) on surface 0, which is a square region centered at (0, 0) with side length 0.27 (extending from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y). I need to determine the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x and y coordinates for each placement, ensuring the object is fully contained within the surface.
           
           The object is effectively a square. This simplifies the calculations.
           
           Let's denote object half-extents, `hx` and `hy`. When the object is aligned with the world axes (theta = 0), `hx = hy`. I must account for object rotation when determining the placement bounds.
           
           I know that:
           *   The effective size varies depending on the angle (`theta`).
           *   To ensure stability, the effective x and y extents must be within the surface's boundaries after rotating the object.
           *   I will precompute the allowed x and y coordinate range based on theta.
           *   The surface index (`surf_idx`) is always 0.
           
           Since the object is a near-square, I will analyze some key angles: 0, PI/12, PI/6, PI/4, PI/3, 5*PI/12, PI/2, and so on.
           
           I determined the allowed placement range for x and y positions. For each rotation angle, I will use a central point and 4 corner-like placements within the allowed region for diversification.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's the plan for placing Object 4 on Surface 0, avoiding Object 5:**
           
           First, I've got to understand the situation.  Object 5, a square, is already centered on the surface.  Now, I need to place Object 4, which is also a square, without it touching Object 5.  I know the dimensions of both the object and the surface, and I've been told to find *fifty* stable placements for Object 4.
           
           I've got the feedback, Object 5 is at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` which means its centre is at `(0, 0)` and rotation 0. Its dimensions are (0.07122, 0.07122), so Object 5's AABB is  `[-0.03561, 0.03561] x [-0.03561, 0.03561]`.  Object 4 is size `0.08140`. Surface 0's coordinates are `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           The tricky part is that Object 4 can rotate. So, I need to account for its rotation when determining its effective size and how to avoid Object 5.  I'll call the angle of rotation *theta*.  The *effective half-extent* of Object 4, *eff_h4*, will change based on *theta*.  I'll calculate *eff_h4* using the formula `(obj4_s / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           To avoid overlap, the center of Object 4 must stay away from the center of Object 5 by a distance greater than `eff_h4 + obj5_half_s` on either x or y coordinate.
           
           Then I am going to select 10 angles in steps of PI/12 and for each of the 10 angles generate 5 points to have 50.
           
           I need to make sure that for each of these angles I find 5 placements, while checking them against this "forbidden region". Then I will filter the coords, round them, check for duplicates and then select 5.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with the existing objects, IDs 4 and 5.**
           
           First, I need to understand the geometry. Surface 0 is a square, centered at (0,0) with a side length of 0.27. I know object 6 is also essentially a square.
           
           Object 5 is at the center (0,0) and its AABB extents are calculated from its given side length, making it a small square in the center. I calculate the *forbidden region* for placements around object 5, which I must avoid. Object 4 is placed towards the top-right corner of surface 0. Similar to object 5, object 4 is also a square, and I again calculate the forbidden region it occupies, ensuring no overlap.
           
           My primary approach is:
           1.  **Placement Strategy**: Determine the rotation *theta* of ID 6, compute its half extent.
           2.  **Surface Containment**: Compute xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax constraints for the valid region for the center of object 6.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance**: Compute forbidden regions from each object, and check each placement candidate.
           
           I'm calculating `eff_h6` that's the effective half-extent of the rotated square. I plan to use 10 angles in steps of PI/12.
           I calculate the allowed region (valid) *x* and *y* ranges considering its half-extent, which is also an AABB.
           Then, I compute the *forbidden_offset_5* (based on the effective half-extent of 6, and half extent of 5).
           
           Since Object 4 is in the top-right corner of the surface, I need to compute the *forbidden_offset_4*.
           
           I'll iterate and check points, looking for placements that fit within the bounds and avoiding the collision areas of the obstacles (objects 5 and 4).
           I am focusing on corners (BL, TL, BR), and edge points (horizontal and vertical midpoints), and in those regions.
           
           I've crafted an `is_valid_placement()` function to filter coordinates, returning `True` only if an object's center's `(x, y)` location is safe, after a rotation *theta*.
           
           I will iterate with a grid sampling strategy, and prioritize candidate points located near the boundary of forbidden regions
           and within the edges of the surface.  This way I cover the quadrants I outlined, and ensure that I get 5 *distinct* placements per angle.
           
           By choosing these coordinates in a strategic way, I can ensure I get a variety of possible 50 stable placements (10 angles and 5 placements for each angle).
