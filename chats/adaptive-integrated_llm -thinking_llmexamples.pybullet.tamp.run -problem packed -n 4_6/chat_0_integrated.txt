User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.523), (-0.124, -0.429)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.246, -0.007, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.712, 0.702).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.241, 0.184, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.701, 0.713).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.123, 0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.988, 0.157).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.171, -0.476, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.52, 0.854).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.282, -0.043), (-0.211, 0.028)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.277, 0.149), (-0.206, 0.22)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.167, 0.458), (-0.079, 0.546)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The core of this problem is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all "on" `v18`. That means they need to be at a specific pose *and* supported by `v18`. I'm starting by carefully reviewing the initial state: those key objects are currently at different poses, supported by `v11`.  I note that the problem gives me information about grasps, poses, and support, but crucially, I must work with *only* actions provided in the "valid action instances" list.
           
           This is where the problem becomes clear. The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That means I can move the robot's base, but I *cannot* pick up or place any objects.
           
           I then break down the goal using first-order logic. To achieve `on(o, v18)`, I need to satisfy both `supported(o, p, v18)` and `atpose(o, p)` for each object.  I quickly see that in the initial state, each object *could* be supported by `v18` at a certain pose (`#o2`).  However, the initial state *does not* show any of the target objects `atpose(#o2)`.
           
           To fix this, I would need a `place` action.  However, this implies picking something up as well.  The preconditions for a place action are things like `atgrasp` (the robot is holding something) which depends on `pick`, which relies on `atpose` and `handempty`. Since neither `pick` nor `place` is among the *allowed* actions, the goal becomes unreachable. This is due to the constraints of the action instances that were provided to work with.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of only a `move_base` action, it is impossible to manipulate objects. Hence, I'll have to explicitly state that the goal cannot be achieved. I need to explain the reasoning: I can't use `pick` or `place`, I can't move the objects, and thus, I can't place them. It is important to remember the crucial constraint: If an action is not provided, I cannot use it. So, there is no plan.
