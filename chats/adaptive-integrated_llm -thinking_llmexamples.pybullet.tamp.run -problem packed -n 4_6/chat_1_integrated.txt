User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.523), (-0.124, -0.429)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.246, -0.007, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.712, 0.702).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.241, 0.184, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.701, 0.713).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.123, 0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.988, 0.157).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.171, -0.476, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.52, 0.854).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.282, -0.043), (-0.211, 0.028)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.277, 0.149), (-0.206, 0.22)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.167, 0.458), (-0.079, 0.546)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My primary objective is to get these four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, all neatly arranged on surface `v18`. That's the ultimate goal, and I've got a pretty good idea of how to get there.
           
           Currently, these objects are scattered across another surface, `v11`, resting on various other objects. My robot, with its two arms (`v4` and `v6`), is ready to do the heavy lifting. The only base movement is self-loop. Therefore, the base will stay put. The available `move_base` operation is effectively a no-op, which streamlines things considerably.
           
           A critical aspect of this problem is the use of the placeholder pose `#o2`. This represents a collision-free and stable placement on `v18`. Here's the catch: I need to assign distinct spatial coordinates for each object's placement within the bounds of `v18`. I need to ensure they are collision free. I will leverage the known geometry to achieve this.
           
           The robot's arm, specifically `v4`, can handle the pick-and-place maneuvers, and I will employ that arm. The necessary `kin` facts specify the correct arm, grasp, base config. From the initial state, the robot base is at `v3`, which will remain fixed at `v3` for all operations.
           
           I'll be using `v4` to perform a sequential pick-and-place strategy for `v14`, `v12`, `v8`, and then `v16`. Given the geometry, I've defined specific placement coordinates. For example, `v12` is to be placed at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0), and so on. The z-coordinate is the surface height. The x, y coordinates must fit within `v18`'s bounds.
           
           Finally, while the TAMP system will determine the trajectory. Since base does not move, any base motion action will result in self loop for base location and hence will have no cost.
           In terms of constraints, I need to ensure that the approach, trajectory, and placement are collision-free. I will then ensure the pick and place operations can be executed with that pose.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Infeasibility**
           
           Okay, I see the issue. My initial plan was fundamentally flawed. I completely missed the crucial detail in the problem statement that *explicitly* restricts me to only use actions from a *specific* list of action instances. I, a seasoned expert, made the rookie mistake of assuming a broader action space than was permitted.
           
           The user rightly pointed out that my previous plan included actions like "pick" and "place," which are, in fact, **not** in the permitted list.  The *only* allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This, of course, is a no-op; the base is moving from its current position `v3` to the *same* position `v3`. It doesn't actually change anything about the `atbconf`.
           
           The ultimate goal, I now realize, is utterly unattainable with the constraints I've been given. The objective is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.  This clearly requires *manipulating* those objects, which necessitates "pick" and "place" actions.  But since those actions are *forbidden*... the goal is impossible.  There's no way to move those objects with a move-base no-op. The plan is demonstrably infeasible.
