           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.655, 0.428), (-4.559, 0.524)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, 0.476, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.963, 0.27).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal and Initial Analysis**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`. I've looked at the initial state and see that there are two objects of type `v17`: `v8` and `v12`. Both are supported by `v18`. Initially, `v8` is at pose `v9` and `v12` is at pose `v13`.  The robot arm `v4` and base `v3` are also at their respective configurations.  I need to figure out how to get either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           **Action Selection and Preconditions**
           
           I've examined the available actions (pick and place).  To place `v8` on `v18`, it looks like the plan involves picking `v8` from `v9` and then placing it at a new pose, which I'll call `#o2`, on `v18`.  A key detail is that `v4` needs to be in a position where it can work with `v8` and also on the surface `v18`. I've checked the preconditions for the picking action, and it looks like I need to make sure the robot base is moved. Before picking up `v8`, I need to move the robot base from its initial position (`v3`) to a new configuration (`#o3`).  The provided `kin` facts suggest that `#o3` is required for the arm to be able to manipulate `v8`.
           
           **Detailed Plan and Continuous Parameter**
           
           My current plan, then, is as follows:
           
           1.  **(Move Base)**  `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`:  The base must move from its initial configuration (`v3`) to a suitable new base configuration (`#o3`).
           2.  **(Pick)** `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: The arm picks `v8` from its initial pose `v9`.
           3.  **(Place)** `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: The arm places `v8` at the designated pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           Now, the tricky part is `#o2`. The problem asks me to provide a continuous value for `#o2` because `pose(v8, #o2)` is in the initial state and is used in the plan. I need to make sure this pose is stable and collision-free. I've analyzed the AABBs of `v8` and `v18`. Since `v8` must be placed on `v18`, I need to find a placement within `v18`'s bounds that is collision-free.  I calculated that a placement at (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) should work. Given the geometry, a z of 0.8 also fits. Based on the problem's criteria, the specific coordinates are needed. I am assuming a standard world coordinate system and that the AABB values in the initial state are for the object's center coordinates and not the AABB extents.
           
           **Collision Check**
           
           I have considered the collision-free requirement.  In this specific problem, I see that I have `atpose` facts for `v12` and `v15` for the poses `v13` and `v16` respectively. Based on the position of those two objects, my proposed pose `#o2` for `v8` seems to be valid. The AABBs of these objects do not overlap. The `kin` values provide support for approach/trajectories/placement stability.
           
           **Final Plan and Pose Value**
           
           The final plan is as described above, with `#o2` given a value.
           
           *   `#o2` (for `v8` on `v18`): (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)
           
           With this pose, I believe I can achieve the goal, satisfying the initial axiom.
