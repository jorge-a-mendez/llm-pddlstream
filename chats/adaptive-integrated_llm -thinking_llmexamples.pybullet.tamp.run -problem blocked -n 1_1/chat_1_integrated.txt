User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.655, 0.428), (-4.559, 0.524)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.607, 0.476, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.963, 0.27).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. First, I need to understand what this axiom means. Expanding it reveals that I need to place an object of type `v17` on `v18`. From the initial state, I see that both `v8` and `v12` are objects of this type. So, the goal boils down to placing either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.
           
           Let's break down the action of being "on" an object.  "On" means the object is both supported and in a specific pose. Looking at the initial state, I can see that `v8` is currently supported on `v11`, and `v12` on `v14`. I need to figure out how to get them supported on `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state further, it looks like placing either `v8` or `v12` on a pose `#o2` supported by `v18` would achieve the goal. I'll focus on getting `v8` to that pose for this plan. Currently, `v8` is at `v9`. I need to move it to `#o2` on `v18`. The robot has two arms available (`v4` and `v6`), and both are currently empty.
           
           To do this, I'll need a pick-and-place action. Arm `v4` looks like a good candidate based on the available `kin` facts. I can use the `pick` action to grasp `v8` from pose `v9`, and then the `place` action to put `v8` at the new pose `#o2` on `v18`. I know `v18` is a surface.
           
           To check for collisions, I need to define a collision-free placement for `#o2`. Using the bounding box information for `v8` (which is small), and knowing the dimensions and position of surface `v18`, I determined that a good location for `#o2` is at position `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)` with a zero quaternion rotation. I need to make sure this pose will not collide with the neighboring objects, `v12` at `v13` and `v15` at `v16`, which are not close to `v18`. By examining their bounding boxes, I've confirmed that these objects won't collide.
           
           The `kin` action also has `#o3`, and `move_base` action suggests `v3` for `bconf` which aligns with all the `kin` actions using `v3`.
           
           The plan I need is the following sequence of actions, with the following continuous parameters for those actions:
           1. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`: `atpose(v8, v9)` -> `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` and `canmove()`.
           2. `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` -> `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `handempty(v4)`.
           
           The final pose of `v8` is `#o2` `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`.
           
           My pose value for the problem definition is `#o2 : (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`.

           2. `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` -> `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `handempty(v4)`.
           
           The final pose of `v8` is `#o2` `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`.
           
           My pose value for the problem definition is `#o2 : (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`.
           

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so here's the situation: the user has pointed out a critical flaw in the previously suggested plan. The *only* action the robot is capable of is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which is essentially a no-op; it just keeps the robot in place. It can't pick, it can't place, it can't manipulate objects in any meaningful way. This severely restricts what the robot can do.
           
           The ultimate goal, `Atom new-axiom@0()`, is defined as `on(?green, v18) AND type(?green, v17)`.  I can see that we have two objects that satisfy the `type` predicate: `v8` and `v12`.  So, the task boils down to making either `v8` or `v12` be "on" surface `v18`.
           
           Let's break it down: "on" requires both `atpose(?, p)` and `supported(?, p, v18)`. In the initial state,  neither `v8` nor `v12` are on `v18`.  `v8` is on `v11`, and `v12` is on `v14`. There are `supported` relationships between each of these and `v18` but the `atpose` isn't there for `v18`.
           
           Here's the problem: The `move_base` action doesn't let me change anything about the objects' `atpose` or their `supported` relationships. The robot cannot move the objects!  The only way to achieve the goal would be if the initial state already satisfied it or if `move_base` had some hidden side effect that altered the object's position, but neither of those things are true. Since the action set is limited, I'm certain this goal cannot be achieved. I need to make sure the user understands this is the most critical point.
           
           To make things absolutely clear to myself (and, hopefully, to the user), I went through the goal possibilities using both objects.
           - If `?green` is `v8`, the goal is `on(v8, v18) AND type(v8, v17)`. The `type` is true, but `on(v8, v18)` requires that `v8` is both at pose and supported by `v18`, neither of which is the case.
           - If `?green` is `v12`, the goal is `on(v12, v18) AND type(v12, v17)`. The `type` is true, but `on(v12, v18)` still fails for the same reasons as above.
           
           Since there is no way to achieve the goal with the limited actions provided, it's impossible to generate a plan.
