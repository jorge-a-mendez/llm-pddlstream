(Thoughts: **Understanding Stable Placements for a Rotated Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for an object with ID 5 and dimensions (0.07, 0.07) on a given surface. The surface is defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  "Stable" here means the object must be fully contained within the surface boundaries. A critical aspect of this problem is interpreting "axis-aligned bounding box" (AABB) in the context of rotation. I'm assuming that the dimensions (0.07, 0.07) describe the object's *local* AABB, meaning when it's rotated by an angle *theta*, its world-aligned bounding box dimensions will change accordingly. For a square object (w = h = 0.07), its world-aligned bounding box will have a side length of 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))). This side length ranges from 0.07 (at multiples of pi/2) to approximately 0.099 (at odd multiples of pi/4).  I will then generate a list of 50 placements with surf_idx = 0. The first 25 will have theta = 0, and I will vary x and y across the bounding box. The subsequent 25 will have theta = pi/4, again varying x and y to achieve good coverage.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis for ID 10**
           
           My task is to place object ID 10, a square-like object with dimensions of approximately 0.098968 x 0.098968, onto surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0). I also need to account for previously placed objects, specifically object ID 5, which are fixed squares of side 0.07.
           
           First, I determine the object's half-extents for calculations: `object_half_x = object_half_y = 0.049484`. I also consider that the rotation will change this extents using formula based on `cos(theta)` and `sin(theta)`, but I will leave that for now.
           
           Considering Surface 0, my initial placement boundaries, without considering any collisions, are:
           `x_min = 4.249484`
           `x_max = 4.750516`
           `y_min = -0.550516`
           `y_max = -0.049484`.
           
           Next, I review the fixed object placements (ID 5) which have an AABB that spans from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.27, 0.0), and from (4.3325, -0.6) to (4.4025, 0.0).
           
           With this in mind, the usable x-range for placing object ID 10 at theta = 0, is limited from  4.451984 to 4.750516. The y-range is unaffected.
           
           I will generate 50 unique placements within the usable x and y ranges. I plan to space them in a grid fashion with 5 columns and 10 rows. This will result in object placement in this form: [x,y]:

           My task is to place object ID 10, a square-like object with dimensions of approximately 0.098968 x 0.098968, onto surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).

           `y_max = -0.049484`.
           
           Next, I review the fixed object placements (ID 5) which have an AABB that spans from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.27, 0.0), and from (4.3325, -0.6) to (4.4025, 0.0).
