           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Analysis and Plan Synthesis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()` within the `rovers` domain. The initial examination reveals this goal to be a conjunction of several conditions, with the key challenge centering around achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           The initial state provides a wealth of information, defining the rovers' starting configurations, the types of rocks present, and the existing visibility and communication ranges. I observed that the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, possess cameras and are capable of imaging the objectives; these facts are critical for tackling the `receivedimage` goals.
           
           My initial approach focuses on breaking down the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The `receivedimage` components seem readily achievable since the rovers already *can* see the objectives. My plan involves directing rover `v12` to calibrate, take, and send images of the objectives. To do this, I will use: `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`.
           
           However, the `receivedanalysis` components present a critical obstacle. To fulfill these, I must use `sample_rock` and then use `send_analysis`. Examining the preconditions of the `sample_rock` action is where things get tricky. It necessitates that the rover *currently* be at a configuration where it is "above" a rock (`atconf(V, Q)` and `above(V, Q, R)`). The initial state indicates the rovers are "above" the rock but not *at* the correct configuration.
           
           Here's the problem: *there are no movement actions available that allow changing the current configurations of the rovers to the necessary `#o5` configuration* required by `sample_rock`. The given `move` actions simply reposition the rover within the same configuration. This makes it impossible to satisfy the preconditions of `sample_rock` and consequently, it makes it impossible to meet the `receivedanalysis` goals. No matter how I try to arrange the actions, the `receivedanalysis` components are unreachable, rendering the entire goal `new-axiom@0()` unachievable.
