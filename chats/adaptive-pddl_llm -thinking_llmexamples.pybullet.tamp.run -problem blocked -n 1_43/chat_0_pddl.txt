User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           #o1: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v15)

           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)

           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis: Goal Unachievable Due to Action Instance Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so the task is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be "on" the surface `v18`. Looking at the initial state, the objects meeting the type requirement are `v12` and `v8`. The ideal would be to get either `v12` or `v8` onto `v18`.
           
           My initial intuition says this will involve moving an object, thus involving *pick* and *place* actions. I confirm this by reviewing the `place` and `pick` action preconditions and effects. To achieve this I need a plan with `pick` and `place` steps.
           
           Then I checked the available action instances. Crucially, the *only* available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which simply moves the robot's base to the same location! This means no actual object manipulation is possible.
           
           Since `on` isn't initially true for `v8` or `v12` being on `v18`, and since I am limited to *move_base* action, I can't move these objects as desired, thus, the goal is unachievable given the available action instances.
           
           Let me double check the axioms for `on`: `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose`, but these predicates can only be changed with `pick` and `place`, which are not available.
           
           Therefore, no matter how I look at it, this goal is beyond my capabilities with the actions at my disposal. It's a closed case.
