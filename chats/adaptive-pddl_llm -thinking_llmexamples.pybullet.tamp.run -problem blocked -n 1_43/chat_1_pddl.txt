           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Reachability of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `new-axiom@0()`.  This boils down to getting an object of type `v17` *on* object `v18`.  Immediately, I know I need to identify which objects *are* of type `v17`.  The initial state tells me that `v12` and `v8` fit the bill.
           
           Now, I need to understand what "on" really means in this context.  I quickly recall the definition: an object is "on" another if it's both *supported* by it and at the correct *pose*.
           
           Let's examine the initial state.  `v8` is currently supported by `v11` and has a specific pose, meaning it's "on" `v11`. Similarly,  `v12` is supported by `v14`, and thus "on" `v14`.  Neither is currently on `v18`.
           
           My next thought is to identify which actions I can use to achieve my goal. The system only provides the `move_base` action. But wait, that action *only* changes the robot's base configuration. It doesn't affect object poses or support relations! That's a problem.
           
           To change which object is "on" another, I'd need actions like `pick` and `place`. But those aren't available!  This is a significant roadblock.  If I can't modify `atpose` and `supported` predicates, then I can't change any "on" relationships.
           
           So, I re-evaluate the initial state, just to be absolutely sure. I check if `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` is already true.  Unfortunately, it's not. I look deeper and recognize that while there are other *supported* relations available in the initial state, their associated `atpose` facts are not present.
           
           Since my only available action cannot change the key elements of an `on` relationship, and the target state isn't true, I can definitively conclude: **The goal is unreachable with the given actions and initial state.** There's no possible plan I can formulate here.
