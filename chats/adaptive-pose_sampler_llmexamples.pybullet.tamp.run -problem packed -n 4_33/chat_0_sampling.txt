           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0948x0.0948. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible placements.
           
           Given the symmetry of both the surface and the object (when considering rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2), placing the object in the center of the surface at an angle of 0 will be a stable placement. I can also try various other positions and rotations within the surface bounds. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a size of approximately 0.095. For an unrotated object, the center (x,y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.095/2 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.095/2
           -0.0875 <= x <= 0.0875
           The same applies to y.
           
           For a rotated object, the effective bounding box will still be contained within the original bounding box if the object is square. So, the same range for x and y applies regardless of rotation.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has the same single square surface. I successfully placed object 4 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 4 occupies the space from approximately -0.0474 to 0.0474 in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID: 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0957x0.0957, which is very similar in size to object 4. I need to place object 7 on the surface without colliding with object 4, which is at the center.
           
           Therefore, I need to place object 7 away from the center of the surface. The surface is 0.27x0.27. Object 4 occupies the central 0.0948x0.0948 area.
           The available space for object 7's center (for an unrotated object) would be:
           -0.135 + 0.0957/2 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0957/2 => -0.08715 <= x <= 0.08715
           -0.135 + 0.0957/2 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0957/2 => -0.08715 <= y <= 0.08715
           
           Since object 4 is centered at (0,0), its extent is roughly from -0.0474 to 0.0474.
           So for object 7, its x and y coordinates of its center should be such that:
           abs(x_7) > (0.0948/2 + 0.0957/2) = 0.0474 + 0.04785 = 0.09525 if I want to place it completely outside the bounding box of object 4 without overlap.
           
           However, since the objects are squares and I'm placing them on a larger square, it's possible to place them side by side if their effective "radius" for collision is considered. A simpler approach is to ensure the bounding boxes of the two objects don't overlap. Since object 4 is at (0,0), its AABB is approximately [-0.0474, 0.0474] in x and y.
           
           Object 7 has a size of 0.0957. If placed at (x,y), its AABB will be [x-0.04785, x+0.04785] and [y-0.04785, y+0.04785].
           To avoid collision with object 4, either:
           x-0.04785 > 0.0474  => x > 0.09525
           x+0.04785 < -0.0474 => x < -0.09525
           or
           y-0.04785 > 0.0474  => y > 0.09525
           y+0.04785 < -0.0474 => y < -0.09525
           
           Given the surface limits are [-0.135, 0.135], placing object 7 at x=0.09525 or x=-0.09525 would place it very close to the edge of the surface (0.09525 + 0.04785 = 0.1431, which is outside 0.135). So, this exact separation won't work perfectly if I strictly avoid any overlap.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the maximum placement. The object's half-size is 0.0957/2 = 0.04785.
           The maximum x or y coordinate for the center is 0.135 - 0.04785 = 0.08715.
           The minimum x or y coordinate for the center is -0.135 + 0.04785 = -0.08715.
           
           This means I cannot place the object such that its center is at abs(x) > 0.08715.
           So, the previous calculation of x > 0.09525 or x < -0.09525 means that it's impossible to place object 7 outside the X or Y bounds of object 4 *and* within the surface bounds if their AABBs are to be non-overlapping. This implies that they will *have* to overlap, or the placement must be rejected. However, the problem statement says "if you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle". The feedback was about object 4's placement as a success, not a collision.
           
           My initial reasoning about collision for ID: 4 assumed it's a fixed obstacle. The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". The problem is also about *finding a stable placement for the object*, not a stable *arrangement* of objects. Unless specified, I should assume only the *current* object being placed needs to not collide with *fixed obstacles*. The previous object (ID: 4) is now part of the scene, and I need to avoid it.
           
           The success feedback for object 4 means that object 4 *is* a fixed obstacle that I now know about. So, I *must* avoid collision with object 4. My calculations for avoiding collision are correct. If it's impossible to place object 7 without colliding with object 4, then I need to reconsider the task or the interpretation of "collision".
           
           Given that the object ID 4 is *already placed* and it *succeeded*, it acts as a fixed obstacle. Therefore, I need to place object 7 without colliding with object 4. The available surface area is limited.
           
           The object 4 (ID 4) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), its size is 0.0948.
           Its bounding box is approximately `(-0.0474, -0.0474), (0.0474, 0.0474)`.
           The new object (ID 7) has a size of 0.095679632614711. Its half-size is 0.0478398.
           To place object 7 without colliding with object 4, the minimum distance between their centers must be greater than half the sum of their sizes if they are placed along an axis and aligned (0.0474 + 0.0478398 = 0.0952398).
           The maximum center coordinate for object 7 on the surface is 0.135 - 0.0478398 = 0.0871602.
           The minimum center coordinate for object 7 on the surface is -0.135 + 0.0478398 = -0.0871602.
           
           Since 0.0952398 > 0.0871602, it means that I cannot place object 7 entirely outside of object 4's bounding box and still be within the surface. This is a crucial point.
           
           However, the problem statement says "you must avoid collision between objects i and j." It does not say "avoid bounding box overlap." It's possible that a slight overlap of bounding boxes is allowed if the actual object geometries (which I don't have) don't collide. But with square objects, AABB collision is generally a good proxy.
           
           If I cannot place the object such that its AABB does not overlap with object 4's AABB, then I should try to place it as far as possible from the center. I should also consider that rotations might change the effective AABB (for a square, it just expands to the diagonal for a 45-degree rotation, which is not helpful here). For a square object, the smallest AABB is when it's aligned with the axes (theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2).
           
           Let's re-evaluate:
           Surface: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           Object 4: (0.0948, 0.0948) at (0,0) -> AABB approx. ((-0.0474, -0.0474), (0.0474, 0.0474))
           Object 7: (0.09568, 0.09568) -> half_size = 0.04784
           
           If I place object 7 with its center at (x, y), its AABB is ((x-0.04784, y-0.04784), (x+0.04784, y+0.04784)).
           To avoid collision with object 4, I need:
           (x+0.04784 < -0.0474) OR (x-0.04784 > 0.0474) OR
           (y+0.04784 < -0.0474) OR (y-0.04784 > 0.0474)
           
           This implies:
           x < -0.09524 OR x > 0.09524 OR
           y < -0.09524 OR y > 0.09524
           
           However, the allowed range for x and y of object 7's center on the surface is [-0.08716, 0.08716].
           Since 0.09524 > 0.08716, it is impossible to place object 7 such that its AABB does not overlap with object 4's AABB. This means *any* placement of object 7 will result in an AABB collision with object 4.
           
           This is a critical situation. Either:
           1. My interpretation of "avoid collision between objects i and j" as "avoid AABB overlap" is too strict.
           2. The objects are allowed to slightly overlap in their bounding boxes, but not in their actual (unspecified) geometry, which would be true for more complex shapes but less so for squares.
           3. The problem implies that placing this object might be impossible on this surface given object 4's presence, and I should try to find the "least colliding" or "most stable if collision checks were less strict" placements.
           4. I am supposed to find a placement that *would* be stable if object 4 wasn't there, and if it *does* collide, I'll be informed.
           
           Given the wording "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", and the fact that I don't have the full geometry, I will assume a standard AABB collision check. If it's impossible to avoid AABB collision, I should generate placements that are as far as possible from the already placed object 4, within the surface bounds. If these placements still fail, it confirms my suspicion about impossible placement due to collision.
           
           I will propose placements that are as close to the corners as possible, which maximizes the distance from the center.
           The maximum allowed center coordinate is 0.087. I'll use 0.085 to leave a tiny bit of buffer.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has the same single square surface.
           I now have two fixed obstacles:
           Object 4 (ID: 4): size 0.0948, placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its AABB is approximately `((-0.0474, -0.0474), (0.0474, 0.0474))`.
           Object 7 (ID: 7): size 0.09568, placed at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085). Its AABB is approximately `((0.085-0.04784, 0.085-0.04784), (0.085+0.04784, 0.085+0.04784)) = ((0.03716, 0.03716), (0.13284, 0.13284))`.
           
           The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.09896x0.09896. Its half-size is 0.04948.
           The surface bounds are `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           For object 5, its center (x,y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.04948 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04948
           -0.08552 <= x <= 0.08552
           And similarly for y.
           
           Let's check for AABB collisions with the existing objects:
           Object 4 AABB: `((-0.0474, -0.0474), (0.0474, 0.0474))`
           Object 7 AABB: `((0.03716, 0.03716), (0.13284, 0.13284))`
           
           Notice that object 7's AABB extends from 0.03716 to 0.13284 in both x and y.
           Object 4's AABB extends from -0.0474 to 0.0474 in both x and y.
           These two bounding boxes are overlapping:
           For x: object 4 ends at 0.0474, object 7 starts at 0.03716. So there's an overlap from 0.03716 to 0.0474.
           This means that my previous AABB collision avoidance logic was likely too strict or incomplete, or the actual geometry allows for some overlap of AABBs.
           The fact that `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)` for object 7 *succeeded* implies that placing objects whose AABBs slightly overlap is considered non-colliding for the actual (unseen) geometry. This is critical new information.
           
           Given this, I should aim to place object 5 in the remaining space.
           Let's try placing object 5 in the opposite corner from object 7, and at the other two corners as well.
           The maximum valid center coordinate is 0.08552. I'll use 0.085 for symmetry and to be consistent.
           
           Possible positions for object 5, avoiding the already occupied areas as much as possible:
           1. Corner opposite to object 7: `(-0.085, -0.085)`
           2. Other two corners: `(0.085, -0.085)` and `(-0.085, 0.085)`
           
           Let's check AABB for `(-0.085, -0.085)` for object 5:
           AABB for object 5: `((-0.085-0.04948, -0.085-0.04948), (-0.085+0.04948, -0.085+0.04948))`
           `((-0.13448, -0.13448), (-0.03552, -0.03552))`
           
           Collision check with object 4:
           Object 4 X: `(-0.0474, 0.0474)`
           Object 5 X: `(-0.13448, -0.03552)`
           No X overlap.
           No Y overlap.
           So, `(-0.085, -0.085)` should not collide with object 4.
           
           Collision check with object 7:
           Object 7 X: `(0.03716, 0.13284)`
           Object 5 X: `(-0.13448, -0.03552)`
           No X overlap.
           No Y overlap.
           So, `(-0.085, -0.085)` should not collide with object 7.
           
           This placement appears safe. I will generate several placements in the available corners and along the edges, avoiding the central region and the upper-right corner.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has the same single square surface.
           I now have three fixed obstacles:
           Object 4 (ID: 4): size 0.0948, placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). AABB: `((-0.0474, -0.0474), (0.0474, 0.0474))`.
           Object 7 (ID: 7): size 0.09568, placed at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085). AABB: `((0.03716, 0.03716), (0.13284, 0.13284))`.
           Object 5 (ID: 5): size 0.09896, placed at (0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085). AABB: `((-0.13448, -0.13448), (-0.03552, -0.03552))`.
           
           The new object (ID: 6) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.09105x0.09105. Its half-size is 0.045525.
           The surface bounds are `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           For object 6, its center (x,y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.045525 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.045525
           -0.089475 <= x <= 0.089475
           And similarly for y.
           
           Based on the successful placements of objects 4, 5, and 7, it's clear that their AABBs can overlap slightly, or the collision detection is more nuanced than a simple AABB overlap.
           I need to place object 6 such that it avoids collision with 4, 5, and 7. The remaining "corners" would be `(0.085, -0.085)` and `(-0.085, 0.085)`. Let's try `(0.085, -0.085)`.
           
           Placement target: `(0.085, -0.085)` for object 6.
           Object 6 AABB (centered at 0.085, -0.085):
           X: `(0.085 - 0.045525, 0.085 + 0.045525)` = `(0.039475, 0.130525)`
           Y: `(-0.085 - 0.045525, -0.085 + 0.045525)` = `(-0.130525, -0.039475)`
           
           Collision check with object 4 AABB: `((-0.0474, -0.0474), (0.0474, 0.0474))`
           Object 6 X-range `(0.039475, 0.130525)` overlaps with object 4 X-range `(-0.0474, 0.0474)` from 0.039475 to 0.0474.
           Object 6 Y-range `(-0.130525, -0.039475)` overlaps with object 4 Y-range `(-0.0474, 0.0474)` from -0.0474 to -0.039475.
           Since both X and Y ranges overlap, this would be an AABB collision. However, given previous successes (object 4 and 7), this overlap is likely tolerated.
           
           Collision check with object 7 AABB: `((0.03716, 0.03716), (0.13284, 0.13284))`
           Object 6 X-range `(0.039475, 0.130525)` overlaps with object 7 X-range `(0.03716, 0.13284)`.
           Object 6 Y-range `(-0.130525, -0.039475)` does NOT overlap with object 7 Y-range `(0.03716, 0.13284)`.
           Since only X overlaps, but Y does not, this should not be a collision.
           
           Collision check with object 5 AABB: `((-0.13448, -0.13448), (-0.03552, -0.03552))`
           Object 6 X-range `(0.039475, 0.130525)` does NOT overlap with object 5 X-range `(-0.13448, -0.03552)`.
           No overlap, so no collision.
           
           So placing object 6 at `(0.085, -0.085)` seems like a promising candidate based on the "relaxed" collision model I've inferred from previous successes. I will try this and other similar locations. I should try to place the object in the remaining "empty" corners first.
           
           The four corners of the available space (considering the current grid of objects) are approximately:
           1. `(0.085, 0.085)` - occupied by ID 7
           2. `(-0.085, -0.085)` - occupied by ID 5
           3. `(0.085, -0.085)` - available (target for current object)
           4. `(-0.085, 0.085)` - available
           
           I will prioritize placing object 6 in `(0.085, -0.085)` and `(-0.085, 0.085)`. I'll also try points along the edges and some slightly inward positions.
