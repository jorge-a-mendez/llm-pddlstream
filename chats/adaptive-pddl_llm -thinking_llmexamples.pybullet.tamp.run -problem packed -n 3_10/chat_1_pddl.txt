           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and it's pretty straightforward, unfortunately, in a negative sense. My goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all onto `v16`.  They're currently sitting on `v11`. Classic stacking problem, right? Easy peasy...except for the action instances.
           
           I have a very restricted action space here. The only thing I can *do* is this `move_base` action, which essentially does *nothing*. It moves the base from `v3` to `v3`. It doesn't allow any manipulation of the objects themselves. I've re-checked, and there are *no* `pick` or `place` actions available. None. Zilch. Nada.
           
           My understanding is, from the problem statement, I *can only* use actions in the provided list. That means I can't even *think* about picking anything up or placing it anywhere. These are the *only* actions allowed to build a plan.
           
           Given that restriction, I'm stuck. Absolutely stuck. I cannot change the `on` relationships. I'm *incapable* of moving objects from `v11` to `v16`. Since I can't pick up and place, I can't modify the current world state. My current state, along with the very limited action set, implies that the goal is simply *unreachable*. This is a classical problem, and the solution is to reject the initial plan due to the conflict between action availability and the goal. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable with the provided tools.
