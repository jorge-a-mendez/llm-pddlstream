           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  Easy enough, in theory.  I know that 'on' is defined by being 'supported' at a certain 'atpose'.  So, I need to place these three objects on `v16` using the existing pose `#o2`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently `on(v11)`.  They are at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, supported by `v11`. To achieve the goal, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions, moving them to `#o2`.
           
           However, here's the rub.  The *only* allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  No `pick` or `place` instances are available, even though they are *the only means* of modifying the `on` state.  This `move_base` action simply moves the base from one state to the same state. While the initial state says I can move the base, the `move_base` action removes this ability. The precondition `canmove()` must be true. However, `move_base` *also* makes `canmove()` false, and all other actions (including `pick` and `place`) require `canmove()`. That means I can only move the base one time, so, *regardless* of the other constraints, I cannot move any object.
           
           Therefore, because I can't *pick* or *place* anything with the restricted action set, the goal of getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16` is simply *unachievable* given the constraints.
