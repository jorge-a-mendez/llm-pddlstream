           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.345, 0.33), (-4.27, 0.405)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.307, 0.368, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.037, 0.999).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan that fulfills the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified that `?green` corresponds to `v12` due to the presence of `type(v12, v17)` in the initial state. Consequently, I aim to achieve `on(v12, v18)`. This expands to the need to ensure `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. Fortunately, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` already exists in the initial state. Therefore, my primary focus shifts to achieving `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is situated at `atpose(v12, v13)`.  To move it to `#o2`, I plan to employ a standard pick-and-place strategy.  The available actions involving `v12` are `pick` and `place`.
           
           **Plan Outline:**
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Place `v12` at the target pose `#o2`.
           
           **Detailed Action Analysis:**
           I've carefully examined the preconditions for both `pick` and `place`, ensuring they are all met based on the initial state and the expected effects of the `pick` action.  No negative preconditions like `unsafeapproach` or `unsafeatraj` were present to worry about.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Assignment:**
           The only continuous parameter I must address is `#o2`, representing the pose of `v12`. I need to choose a location for it on surface `v18`. From the scene's geometry, I can derive a reasonable location. The AABB of `v18` defines the bounds. Assuming `v12` is a small object that fits within the surface dimensions, and considering the height, I have chosen `#o2` as a pose within the bounds and at an appropriate height.
           
           **Final Check:**
           After executing the plan, the condition `atpose(v12, #o2)` is guaranteed.  Since `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` already exists, `on(v12, v18)` holds true. Combined with the initial state fact of `type(v12, v17)`, the goal condition `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied. The pick and place actions, and the pose value for #o2, are valid instances for this problem. The cost is 2, minimal for this plan.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan's Failure: The Critical `atbconf` Predicate**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan fell apart because `atbconf(#o3)` wasn't satisfied. Time to dissect this thoroughly, focusing on the initial state and available actions related to this crucial predicate.
           
           Initially, we know `bconf(#o3)`, indicating `#o3` is a base configuration, but crucially, *not* that the robot *is currently* at that configuration.  The initial state *lacks* the `atbconf(#o3)` fact.
           
           Analyzing the actions: We have `move_base(#o3, #o3, #o0)`. This seems like a no-op, moving from `#o3` to `#o3`. It's likely intended for resolving other predicates, perhaps `canmove()`. However, the precondition is `atbconf(#o3)`. Since we *don't* have it initially, this action is unusable.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions – all flavors of them – all require `atbconf(#o3)`. We're at a standstill, as the bot can't pick or place anything without being at base config `#o3`.
           
           Let's double-check the initial state: We have `canmove()`, arm and aconf information, but *no* `atbconf(?q)` predicate for any base configuration, most critically, `#o3`.  According to the problem's rule, absent facts are *false*. Thus, the bot is not at *any* base configuration at the start, and it's certainly not at `#o3`.
           
           This spells trouble. The actions that *move* objects (`pick` and `place`) can't be executed, making any plan involving those objects impossible. The only action related to the base, `move_base`, needs `atbconf(#o3)` which also means it cannot be used initially.
           
           The problem is fundamentally unachievable. There's no way to establish the necessary `atbconf(#o3)` precondition, and without it, the robot cannot interact with the world and manipulate the objects.
           
           The lack of `atbconf` predicates in the initial state seals the plan's fate. My conclusion? The goal is unreachable.
