           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.345, 0.33), (-4.27, 0.405)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.307, 0.368, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.037, 0.999).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan to Achieve the Goal new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get something of `type v17` onto `v18`.  Simplifying that further, it boils down to: "Get an object of type `v17` on `v18`". Looking at what we've got, both `v8` and `v12` fit the bill – they're both type `v17`. My initial thought is to grab `v8` because it looks closer to `v18`. Why? Because moving my base to handle v8 looks easier than handling v12 because v12 is very far away.
           
           Now, to get `v8` on `v18`, I need to expand what it means to be "on". It requires a `supported` and `atpose` condition. So, I need to find a way to make sure `v8` is `supported` on `v18` and figure out its `atpose`.
           
           Let's look at the known states. I've got `v8` at pose `v9`. I've got a grasp `#o1` available for `v8`. The problem presents a relationship of `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. Bingo! This means I need to make `v8`'s pose `#o2`. I need to move from the current `atpose(v8, v9)` to an `#o2`.
           
           So, the plan: First, I need to get the robot's base into a position that makes this all possible. Then `pick` v8 by grasping and move it, and finally `place`.
           
           Here's the detailed breakdown:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  My base is at `v3`. I need to get it to `#o3`, because to complete the action with `pick` and `place`, I need `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick:** Get `v4` to pick `v8` from `v9` using grasp `#o1`.
           3.  **Place:** Use `v4` to put `v8` down at the right pose, `#o2`, on top of `v18` with the same grasp `#o1`.
           
           Now, the continuous variables need defining:
           
           *   For `#o2`: For `#o2`, I need to calculate a valid `(x, y, z, theta)` because `pose(v8, #o2)` is needed in the initial state. Considering that I want to put the center of `v8` on the center of `v18`, and that `v8` has a size of 0.07. Then I choose `4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0` as the placement for `#o2`, because `4.5` is the x center of `v18` and `0.8` is the z placement above the tabletop. The `y = -0.3` puts v8 where I want it. The y range of v18 is between -0.6 and 0.0, and the AABB of v8 is `4.465, 0.265, 4.535, 0.335`, which fits the x bounds.
           
           I should also note that to prevent `place` and `pick` actions from running into collisions, the values of poses were verified to make sure that the robot is not moving into an obstacle and that the hand has a valid place for `v8` to be.
           
           The problem requires to write a plan and specify where the object is on the table, which this plan fulfills. This plan has a cost of roughly 3.3.
