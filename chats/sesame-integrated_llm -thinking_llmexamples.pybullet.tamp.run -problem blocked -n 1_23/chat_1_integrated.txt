           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.345, 0.33), (-4.27, 0.405)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.307, 0.368, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.037, 0.999).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires placing an object of type `v17` (let's call it 'green') on object `v18`. I know that `v8` and `v12` are the only objects that meet this 'green' criteria.
           
           Firstly, I checked the current state to determine if `v8` or `v12` is already `on(v18)`. Upon inspection, neither is, so I need to devise a pick-and-place sequence.  I need to find a suitable object that has `type(obj, v17)`. After careful review, I know that v8 satisfies the `type` requirement.
           
           I examined the initial state to determine where each of the potential green objects `v8`, `v12`, `v15` is currently and what supporting objects exist. I found that `v8` is initially supported by `v9` where `atpose(v8, v9)` and that it is also supported by `#p0` on `v18`. I decided to proceed with `v8` because it is supported and I know that I have a valid `kin` relationship for `v8` to `#p0`, and it's also true in the initial state to make `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`.
           
           My plan is to *pick* `v8` from its current pose `v9`, *move* to the destination `#q1`, and then *place* it on `v18` at pose `#p0`. I am working on the assumption that `#q0` and `#q1` and other elements beginning with # are continuous parameters to be found by another algorithm. I know `#q0` and `#q1` are base configurations.
           
           The *pick* action has preconditions that must be met: The robot arm must be empty, there must be a valid kinetic relationship (kin), the object must be at its current pose and the robot arm must be at its base configuration. The same applies for place, except that the robot arm now has the object. I *move* and *place* the object on `v18`.
           
           My detailed plan is as follows:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #q0 #t1`: Move the robot base from its initial configuration `v3` to an intermediate configuration `#q0`. This will allow the action `pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0` and is dependent on a basemotion.
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0`: Pick `v8` from its initial position `v9`.
           3.  `move_base #q0 #q1 #o0`: Move the robot base from `#q0` to `#q1`.
           4.  `place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2`: Place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#p0`.
           
           I understand that "#p0" is a pose on the surface `v18`. After carefully examining the known surface values, I selected `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for the coordinates for object `v8` where the initial and the final position is a collision-free and stable placement.
           
           Upon performing the `place` action, the goal `on(v8, v18)` is realized and `new-axiom@0()` is achieved.
           
           I have followed the stated cost function, and since costs are unknown, and I've stated that there is not cost for a pick or place, and my pick and place actions must be 1.
           I acknowledge that I may have the responsibility for calculating the value of `#q0`, `#q1`, and `#p0` but was instructed to use a separate algorithm for continuous parameters.
           
           This completes the derivation of my plan.
