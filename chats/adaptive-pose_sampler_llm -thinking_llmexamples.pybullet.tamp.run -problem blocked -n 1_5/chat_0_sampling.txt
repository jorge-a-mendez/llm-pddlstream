(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a 0.07 x 0.07 square, on surface 0 defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement is stable if the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) fits entirely within the surface's AABB.  Given the square object, rotation won't change its AABB, so I can keep `theta` at 0 for simplicity.
           
           First, I calculate the valid range for the object's center (x, y) on the surface. Since the object's width and height are both 0.07, I need to place the center within a smaller area to ensure the entire object is within the surface. This means `x` must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and `y` must be between -0.565 and -0.035.
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I'm going to create a grid within these valid x, y ranges. I decided on 7 steps in the x direction and 8 steps in the y direction to get 56 placements, and then I'll just take the first 50.  I'll then calculate the increments for both dimensions.  For x, I will use  (4.765 - 4.235) / 6, and similarly for y.  I'll then create a list of x coordinates and another for y coordinates using the calculated increments and valid ranges.
           
           Then, I'll generate the placement tuples (surf_idx, theta, x, y) setting `surf_idx` to 0 and `theta` to 0.0 for all cases, and iterate through x and y values for the first 50 placement combinations.  I'm confident this will produce a set of stable and distinct object placements. The stability is guaranteed by the x, y range restrictions relative to the object's size and surface extents.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0, avoiding collision with the previously placed object ID 5 at (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565). Object 10 is almost square with dimensions (0.0719, 0.0719). Surface 0's valid placement area is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).
           
           First, I calculate the valid range for object 10's center coordinates (x, y) on surface 0, considering the object's size. The valid range for x is [4.23595, 4.76405] and y is [-0.56405, -0.03595].
           
           Next, I determine the collision boundary with object 5, which occupies a region defined by [4.2, 4.27] x [-0.6, -0.53].  For object 10 to *not* collide, its placement needs to avoid overlapping with this region.
           
           I deduce two regions for stable placements: one *right* of object 5 (x ≥ 4.30595) and the other *above* object 5 (y ≥ -0.49405).
           
           To generate placements, I will prioritize filling the region to the *right* of object 5, and then supplement with placements above object 5. I will establish a grid of 56 points where x >= 4.30595, and y takes on 8 steps between -0.56405 and -0.03595. Finally, I'll provide 50 of these calculated placements.
