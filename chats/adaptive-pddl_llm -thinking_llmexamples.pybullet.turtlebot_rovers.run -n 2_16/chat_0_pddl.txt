           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan's Failure: A Fixed-Configuration Conundrum**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This translates into verifying several initial conditions, but crucially, I must *acquire images and analyses* and establish their corresponding *received* facts. To do so, I need rovers v12 and v14 to perform various tasks: taking images, sampling rocks, sending information.
           
           However, a critical review of the problem reveals a significant constraint: the rovers are locked into their initial configurations.  The provided actions allow only "move" actions that effectively do nothing. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` will *not* change their state!
           
           Here's the breakdown of why I fail:
           
           *   **Image Acquisition:** To get the necessary image (`receivedimage`), the rovers *must* be in specific configurations like `#o3`.  But, the `imagevisible` predicates are paired with `atconf`, and the rovers are fixed at v13 and v15, not #o3. Thus, I can't even get the images needed to "receive" them.
           *   **Analysis Acquisition:**  To achieve `receivedanalysis`, I need to sample rocks and send the results. This requires being in configuration `#o5` which, again, is not the case. The rovers are stuck!
           *   **The Restricted Action Instances:** I am strictly limited to specific action instances. The only "move" actions I can use are pointless: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. These do nothing relevant. I cannot use `drop_rock` because the stores are `free`.
           
           No action can change the state enough to achieve the goals. The goal is unachievable!
