(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size 0.0818 x 0.0818) on a square surface (Surface 0, bounds -0.135 to 0.135). A placement is considered stable if the object fits entirely within the surface bounds and doesn't collide with obstacles (which I'll address later based on feedback) or previously placed objects (none yet in this scenario).
           
           First, I analyzed the geometry. Both the object and surface are squares. This simplifies the calculations. The object's maximum rotated extent (diagonal) is 0.1157, well within the surface dimensions (0.27 x 0.27), ensuring it can always fit. The key is to calculate the effective half-width and half-height for containment given a rotation.
           
           For a square object rotated by an angle *theta*, the maximum extent, in both X and Y, becomes *side_length* * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))). Since the object is a square, its bounding box remains a square regardless of rotation.
           
           To create diverse placements, I've chosen several rotations: 0, pi/4 (45 degrees), pi/2 (90 degrees), pi/8 (22.5 degrees), and 3*pi/8 (67.5 degrees). For each rotation, I've created a grid of positions within the allowed bounds to ensure coverage. The number of grid points is determined by the maximum bounding box size at that rotation.
           
           For `theta=0, pi/2`, bounding box (0.08182), half_width (0.04091)
           x_coords and y_coords is a 5x5 grid (25 placements)
           
           For `theta=pi/4`, bounding box (0.11571), half_width (0.05786), 3x3 grid (9 placements)
           
           For `theta=pi/8 and 3pi/8`, bounding box size 0.10688, half width is (0.05344). 2x2 grids (4 placements each), generating (8 placements)
           
           I adjusted the number of points at each angle to get the final count to be 50. All the calculations are done to full precision, with rounding during output.
           
           Here are the 50 stable placements:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, my primary objective is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square with a side length of approximately 0.078, on surface 0, which is a square region spanning from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y dimensions. I need to ensure that none of these placements collide with object ID 5, a square with a side length of about 0.082, already placed at (0, 0, -0.094088, -0.094088).
           
           To begin, I've analyzed the AABB of object 5, which resides in the bottom-left corner of the surface, specifically within the region [(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.053176, -0.053176)]. This means object 4's placements must not overlap this area. I need to factor in the rotation of object 4 as it impacts its effective bounding box size. The maximum width, considering all rotations, will be 0.078 * sqrt(2) which is about 0.11.
           
           I have a strategy:
           
           1. **Calculate Available Space:** I need to account for rotations and object sizes. The coordinates for the center are determined by the collision zone, so I will take into account the value of `hw4`, or half-width/height. I will limit the `x` and `y` center coordinates.
           2. **Rotation Selection:**  I will be using rotations of 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2 for diversity.
           3. **Placement Generation:** Now for the fun part: I am going to populate the surface.
               *   For theta = 0, the side length is simple to account for in the x and y bounds. I will use a 5x5 grid, so 25 placements. The surface area available is smaller, however.
               *   For theta = pi/4, the bounding box of the object is wider and will use a 3x3 grid, for 9 placements.
               *   For theta = pi/2, the geometry is the same as theta = 0, so I will use a 3x3 grid again.
               *   For the last two angles, theta = pi/8, I will only need 4 placements. From the same grid, I will reuse some for theta=3*pi/8, and place the final 3 points from the existing grid to get a total of 50.
           
           I've carefully calculated all the bounds and half widths to make sure these all fit the rules!

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while ensuring no overlap with two existing objects, (ID 5) and (ID 4), both also square.  The approach leverages the concept of Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to efficiently detect potential collisions.
           
           First, I define the AABBs for the existing objects. Given that object rotations are zero, the AABB calculations are straightforward: the bounds are based on the object's center coordinates and side length. Using the side lengths and center coordinates, I calculate the AABBs for Object 5 and Object 4.  The new object, object 6, has a side length `s6`.
           
           Then, using the side lengths I can compute a half-width `hw6` of the new object.
           
           I established the following validity criteria for a new object's placement: (1) Its AABB must be fully contained within the surface boundaries. (2) It must not overlap with the AABBs of either object 5 or object 4.
           
           I then used an algorithm that iterates over potential positions for the new object's center, (xc, yc) for various rotation angles. For each position and angle, the program checks for collisions with existing objects. If no collision exists, then the object is placed. Finally, I generate a number of placements to total 50.

(Thoughts: **Planning Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for object ID 7 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into objects ID 5, 4, and 6. I've got the surface size (a square: -0.135 to 0.135) and AABB data for those existing objects.  Object 7 is about 10cm, quite large for the space. My strategy is to map out available areas, consider rotation and perform collision checks to place the object without overlap.
           
           First, I looked at the bounding boxes of the existing objects. They're mostly in the lower-left and lower-central areas.  That means I'm probably placing the new object in the upper or right side of the space. Object 7's AABB half-width for a rotation of 0 degrees is about 0.048968; for 45 degrees, it's about 0.069256, and other rotations have slightly different widths. I'll need to account for these as well.
           
           I then calculate valid ranges for the center point (cx, cy) of object 7, depending on the rotation angle. Then I defined a function called 'is_colliding' for collision detection using AABBs.
           
           Given the existing space and sizes, I will start by placing them for 0 degree rotation as most of the available space is clear to the right and above. The surface goes from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           I will calculate the grid points for rotation angle 0.0 (theta), and apply some logic to check if new point overlaps with object's existing position. I'll make grid point for angle 0 and 90, 45, 22.5, 67.5 (22.5 and 67.5 are similar), and check their positions.
           
           I will iterate with a grid to find those points, and return them, ensuring no collisions occur. I prioritize top-right positions since most space is available there.

I'll need to account for these as well.
           
           I then calculate valid ranges for the center point (cx, cy) of object 7, depending on the rotation angle. Then I defined a function called 'is_colliding' for collision detection using AABBs.
           
           Given the existing space and sizes, I will start by placing them for 0 degree rotation as most of the available space is clear to the right and above. The surface goes from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           I will calculate the grid points for rotation angle 0.0 (theta), and apply some logic to check if new point overlaps with object's existing position. I'll make grid point for angle 0 and 90, 45, 22.5, 67.5 (22.5 and 67.5 are similar), and check their positions.
           
           I will iterate with a grid to find those points, and return them, ensuring no collisions occur. I prioritize top-right positions since most space is available there.
