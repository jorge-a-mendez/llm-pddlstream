(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 7**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on surface 0, ensuring that each placement is distinct and the object remains entirely within the defined surface boundaries. Object 7 has dimensions of approximately 0.09055 units by 0.09055 units, which is practically square. The surface 0 is a rectangle defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           To achieve this, I'll leverage the geometry of the object and surface, focusing on the object's effective dimensions (AABB) when rotated. The key parameters are `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, representing surface index, rotation angle, and the center coordinates of the object, respectively.  The effective width and height of the object's AABB vary with the rotation angle `theta`.
           
           First, I need to define the valid region for the object's center `(x, y)` given a rotation `theta`. The maximum effective dimension occurs at `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees), where the effective width becomes approximately 0.128 units. Conversely, the minimum effective dimension occurs when `theta` is a multiple of `pi/2` or `0`, with an effective width of about 0.09055. Using the surface's dimensions (0.27 x 0.27), I can deduce the valid center ranges for each angle.
           
           I'll generate a set of placements by sampling rotations and then sampling the centers within the permitted region. I chose to use the following angles: `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi`, along with a few other points. For each rotation angle, I create a 3x3 grid of `(x, y)` points within the allowable region.  This results in 9 distinct placement possibilities for each angle. The 5 additional placements are all central placements, ensuring the total placements amount to 50. All the calculations are double-checked for geometric validity.
           
           This strategy will create various stable placement candidates, varying both the rotation angle and the location of the center to make sure all placements are distinct. Since surface 0 has a reasonable size and object is small, I know placement should be straightforward.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating that placing object ID 7 at a specific location was successful, meaning it didn't collide with any obstacles.  I've taken note of that position, which is essentially the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Now, the challenge is to place object ID 5 a total of 50 times without any collisions with object ID 7.
           
           Object 5 is almost square in shape and has specific dimensions, and the surface it needs to fit into is a square as well. Since I'm an expert, I'll take all this into consideration and come up with a comprehensive plan.
           
           The first thing I did was to calculate Object 7's AABB which is [-0.135, -0.0444] x [-0.135, -0.0444]. Object 5's dimensions and its rotation needs to be considered to find the safe placements.
           
           The basic approach will be to define the space in which object 5 can be placed (the surface) and take into consideration that object 7 is already taking a small region in the space. I'll need to generate a list of 50 valid placements of object 5, each with a different rotation. This is where I'll use my knowledge to generate the list.
           
           Now I have to devise a scheme to avoid collisions. I'll take a two-pronged approach. First, I'll divide the remaining space into logical regions that do not overlap with object 7. I'll then consider what these regions look like. I know that if I have a grid of points on which object 5's center can be based, and the grid doesn't intersect with the space which object 7 occupies, then I can generate these locations and provide the list of 50 placements.
           
           Finally, I will generate a number of points using a loop that checks for collisions at different angles. This loop will provide all the 50 possible placements.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Placement Challenge**
           
           Okay, so the task is to place object ID 4 stably on surface 0, avoiding collisions with any existing obstacles. I'm given two other objects (ID 7 and ID 5) which have already been "successfully" placed. But here's the twist: it turns out that object ID 5 actually *collides* with object ID 7! The system's "success" feedback only guarantees there are *no collisions with fixed obstacles*. But not with objects that are also on the surface. Now the real task is to place the new object so that it avoids ID 7 and ID 5. This tells me that they've now become part of the scene's obstacle set.
           
           **Scene Geometry**
           
           The relevant geometry is surface 0, which is a square with boundaries from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The dimensions are 0.27m by 0.27m. I've got to find 50 stable positions within this boundary.
           
           Objects ID 7 and ID 5, based on their given center and size, occupy a portion of the bottom-left corner. They are effectively now fixed obstacles that must be avoided. My collision check will now be against their placement.
           
           I've determined that due to the overlap, I can simplify the collision check by treating their combined area as a single larger obstacle.  This means I can treat their combined AABB as the 'effective' obstacle space.
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           To find the placements, I'll take the following steps:
           
           1.  **Iterate Through Rotations:** Consider object 4 at different orientations.
           2.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** I'll determine how big object 4 is for each angle.
           3.  **Define Valid Surface Range:** Determine the valid (x,y) placement locations on the surface.
           4.  **Generate Positions:** I'll generate a grid of potential (x, y) placements within valid bounds for each rotation angle.
           5.  **Collision Check:** For each placement, I'll calculate the exact AABB. Then, I will perform an AABB vs. AABB collision check.
           6.  **Filter Non-Colliding Positions:** I'll select only those positions that *do not* collide with the obstacles.
           7.  **Generate a Diverse Set:** The code generates a diverse sample of valid placements for a high probability of finding 50 unique placements.
           
           The code will iterate across multiple angle values to make sure that a solution set is achieved.
           
           **Collision Checking**
           
           I'm using the standard AABB collision detection. If any part of the new object's AABB overlaps with the obstacle's AABB (in both the x and y axes), there's a collision. I will now use a collision check and a set of candidate points to generate 50 unique stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing New Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 8) on surface 0, while keeping in mind the existing objects (IDs 7, 5, and 4) as obstacles. Surface 0 is a rectangle, and I have the precise dimensions of each obstacle. I'm going to focus on placing ID 8 with a rotation of 0, because it simplifies the calculations.
           
           First, I need to figure out the areas where I can't put the new object. I have the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for each obstacle.  Object 5 is completely contained within Object 7, so I only need to consider Object 7 and Object 4.  I've already calculated the AABB coordinates, so I know I need to avoid these rectangles.
           
           The main strategy involves:
           1.  **Define Obstacle AABBs:** Convert the object locations and extents into two obstacle AABBs (rectangle regions). One covers the combination of Object 7 and 5, and one for Object 4.
           2.  **Determine Valid Placement Regions:** At the rotation of 0, I can calculate `effective_width` and `effective_height`, since it's a nearly square object. Using the dimensions, I'll calculate the bounds of where object 8 can be located within the surface. I also calculate the valid center ranges.
           3.  **Generate Grid of Placements:**  Then, I'll generate a grid of potential `(x, y)` center points within the calculated valid ranges.
           4.  **Collision Check:** For each point in my grid, I'll figure out where the object's AABB would be placed at rotation 0 and check if it overlaps any of the AABBs that define obstacles.
           5.  **Placement Selection:** If there are no overlaps with the obstacles, it will then be a valid placement to add to my list. I will collect 50 of these.
           
           Since the object is almost a perfect square and rotation 0 is much easier to work with, it makes sense to go in this direction.
           
           **Calculating Valid Placements**
           
           I've already determined the x and y dimensions. Next, I need to find the valid center ranges for the new object. I found that I have the following conditions.
           
           The best thing to do is divide this into logical regions.
           To be in a valid placement, it is valid when:
           (`center_x >= 0.002868`) OR (`center_y >= 0.00286858269101171`)
           AND
           (`center_x >= -0.00466000574989183`) OR (`center_y <= -0.036851855705250676`)
           
           Then, I make a selection by doing a 5x10 grid on the valid x and y regions. Since I have 50 total placements to collect, this will be sufficient.  The grid will provide my valid placement values.

           Then, I make a selection by doing a 5x10 grid on the valid x and y regions. Since I have 50 total placements to collect, this will be sufficient.  The grid will provide my valid placement values.
           

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable locations for a new, almost-square object (ID 6) on a specific surface (Surface 0). This surface is a rectangle defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I have to treat the existing objects (IDs 7, 5, 4, and 8) as fixed obstacles.
           
           First, I calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each existing object. This involved determining their positions, extents (size), and then their half-extents to compute their AABBs in the format `(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y)`. For object ID 7, this resulted in the AABB `((-0.135, -0.0444476886488114), (-0.135, -0.044447688648811425))`. Object ID 5, being within 7, did not change this. Then, for Object ID 4, I got the AABB  `((-0.135, -0.05197627708971496), (0.01046441563457244, 0.09348813854485748))`. Finally, for object ID 8, the AABB became `((-0.0444476886488114, 0.05018485403083486), (-0.135, -0.040367457320353725))`.  I will use these AABBs for efficient collision detection.
           
           Now, considering the new object (ID 6), which is nearly a perfect square with `size_x = 0.08619353049266563` and `size_y = 0.08619353049266565`, I'll start by assuming its orientation (theta) is 0 for simplicity. Its half-extents are `0.043096765246332815`. The key to finding stable placements is to ensure that the new object's AABB doesn't overlap with any of the obstacles' AABBs.
           
           The first step is to calculate the limits of where the center of object 6 can be. Given the surface and half-extents, it would be from `[-0.09190323475366718, 0.09190323475366718]`. I then need to find an overlap-free region within the surface limits, avoiding all obstacles.
           
           To avoid collisions, I needed to ensure that the object's AABB did not overlap with any of the obstacle AABBs. I carefully evaluated the conditions where object 6's maximum or minimum X and Y values could potentially touch, but not collide with the AABB of each obstacle. I decided the best way to get enough stable positions would be to make a grid.
           
           After this careful analysis, I've determined that a collision-free region for the object's center is:
           
           *   X: `[-0.008879511843382145, 0.09190323475366718]`
           *   Y: `[0.0027293079259791, 0.09190323475366717]`
           
           I've decided to create a grid of these coordinates to generate 50 stable positions.
           This grid contains 7 x-positions and 8 y-positions.
           The resulting list will have a 56 positions, each guaranteed to be stable and non-colliding.
