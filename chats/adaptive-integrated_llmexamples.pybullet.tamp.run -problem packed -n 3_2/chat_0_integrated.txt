           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.016, -0.265, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.123, 0.992).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.026, -0.308), (0.059, -0.223)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.249, -0.024, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.561, 0.828).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.203, -0.069), (0.294, 0.022)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.052, -0.503, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.788, 0.616).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.01, -0.545), (0.094, -0.46)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom controllable(v4)

           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. They are currently at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, all supported by `v11`. The goal is to stack all three objects on `v16`. Since `v16` is a square object and all three items `v8`, `v12`, `v14` are also square objects, they can be stacked on top of each other on `v16`. The `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` indicates that the robot can move its base from configuration `v3` to `v3` via trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the base configuration, but it does consume the `canmove()` predicate. This problem does not require any movement of the base, so the `move_base` action is unnecessary.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to pick up each object and place it on `v16`. Since the specific pick and place actions with their corresponding kinematics, trajectories, and base configurations are not provided, it is impossible to generate a plan that achieves the goal. The only action instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not help to pick or place objects.
           
           Thus, the goal is unreachable given the available action instances.
