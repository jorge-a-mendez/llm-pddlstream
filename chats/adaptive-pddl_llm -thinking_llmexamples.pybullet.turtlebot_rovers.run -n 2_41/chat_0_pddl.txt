           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable Given Constraints**
           
           My analysis begins by dissecting the target axiom `new-axiom@0()`, focusing on the necessary conditions: achieving images of two objectives, and performing analysis on both stone and soil samples.  The initial state provides crucial information, including the locations of the rovers (`v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`), and various "visibility" and "communication" predicates that seem key to image and data transmission.
           
           I then explored the action schemas provided. The goal of image reception hinges on the `take_image` and `send_image` actions, requiring calibration.  Similarly, receiving analysis results necessitates the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions.  Critical to all these is the `atconf(?rover, ?configuration)` predicate which dictates the location.
           
           The problem arises due to a crucial constraint: only two `move` actions are allowed.  These explicitly *do not* change the rover's configuration. They're `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. Therefore, neither rover can transition from its starting configuration (v13 or v15). This is a rigid constraint.
           
           Continuous parameters represented by `#oX` (e.g. `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`) are intended to be poses that the rover can move to according to the rules, but the allowed actions do not allow any movement out of the original pose. Therefore, any action with the `atconf` predicate can not be achieved given that the `atconf` location cannot change.
           
           This restriction renders it impossible to satisfy the preconditions for image taking, image sending, sampling or analysis sending, all of which require the rover to be at specific, non-initial configurations.  The `drop_rock` action is allowed, however, that requires the rover to hold a rock. The rover `v14` has `free(v14, v16)` which means it does not have a rock.
           
           In summary, given the strict limitations on movement and the specific configuration requirements of the relevant actions, achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently infeasible. The plan, as it currently stands, is blocked.
