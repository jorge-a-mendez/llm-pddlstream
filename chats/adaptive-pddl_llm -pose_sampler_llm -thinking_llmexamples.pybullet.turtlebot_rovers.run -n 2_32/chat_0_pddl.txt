           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which boils down to achieving four sub-goals: getting images of objects `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11` received by lander `v9`, and analyzing samples from a stone and a soil. The initial state gives me a decent starting point with rovers `v12` and `v14` at configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, the camera `v10` onboard those rovers, and a store `v16`. I have also visibility to the lander and can communicate with it.
           
           To get the images, I need to use the `send_image` action. This has a few requirements: the rover needs to be able to communicate with the lander, it must have an objective (i.e. the picture), a mode, and it must `haveimage`.  This is where things get tricky.  `haveimage` requires `take_image` which in turn demands a calibrated camera using the action `calibrate`.  Similarly, the `send_analysis` action has preconditions `comvisible`, a rock or soil to analyse (which I have), `analyzed`, `atconf` and `~blocked` (no blocking rays in my world). `analyzed` requires `sample_rock`.
           
           Now, the plan is to use rovers to take pictures of objects, and analyze a stone and a soil and then send them to the lander. The problem is I have to work with this list of actions, those are the only actions I am allowed.
           
           Here is the plan I came up with:
           
           - Rover `v12` calibrates camera `v10` with respect to objects `v17` and `v18` with current config.
           - Rover `v12` takes the image of `v17`
           - Rover `v12` sends image `v17`
           - Rover `v12` calibrates camera `v10` again because it is not calibrated.
           - Rover `v12` takes the image of `v18`
           - Rover `v12` sends image `v18`
           - Rover `v12` goes to the sample location to sample the soil
           - Rover `v12` drops the sample on store `v16`
           - Rover `v12` sends analysis of the soil sample
           - Rover `v14` goes to the sample location to sample the stone
           - Rover `v14` drops the sample on store `v16`
           - Rover `v14` sends analysis of the stone sample
           
           The only actions allowed by the problem are `move` and `drop_rock`. No `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions are explicitly listed in the "list of valid action instances". It means even if I can prove the action works, I am not allowed to use those.
           
           **Conclusion:** Given the restricted set of allowed action instances, `new-axiom@0()` cannot be achieved. The plan is theoretically possible, but the required steps are not permitted by the problem's constraints.
