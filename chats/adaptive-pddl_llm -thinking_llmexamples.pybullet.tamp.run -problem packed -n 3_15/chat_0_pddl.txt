           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v4)

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough, right? I need to get each object `on(..., v16)`. The catch, and here's where the head-scratching starts, is the seemingly arbitrary restriction: only one action instance is allowed: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           My initial read is that I have to move the three objects to the target receptacle, which by definition means to change each of their `atpose` states, so that each one is supported by the new pose on `v16`. That would require the robot to use `pick` and `place` actions because those are the only actions that can modify an object's `atpose`. But, the action `move_base` doesn't affect `atpose`.
           
           However, the problem statement *explicitly* prohibits me from using any actions *not* in the given list, which is just this `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` instance. I'm essentially told that `pick` and `place` are off-limits, which implies it's impossible to manipulate these objects. It's a bit perplexing since the problem is clearly a blocks world problem.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is the conflict between the goal, the initial state, and the constraint on actions. The goal and initial state are defined in a standard blocks world problem, but the action constraint makes the problem unsolvable. I have to declare that the goal *cannot* be reached.
