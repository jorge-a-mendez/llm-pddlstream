User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by four walls: x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters of small boxes near the corners (e.g., at (2,2), (-2,2), etc.) and some individual smaller obstacles. I will avoid placing the robot too close to any of these known obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are within the allowed x and y limits.
           
           Given the target point {target_point}, I will try to find 3 positions within a radius of 2.0. I will start by considering points directly around the target, and then move to a wider range if necessary. I will try to vary the angle around the target point for diversity.
           
           Positions:
           ( {target_point[0]} + 1.5, {target_point[1]} )
           ( {target_point[0]} - 1.5, {target_point[1]} )
           ( {target_point[0]}, {target_point[1]} + 1.5 )
