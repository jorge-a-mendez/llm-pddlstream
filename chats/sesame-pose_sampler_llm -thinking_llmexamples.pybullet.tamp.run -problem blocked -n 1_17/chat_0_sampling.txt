(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, an AABB defined by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates of the object's center. Given the AABB definition of the object, the rotation angle *does* influence the effective area *if considering the object's geometry*.
           
           For a stable placement, the object must be entirely within the surface bounds.  Surface 0 has x-min of 4.2, y-min of -0.6, x-max of 4.8, and y-max of 0.0. The object's center will be (x_c, y_c).
           
           Due to the object's dimensions and the surface's bounding box, there's a range of valid positions for the object. I've calculated that x_c must be within [4.235, 4.765] and y_c within [-0.565, -0.035] for *theta = 0*.  However, since the object is a square and is *rotated*, the rotated AABB expands. The bounds shift based on the rotation angle. For *theta = pi/4*, the ranges become more constrained and the valid area shrinks.
           
           To efficiently generate placements, I'll prioritize filling the larger *theta=0* region first, calculating the effective bounds using the rotated AABB extents. Then, I'll use a grid to generate 8x5 placements within the theta=0 region. Afterward, I'll generate a grid of 5x2 placements for `theta = pi/4`. Finally, I'll check to ensure I don't generate more than 50 placements.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 10) on a given surface (surface 0). This object's size is approximately 0.0987 x 0.0987, and I need to avoid collisions with previously placed objects.  The surface has dimensions 0.6 x 0.6, and already has objects placed on it.  Crucially, I must treat these earlier, successful placements of a different object (ID 5) as fixed obstacles to be avoided.
           
           First, I analyze object dimensions and surface boundaries. The bounds of surface 0 are defined. I calculate the AABB of object 10 to cover different orientations. I determine that the most efficient placement strategy will be with the object at 0 degrees and the object oriented at 45 degrees. However, to keep this strategy simple, I'll limit the placements to the 0 degree orientation.  Therefore, I use 0.04935 as the object's half-dimension.
           
           The most important step is to identify the collision constraints from existing objects: the AABBs of previous ID 5 placements.  There are 10 successful placements of ID 5.  These represent collision zones for ID 10 and they limit the viable placement area.  I determine that if my object is placed on the surface bottom, it must be above the previous object.  This constraint effectively creates two valid placement regions, labeled A and B.
           
           Region A's is created from the edge of the previous objects, and can be used to hold up to 18 objects by dividing this region using a 5x2 grid. In Region B, 32 objects can be placed. These placements should create a 6x5 grid and cover the upper area of the surface.  This region also does not overlap.  The strategy is to avoid the area of previously placed objects and create a grid to create non-overlapping objects.
           
           Therefore, for the 50 desired stable placements, I will use only `theta = 0` and the combination of the two regions.
