           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My initial thought process:** I need to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This means ensuring a conjunction of several conditions hold true. I'll need to work through each condition, checking if it's already true in the initial state. If not, I'll need to figure out what actions can make it true, given the constraints of the problem.  I'll start with the conditions involving `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`, and `type`. The most crucial part will be finding a sequence of actions from the allowed action list that results in the goal being satisfied, or determining that it's unachievable. The presence of the `type` conditions is straight forward.
           
           **Breaking it Down:** First, I'll analyze the goal's definition to understand what needs to be accomplished. I have several `atconf` and `free` conditions that are all true in the initial state, so those are good. Then, the crux of the matter starts to appear; I have four `receivedimage` conditions to address.  `receivedimage` means I'll need to use the `send_image` action. The precondtions of `send_image` require the rover and the lander to be comvisible, that there is an objective to image, and the rover has the image. To get the image, I have to use `take_image`, the preconditions of which is  that the rover has a calibrated camera. The problem provides that `v14` has a camera, and is at `v15` in `atconf` configuration. So I will likely use `v14` for imaging, and thus `v9` for the lander, in any imaging plan.
           
           **Working with the Constraints:**  Next, there are two `receivedanalysis` conditions. These need `send_analysis`, which requires that the rover has analyzed a rock. That means I will probably have to `sample_rock`. Now,  I also have to remember the strict limitation on which actions I can include. From here, I go back to checking the initial state to determine what objects exist.
           
           **Unreachable Conclusion:** Unfortunately, after scrutinizing the list of allowed actions, I quickly recognize a major problem. The allowed action list *does not* include `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. These actions are necessary to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. Since the problem explicitly states that only the provided actions can be used, this makes the goal *unachievable*. None of these essential actions are present, and the actions that *are* present, `move` and `drop_rock`, can't address the missing facts.
           
           **Final Determination:** Given the extremely limited set of available actions, it's clear the goal cannot be reached. Therefore, I will not include a plan since the problem states it's unreachable.
