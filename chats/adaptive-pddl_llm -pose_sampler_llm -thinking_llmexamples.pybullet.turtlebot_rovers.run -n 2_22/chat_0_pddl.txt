           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           My task is to create a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires receiving images of two objectives and analyzing and receiving analysis of both a stone and soil sample. I've broken down the goal into its components and examined the initial state. I've identified that the image receiving part of the goal (using the `take_image` and `send_image` actions) is achievable. However, the analysis part of the goal presents a significant hurdle.
           
           Specifically, achieving `receivedanalysis(?r)` necessitates the `send_analysis` action, which in turn depends on the `sample_rock` action.  `sample_rock`'s preconditions include `above(?v, ?q, ?r)` and `atconf(?v, ?q)`. The `above` predicates use a specific configuration,  `#o5`, to signify when a rover is located above a rock.  Crucially, to sample a rock, a rover must be at this configuration (`#o5`) according to `atconf`. The available `move` actions, however, only allow me to keep the rovers at their current configurations (`v13` or `v15`).  Therefore, there's no way to place either rover at configuration `#o5` which is required to use the `sample_rock` action. Since, I cannot get `sample_rock` to work, `analyzed(?r)` and `send_analysis`, the goal of analyzing and receiving analysis of rocks is not achievable. This suggests a fundamental inconsistency in the plan's requirements and available actions.
