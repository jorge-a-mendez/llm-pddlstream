User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/- 2.55 and y = +/- 2.55. There's a vertical obstacle through the middle at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters in the top-right and top-left quadrants, and a few in the bottom half. I will attempt to place the robot in a clear area within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize areas that appear less cluttered, and try to place them at different angles around the target point.

Model:     The previous attempts were too far from the target point and either didn't have line of sight or were out of range. The target point is at (-0.63, 2.14). The previous positions were too low on the y-axis, and (0.468, 0.468) and (0.468, -0.468) were likely occluded by the central vertical barrier (obstacle 5). (-0.468, 0.468) was also too far from the target. I need to generate positions that are closer to the target and respect the obstacles. The target is in the upper left quadrant. I will focus on positions in that quadrant, avoiding the x=0 barrier. The target is quite close to obstacle 20 ((-0.673, 2.104), (-0.587, 2.190)) and other obstacles in the top left, so I need to be careful with placement.

Model:     My previous positions failed because I received a duplicate request with the same failed positions. I need to generate new positions. The target is (-0.63, 2.14). I must remember the previous failures for this target: (0.468, 0.468), (0.468, -0.468), and (-0.468, 0.468).
           
           I will now try positions closer to the target point, making sure they are within the max range of 2. I need to be careful to avoid fixed obstacles. The target is in the upper left quadrant. The obstacles in this area include 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), 20 ((-0.673, 2.104), (-0.587, 2.190)), and 6 ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3952, -1.6544)) which is further down.
           
           I will try positions further to the left and slightly below the target, or directly below it, to avoid obstacles to the right and above.

Model:     I have a new target point: (2.064, 1.799). The previous set of proposed positions were for a different target point (-0.63, 2.14), but the provided "failures" section shows a new target. I must assume the new failures correspond to the *new* target point.
           
           The new target is (2.064, 1.799), which is in the upper right quadrant.
           The failed positions for this target were:
           (-1.5, 1.5) -- no line of sight (expected, far from target and blocked by center wall)
           (-2.0, 2.0) -- collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) (expected, far from target and in obstacle)
           (-0.63, 1.0) -- no line of sight (expected, far from target and blocked by center wall)
           
           My initial assessment was for the incorrect target, I need to focus on positions close to (2.064, 1.799).
           Obstacles in this region include:
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This obstacle is *at* the target. I need to be careful to avoid it.
           11: ((2.296, 1.325), (2.436, 1.465))
           16: ((1.555, 2.037), (1.674, 2.157))
           19: ((2.016, 1.751), (2.113, 1.848)) - This obstacle is also *at* the target.
           
           It appears the target point itself is within or very close to obstacles 7 and 19. This means I need to place the robot *around* these obstacles. The max range is 2.
