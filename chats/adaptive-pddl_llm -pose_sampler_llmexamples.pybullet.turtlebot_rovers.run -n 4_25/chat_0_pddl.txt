User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a central vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0, and several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the edges and some clustered in certain areas. I need to find positions within a 2-unit radius of the target point, avoiding these obstacles and ensuring line of sight.
           
           Since the target point is (-0.91 0.45), which is to the left of the central wall, I should focus on finding positions in the left half of the room (x < 0). There are obstacles in the upper left (6, 8, 10, 11, 20, 22), mid-left (16, 17), and lower-left (12, 18).
           
           I'll start by checking positions directly to the left, right, top, and bottom of the target, and then some diagonals, all within the max range. I will prioritize positions that are clearly away from the known obstacles.
           
           Target point: (-0.91, 0.45)
           Max range: 2
           
           Candidate positions will be tested around the target.
           1. Directly to the left, but accounting for the obstacle 17: (-0.923, -0.231) to (-0.785, -0.093). So, a bit further left and up/down.
           2. Directly to the right, but staying to the left of the central wall (x=0).
           3. Directly above, avoiding obstacle 16: (-1.615, 0.710) to (-1.478, 0.848).
           4. Directly below, avoiding obstacle 18: (-1.874, -1.393) to (-1.755, -1.274).
           
           Let's calculate some points:
           - Left: (-0.91 - 1.5, 0.45) = (-2.41, 0.45) - this is very close to the wall at x=-2.45. Let's try (-2.0, 0.45)
           - Right: (-0.91 + 0.5, 0.45) = (-0.41, 0.45) - this seems reasonable, avoiding the central wall.
           - Up: (-0.91, 0.45 + 1.5) = (-0.91, 1.95) - this is within reach and could be good. It seems to avoid most obstacles in the upper left, but it's close to 10 and 20.
           - Down: (-0.91, 0.45 - 1.5) = (-0.91, -1.05) - this avoids obstacle 17, and seems to be in a relatively clear area between 12 and 18.
           - Diagonal: (-0.91 - 1.0, 0.45 + 1.0) = (-1.91, 1.45) - this might be clear.
           - Diagonal: (-0.91 + 0.5, 0.45 - 1.0) = (-0.41, -0.55) - also seems reasonable.
           
           I'll pick three diverse positions that seem promising.
           1. Directly to the right of the target, away from the central wall and any known obstacles.
           2. Directly below the target, in what appears to be a clear corridor.
           3. Up and to the left of the target, but not too close to the far wall or the clustered obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.4 0.45)
           (-0.91 -1.05)
           (-1.9 1.4)
