           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on object `v18`. After examining the initial state, I've identified two potential candidates for this object, `v8` and `v12`, both of which are of the correct type (`type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`). However, neither of these objects is initially located on `v18`.
           
           My strategy would be to move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.  I confirmed that `v8` and `v12` are indeed stackable on `v18`. This requires actions like `pick` and `place`.
           
           The critical constraint here, however, is the very limited set of allowed actions. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action simply moves the robot's base and does not enable any object manipulation. It's like I have a tool without any moving parts; it is not able to fulfill my goal.
           
           Since the available action instances only includes base movement and not any pick/place capabilities,  I conclude that achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()` is impossible within this environment. The necessary object manipulation actions are not permitted.
