           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Goal: A Frustrating Dead End**
           
           Okay, so the task is to achieve the state where some object, let's call it `?green`, is `on` `v18`, and that `?green` has a specific `type`.  The initial state tells us that `v8` and `v12` could potentially satisfy this, as they have the correct `type`.  Ideally, I'd want either `v8` or `v12` to be `on v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see that `v8` is currently on `v11` and `v12` is currently on `v14`. This means I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions to move one of these objects. I’ll make v8 go on v18 because `type(v8, v17)` is given.
           
           My plan would be to: 1. Pick up `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) and 2. Place it on `v18`.
           
           The "problem" is the `pick` action. For the robot arm to pick an object, the arm (v4) needs to be at a specific base configuration, let's say `#o3`. However, the robot base is initially configured at `v3`. The system explicitly provides a move base action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action keeps the base in its place. The precondition `atbconf(v3)` needs to be changed. And because it doesn't change from `v3` to `#o3`, the `pick` and `place` actions are unreachable. Therefore, there's no way to move `v8` or `v12` to `v18`. Because the initial state does not allow for `pick` and `place` operations, I can't achieve the goal. I should have realized that a pick and place operation needs the base to move to a configuration specified by a kin fact. If there's no way to reach such a configuration, the goal is impossible to achieve.
