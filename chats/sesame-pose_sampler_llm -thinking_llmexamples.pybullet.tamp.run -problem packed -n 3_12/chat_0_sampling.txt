(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on a square surface (Surface 0). I'm looking at a square object, 0.075155... units on each side, and a square surface, 0.27 units on each side, centered at the origin. Since this object and the surface are square, everything is simplified by symmetry.
           
           To keep things stable, the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) must fit completely within the surface's AABB.  The object's AABB changes with rotation, and I know from my experience that for a square object, the widest AABB occurs when rotated by 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians). The widest possible AABB for this square object is calculated to be about 0.106... units wide. This is well within the surface dimensions (0.27 units), so placement is always possible.
           
           I'm aiming for good coverage of the surface. To maximize coverage, I'll use three representative `theta` values (rotation angles): 0, pi/8, and pi/4.  These three angles give me a good spread of different AABB sizes for this square object. For a square, I know that from 0 to pi/2, all the orientations are accounted for. In fact, from 0 to pi/4 covers all the extents because of the symmetry of the square.
           
           Now, for each `theta`, I need to determine the valid `x` and `y` ranges, factoring in the rotation and calculating how much the bounding box expands.
           The formula for rotated bounding box dimensions for a square of side `s` is: `width = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           
           I've calculated the appropriate bounding box half-width (hw) for each `theta` value I'm using:
           *   `theta = 0`: hw = ~0.037
           *   `theta = pi/8`: hw = ~0.049
           *   `theta = pi/4`: hw = ~0.053
           
           Given that, to get 50 placements, I am planning for:
           *   `theta = 0`: 25 placements using a 5x5 grid in the space (-0.097422, 0.097422) x (-0.097422, 0.097422)
           *   `theta = pi/8`: 16 placements using a 4x4 grid in the space (-0.085901, 0.085901) x (-0.085901, 0.085901)
           *   `theta = pi/4`: 9 placements using a 3x3 grid in the space (-0.081851, 0.081851) x (-0.081851, 0.081851)
           
           This gives me the 50 desired stable, contained placements, covering a fair variety of locations and rotations.
           
           Since there are no other objects or obstacles specified, there are no concerns about avoiding collisions, so this seems to be a straightforward problem.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4: A Detailed Plan**
           
           I've been tasked with the precise placement of a new square object (ID 4) onto Surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with the already-placed object (ID 5).  My plan involves a methodical, well-informed approach.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints: Surface 0 has dimensions of 0.27 x 0.27, and object 4 has a side length of approximately 0.0952.  A key insight is that by rotating object 4, I can almost perfectly span the surface. I'll consider three rotation angles, specifically focusing on 0 degrees (aligned), pi/8 (intermediate angle), and pi/4 (diagonal alignment), which will provide diverse coverage.
           
           My strategy is to create a set of valid object 4 center points (x, y) for each rotation. I'll define ranges for the x and y coordinates, ensuring the object stays within the surface boundaries.  These ranges change depending on the rotation, due to the changing AABB dimensions.
           
           Object 5, already placed, presents a challenge: it occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface. To avoid collisions, I'll calculate object 5's bounding box and meticulously exclude all placements of object 4 that overlap it.
           
           To generate 50 stable placements, I will divide the surface area into grids for each rotation angle. The grid resolution needs to be fine enough to ensure a good distribution of valid positions.  For each rotation, I will generate placements and discard those that are colliding.
           
           I've carefully calculated the collision check for each object placement and developed a collision exclusion zone to ensure the desired object separation.
           
           Here's my calculated plan:
           
           *   **Rotation 0 degrees:** Place 27 locations on a 6x6 grid, excluding 9 points in the bottom left corner to avoid collisions.
           *   **Rotation pi/8 radians:** Place 16 locations on a 5x5 grid, excluding 9 points on the bottom left corner to avoid collisions.
           *   **Rotation pi/4 radians:** Place 12 locations on a 4x4 grid, excluding 4 points on the bottom left corner to avoid collisions.
           
           The total number of valid placements is 55. I'll extract 50.
