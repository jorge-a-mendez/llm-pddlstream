(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down systematically. I'm tasked with placing object ID 4, which is essentially a near-square object (dimensions roughly 0.099 x 0.099), onto surface 0, a square surface bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). The critical constraint is that each placement must be *stable*, meaning the entire object's bounding box has to stay within the surface's boundaries.
           
           Given the almost-square shape, rotation becomes a key factor. While I could analyze the bounding box changes with *any* rotation, I'm going to take a more efficient, conservative approach to ensure containment for all orientations. My plan: first, determine the minimum and maximum boundaries of x and y for *any* rotation, and then place the object's center within those boundaries for specific rotations.
           
           Since the object is almost square, the effective bounding box dimensions (W and H) will be maximal at a 45-degree angle (pi/4 radians) and minimal at 0 degrees. So, I will calculate the minimal and maximal bounding box dimensions, and then generate placement coordinates accordingly.
           
           First, let me calculate the maximum width and height. When rotating by 45 degrees, the effective dimensions become: W = H = (w + h) * cos(pi/4).
           Given the input object w = 0.09895185550935043 and h = 0.09895185550935048, the largest box will be ~0.14. This gives us half the max dimension of 0.07.
           
           The bounds of placement, given the surface, are approximately within the rectangle from x = -0.065 to 0.065 and y = -0.065 to 0.065, ensuring full containment for *any* possible rotation. I can now define x and y to range in these values.
           
           To place 50 objects I will generate the x and y coordinates by dividing the area and consider two different angles.
           The valid x and y range are: x, y in range from -0.065 to 0.065
           
           I will make use of the fact that I do not need to care about the minimal bounds but I can rather use the max, and make the objects' x, y coordinate centers such that they are within the max.
           
           The strategy is:
           1.  **Coordinate Grid:** Create a 5x5 grid of placement points using the center-constrained boundaries within the x and y dimensions.
           2.  **Rotation Mix:** Apply two key orientations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees.
           3.  **Construction:** Use these two orientations across the 5x5 grid to construct 50 placements.
           
           Now I can define the coordinates to use: x\_coords and y\_coords:
           ```
           x_coords = [-0.06502748488376464, -0.03251374244188232, 0.0, 0.03251374244188232, 0.06502748488376464]
           y_coords = [-0.06502748488376464, -0.03251374244188232, 0.0, 0.03251374244188232, 0.06502748488376464]
           ```
           
           I'll use `theta = 0` (no rotation) for the first 25 placements (for each (x, y) grid coordinate) and then `theta = pi/4` (45-degree rotation) for the next 25. This should guarantee 50 stable placements, covering the surface with a reasonable distribution. This is a robust approach.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 5, that needs a spot on the surface, and I need to make sure it doesn't collide with the previously placed object, ID 4.  Here's how I'm thinking about it:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** Object 5 is a square (0.0787 units on each side). The surface itself is a square region. I already know that object 4 is placed at a specific location and, crucially, I know its size and the bounding box created by it. I must ensure these two objects don't intersect.
           
           2.  **Surface Constraints and Object Size:** I first calculate the range where object 5's center can be based on the surface size and object's dimensions.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** The key is avoiding a collision. Because I know the placement and size of object 4, I will work to find the points that don't collide. Because object 4 is already in position, I'll calculate the region it occupies. I need to make sure the bounding box for object 5 *does not* intersect the bounding box for object 4. This is a crucial concept.
           
           4.  **Creating a Safe Zone:** To avoid collisions, I need to know where I *can* place the center of object 5. To do that, I'll subtract the forbidden volume defined by the AABB of object 4. I'll need to define it relative to object 4, since it already exists.
           
           5.  **Placement Point Selection:** I need to find 50 valid placements. To ensure variety and good spatial coverage, I am going to form a grid and select grid points. I have calculated the valid x and y regions. I will place the points within the valid regions, and make sure that each selected position doesn't fall into the 'collision zone'. Also, as this is a square object, rotation doesn't change the size of its AABB. However, I want a variety. I can still use a variety of positions with two different theta values (0, and pi/2).
           
           6. **Systematic Generation**: I now generate a series of placements by creating a grid over the valid region (surface excluding the collision area) and testing each placement point. Finally, I alternate the theta value for variety.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis: A Detailed Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding 50 stable locations for Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 4 and 5. I've got the object's dimensions and Surface 0's boundaries, along with the positions and sizes of the existing objects.
           
           First, I figured out the safe zone for Object 6's center on Surface 0. It's basically a square, the surface's boundary shrunk by half of Object 6's width/height. This gives me an initial safe region *S*.
           
           Then, I had to account for Object 4 and Object 5, which are already placed. For each, I calculated a "forbidden region" - areas where Object 6's center *can't* be because it would collide. These are denoted F4 and F5.  I had to restrict these forbidden regions to the surface region S, effectively determining the portion of F4 and F5 that actually matter within S.
           
           Next, I needed to combine F4 and F5 to get the total forbidden area. Then I determined the VALID point range. That meant a valid placement needed to be within the allowed region of S AND NOT in the forbidden regions.
           
           I've got a system for picking potential center points for Object 6. They lie on a 10x10 grid within the allowed region.  I calculated each point's coordinates to be outside F4 and F5. Finally, I'll generate the placement with alternating theta values.
