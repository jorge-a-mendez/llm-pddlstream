User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a 5x5 square with corners at (-2.5, -2.5) and (2.5, 2.5). There's a vertical obstacle through the center at x=0, and many smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will try to place the robot in a variety of locations around the target point, within the allowed range of 2. I'll prioritize positions that are further away from known obstacles, especially the central x=0 obstacle.
           
           Positions:
           (1.037 1.488)
           (2.499 1.988)
           (0.403 2.062)
