           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           I've been tasked with developing a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which expands into several conditions related to image reception, rock analysis, and state maintenance (specifically rover configuration and store availability). My initial assessment involved verifying the initial state and identifying the necessary actions to fulfill the goal's requirements.
           
           A central issue arose when examining the allowed actions. The problem provided a very limited list, essentially only `move` and `drop_rock` instances. These actions are insufficient to satisfy the key predicates that must be true for `new-axiom@0()` (which require image transmission and sample analysis), as they do not include actions for imaging and analysis.
           
           I considered the implicit "teleportation" interpretation of configuration for '#' object names (given that there are no moves), and initially adopted the approach of implicitly updating `atconf` to satisfy the preconditions. Even under this more charitable interpretation, the restricted action set would prevent goal satisfaction, and the plan would not be valid.
           
           Since the list of actions is strictly constrained, I conclude that the provided set of valid action instances does not include the necessary actions to reach the goal. Thus, with a strict reading of the rules, the goal is unreachable.
