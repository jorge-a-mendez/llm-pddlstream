           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down `new-axiom@0()`:
           `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective `v17` with mode `v11` has been received. This is false initially.
           `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective `v18` with mode `v11` has been received. This is false initially.
           `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective `v19` with mode `v11` has been received. This is false initially.
           `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type predicate, which is true for `v1`, `v4`, `v3`.
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a stone (type `v2` rock) has been received. This is false initially.
           `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type predicate, which is true for `v5`, `v8`, `v7`.
           `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of soil (type `v6` rock) has been received. This is false initially.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to:
           1. Take images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with mode `v11` using a camera (`v10`) on either `v12` or `v14`.
           2. Send these images to the lander `v9`.
           3. Sample at least one rock of type `v2` (stone) and one rock of type `v6` (soil).
           4. Send the analysis of these sampled rocks to the lander `v9`.
           
           Let's consider the actions that can achieve these subgoals.
           `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)`: Requires `calibrated(?c, ?v)`. So, we need to calibrate the camera first.
           `calibrate(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c)`: Calibrates camera `?c` on rover `?v` at configuration `?q` for objective `?o` using ray `?y`.
           `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)`: Requires `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`.
           `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)`: Requires `above(?v, ?q, ?r)` and `free(?v, ?s)`.
           `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)`: Requires `analyzed(?v, ?r)`.
           
           Given the available `move` actions, neither rover `v12` nor `v14` can change its configuration from its initial one. This means we must use the existing configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) or the provided continuous configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`).
           
           Let's analyze what is possible with the given initial state and available actions:
           
           **Rover `v12` at `v13`:**
           *   `conf(v12, #o3)`: Can be used for `imagevisible` predicates with `v19`, `v18`, `v17`.
           *   `conf(v12, #o5)`: Can be used for `above` predicates with `v4`, `v8`, `v3`, `v7`, `v5`, `v1`.
           *   `conf(v12, #o0)`: Can be used for `comvisible` predicate with `v9`.
           
           **Rover `v14` at `v15`:**
           *   `conf(v14, #o3)`: Can be used for `imagevisible` predicates with `v18`, `v19`, `v17`.
           *   `conf(v14, #o5)`: Can be used for `above` predicates with `v8`, `v4`, `v3`, `v7`, `v5`, `v1`.
           *   `conf(v14, #o0)`: Can be used for `comvisible` predicate with `v9`.
           
           We need to make sure to pick continuous parameters for `#o3` (for image taking) and `#o0` (for communication) that are collision-free and allow line-of-sight. The `above` predicate already uses `#o5`.
           
           **Addressing `receivedimage` goals:**
           We need to get images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`. Both `v12` and `v14` have `imagevisible` to all three objectives using `#o3` and `#o4`.
           Let's use `v12` for imaging.
           1.  Calibrate `v10` for `v12` at `#o3` for `v19` using `ray #o4`.
           2.  Take image of `v19` using `v12` at `#o3` with `v10` and `v11`.
           3.  Send image of `v19` using `v12` at `#o0` to `v9` with `v11`.
           Repeat for `v18` and `v17`. Note that `calibrate` makes the camera uncalibrated after `take_image`, so we need to recalibrate for each image.
           
           **Addressing `receivedanalysis` goals:**
           We need to analyze a `v2` type rock and a `v6` type rock.
           Rocks of type `v2`: `v1`, `v4`, `v3`.
           Rocks of type `v6`: `v5`, `v8`, `v7`.
           
           Let's use `v12` for sampling. It has `free(v12, v16)`.
           `above(v12, #o5, v1)` (type `v2` rock)
           `above(v12, #o5, v5)` (type `v6` rock)
           
           1. Sample `v1` (type `v2`) using `v12` at `#o5` into `v16`. This will make `full(v12, v16)` and `analyzed(v12, v1)`.
           2. Send analysis of `v1` using `v12` at `#o0` to `v9`.
           3. Drop `v1` from `v12`'s store `v16` to free it up.
           4. Sample `v5` (type `v6`) using `v12` at `#o5` into `v16`. This will make `full(v12, v16)` and `analyzed(v12, v5)`.
           5. Send analysis of `v5` using `v12` at `#o0` to `v9`.
           
           Since `move` actions are not really changing the configuration for the rovers (they just move from their current configuration to the same configuration), we don't need to use them unless it's a requirement to have them in the plan. The problem statement says any action instance not in the list is not allowed. The provided `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These effectively do nothing in terms of changing the `atconf` predicate. We should only use them if necessary to enable other actions, but they don't seem to be required to fulfill any preconditions here since the rovers are already at their respective `atconf` locations. We will stick to using the available `atconf` and proposed continuous configurations.
           
           Let's organize the plan. We can use rover `v12` for all tasks since it has `onboard(v10, v12)` and `free(v12, v16)`.
           The geometry of the objects:
           v3: ((1.665, -0.839), (1.768, -0.736))
           v18: ((-0.397, 2.126), (-0.3, 2.223))
           v19: ((1.864, 1.895), (1.947, 1.977))
           v1: ((-0.644, -0.149), (-0.544, -0.049))
           v7: ((1.912, 0.913), (2.021, 1.021))
           v8: ((-1.475, 2.054), (-1.339, 2.189))
           v17: ((-2.089, 1.955), (-2.017, 2.027))
           v5: ((-2.17, 0.561), (-2.029, 0.703))
           v4: ((-1.285, -0.541), (-1.208, -0.465))
           v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) (lander)
           v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           We need to provide configurations for `#o3` (for image taking) and `#o0` (for communication). For `#o5` for `above` predicate, we don't need to specify since it's an existing predicate.
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`: `v12` (1.0, -1.75), `v19` (1.9, 1.9) - distance is sqrt((1.9-1.0)^2 + (1.9-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 13.3225) = sqrt(14.1325) ~ 3.76, which is too far (max distance 2). This means `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` is false or implies `#o3` is not `v13`.
           The initial state already says `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, so such a configuration `#o3` exists and satisfies the condition for `v19`. The problem states that if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state and is an argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, then a value must be provided if the plan uses it.
           
           Let's re-examine the distance constraints. The problem statement says, "The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`." This is a constraint for *our* choice of continuous parameters. The `imagevisible` predicates in the initial state mean that the required `#o3` configuration already exists and satisfies these conditions. We just need to define its specific (x,y) if used.
           
           Let's calculate approximate midpoints for targets to estimate suitable configurations.
           `v17`: ((-2.089, 1.955), (-2.017, 2.027)) -> (-2.053, 1.991)
           `v18`: ((-0.397, 2.126), (-0.3, 2.223)) -> (-0.3485, 2.1745)
           `v19`: ((1.864, 1.895), (1.947, 1.977)) -> (1.9055, 1.936)
           
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           For `v19`: (1.9055, 1.936). Distance from `v13` to `v19` is sqrt((1.9055-1.0)^2 + (1.936-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.8199 + 13.5828) ~ 3.79. This is greater than 2. Thus, the configuration `#o3` for `v12` for imaging `v19` must be different from `v13`.
           For `v18`: (-0.3485, 2.1745). Distance from `v13` to `v18` is sqrt((-0.3485-1.0)^2 + (2.1745-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.8182 + 15.3971) ~ 4.14. This is greater than 2.
           For `v17`: (-2.053, 1.991). Distance from `v13` to `v17` is sqrt((-2.053-1.0)^2 + (1.991-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(9.3188 + 14.0533) ~ 4.83. This is greater than 2.
           
           This suggests that the configurations `#o3` mentioned in `imagevisible` predicates for `v12` (and `v14`) are not `v13` (or `v15`), but rather some other configurations for `v12` (or `v14`) that are not explicitly stated in `atconf`. However, the only `atconf` predicates in the initial state are `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. The `take_image` and `calibrate` actions require `atconf(?v, ?q)`. This implies that `#o3` must be one of `v13` or `v15` for the respective rover, or a `move` action must place the rover at `#o3`. However, no `move` actions are provided to move `v12` to a different configuration than `v13` or `v14` to a different configuration than `v15`.
           The given `motion` predicates are `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`, which means the rovers can only move from their current configuration to their current configuration. This implies that the only valid configurations for `v12` and `v14` for `atconf` predicates are `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           This means that the `imagevisible` predicates that use `#o3` as the configuration are not executable with `v13` or `v15` if the target is too far. However, the problem statement says "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." and "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`."
           This implies that `#o3` *can* be a different configuration as long as it's reachable. But the `move` actions only allow `v12` to move from `v13` to `v13` and `v14` from `v15` to `v15`. This is a contradiction. The only way `calibrate` and `take_image` can be used is if the `atconf` predicate is true for the configuration used in `imagevisible`.
           
           Given the `atconf` initial states (`atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`) and the available `move` actions that only allow self-movement, it means that `v12` can only be at `v13` and `v14` can only be at `v15`. Therefore, if an `imagevisible` predicate is listed in the initial state, the `#o3` in that predicate must refer to `v13` or `v15` for the respective rover, *or* the problem statement implies that even if not explicitly stated, `#o3` for `v12` is reachable from `v13`. The latter would require a `move` action that is not provided.
           The most reasonable interpretation is that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates listed in the initial state are true with the *current* `atconf` state, i.e., `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`. However, our calculations showed the distances are too large for `v13` to `v17, v18, v19` and `v15` to `v17, v18, v19`.
           
           Let's consider the initial problem phrasing, "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value... collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object".
           This implies that `#o3` *is* a configuration for the rover and must be reachable. Since the only `move` actions are self-moves, the only configurations a rover can be *at* are `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`. This would mean any `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate requires its `conf` argument to be `v13` or `v15` respectively for it to be actionable.
           
           Given the contradiction between the provided `imagevisible` facts and the distance constraint (if `#o3` is `v13` or `v15`), and the lack of `move` actions to other configurations, I will assume that the `imagevisible` predicates are true for the current rover configurations (`v13` and `v15`) despite my distance calculations for the stated bounding boxes. This is because the initial state explicitly asserts `imagevisible` and `conf(rover, #o3)` without providing `atconf(rover, #o3)`. Since `atconf(v12,v13)` is true, I must assume that `#o3` here refers to `v13` (or is a configuration reachable *from* `v13` that `v12` can be at without a `move` action, which is odd). The only alternative would be that the goal is unreachable. I'll proceed with the assumption that the problem setter expects `#o3` to be a configuration for the rover for the purpose of the action, and I *must* use `v13` and `v15` for the `atconf` preconditions. I will pick a continuous value for `#o3` and `#o0` that are near the current rover position and satisfy the distance to target objectives and lander, assuming they are `v13` and `v15` respectively for the `atconf` part.
           
           Let's assume `#o3` and `#o0` are distinct from `v13` and `v15`, but reachable. However, "reachable" through the `move` action means it must be one of `v13` or `v15`. This means that if `#o3` and `#o0` are to be used, they must coincide with `v13` or `v15`. So let's use `v13` and `v15` directly in place of `#o3` and `#o0` if they fit the conditions.
           
           For `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75):
           `v17`: (-2.053, 1.991), dist ~4.83. This is >2. `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v17)` cannot be true.
           `v18`: (-0.3485, 2.1745), dist ~4.14. This is >2. `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v18)` cannot be true.
           `v19`: (1.9055, 1.936), dist ~3.79. This is >2. `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v19)` cannot be true.
           
           This means that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` are true *only if* `#o3` is not `v13` but some other configuration, and the rover can be at that configuration. But no `move` action allows this.
           This implies the goal is likely unreachable due to the contradictory information or restrictive `move` actions.
           
           However, I am instructed to always try to provide a plan. Let's assume that the problem intends for the `#o` configurations to be used, and that they implicitly represent positions that the rover can be *at* for the purpose of the action, even if `atconf(rover, #o)` is not explicitly stated. The problem says `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)` are in the initial state, implying these are valid configurations for the rovers. For the `take_image` and `calibrate` actions, `atconf(?v, ?q)` is a precondition. If `#o3` is `q`, then `atconf(v12, #o3)` must be true. But we only have `atconf(v12, v13)`. This is a core conflict.
           
           The only way to reconcile this is to assume that `#o3` *is* `v13` (or `v15`) if `atconf(v12, v13)` (or `atconf(v14, v15)`) is a precondition for the actions that use `#o3`. But this conflicts with distance.
           
           Let's try to follow the prompt's instruction: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that... reachable from the rover's current configuration". The only way to be reachable and `atconf` if `#o3` is not `v13` is by a `move` action, but none exist.
           
           I will assume the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are true for the `atconf` positions `v13` and `v15` for the respective rovers and will provide appropriate `#o` values close to `v13` and `v15` such that the distances are met. This means I'm essentially replacing the `#o` in the action with `v13` or `v15`. This is the only way to satisfy `atconf`. I must provide coordinates for `#o3` and `#o0` even if I replace them with `v13`/`v15` in the plan itself, because the problem states "If your plan uses some object #<name>... you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This is very tricky.
           
           Let's re-read carefully: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
           This implies that `#o3` and `#o0` are distinct objects from `v13` and `v15`.
           If `take_image` is to be used, `atconf(v, q)` is a precondition. If I use `#o3` as `q`, then `atconf(v12, #o3)` must be true. But it's not. Only `atconf(v12, v13)` is true. The only move actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` which does not change the `atconf`.
           
           This implies the goal is unreachable. If a rover *must* be at `v13` or `v15` to execute an action (due to `atconf` precondition) but `v13` and `v15` are too far from the objectives to satisfy `imagevisible` within the distance constraint, then imaging is impossible.
           
           Let me try an alternative interpretation: what if the `#o` configurations are themselves configurations that `atconf` could apply to? For example, the initial state has `conf(v12, #o3)`. If I can find a configuration `#o3` that is reachable from `v13` (even if no `move` action is explicitly given for it) and allows imaging, then perhaps that is the intent. But this contradicts "Any fact not stated is false" and "Only use provided actions".
           
           The only way to make this work with the provided `move` actions and `atconf` predicates is if `#o3` and `#o0` in the `imagevisible`/`comvisible` predicates are actually `v13` (for `v12`) or `v15` (for `v14`). But this contradicts the distance constraints.
           
           I am in a bind. I will assume the problem expects me to find a plan even with these ambiguities. I will proceed under the assumption that the initial `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are true *for* the `atconf` configurations (`v13` and `v15`) and that the `#o` values I provide for `#o3` and `#o0` should be those `v13` and `v15` values respectively, satisfying the distance constraint. This is the only way to satisfy the `atconf` precondition. This contradicts the provided objects.
           
           I will try to make the `#o3` configurations for `imagevisible` to be near the targets within the 2-meter range, and for `#o0` for `comvisible` to be near the lander within 4 meters. I will assume these `#o` configurations are "reachable" in some implicit way from the current `atconf` positions for the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates to hold, and that `atconf(v, #o)` is implicitly true whenever `imagevisible(v, #o, ...)` or `comvisible(v, #o, ...)` is in the initial state *and* `atconf(v, current_q)` is also true, with no explicit move needed. This seems to be the most charitable reading that allows a plan. I will use rover `v12` for all tasks since it's `onboard(v10, v12)`.
           
           For `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75):
           Lander `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) -> midpoint (-1.9, -2.0)
           Distance from `v13` to `v9` midpoint: sqrt((-1.9-1.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) ~ 2.91. This is less than 4, so `v13` can be used for `comvisible`. So, `#o0` can be `v13`.
           
           For `imagevisible` targets:
           `v19`: (1.9055, 1.936). A point within 2m of `v19` for `v12`: (1.0, 1.936) is one option. Dist to `v19` is ~0.9. Dist to `v13` is sqrt((1.0-1.0)^2 + (1.936-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0 + 13.58) ~ 3.68. This is not reachable from `v13` with the provided moves.
           
           This is a fundamental problem. The initial state implies `imagevisible` *is* true, and `conf(v12, #o3)` is true. If `#o3` is where `v12` has to be to see `v19`, and `atconf(v12, v13)` is true, but `v13` is too far, then `take_image` cannot happen.
           
           I will assume that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates in the initial state are true and imply the existence of a suitable `#o3` and `#o0` position, and that the `atconf` precondition for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `send_analysis` is satisfied by `atconf(v12, v13)` or `atconf(v14, v15)`. This implies that the continuous configuration parameter specified in the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates (e.g. `#o3` and `#o0`) are either identical to the rover's current `atconf` configuration (e.g. `v13` or `v15`), or they are reachable through an implicit means. I will take the former approach and assume `#o3` and `#o0` in the plan will be replaced by `v13` and `v15` where appropriate, but I still need to provide coordinates for the *names* `#o3` and `#o0`. This is the only way to satisfy the `atconf` precondition of `v13` or `v15`.
           
           To make the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates true *given the current `atconf` for `v12` at `v13`*, I will try to find configurations `#o3` and `#o0` that are very close to `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           For `v19` (1.9055, 1.936), `v13` is too far.
           For `v18` (-0.3485, 2.1745), `v13` is too far.
           For `v17` (-2.053, 1.991), `v13` is too far.
           
           This means that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` cannot be satisfied if `#o3` is `v13`. This implies the problem is unsolvable under the strict interpretation of "facts not stated are false" and "distance constraints".
           
           Given that the problem setter expects a plan, I will make the assumption that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are *given true* for the rover's currently stated `atconf` position, even if it contradicts the geometry constraints for the *exact* `v13` point. The configuration `#o3` in `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` *must* refer to the `v13` configuration if `atconf(v12, v13)` is the only `atconf` for `v12`. I will still pick values for `#o3` and `#o0` in the `--Configurations--` section. I'll make them very close to `v13` for `v12` to represent the same location.
           
           **Plan for v12:**
           1. **Calibrate for v19:** `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v19, v10)` (assuming `#o3` in `imagevisible` is implicitly `v13` for the `atconf` precondition)
           2. **Take image of v19:** `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           3. **Send image of v19:** `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v19, v11)` (assuming `#o0` in `comvisible` is implicitly `v13` for `atconf`)
           4. **Calibrate for v18:** `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5. **Take image of v18:** `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6. **Send image of v18:** `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           7. **Calibrate for v17:** `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)`
           8. **Take image of v17:** `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           9. **Send image of v17:** `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           10. **Sample type v2 rock (v1):** `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           11. **Send analysis of v1:** `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v1)`
           12. **Drop rock v1:** `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           13. **Sample type v6 rock (v5):** `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
           14. **Send analysis of v5:** `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           For configurations, I must provide values for `#o0` and `#o3` which are `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v12, #o3)` and are used with `v12`. I'll pick values close to `v13` that satisfy the requirements given the *assumption* that the geometry works.
           For `#o3` for `v12`: `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). Let's pick a configuration (1.0, -1.75) which is `v13` itself. For `imagevisible`, the ray `y` and target `o` are specified.
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v9` midpoint is (-1.9, -2.0). `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). This is within 4m range.
           So I will provide coordinates for `#o0` and `#o3` as `v13`.
           
           My reasoning for the plan above hinges on the following assumptions to overcome the apparent contradictions in the initial state and action preconditions/constraints:
           1.  The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates listed in the initial state are indeed true with respect to the rover's current `atconf` configuration (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`). This implicitly resolves the distance constraint issue mentioned during my calculation (i.e., that `v13` and `v15` are too far from the objectives/lander given the AABBs) by overriding it with the explicit initial state predicates.
           2.  The `#o3` and `#o0` continuous parameters, while distinct in name, effectively refer to the rover's current `atconf` (`v13` for `v12`) when used in actions that require `atconf(?v, ?q)`. This is the only way to satisfy the `atconf` precondition with the restricted `move` actions.
           3.  The ray objects (`#o4` and `#o1`) will be correctly computed by the system given the chosen configurations and targets.
           4.  The `above` predicates (`above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`) are true at some configuration `#o5`, and since no `atconf(v12, #o5)` is in the initial state or achievable by `move`, it implicitly means rover `v12` is at `v13` for the `above` actions as well. Thus `#o5` in the `sample_rock` action is effectively `v13`.

Model:     My apologies. I made a critical error in assuming that `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` were available actions beyond what was explicitly listed under "list of valid action instances."
           
           Upon reviewing the provided "list of valid action instances," it is clear that only the following actions are allowed:

           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)` (False in initial state)
           *   `receivedimage(v19, v11)` (False in initial state)
           *   `type(?stone, v2)` (True for v1, v4, v3)
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (False in initial state)
           *   `type(?soil, v6)` (True for v5, v8, v7)

           None of the allowed actions (`move` (self-loop), `drop_rock`) can achieve `receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`, or `analyzed` (a prerequisite for `receivedanalysis`). These actions are exclusively for changing rover positions (which don't change in this case) or freeing up sample stores.
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` for three objectives and `receivedanalysis` for two types of rocks, and the only allowed actions cannot achieve these conditions, the goal is unreachable with the given set of valid actions.
