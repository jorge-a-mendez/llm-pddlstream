User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.129, -0.335), (0.224, -0.24)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.104, -0.474), (-0.005, -0.375)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.077, 0.471), (0.17, 0.564)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.152, 0.463), (-0.064, 0.551)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.235, -0.574), (-0.14, -0.479)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.176, -0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.244, 0.97).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.054, -0.425, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.917, 0.399).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.124, 0.517, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, -0.215).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.108, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.807, 0.591).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.188, -0.526, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.51, 0.86).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable with Provided Constraints**
           
           As an expert in this field, I've analyzed the problem thoroughly. My task is to devise a plan to move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a small surface (v20) given the initial state and available actions. The challenge, however, immediately presents itself: the *strict* limitations imposed by the provided action instances.
           
           My analysis begins by understanding the goal: to establish `on(?o, v20)` for each object. This means ensuring that each object is both at a specific pose and supported by the surface v20.  Examining the initial state reveals the objects are supported on surface v11 and have their respective poses.  
           
           The crux of the issue lies in the allowable actions.  The only permitted action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This action merely allows the robot base to move (in a null motion, in this case) and, critically, *does not* facilitate any manipulation of the objects themselves.  I see I can provide values for the continuous parameters (#o0, #o1, #o2).  However, the core functionality required for this task – *picking* objects from v11 and *placing* them on v20 – is absent.
           
           The provided "valid action instances" are the *only* actions allowed. Therefore, I can't use actions like `pick` or `place`. I can only use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. However, this only allows the robot to move from v3 to v3 (staying at the same base configuration and table position) and has no impact on the objects' poses or support relationships.  
           
           The implication is clear: with only this restricted action, the goal is *impossible* to achieve.  No combination of allowed actions can transform the initial state to the desired goal state. The prompt states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Therefore, I must conclude that, given the constraints, the goal is unreachable.
