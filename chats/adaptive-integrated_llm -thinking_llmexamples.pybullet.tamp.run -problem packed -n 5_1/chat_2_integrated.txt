           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.129, -0.335), (0.224, -0.24)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.104, -0.474), (-0.005, -0.375)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.077, 0.471), (0.17, 0.564)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.152, 0.463), (-0.064, 0.551)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.235, -0.574), (-0.14, -0.479)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.176, -0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.244, 0.97).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.054, -0.425, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.917, 0.399).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.124, 0.517, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, -0.215).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.108, 0.507, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.807, 0.591).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.188, -0.526, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.51, 0.86).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Challenge: Orchestrating a Precise Object Transfer**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their initial positions on surface v11 to a new surface, v20. The current situation is straightforward: all objects are supported by v11, and my objective is to have them all on v20.
           
           The plan must utilize a robot arm (v4) to pick each object from its current location, grasp it, and place it precisely onto v20.  Crucially, the problem statement instructs me to provide distinct "pose" values starting with '#' for each object, even if they share the same physical destination (v20). I need to ensure the robot arm can maneuver freely between each pick and place operation.
           
           This involves:
           
           1.  **Defining the Path:** Move objects one by one, picking them up from their starting positions and carefully placing them onto the target surface, v20. The challenge is ensuring each object has its own unique placement coordinates on v20.
           2.  **Continuous Value Generation:** Identifying suitable coordinates for each object's placement on v20. I'll need to compute distinct coordinates in the form of `#o2` for all objects on `v20`. The poses on the table are specified as well, so I need to choose them wisely.
           
           I will begin by planning a series of "pick" and "place" actions. These actions will utilize the robot arm (v4), grasping each object with a generic grasp and utilizing the base configuration `#o3` (which is needed to ensure the robot arm can move appropriately), trajectory `#o4`, and grasp `#o1`. Since I am given the `basemotion` predicate, I will include it. I will generate a valid trajectory from moving base `v3` to configuration `#o3`.
           
           *   I must ensure that the robot's base configuration (#o3) is appropriately configured prior to all pick and place operations, given that this action may not have been predefined.
           *   Once this is met, I will proceed to pick up each object and carefully place it in its respective pose on the target surface, and confirm that each object has arrived at its final destination. I have designed the poses on surface v20 to be distinct and appropriate for this set of objects.
           *   After ensuring all objects are appropriately placed, I will confirm my work and acknowledge I have met the defined goals.
