               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get these four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, all stacked on `v18`. I've got a good handle on the initial state: the objects are currently resting on `v11`, and I know which objects can be stacked on which surfaces. Critically, I have information about potential poses on `v18` for all the target objects. This looks promising.
           
           Now, let's consider the actions I can take. I've got `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` at my disposal. Looking closely at the provided "valid action instances," I see only one entry: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is problematic.
           
           This effectively limits me to a single, trivial base motion – staying put. I'm unable to execute any `pick` or `place` actions because no specific instances are provided for them. This means I'm stuck with the robot's current pose.
           
           The goal, however, necessitates moving objects. I need to lift each object off `v11` and place it on `v18`. This requires a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. Without valid instances of these actions, there's simply no way to achieve the goal state.
           
           In short, based on the constraints provided, the goal is **unachievable**. The available actions are insufficient to modify the current configuration and fulfill the requirement of moving the objects onto `v18`. I need at least `pick` and `place` action instances to succeed.
