(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 7) on a square surface (AABB `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`).  The object has dimensions of (0.0932, 0.0932). Stability, in this context, means the object must be entirely contained within the surface, regardless of its rotation.
           
           Since the object is square, the effective bounding box changes with rotation, and its safe, minimal, containment extents will be a function of `theta`.  To calculate the effective half-extents, I leverage the formula: `eff_H = half_size * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This is the distance from the center of the object to the edge of the rotated AABB.  By understanding the changing extents of the rotating bounding box, I can calculate the valid range for *x* and *y* coordinates for the object's center.
           
           To ensure stability for *any* rotation, I utilize the *maximum* possible effective half-extent (which occurs at 45 degrees,  `0.06593922336829705` in my calculations), and then for any theta, calculate the valid *x* and *y* ranges. These are computed as: `x_min_valid = surface_min_x + eff_H` and `x_max_valid = surface_max_x - eff_H`, and `y_min_valid = surface_min_y + eff_H` and `y_max_valid = surface_max_y - eff_H` respectively. Using this calculated extent as a margin from the surface edges, I then systematically generate sets of `(x, y, theta)` configurations.  The distribution of these configurations uses several angles evenly spread from 0 to 7pi/8 as input to the aforementioned formulae.
           
           The strategy calculates a grid of (x,y) coordinates within this valid range for each `theta`.  I've tuned the approach to generate x and y positions in a grid based on sqrt(points to generate) to have even distribution within the valid ranges.  The goal is a good distribution of placements. Then by iterating though the calculated x,y,theta combinations, I generated the 50 desired stable placements for the object.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on finding 50 stable placements for object ID 8 while avoiding collisions with the existing object ID 7 on surface 0. My main concern is to generate these placements quickly and efficiently, given the known parameters of the objects and the surface.
           
           First, I established the surface boundaries for object 8, ensuring it remains stable. Then, I took the data about the previously placed object, ID 7. Its size and placement were crucial because I needed to avoid any overlap between object 8 and object 7. I calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object 7, which effectively creates a no-go zone. Given that object 7 is a rectangular shape, finding the AABB is straightforward.
           
           Next, I calculated the effective bounding box of Object 8 for each given angle of rotation using the formula for the rotated bounding box. I’ve decided to iterate through a range of angles, knowing that a square object requires special consideration of the rotation’s influence on the bounding box.  I considered a grid search strategy, considering both the surface restrictions and the collision with object 7, taking care to check for collisions effectively at each point in the range. The range of valid center coordinates (x, y) for object 8 depends on the angle and ensuring that the AABB is completely contained within the surface’s bounds.
           Since the bounding box of object 7 is fixed, I will determine the region occupied by object 7. The code checks for AABB overlap, using a clear set of logical AND conditions that check for overlap along each axis.
           I designed a routine to generate a candidate set of placements and filtered out the placements based on collisions with object 7, the existing object.
           If the desired number of stable placements is not met, I’ll try using a denser grid, more angles to account for the free area on the surface.
           With these enhancements, the objective is to ensure that a diverse set of collision-free placements can be determined on the given surface.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem.** My task is to find 50 stable positions for object ID 5 on surface 0, while carefully avoiding any collisions with objects ID 7 and ID 8 that are already placed.
           
           **Here's the setup:** Surface 0 is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 5 is a square object. Its size is `0.0980543790653707` units, so its half-extent (`H5`) is approximately `0.049`. Object 7 is positioned at `(-0.088, -0.088)` with a size close to Object 5. Object 8 is at `(-0.099, 0.059)` and is a bit smaller.
           
           **My Approach:** I'll use a standard AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection strategy, combined with a rotational approach.
           
           1.  **Rotation and Effective Half-Extent:** For various orientations (theta), I'll calculate the "effective half-extent" (`eff_H5`) of Object 5. At `theta=0`, `eff_H5` equals the plain `H5`, but with other angles, it grows.
           2.  **Valid Placement Region:** With `eff_H5` I calculate the valid *x* and *y* range on surface 0, where object 5 can be placed without extending beyond the bounds.
           3.  **Grid Search:** Within the valid range, I'll set up a grid of potential placement positions.
           4.  **Collision Checks:** For each grid point, I'll compute object 5's AABB for collision with object 7 and object 8. These AABBs have been pre-calculated based on data. Two AABBs collide if the horizontal and vertical intervals intersect.
           5.  **Placement Validation and Iteration:** If there's no collision, I'll store the placement coordinates (`0`, `theta`, `x`, `y`) into the `placements` array, and keep going. When I have accumulated 50, I'm done.
           
           **Calculations & Refinements:**
           1.  I have double-checked the AABBs for object 7 and object 8 to avoid errors. Object 7 has the region `[-0.135, -0.042] x [-0.135, -0.042]`. Object 8 uses `[-0.135, -0.063] x [0.023, 0.095]`. I will create a refined 6x6 (36) candidate placements per angle from 0 to `7pi/8`. That gives a total of 288 candidates. I'm confident this will find 50.
           2.  I will handle floating-point edge cases, ensuring the grid is created correctly.
           
           **The output of these steps will be a list of 50 collision-free placements on surface 0.**

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, my primary objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) with a side length of approximately 0.0934.  I need to fit these on surface 0, which is a square area from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.  The challenge, of course, is avoiding collisions with objects already in place: Object 7, Object 8, and Object 5.
           
           First, I need to account for the object's dimensions and any rotation.  I've got the half-side length, and I know that rotating the object will change the effective half-extents. I plan to check a variety of angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, etc.) to consider all possible orientations.  For each angle, I calculate the effective half-extents, and then I determine the valid range for the center of object 4 to be placed without going off the surface.
           
           Now, I'm going to set up my collision detection. I've already determined the bounding boxes (AABBs) for objects 7, 8, and 5. I will build an AABB for object 4 based on its center (x, y) and its effective half-extents, comparing it to the AABBs of the other objects to verify there are no overlaps.  I've defined a clear overlapping condition (where the min x and y of one AABB are less than the max x and y of the other and vice-versa).
           
           The calculation will begin by testing `theta=0`, which results in the smallest possible placement area.  With that, I'm considering using a 6x6 grid in the range `[-0.08829300802562589, 0.08829300802562589]` for both x and y.
           
           Finally, I will iterate through the various angles and candidate points within the valid surface range to identify suitable, collision-free placements, collecting a minimum of 50. My focus here will be on areas free from existing objects – specifically, the right side and bottom-right region, and potentially the area below object 5.

(Thoughts: **My Current Thought Process for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to place Object ID 6 onto Surface 0, ensuring I have 50 stable placements and avoid collisions with objects 4, 5, 7, and 8.  I'm dealing with a square object (`size_x = size_y = 0.075`) and a bounded surface (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`).

I need to take into account that rotation affects how much space an object occupies.
           
           I'll be using a discrete set of rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, 5pi/8, 3pi/4, and 7pi/8.
           
           I'll pre-calculate the "effective" half-size of the object ( `eff_H6`) for each angle to get the valid center range. At 0 and pi/2, it's just half the side length, about 0.037. At pi/4, it's about 0.053 (the biggest AABB possible).
           
           To cover the surface systematically, I'm going to create a 5x5 grid of potential placements for each rotation. I'll define ranges for X and Y, and sample with a spacing of `H6`, generating candidate (x, y) coordinates for each rotation.
           
           Then, for each candidate placement (x, y) and rotation theta, I'll calculate the axis-aligned bounding box of Object 6.  I'll check for any collisions with the existing AABBs to prevent any intersection.
           
           I've manually checked a small portion of the possible placements at 0 radians. This verifies the logic and will be helpful in the implementation. If all goes as planned, I should easily find 50 stable placements, given 200 possible choices.

Model:     **My Current Thought Process for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to place Object ID 6 onto Surface 0, ensuring I have 50 stable placements and avoid collisions with objects 4, 5, 7, and 8.  I'm dealing with a square object (`size_x = size_y = 0.075`) and a bounded surface (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`).
