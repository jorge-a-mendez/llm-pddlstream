           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got object ID 10, a square with dimensions ~0.073x0.073, and I need to find 50 stable placements on surface 0, which is defined by the bounding box ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Since this is a fresh request with no prior knowledge of collisions or other objects, it's a straightforward spatial reasoning problem.
           
           The object's square shape is key here. Because the object is a square, its bounding box (AABB) won't change with rotation.  Therefore, I can fix the rotation to theta=0 (no rotation). This simplifies the problem significantly.
           
           First, I need to figure out the *valid* placement area on the surface. That means the object's AABB has to fit entirely within the surface's bounding box.  I need to calculate the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates for the *object's center* that allow this. I start by calculating the object's half-size for both X and Y (about 0.0367).
           
           The surface's available dimensions are: 0.6 in both width and height.
           
           I can then calculate the valid range for the object's center:
           *   `x_min`: Surface's lower X + object's half-width = 4.2 + 0.0367 = 4.2367
           *   `x_max`: Surface's upper X - object's half-width = 4.8 - 0.0367 = 4.7633
           *   `y_min`: Surface's lower Y + object's half-height = -0.6 + 0.0367 = -0.5633
           *   `y_max`: Surface's upper Y - object's half-height = 0.0 - 0.0367 = -0.0367
           
           This gives me the rectangular area where the object's center can be.
           
           Now, I'll generate a grid of 50 placements within this valid range. I could also vary the rotation, but for a square, it doesn't change the outcome, so I'll keep it simple at `theta = 0`.  A 7x8 grid (49 + extra row = 56) will be sufficient to provide a good spread and exceed the requested 50, then I'll just trim the list.
           
           The x and y coordinates will be calculated with equal spacing. I need to make sure to generate enough points within the surface space to make the 50 placements.
           
           The x-coordinate is calculated with 7 divisions on 0.5265, and y-coordinate is calculated with 8 divisions on 0.5265.
           
           I'll iterate through this grid and select the first 50 positions, creating a list of (surface_index, theta, x, y) tuples.  This list will be my final result. I'll make sure to double-check that the coordinates I calculated are correct before returning the list.
