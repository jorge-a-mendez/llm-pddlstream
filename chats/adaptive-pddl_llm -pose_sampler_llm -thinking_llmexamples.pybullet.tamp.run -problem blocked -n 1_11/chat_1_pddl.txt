(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy a New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this problem. The goal is to make `new-axiom@0()` true, which means I need to get an object, let's call it `?green`, to be both *on* something (`v18`) and of a certain *type* (`v17`). The initial state gives me two objects that could be `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. Since they're both of the right type, I'm going to focus on getting one of them *on* `v18`.
           
           To be *on* something means it needs to be *at a pose* and *supported* in that pose.  The initial state already tells me that both `v8` and `v12` *can* be supported by `v18` - so they can *get* into the necessary configuration!  I'm going to choose `v12` as my target, since either will work.
           
           Now, to get `v12` *on* `v18`, I need to pick it up and place it. I'm going to need to reach a state where `atpose(v12, #o2)` and  `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` which will make `on(v12, v18)` true. It's already supported, I just need to reach the pose!
           
           To do this, I need to execute `pick` and `place` actions, since those are how I move objects.  The robot arm `v4` and `v3` are the relevant parts. I already have all the *kinematics* information from `kin` predicates to tell the system *how* to do these actions, and it looks like `v13` and `#o2` are the relevant poses, while `#o1` are my grasping parameters. The continuous planner will use these to figure out valid trajectories.
           
           My initial state tells me `atpose(v12, v13)` and from all the `kin` facts, it looks like a sequence:
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: The system is now *in state* `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` which means I have the object.
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: The system will then *reach the new pose* and will now have `atpose(v12, #o2)` and satisfy `on(v12, v18)`
           The continuous solver finds the exact trajectories to grasp and release `v12`!  The system should take care of these `#oX` continuous parameters.
           
           The only "valid action instance" I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It's a bit of a head-scratcher why this is given, since it doesn't seem directly relevant to my plan to pick and place. However, it *does* have some interesting side effects: `~atbconf(v3)` and `~canmove()`. That means the system should be able to account for that.
           
           Finally, I just need to verify that my actions don't violate any preconditions. It *looks* like these `kin` predicates cover all the kinematics, and the system can handle the continuous parameters and state transitions!
           
           Therefore, the actions `pick` and `place` achieve `new-axiom@0()`, assuming that the continuous solver takes care of the `#oX` parameters. If that is done, I will have successfully achieved my goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Infeasible Goal with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out a problem: my previous plan used actions that weren't allowed.  Time to rethink everything. The only tool I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This *moves* the base, but doesn't *do* anything with objects.  The effects are basically a no-op except for negating `canmove()`.  Not very useful for this.
           
           The goal is to get `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having something green *on* v18.  That means I need both `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.  
           
           Now, I'm given some initial state information.  I know *types* of objects: v8 and v12 are type v17 (which I'm assuming is the green color).  I can see that v12 is *on* v14, supported by v13.  And v8 is on v11, supported by v9.  Crucially, both v8 and v12 have the *potential* to be on v18 because they're *supported* by #o2. To change the *atpose* of v8 or v12, I'd need to pick it up and then place it on v18. 
           
           But here's the catch: I can *only* use `move_base`.  This action does *nothing* to change the *atpose* of anything!  It can't pick up, it can't place.  It simply *moves* the base configuration.  Given the goal is reliant on `on` and, therefore, `atpose`, and the available action cannot change `atpose`, I have to conclude that **this goal is completely unachievable with the given constraints.**  I'm stuck.
