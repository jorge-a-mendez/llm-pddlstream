           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` which means:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` (which is true for v1, v3, v4) and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for these rocks
           - `type(?soil, v6)` (which is true for v5, v7, v8) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for these rocks
           
           From the initial state, we already have:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           
           So, we need to achieve:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis` for `v1`, `v3`, `v4` (stones)
           4. `receivedanalysis` for `v5`, `v7`, `v8` (soils)
           
           Let's break down the strategy for each of these:
           
           **For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
           This requires the sequence: `calibrate` -> `take_image` -> `send_image`.
           Both `v12` and `v14` can take images of `v17` and `v18` from configuration `#o3` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           They also can send images from configuration `#o0` to lander `v9`.
           
           **For `receivedanalysis` of rocks:**
           This requires the sequence: `sample_rock` -> `send_analysis`.
           Both `v12` and `v14` can sample rocks from configuration `#o5` into store `v16`.
           They can also send analysis from configuration `#o0` to lander `v9`.
           
           Given the objects and actions, we need to carefully sequence them to achieve all goals. We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and one store `v16`. Each rover can only hold one sample at a time (since `sample_rock` makes the store `full` and `drop_rock` makes it `free`). However, the `analyzed` predicate is specific to the rover and the rock. The `receivedanalysis` predicate is independent of the rover. This means we can sample a rock with `v12`, send its analysis, then sample another with `v12`. Or, we can use both rovers simultaneously.
           
           Let's assign tasks to rovers to avoid unnecessary movements:
           
           **Rover v12:**
           - Calibrate, take and send image for `v17`
           - Calibrate, take and send image for `v18`
           - Sample and send analysis for `v1` (stone)
           - Sample and send analysis for `v3` (stone)
           - Sample and send analysis for `v4` (stone)
           - Sample and send analysis for `v5` (soil)
           - Sample and send analysis for `v7` (soil)
           - Sample and send analysis for `v8` (soil)
           
           This seems like a lot for one rover to do, considering it has only one store `v16`. Let's distribute the tasks between the two rovers.
           
           Both rovers are at `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           Image taking and sending involves configurations `#o3` and `#o0`.
           Rock sampling involves configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use `v12` for imaging and some rock analysis, and `v14` for the remaining rock analysis.
           
           **Rover v12 plan:**
           1. Move `v12` to `#o3` (for imaging).
           2. Calibrate `v10` for `v17`.
           3. Take image of `v17`.
           4. Calibrate `v10` for `v18`. (Camera becomes uncalibrated after `take_image`, so needs recalibration for the next image)
           5. Take image of `v18`.
           6. Move `v12` to `#o0` (for sending).
           7. Send image of `v17`.
           8. Send image of `v18`.
           9. Move `v12` to `#o5` (for sampling rocks).
           10. Sample `v1` (a stone).
           11. Move `v12` to `#o0` (to send analysis).
           12. Send analysis of `v1`.
           13. Move `v12` to `#o5`.
           14. Drop `v1` to free the store.
           15. Sample `v3` (a stone).
           16. Move `v12` to `#o0`.
           17. Send analysis of `v3`.
           18. Move `v12` to `#o5`.
           19. Drop `v3`.
           20. Sample `v4` (a stone).
           21. Move `v12` to `#o0`.
           22. Send analysis of `v4`.
           23. Move `v12` to `#o5`.
           24. Drop `v4`.
           
           **Rover v14 plan:**
           1. Move `v14` to `#o5` (for sampling rocks).
           2. Sample `v5` (a soil).
           3. Move `v14` to `#o0` (to send analysis).
           4. Send analysis of `v5`.
           5. Move `v14` to `#o5`.
           6. Drop `v5`.
           7. Sample `v7` (a soil).
           8. Move `v14` to `#o0`.
           9. Send analysis of `v7`.
           10. Move `v14` to `#o5`.
           11. Drop `v7`.
           12. Sample `v8` (a soil).
           13. Move `v14` to `#o0`.
           14. Send analysis of `v8`.
           15. Move `v14` to `#o5`.
           16. Drop `v8`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that the rovers are at their initial configurations (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`) AND stores are free (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`) at the *end* of the plan. So, after all operations, the rovers need to return to their initial configurations and drop any sampled rocks. The plan above already incorporates dropping rocks to ensure the store is free for the next sample, and ultimately for the final state.
           
           The initial states for rovers are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The final moves should take them back to these initial configurations.
           
           Let's refine the plan, making sure the rovers return to their initial configurations at the end. The axiom only requires `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` as part of the conjunction. The actions ensure `free` stores. We need to ensure the rovers are back at their home configurations.
           
           A note on configurations:
           - `#o3` is used for `imagevisible`.
           - `#o0` is used for `comvisible`.
           - `#o5` is used for `above`.
           
           The AABBs of the target objects for `imagevisible` (`v17`, `v18`) are:
           v17: ((-0.398, 2.146), (-0.307, 2.237))
           v18: ((0.568, 2.022), (0.656, 2.11))
           
           The AABB of the lander `v9` for `comvisible` is:
           v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           The AABBs of the rocks for `above`:
           v1: ((1.783, -0.625), (1.877, -0.531))
           v3: ((1.172, -0.14), (1.248, -0.063))
           v4: ((-0.404, 0.375), (-0.314, 0.465))
           v5: ((-1.845, -0.817), (-1.71, -0.682))
           v7: ((0.309, -2.113), (0.438, -1.985))
           v8: ((-1.523, 1.691), (-1.388, 1.827))
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`:
           `v17` is at `(-0.35, 2.19)`.
           `v18` is at `(0.61, 2.06)`.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           A good `#o3` for `v12` to see both `v17` and `v18` needs to be in a position where both are visible. For example, `(0.1, 0.1)`. Let's call this `#o3_for_v12_v17_v18`.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`:
           `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           A good `#o0` for `v12` to see `v9` would be `(-0.5, -2.0)`. Let's call this `#o0_for_v12_v9`.
           A good `#o0` for `v14` to see `v9` would be `(-1.0, -2.0)`. Let's call this `#o0_for_v14_v9`.
           
           For `above(v12, #o5, <rock>)` and `above(v14, #o5, <rock>)`:
           `#o5` needs to be near the rocks. Since we want to sample all rocks, and `v12` is closer to the rocks with positive X coordinates and `v14` is closer to rocks with negative X coordinates, we can assign `#o5` for `v12` to be near `v1, v3, v4, v7` and `#o5` for `v14` to be near `v5, v8`. Since `#o5` is a single configuration for each rover, we need to pick a central location for sampling. For example, for `v12`, near `(0.5, 0.0)`. For `v14`, near `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Let's pick a single `#o5` for each rover, which is a bit of a simplification as the problem states a generic `#o5` per rover. Let's assume a single `#o5` for both is the same, as per the initial state. The problem implies one `#o5` per rover, or one `#o5` that works for all given the context `above(v12, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v3)`. Let's assume the continuous parameter `#o5` is computed such that it allows the `above` predicate to be true for multiple rocks for a given rover.
           
           Let's pick a common `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17` and `v18`.
           Let's pick a common `#o0` for `v12` to see `v9`.
           Let's pick a common `#o5` for `v12` to be above multiple rocks.
           
           Same for `v14`. However, the current problem description uses the same `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o5` for both rovers. This means these continuous parameters must be chosen carefully to satisfy the needs of both rovers.
           
           If `#o3` is common, it must allow `v12` to see `v17` and `v18`, AND `v14` to see `v17` and `v18`. This is very restrictive.
           The same applies to `#o0` for `comvisible`.
           And `#o5` for `above`.
           
           Given the phrasing `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`, it seems `#o3` represents *a* configuration, not necessarily the *same* configuration value. However, the action instances use the exact same `#o3` object. This implies the same configuration value for both. This means `#o3` needs to be a point from where both `v12` and `v14` can see `v17` and `v18`, which is impossible for two different rovers simultaneously. This suggests an error in my interpretation of the problem.
           
           "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This means that even though `#o3` is listed as one object, in the `imagevisible` context, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` might imply a different configuration for `v12` than `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` for `v14`. This is a common pattern in PDDL. The continuous values section will resolve this ambiguity. I need to output distinct values for `#o3` for `v12` vs `v14`.
           
           Let's assume there are distinct values of `#o3` for `v12` for `v17` and `v18`, and for `v14` for `v17` and `v18`.
           But the available action instances just use `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)` and `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`. This implies a single value for `#o3` is sufficient to satisfy the predicate `imagevisible` for all combinations. This is very unlikely.
           
           Let's re-read the axiom:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The goal is to get *all* stones and *all* soils analyzed.
           Stones: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`
           Soils: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`
           
           **Rover v12 initial: `atconf(v12, v13)` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)**
           **Rover v14 initial: `atconf(v14, v15)` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)**
           
           Let's assign specific tasks to `v12` and `v14`.
           
           **Tasks for v12:**
           1. Image `v17` and `v18`.
           2. Analyze `v1` (stone), `v3` (stone), `v7` (soil).
           
           **Tasks for v14:**
           1. Analyze `v4` (stone), `v5` (soil), `v8` (soil).
           
           Now, let's determine the configurations for each rover.
           
           **For v12 (Imaging):**
           Target `v17` is at `(-0.35, 2.19)`. Target `v18` is at `(0.61, 2.06)`.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           A good `#o3` configuration for `v12` to image both `v17` and `v18` could be `(0.1, 0.1)`. Let's denote this as `#o3_v12`.
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`:
           Target `v9` (lander) is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           A good `#o0` configuration for `v12` to communicate with `v9` could be `(-0.5, -2.0)`. Let's denote this as `#o0_v12`.
           
           **For v12 (Sampling):**
           Rocks: `v1` (1.8, -0.58), `v3` (1.2, -0.1), `v7` (0.37, -2.0).
           A good `#o5` for `v12` to be above these rocks could be `(1.0, -0.5)`. Let's denote this as `#o5_v12`. This should be close enough to `v1, v3, v7` for `above` to be true for all of them.
           
           **For v14 (Sampling):**
           Rocks: `v4` (-0.35, 0.42), `v5` (-1.78, -0.75), `v8` (-1.45, 1.75).
           `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           A good `#o5` for `v14` to be above these rocks could be `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Let's denote this as `#o5_v14`.
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`:
           Target `v9` is around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           A good `#o0` configuration for `v14` to communicate with `v9` could be `(-1.0, -2.0)`. Let's denote this as `#o0_v14`.
           
           Since the problem uses the *same* `#o0, #o3, #o5` objects for both rovers in the action instances, I must choose a single continuous value for each of these. This implies the configurations are globally valid for both rovers, which is a very strong assumption, but I have to follow the provided action instances.
           
           This means:
           - `#o3` must allow `v12` to see `v17` and `v18`, AND `v14` to see `v17` and `v18`. This is impossible.
           - `#o0` must allow `v12` to see `v9`, AND `v14` to see `v9`.
           - `#o5` must allow `v12` to be above multiple rocks, AND `v14` to be above multiple rocks.
           
           Given the constraints, `imagevisible` and `comvisible` require line of sight. It's improbable that a single `#o3` configuration works for `v12` and `v14` to see `v17` and `v18` at the same time, or `v9` from `v12` and `v14`.
           
           However, the problem says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This means that I can provide different continuous values for `#o3` for `v12` and `v14`. So, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` will use a different `#o3` from `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, but they will both be named `#o3` in the plan. My output format is specifically designed for this.
           
           So, I will define different values for `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` for each rover/target pair as needed.
           
           Let's assume:
           - `#o3_v12_v17`: configuration for `v12` to see `v17`.
           - `#o3_v12_v18`: configuration for `v12` to see `v18`.
           - `#o3_v14_v17`: configuration for `v14` to see `v17`.
           - `#o3_v14_v18`: configuration for `v14` to see `v18`.
           
           Similarly for `#o0` and `#o5`. But the action instances only use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` without suffixes. This is the crucial part. The instruction states "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This means that when I *use* `#o3` in the plan, for example `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`, I am implicitly defining the value of `#o3` for `v12` and `v17`. If I then use `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`, I'm defining `#o3` for `v14` and `v17`. I need to make sure these values are consistent with the geometric constraints.
           
           Given the goal and actions, it seems more efficient to divide the work such that each rover does tasks in a localized area to minimize movement.
           
           **Rover v12 (initial at v13: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)) will primarily focus on imaging and rocks in its vicinity.**
           Rocks near v12: `v1` (1.8, -0.58), `v3` (1.2, -0.1), `v4` (-0.35, 0.42), `v7` (0.37, -2.0). `v4` is a bit further but still accessible.
           
           **Rover v14 (initial at v15: (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)) will primarily focus on rocks in its vicinity.**
           Rocks near v14: `v5` (-1.78, -0.75), `v8` (-1.45, 1.75). `v4` (-0.35, 0.42) is also closer to v14 than v12.
           
           Let's adjust task distribution:
           **v12:**
           1. Image `v17` and `v18`.
           2. Analyze `v1` (stone), `v3` (stone).
           
           **v14:**
           1. Analyze `v4` (stone), `v5` (soil), `v7` (soil), `v8` (soil). This is four rocks, `v14` has one store. This will require `sample -> send -> drop -> sample -> ...`.
           
           Let's start the plan.
           
           **Rover V12 Actions:**
           - Move to `#o3_v12_v17` for imaging `v17`.
           - Calibrate for `v17`.
           - Take image of `v17`.
           - Move to `#o3_v12_v18` for imaging `v18`. (Assuming `#o3_v12_v17` is different from `#o3_v12_v18`)
           - Calibrate for `v18`.
           - Take image of `v18`.
           - Move to `#o0_v12_v9` for sending images.

           - Drop rock.
           - Move back to `v13`.
           
           **Rover V14 Actions:**
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v4` for sampling `v4`.
           - Sample `v4`.
           - Move to `#o0_v14_v9` for sending analysis.
           - Send analysis `v4`.
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v4` to drop rock.
           - Drop rock.
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v5` for sampling `v5`.
           - Sample `v5`.
           - Move to `#o0_v14_v9` for sending analysis.
           - Send analysis `v5`.
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v5` to drop rock.
           - Drop rock.

           - Sample `v7`.
           - Move to `#o0_v14_v9` for sending analysis.
           - Send analysis `v7`.
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v7` to drop rock.
           - Drop rock.
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v8` for sampling `v8`.
           - Sample `v8`.
           - Move to `#o0_v14_v9` for sending analysis.
           - Send analysis `v8`.
           - Move to `#o5_v14_v8` to drop rock.
           - Drop rock.
           - Move back to `v15`.
           
           The "multiple different (rover, target object) pairs" clause is key. I will specify configurations per (rover, target) pair.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters are `conf_v12_img_v17`, `conf_v12_img_v18`, `conf_v12_com_v9`, `conf_v12_above_v1`, `conf_v12_above_v3`, `conf_v12_above_v4`, `conf_v12_above_v5`, `conf_v12_above_v7`, `conf_v12_above_v8`. Same for `v14`.
           This means `#o3` in `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` will refer to `conf_v12_img_v17`. But in the action list, `#o3` is a single object name.
           
           This is a critical contradiction. The given action instances use a single `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` for all contexts. If `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` implies a value for `#o3`, then `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` *must* use the same value for `#o3`, otherwise the action instance `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)` would be invalid.
           
           So, I am constrained to use *one* `#o3` for all imaging, *one* `#o0` for all communication, and *one* `#o5` for all sampling. This is highly restrictive from a geometric perspective.
           
           Let's re-examine the problem description for ambiguity. "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. ... If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           
           This paragraph implies I *must* provide different values. The conflict is with the provided valid action instances. However, the action instances only specify the *name* of the parameter. The *value* is what is being determined. So, I will use `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` in the plan and define their values specific to the (rover, target) pair as needed. This seems like the most reasonable interpretation.
           
           Let's define configurations.
           Rover `v12` start: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           Rover `v14` start: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           Lander `v9`: (-1.9, -2.0)
           `v17`: (-0.35, 2.19)
           `v18`: (0.61, 2.06)
           `v1`: (1.8, -0.58)
           `v3`: (1.2, -0.1)
           `v4`: (-0.35, 0.42)
           `v5`: (-1.78, -0.75)
           `v7`: (0.37, -2.0)
           `v8`: (-1.45, 1.75)
           
           **Configuration values:**
           - `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17`: `(0.1, 0.1)` (This is `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`)
           - `#o3` for `v12` to see `v18`: `(0.5, 0.1)` (This is `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`)
           - `#o0` for `v12` to see `v9`: `(-0.5, -2.0)` (This is `conf(v12, #o0)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`)
           - `#o5` for `v12` to be above `v1`: `(1.8, -0.58)`
           - `#o5` for `v12` to be above `v3`: `(1.2, -0.1)`
           - `#o5` for `v12` to be above `v7`: `(0.37, -2.0)`
           - `#o0` for `v14` to see `v9`: `(-1.0, -2.0)` (This is `conf(v14, #o0)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`)
           - `#o5` for `v14` to be above `v4`: `(-0.35, 0.42)`
           - `#o5` for `v14` to be above `v5`: `(-1.78, -0.75)`
           - `#o5` for `v14` to be above `v8`: `(-1.45, 1.75)`
           
           Now, the problem is about using the *same* `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` in the plan actions. This implies the actions might actually be:
           `(calibrate v12 #o3_for_v12_v17 #o4_for_v12_v17 v17 v10)` and `(calibrate v12 #o3_for_v12_v18 #o4_for_v12_v18 v18 v10)`.
           But the provided actions are literal, like `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`. This means the *name* of the configuration is `#o3`. The problem is about assigning values to these named continuous parameters. So when I list `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.1 0.1)`, I am defining the value of `#o3` *in the context of* `v12` and `v17`.
           This interpretation is the most consistent with the instructions.
           
           Revised Plan:
           The goal requires all analyses and images to be received.

           The motion parameters `#o2` for movement: I will just use `#o2` as a generic trajectory parameter.
           
           Let's carefully construct the plan using the given action instances and provide unique continuous values for each (rover, target) pair as requested.
           
           The current axiom states `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o0)`. The same for `v14`. This implies `v12` can be at any of these configurations. The moves are specific: `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`. This means from `v13` to `#o3`.
           
           For the configurations:
           - `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` will be `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.1 0.1)`
           - `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` will be `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (0.5 0.1)`
           - `conf(v12, #o0)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` will be `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-0.5 -2.0)`
           - `conf(v12, #o5)` and `above(v12, #o5, v1)` will be `(#o5 v12 null v1): (1.8 -0.58)` (null for ray as above does not use ray)
           - `conf(v12, #o5)` and `above(v12, #o5, v3)` will be `(#o5 v12 null v3): (1.2 -0.1)`
           - `conf(v12, #o5)` and `above(v12, #o5, v7)` will be `(#o5 v12 null v7): (0.37 -2.0)`
           
           - `conf(v14, #o0)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` will be `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.0 -2.0)`
           - `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, v4)` will be `(#o5 v14 null v4): (-0.35 0.42)`
           - `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` will be `(#o5 v14 null v5): (-1.78 -0.75)`
           - `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, v8)` will be `(#o5 v14 null v8): (-1.45 1.75)`
           
           This seems to be the right way to interpret the continuous parameters, allowing the same object name (`#o3`) to refer to different values depending on the rover and target context.
           The problem statement's `new-axiom@0()` has a final state requirement that includes `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. So the rovers must return to their initial configurations.
           
           One final check on which `motion` actions are allowed.
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` is allowed. This takes `v12` from its start to a config for imaging.
           `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)` is allowed. From imaging config to communication config.
           `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)` is allowed. From communication config to sampling config.
           `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, #o0)` is allowed. From sampling config to communication config.
           `motion(v12, #o0, #o2, #o5)` (again)
           `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, v13)` is allowed. From sampling config to home.
           Similarly for `v14`.
           
           The plan will be long. I will try to make it concise.
           Starting states: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`.
           Goals: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)`. All rovers back at home, and stores free.

           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (0.5 0.1) for rover v12 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration ``` is not in the correct format. Please provide each configuration in the format `(<pose_name> <rover_name> <ray_name> <target_name>): (<x> <y>)`.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan had collision and reachability issues with the chosen continuous configurations. I need to select new configurations for `#o3` (imaging), `#o0` (communication), and `#o5` (sampling) that are collision-free and reachable.
           
           The obstacle `v19` is an AABB from `(-0.05, -2.5)` to `(0.05, 2.5)`. This means it's a thin vertical wall along the Y-axis at X=0.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations, keeping `v19` in mind and ensuring reachability from the current rover position.
           
           **Rover v12 initial: `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)**
           
           **For v12 imaging (`#o3`):**
           Target `v17`: `(-0.35, 2.19)`
           Target `v18`: `(0.61, 2.06)`
           Obstacle `v19` is at x=0.
           - For `v12` to see `v17` (x=-0.35), `v12` needs to be on the left side of `v19` (x < 0) or far enough to avoid occlusion. Current `v12` is at `x=1.0`. Moving to `x < 0` to see `v17` would require crossing `v19`.
           - For `v12` to see `v18` (x=0.61), `v12` can stay on the right side of `v19` (x > 0).
           
           Let's adjust the plan slightly and use `v14` to image `v17` and `v12` to image `v18`. This makes more sense considering the obstacle `v19`. `v14` is initially at `x=-1.0`, so it's on the left side of `v19`, which is good for `v17`. `v12` is initially at `x=1.0`, good for `v18`.
           
           **Revised task distribution:**
           **v12:**
           1. Image `v18`.
           2. Analyze `v1` (stone), `v3` (stone), `v7` (soil). (All are in positive X, which is suitable for `v12` starting at `x=1.0`)
           
           **v14:**
           1. Image `v17`.
           2. Analyze `v4` (stone), `v5` (soil), `v8` (soil). (All are in negative X or close to `x=0`, suitable for `v14` starting at `x=-1.0`)
           
           Now, let's redefine the configurations based on this new task distribution and collision/reachability.
           
           **Configuration values for v12 (initial at v13: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)):**
           - Target `v18` (0.61, 2.06). Obstacle `v19` at x=0.
             - `#o3` for `v12` to see `v18`: `(0.8, 1.0)`. This is reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)` and avoids `v19`. Line of sight to `v18` (0.61, 2.06) from `(0.8, 1.0)` is clear, `v19` at x=0 is not between them.
           - Target `v9` (lander) (-1.9, -2.0). Obstacle `v19` at x=0.
             - `#o0` for `v12` to see `v9`: `(0.1, -2.0)`. Moving from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.1, -2.0)` is reachable. Line of sight from `(0.1, -2.0)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` is blocked by `v19` (x=0). This configuration for `v12` to communicate with `v9` is still problematic. `v12` cannot cross `v19` without an explicit move through it, and the straight line of sight is blocked. To avoid `v19`, `v12` needs to be at a negative X coordinate to see `v9`. Given `v12` starts at `x=1.0`, it can't easily get to `x < 0` without collision.
             This means `v12` cannot communicate with `v9` directly across `v19`.
           
           Let's make sure only `v14` handles all communications with `v9` as it's on the left side of `v19`.
           
           **Revised task distribution (again):**
           **v12:**
           1. Image `v18`.
           2. Analyze `v1` (stone), `v3` (stone), `v7` (soil).
           (No communication for `v12` to avoid `v19`)
           
           **v14:**
           1. Image `v17`.
           2. Analyze `v4` (stone), `v5` (soil), `v8` (soil).
           3. Handle *all* `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, as `v14` is on the left side of `v19` and can access `v9`. This means `v12` needs to drop its samples, and `v14` needs to pick them up and send the analysis. This will make the plan very long and likely inefficient, but if `v12` cannot communicate, this is the only way.
           
           Let's check the problem again for "collision-free" specifically for ray. The problem description states: "the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object". `v19` is an obstacle.
           
           If `v12` cannot see `v9`, then `v12` cannot `send_image` or `send_analysis`. This means `v12` can only `take_image` and `sample_rock`. `v14` would then have to handle all transmissions. This is possible by `v12` `drop_rock` then `v14` `sample_rock` at the same location. But `receivedanalysis(?r)` only cares about *a* rover analyzing it and sending it, not which rover. And `receivedimage` also does not care which rover sent it.
           
           So, `v12` does imaging and rock sampling. `v14` does imaging and rock sampling, AND ALL COMMUNICATIONS.
           
           **Rover v12 Plan (imaging v18, sampling v1, v3, v7):**
           Initial `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           1. `move v12 v13 #o3` (to image v18). Let `#o3_v12_v18` be `(0.8, 1.0)`.
           2. `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`.
           3. `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`. (Now `haveimage(v12, v18, v11)`)
           4. `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o5` (to sample v1). Let `#o5_v12_v1` be `(1.8, -0.58)`.
           5. `sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16`. (Now `analyzed(v12, v1)` and `full(v12, v16)`)
           6. `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o5_drop1`. Let `#o5_drop1` be a location to drop `v1` near `v14`'s path. (No, `v12` can simply drop it where it sampled it, or near there, as `drop_rock` does not need a specific pose. For simplicity, just drop it there.)
           7. `drop_rock v12 v16`. (Now `free(v12, v16)`)
           8. `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o5_v12_v3`. Let `#o5_v12_v3` be `(1.2, -0.1)`.
           9. `sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16`. (Now `analyzed(v12, v3)`)
           10. `drop_rock v12 v16`. (Now `free(v12, v16)`)
           11. `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o5_v12_v7`. Let `#o5_v12_v7` be `(0.37, -2.0)`.
           12. `sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16`. (Now `analyzed(v12, v7)`)
           13. `drop_rock v12 v16`. (Now `free(v12, v16)`)
           14. `move v12 #o5 #o2 v13`.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan (imaging v17, sampling v4, v5, v8, and ALL communications):**
           Initial `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           1. `move v14 v15 #o3` (to image v17). Let `#o3_v14_v17` be `(-0.5, 1.0)`. This is reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)` and avoids `v19`. Line of sight to `v17` (-0.35, 2.19) is clear, `v19` at x=0 is not between them.
           2. `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`.
           3. `take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`. (Now `haveimage(v14, v17, v11)`)
           4. `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0` (to communicate). Let `#o0_v14_v9` be `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This is reachable from `(-0.5, 1.0)` (or its starting point) and to `v9` is clear of `v19`.
           5. `send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`. (Now `receivedimage(v17, v11)`)
           6. `send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`. (This requires `haveimage(v14, v18, v11)`, but `v14` didn't take this image. This is a problem. The problem states `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` is the goal, not who took it. `send_image` requires `haveimage(v,o,m)`. So `v12` must transfer the image to `v14` if `v14` sends it. This is not possible in PDDL without a specific action for it. This means the rover that *takes* the image must *send* it, or I have made an incorrect assumption about the `receivedimage` goal.)
           
           The goal `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` only cares that the image is received, not by whom it was taken.
           The `send_image` action has the precondition `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`. This means the rover `?v` that sends the image must *have* the image. So if `v12` takes the image, `v12` must send it.
           
           This means `v12` *must* be able to communicate with the lander `v9`.
           `v12` is at `x=1.0`. `v9` is at `x=-1.9`. `v19` is at `x=0`.
           To communicate, `v12` needs a clear line of sight to `v9`. A position like `(0.1, -2.0)` has line of sight to `v9` blocked by `v19`.
           A position like `(-0.1, -2.0)` would be on the other side of `v19`, but `v12` cannot reach it from `x=1.0` without colliding with `v19`.
           
           This implies a potential unreachability unless there's a path around `v19`. The problem only mentions AABBs for collisions, no pathfinding around obstacles. If `v12` cannot cross the `x=0` plane, it cannot communicate with `v9`.
           
           Let's assume there is a path for `v12` to get to `(-0.1, -2.0)` without colliding, even if the straight line is blocked. Or, I pick a communication configuration that avoids `v19`.
           If `v12` is at `(0.1, -2.0)`, and `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`, the segment is `(0.1, -2.0)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)`. This segment crosses `x=0`, and thus `v19`. So this ray is blocked.
           Thus, `v12` cannot send images or analysis if `v9` is on the other side of `v19`.
           
           Given that `v12` starts at `x=1.0` and `v19` is at `x=0`, and `v9` is at `x=-1.9`, `v12` simply cannot send anything to `v9`.
           This implies that `v12` can *only* take images and sample rocks.
           Therefore, `v14` must take all images and sample all rocks and send all data. This is because `v14` starts at `x=-1.0`, so it can freely move to `x < 0` to communicate with `v9` without `v19` blocking the ray.
           
           **Revised plan: `v14` does everything.**
           This makes the plan extremely long and inefficient for a single rover, but it is the only way to satisfy the `send_image` and `send_analysis` preconditions given `v19`.
           
           **Rover v14 Plan (imaging v17, v18; sampling v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8; and ALL communications):**
           Initial `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           **Configuration values for v14:**
           - Target `v17` (-0.35, 2.19).
             - `#o3` for `v14` to see `v17`: `(-0.5, 1.0)`. Reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Clear of `v19`.
           - Target `v18` (0.61, 2.06).
             - `#o3` for `v14` to see `v18`: This is problematic. `v14` at `x=-1.0` and `v18` at `x=0.61`. The line of sight will cross `v19`. `v14` must move to `x > 0`. Example: `(0.5, 1.0)`. This is reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)` *if* it can pass through `v19`. If passing through `v19` is not allowed by motion planning (which is what "collision-free for the rover" means), then `v14` cannot image `v18`.
           
           If `v14` cannot image `v18` due to `v19`, and `v12` cannot send, then `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is unreachable.
           Let's assume "collision-free for the rover" means the robot's bounding box does not overlap `v19` *during the movement*. But a configuration `(0.5, 1.0)` for `v14` for imaging `v18` implies `v14` *is* at `(0.5, 1.0)`. How did it get there from `(-1.0, -1.75)`? It must have moved through `v19`.
           This is a critical point. If rovers cannot cross the `x=0` line without explicit actions (which are not available), then goals for targets on opposite sides of `v19` from the rover's starting position are unreachable.
           
           `v12` starts at `x=1.0`. `v19` is at `x=0`. `v17` is at `x=-0.35`. `v12` cannot image `v17`.
           `v14` starts at `x=-1.0`. `v19` is at `x=0`. `v18` is at `x=0.61`. `v14` cannot image `v18`.
           
           This would mean neither `receivedimage(v17, v11)` nor `receivedimage(v18, v11)` can be fully satisfied because the rover that can image one target cannot send that image, and the rover that *can* send cannot reach the imaging configuration.
           
           However, the action `motion(?v: object, ?q1: object, ?t: object, ?q2: object)` has no collision checking for the path `?t`. It just says `motion` exists. The collision check happens at the configuration itself, and the ray.
           
           So, let's assume `v12` can reach `(0.8, 1.0)` to image `v18`, and `v14` can reach `(-0.5, 1.0)` to image `v17`. These configurations are reachable from their starting points.
           
           The key constraint is: `v12` CANNOT communicate with `v9`. So `v12` cannot `send_image` or `send_analysis`.
           `v14` CAN communicate with `v9`. So `v14` must send all data.
           
           This means `v12` takes `v18` image. `v14` takes `v17` image. But `v12` needs to send `v18` image, and `v14` needs to send `v17` image.
           This means `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is unreachable. And all the rocks sampled by `v12` will not have their analyses sent.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the current interpretation of `v19` and rover capabilities.
           The only way for the goal to be reachable is if `v12` can reach `(-0.5, -2.0)` (or similar location) from `(1.0, -1.75)` *without colliding* with `v19` as the robot's bounding box passes through `x=0`. This would imply there is space for the robot to move around `v19` (e.g. at y=2.6 or y=-2.6). But AABBs describe a solid rectangle. If a configuration is collision-free, it means its bounding box does not overlap with any obstacles. If a path is collision-free, it means no intermediate configuration on the path overlaps.
           
           If `v12` can reach `(-0.5, -2.0)` from `(1.0, -1.75)`, it must cross the x=0 plane. If `v19` spans from y=-2.5 to y=2.5, then the rover (whose bounding box is typically wider than `2*0.05=0.1`) cannot pass through it if it's on the y range of v19. `v12` is at `y=-1.75`. `v9` is at `y=-2.0`. So, `v12` needs to move between `y=-2.5` and `y=2.5` to communicate with `v9` if it crosses `x=0`. This means it will collide with `v19` if it attempts to cross `x=0`.
           
           Thus, `v12` cannot communicate with `v9`. This renders a part of the goal (sending data taken by `v12`) unreachable. If `v12` takes `v18` image, it cannot be sent. If `v12` samples `v1`, `v3`, `v7`, their analyses cannot be sent.
           
           Let me rethink the communication of `v12`.
           Maybe `v12` can communicate with `v9` from the far right side, like `(2.0, -2.0)`. But the range for `comvisible` is 4. Distance from `(2.0, -2.0)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` is 3.9. This means it is possible in terms of range. But the ray `(2.0, -2.0)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` will pass through `x=0` and collide with `v19`.
           
           This means the original plan with `v12` sending analysis and images is geometrically impossible.
           I am unable to find a set of configurations that allows `v12` to communicate with `v9` without `v19` blocking the line of sight (ray) or colliding with `v12` (configuration or path).
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           The initial `atconf` states are fine, and `free` stores are fine.
           The main problem is `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis` for rocks.
           `v12` cannot send any data. So `haveimage(v12, v18, v11)` and `analyzed(v12, rock)` cannot lead to `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           `v14` can send data. So `v14` needs to be responsible for all `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           This means `v14` must:
           1. Image `v17`. Send it.
           2. Image `v18`. Send it. (But `v14` cannot image `v18` due to `v19`.)
           3. Sample `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`. Send analysis for all. (But `v14` cannot sample `v1`, `v3`, `v7` effectively as they are on the other side of `v19` from its starting position, it would have to cross `v19` which is a collision).
           
           This really points to the goal being unreachable. If a rover cannot move to a position without colliding with `v19` (because its width is greater than 0.1) or cannot establish line-of-sight due to `v19`, then it can't complete the tasks.
           
           Final conclusion: the goal is unreachable given the geometry of `v19` and the placement of `v9`, `v17`, `v18` relative to the rovers' starting positions.
           
           Explanation:
           The goal requires transmitting images of `v17` and `v18` to the lander `v9`, and analyses of rocks `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8` to `v9`.
           Rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. The lander `v9` is located around `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           There is an obstacle `v19` which is a thin wall from `x=-0.05` to `x=0.05` spanning `y=-2.5` to `y=2.5`.
           
           1. **Communication for Rover v12:** To send data to `v9` (at `x=-1.9`), `v12` (starting at `x=1.0`) would need a line of sight that crosses `x=0`. The obstacle `v19` is located at `x=0` and spans `y` coordinates from `-2.5` to `2.5`. Since `v12` typically operates within these `y` bounds to reach targets, any direct line of sight from `v12` to `v9` would be blocked by `v19`. Therefore, `v12` cannot transmit any images or analyses to `v9`.
           
           2. **Imaging for Rover v12:** `v12` is on the `x > 0` side of `v19`. It can image `v18` (`(0.61, 2.06)`) without `v19` blocking the line of sight. However, since `v12` cannot transmit, any image taken by `v12` cannot be sent to `v9`. `v12` cannot image `v17` (`(-0.35, 2.19)`) because `v19` would block the line of sight.
           
           3. **Sampling for Rover v12:** `v12` can sample `v1, v3, v7` (all `x > 0`) without collision. However, since `v12` cannot transmit, their analyses cannot be sent.
           
           4. **Imaging for Rover v14:** `v14` is on the `x < 0` side of `v19`. It can image `v17` (`(-0.35, 2.19)`) without `v19` blocking the line of sight. It cannot image `v18` (`(0.61, 2.06)`) because `v19` would block the line of sight.
           
           5. **Sampling for Rover v14:** `v14` can sample `v4, v5, v8` (all `x < 0`) without collision. It cannot sample `v1, v3, v7` because they are on the `x > 0` side of `v19`, and `v14` would need to move across `v19`, leading to collision.
           
           6. **Combined Problem:** To achieve `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, either `v12` (which can image `v18`) needs to transmit (which it cannot), or `v14` needs to image `v18` (which it cannot due to `v19`). Thus `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is unreachable. Similarly, for rock analyses, `v1, v3, v7` cannot be sampled and their analyses sent by `v14` (which can transmit), and `v12` (which can sample them) cannot transmit.
           
           Given these geometric constraints and the available actions, the goal is not achievable.
