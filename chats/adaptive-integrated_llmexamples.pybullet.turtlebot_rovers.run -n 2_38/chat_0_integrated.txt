           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, means satisfying several conditions related to two rovers (`v12`, `v14`), a store (`v16`), images of objectives (`v17`, `v18`), and analysis of rocks (`v2`, `v6`). Specifically, the goal requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where `?stone` refers to rocks of type `v2`)
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where `?soil` refers to rocks of type `v6`)
           
           Let's analyze the initial state and the available actions:
           
           **Initial State Analysis:**
           * **Rover Configurations:** `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           * **Store Status:** `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           * **Objectives:** `objective(v17)` and `objective(v18)` are true.
           * **Rocks and Types:**
               * Rocks of type `v2` (stone): `v3`, `v1`, `v4`.
               * Rocks of type `v6` (soil): `v7`, `v5`, `v8`.
           * **Equipment:** `v10` is a camera, onboard both `v12` and `v14`, and supports `v11` (a mode).
           * **Lander:** `v9` is a lander.
           * **Visibility/Reachability:**
               * `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`: Rover `v12` can be above various rocks at configuration `#o5`.
               * `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`: Rover `v14` can be above various rocks at configuration `#o5`.
               * `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: Rover `v12` can see objectives `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
               * `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`: Rover `v14` can see objectives `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
               * `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: Both rovers can communicate with the lander `v9` at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           * **Motion:** `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)` are given. This means the rovers can move from their current configuration to the same configuration, which is a no-op move in this specific case.
           
           **Goal Achievement Strategy:**
           
           *   **Goal 1 & 2 (`atconf`, `free`):** These are already true in the initial state. No actions needed.
           *   **Goal 3 (`receivedimage`):** We need to get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This requires the `take_image` and `send_image` actions.
               *   To `take_image`, the rover needs to be at a configuration where the objective is `imagevisible`, have a calibrated camera, and the ray should not be blocked.
               *   To `send_image`, the rover needs to be at a configuration where the lander is `comvisible`, have the image, and the ray should not be blocked.
               *   Since `calibrated(v10, v12)` and `calibrated(v10, v14)` are not in the initial state, we need to `calibrate` the camera first.
               *   We can use `v12` or `v14` for imaging. Let's use `v12` as an example.
                   1.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
                   2.  `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
                   3.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
               *   Repeat for `v18`. We can use the same rover or the other one. Let's use `v14` to diversify.
                   1.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
                   2.  `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
                   3.  `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           *   **Goal 4 & 5 (`receivedanalysis`):** We need to receive analysis for a stone (type `v2`) and a soil (type `v6`). This requires `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.
               *   To `sample_rock`, the rover needs to be `above` the rock, the store needs to be `free`. After sampling, the store becomes `full`, and the rock is `analyzed`.
               *   To `send_analysis`, the rover needs to be at a configuration where the lander is `comvisible`, have the analysis, and the ray should not be blocked.
               *   We have `v4` (type `v2`) and `v8` (type `v6`) that `v12` is `above` at `#o5`. Let's use them.
                   1.  `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v4, v16)` (for stone, type `v2`)
                   2.  `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
                   3.  `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)` (for soil, type `v6`) - we can use `v14` as it's also `above` `v8` at `#o5`, and `v12` already used its store, so `v14` should use its own store. The problem states `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` in initial state, so each rover has a dedicated store that is called `v16`. It is assumed `v16` is a general store and a rover can use it if `free(rover, v16)` is true. Once `v12` uses it, it becomes `full(v12, v16)`. Then `v14` can use it as `free(v14, v16)` is still true for `v14`.
                   4.  `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           
           **Available Action Instances Check:**
           The provided list of available action instances is very limited. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are given. This implies that the only actions we can use are `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal based on the *actual* available actions:
           
           The goal requires:
           * `atconf(v12, v13)`: True initially.
           * `atconf(v14, v15)`: True initially.
           * `free(v12, v16)`: True initially.
           * `free(v14, v16)`: True initially.
           * `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Needs `take_image` and `send_image`. Neither of these actions are available.
           * `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Needs `take_image` and `send_image`. Neither of these actions are available.
           * `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Needs `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. Neither of these actions are available.
           * `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Needs `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. Neither of these actions are available.
           
           Since the goal requires actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, but these actions are not in the provided list of allowed action instances, the goal is not achievable. The provided `move` actions are no-ops as they move the rover to its current configuration, and `drop_rock` can only be used if the rover's store is `full`, which is not the case initially.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable because the necessary actions to take images, send images, sample rocks, and send analysis are not present in the list of allowed action instances. The only available actions are `move` to the current configuration (no-op) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be used as no stores are full).
