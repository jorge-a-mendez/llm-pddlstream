User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.318, -0.56), (1.429, -0.449)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.148, 2.105), (-1.007, 2.245)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).

           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Object v4 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.197, 0.003), (1.301, 0.108)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.413, 2.076), (-0.318, 2.171)).
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.454, 0.89), (-1.348, 0.996)).
           Object v3 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.225, 2.095), (1.323, 2.193)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     This problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` axiom, which has multiple conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (This means we need to receive analysis for a rock of type v2)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (This means we need to receive analysis for a rock of type v6)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state for these conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True (initial state)
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True (initial state)
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True (initial state)
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True (initial state)
           
           So, the first four conditions are already met. We need to focus on achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           This requires taking an image and then sending it.
           To `take_image`, we need: `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`, `onboard(?c, ?v)`, `supports(?c, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, and `~blocked(?y)`.
           To `send_image`, we need: `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `objective(?o)`, `mode(?m)`, `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `~blocked(?y)`.
           
           From the initial state:
           - Rover `v12` has `onboard(v10, v12)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           - Rover `v14` has `onboard(v10, v14)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           - We have `objective(v17)` and `objective(v18)`.
           - We have `mode(v11)`.
           - We have `lander(v9)`.
           
           Let's consider `v17` first.
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` are in the initial state.
           We also have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (if `~blocked(#o4)`). After this, `calibrated(v10, v14)` becomes true.
           2. `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`. After this, `haveimage(v14, v17, v11)` becomes true and `calibrated(v10, v14)` becomes false.
           3. `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (re-calibrate for sending, though not explicitly required, it's good practice as the previous action uncalibrated it, but it might not be needed for `send_image`). Actually `send_image` only requires `atconf` and `comvisible`, not `calibrated`.
           4. `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` (if `~blocked(#o1)`). After this, `receivedimage(v17, v11)` becomes true.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           We can use `v12` this time.
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` (if `~blocked(#o4)`). After this, `calibrated(v10, v12)` becomes true.
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`. After this, `haveimage(v12, v18, v11)` becomes true and `calibrated(v10, v12)` becomes false.
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)` (if `~blocked(#o1)`). After this, `receivedimage(v18, v11)` becomes true.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type `v2`) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type `v6`):
           This requires sampling a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`, and then sending the analysis.
           To `sample_rock`, we need: `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`, `store(?s)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `free(?v, ?s)`.
           To `send_analysis`, we need: `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `rock(?r)`, `analyzed(?v, ?r)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `~blocked(?y)`.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `v16` is a store.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`.
           - Rocks of type `v2`: `v1` and `v4`.
           - Rocks of type `v6`: `v5` and `v8`.
           
           Let's sample a `v2` rock (e.g., `v1`) and a `v6` rock (e.g., `v5`).
           `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)` are given.
           Similarly for `v12`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type `v2`):
           1. `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`. After this, `full(v14, v16)` becomes true, `analyzed(v14, v1)` becomes true, and `free(v14, v16)` becomes false.
           2. `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)` (if `~blocked(#o1)`). After this, `receivedanalysis(v1)` becomes true.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(v5)` (type `v6`):
           We need `free(v14, v16)` or `free(v12, v16)`. Since `v14` sampled `v1`, `v14`'s store is `full(v14, v16)`. So we need to use `v12` or drop the rock from `v14`. Let's use `v12`.
           1. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`. After this, `full(v12, v16)` becomes true, `analyzed(v12, v5)` becomes true, and `free(v12, v16)` becomes false.
           2. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)` (if `~blocked(#o1)`). After this, `receivedanalysis(v5)` becomes true.
           
           All the `blocked` predicates are defined as `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`. Since `~blocked(?y)` is a precondition, we assume that no ray is blocked.
           The only allowed moves are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These are moves from a configuration to itself, which essentially do nothing in terms of changing `atconf`. We don't need to change `atconf` to achieve the goal as the current configurations are suitable.
           
           Order of actions:
           It's better to calibrate, take image, then send. Similarly, sample rock, then send analysis. The order between image sending and analysis sending does not matter.
           
           We will use the following objects for the axiom:
           `?stone` will be `v1` (type `v2`)
           `?soil` will be `v5` (type `v6`)
           
           Let's check the objects and their AABBs to make sure the configurations make sense.
           Rover v12 at v13 (1.0, -1.75). Rover v14 at v15 (-1.0, -1.75).
           Lander v9 at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). This is to the left and slightly below v14, and further to the left and below v12. So `comvisible` makes sense for both.
           Objective v17 at ((-2.246, 2.009), (-2.147, 2.108)). This is far away and to the left for both rovers, especially for v12.
           Objective v18 at ((-0.413, 2.076), (-0.318, 2.171)). This is in the top-middle, closer to v12 than v17.
           
           The configuration `#o3` for `imagevisible` and `#o5` for `above` and `#o0` for `comvisible` need to be chosen carefully to ensure visibility and reachability. Since these are continuous parameters, we assume there exist valid values for them.
           The problem statement says that if a configuration starting with '#' is used, we must provide a continuous value for it.
           
           Let's list the configurations that need values:
           - `#o3` for `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `#o0` for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `#o5` for `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
           
           A common `#o3` is used for `v17` and `v18`. A common `#o0` is used for `v9`. A common `#o5` is used for `v1` and `v5`. This implies that a single configuration for a given rover for that type of action should suffice if it works for all objectives, but the prompt says to provide a different value for each (rover, target object) pair. So, we'll need to define distinct configurations.
           
           For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`: Rover `v14` (at (-1.0, -1.75)) targeting `v17` (at (-2.19, 2.05)).
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: Rover `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75)) targeting `v18` (at (-0.36, 2.12)).
           
           For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: Rover `v14` (at (-1.0, -1.75)) targeting `v9` (at (-1.9, -2.0)).
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: Rover `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75)) targeting `v9` (at (-1.9, -2.0)).
           
           For `above(v14, #o5, v1)`: Rover `v14` (at (-1.0, -1.75)) targeting `v1` (at (-1.4, 0.94)).
           For `above(v12, #o5, v5)`: Rover `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75)) targeting `v5` (at (1.37, -0.5)).
           
           Let's refine the configuration names and values. The problem statement says `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state, and if it's used for `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, a value must be provided for it.
           
           We need to make sure we use a unique continuous value for each (rover, target object) pair.
           - Let's call the configuration for `v14` to see `v17` as `#config_v14_v17`.
           - Let's call the configuration for `v12` to see `v18` as `#config_v12_v18`.
           - Let's call the configuration for `v14` to communicate with `v9` as `#config_v14_v9`.
           - Let's call the configuration for `v12` to communicate with `v9` as `#config_v12_v9`.
           - Let's call the configuration for `v14` to be above `v1` as `#config_v14_v1_above`.
           - Let's call the configuration for `v12` to be above `v5` as `#config_v12_v5_above`.
           
           Since `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` are used in the initial state, they are placeholders. We should map these to our specific (rover, target) configurations.
           For `#o3`:
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           This indicates `#o3` represents a configuration that can be used for *any* rover and *any* objective for `imagevisible`. However, the prompt clearly states "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". So we must differentiate these. I will assume that the `#o3` in the initial state can be seen as representing multiple configurations and we need to choose them.
           
           Similarly for `#o0` and `#o5`.
           
           Let's specify the configurations as requested.
           - Rover `v14` (at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)) needs to image `v17` (at (-2.19, 2.05)).
             - `conf_v14_v17_img`: x should be near `v14`'s current x, y should be adjusted to face `v17`. A simple (x,y) configuration for viewing `v17` from `v14`'s vicinity could be around `(-1.0, 0.0)`.
           - Rover `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)) needs to image `v18` (at (-0.36, 2.12)).
             - `conf_v12_v18_img`: x should be near `v12`'s current x, y should be adjusted to face `v18`. A simple (x,y) configuration for viewing `v18` from `v12`'s vicinity could be around `(1.0, 0.0)`.
           
           - Rover `v14` (at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)) needs to communicate with `v9` (at (-1.9, -2.0)).
             - `conf_v14_v9_com`: x should be near `v14`'s current x, y adjusted to face `v9`. A simple (x,y) configuration could be around `(-1.0, -1.5)`.
           - Rover `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)) needs to communicate with `v9` (at (-1.9, -2.0)).
             - `conf_v12_v9_com`: x should be near `v12`'s current x, y adjusted to face `v9`. A simple (x,y) configuration could be around `(0.0, -1.5)`.
           
           - Rover `v14` (at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)) needs to be above `v1` (at (-1.4, 0.94)).
             - `conf_v14_v1_above`: x and y should be close to `v1`. A simple (x,y) could be around `(-1.4, 0.9)`.
           - Rover `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)) needs to be above `v5` (at (1.37, -0.5)).
             - `conf_v12_v5_above`: x and y should be close to `v5`. A simple (x,y) could be around `(1.37, -0.5)`.
           
           The configurations in the initial state are:
           `conf(v14, #o3)` where `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `conf(v12, #o3)` where `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `conf(v12, #o0)` where `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `conf(v14, #o0)` where `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `conf(v14, #o5)` where `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`
           `conf(v12, #o5)` where `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`
           
           The problem formulation indicates that `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` refer to specific continuous values, and if they are used, we must provide those values. The prompt also states "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This seems to imply that for `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, if we use `v14` for both `v17` and `v18`, even though `#o3` is the same, we must provide different configurations. However, the initial state gives `conf(v14, #o3)`. This means `#o3` is a specific configuration. I will interpret this as `#o3` is a valid configuration for *all* instances of `imagevisible` that use it in the initial state. The same for `#o0` and `#o5`. If I need *another* imagevisible or comvisible configuration that is not pre-defined by `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, then I would create a new `#` variable. Since the actions use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` from the initial state directly, I will provide values for these placeholders.
           
           Ray objects: `#o4` for `imagevisible` and `#o1` for `comvisible`.
           - `ray(#o4)`
           - `ray(#o1)`
           
           Let's use the given `#o` parameters directly in the plan and provide values for them.
           The plan will involve:
           1. Calibrate `v14` to image `v17`.
           2. Take image of `v17` with `v14`.
           3. Send image of `v17` with `v14`.
           4. Calibrate `v12` to image `v18`.
           5. Take image of `v18` with `v12`.
           6. Send image of `v18` with `v12`.
           7. Sample rock `v1` (type `v2`) with `v14`.
           8. Send analysis of `v1` with `v14`.
           9. Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`) with `v12`.
           10. Send analysis of `v5` with `v12`.
           
           This sequence will achieve all the subgoals of the axiom.
           
           Since the available action instances for `move` are self-loops `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, they do not change the `atconf` state. We are already at the required configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) so we do not need to use `move` actions to satisfy `atconf` for other actions. The configurations like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are already associated with `v12` and `v14` through `conf` predicates in the initial state, implying the rovers can reach these configurations.
           
           Final plan structure:
           The conditions `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)` are already met.
           We need `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)` and `receivedanalysis(v5)`.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(v1)`:
           (sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)
           (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(v5)`:
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)
           
           I need to make sure that the `#o` configurations are provided for each specific rover and target, even if the same `#o` symbol is used in the initial state.
           For example, for `#o3`, we have:
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           
           This means `#o3` acts as a generic placeholder for configurations that allow imaging.
           To comply with the "different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" rule, I will define specific coordinate values for each (rover, target) pair using `#o3_v14_v17`, `#o3_v12_v18`, etc. and replace `#o3` with these specific names in the plan. This also applies to `#o0` and `#o5`.
           
           Let's rename and define the specific configurations:
           For `imagevisible`:
           - `#o3_v14_v17_conf` for `imagevisible(v14, #o3_v14_v17_conf, #o4, v17)`
           - `#o3_v12_v18_conf` for `imagevisible(v12, #o3_v12_v18_conf, #o4, v18)`
           For `comvisible`:
           - `#o0_v14_v9_conf` for `comvisible(v14, #o0_v14_v9_conf, #o1, v9)`
           - `#o0_v12_v9_conf` for `comvisible(v12, #o0_v12_v9_conf, #o1, v9)`
           For `above`:
           - `#o5_v14_v1_conf` for `above(v14, #o5_v14_v1_conf, v1)`
           - `#o5_v12_v5_conf` for `above(v12, #o5_v12_v5_conf, v5)`
           
           These new configurations need to be explicitly added to the plan, as they are not literally in the initial state with those names. This means that my interpretation of the initial state having `#o3` for example, meaning a single, already-computed configuration that works for multiple tasks, is likely incorrect. The instruction "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state ... then you must provide a continuous value" implies that I should use the specific `#o` names *if they are in the initial state for the particular usage*. Since the initial state has `conf(v14, #o3)` and also `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, this implies that `#o3` is a single configuration that is *already computed* for `v14`. If I were to use a different one (like `#o3_v14_v17_conf`), it would need to have `conf(v14, #o3_v14_v17_conf)` as an initial state predicate, or I'd need to move the robot there, which is not allowed given the move actions.
           
           Therefore, the interpretation that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *specific* pre-computed configurations that satisfy all the initial conditions they are mentioned in, seems to be the correct one for using the given initial state. The rule "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair" applies when I *introduce new* `#` configurations, or if the original `#` configurations are not sufficient (e.g., if `#o3` only worked for `v17` and I needed a separate one for `v18`). Here, the problem statement provides specific usages. `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` AND `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` means `#o3` works for both `v17` and `v18` with `v14`. Same applies for `v12` and `#o3`.
           
           So I will use the original `#o` names as they appear in the initial state.
           
           Coordinates for reference:
           v12: (1.0, -1.75)
           v14: (-1.0, -1.75)
           v1: (-1.4, 0.94) (rock type v2)
           v3: (1.27, 2.14) (rock type v2)
           v4: (1.25, 0.05) (rock type v2)
           v5: (1.37, -0.5) (rock type v6)
           v7: (-1.07, 2.17) (rock type v6)
           v8: (-0.7, -0.17) (rock type v6)
           v9: (-1.9, -2.0) (lander)
           v17: (-2.19, 2.05) (objective)
           v18: (-0.36, 2.12) (objective)
           
           Let's estimate continuous values for the configurations.
           #o3: imagevisible config for v12 and v14 for targets v17 and v18.
           - For `v14` to see `v17` (from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-2.19, 2.05)): e.g., (-1.0, 0.0)
           - For `v12` to see `v18` (from (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.36, 2.12)): e.g., (1.0, 0.0)
           Since `#o3` is used for *both* rovers and *both* objectives, a single value won't work for all. The prompt says "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair".
           So even though the initial state has `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, I must specify configurations for the *pair*. This means I need to interpret `#o3` as a placeholder for multiple configurations that satisfy the conditions for each rover-objective pair. I will name them accordingly when providing the values.
           
           #o0: comvisible config for v12 and v14 for lander v9.
           - For `v14` to see `v9` (from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.9, -2.0)): e.g., (-1.0, -1.8)
           - For `v12` to see `v9` (from (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.9, -2.0)): e.g., (0.0, -1.8)
           Similar situation as `#o3`.
           
           #o5: above config for v12 and v14 for multiple rocks.
           - For `v14` to be above `v1` (rock at (-1.4, 0.94)): e.g., (-1.4, 0.9)
           - For `v12` to be above `v5` (rock at (1.37, -0.5)): e.g., (1.37, -0.5)
           Similar situation as `#o3` and `#o0`.
           
           This means I must use the *symbolic name* `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` in the plan as it appears in the initial state predicates, but when defining the continuous values, I must distinguish them by (rover, target) pair.
           
           For `#o3`:
           - For (v14, v17): a position for v14 to see v17.
           - For (v12, v18): a position for v12 to see v18.
           
           For `#o0`:
           - For (v14, v9): a position for v14 to see v9.
           - For (v12, v9): a position for v12 to see v9.
           
           For `#o5`:
           - For (v14, v1): a position for v14 to be above v1.
           - For (v12, v5): a position for v12 to be above v5.
           
           This interpretation seems to satisfy the prompt's requirements.
           The rays `#o1` and `#o4` don't require specific (rover, target) values. They represent the ray itself.
           
           ```
           The task requires satisfying the conditions of `new-axiom@0`. The initial state already satisfies the `atconf` and `free` predicates for both rovers. Therefore, the plan focuses on achieving the `receivedimage` for objectives `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` (using `v1`) and a rock of type `v6` (using `v5`).
           
           Rover `v14` will be used to image objective `v17` and sample rock `v1` (type `v2`).
           Rover `v12` will be used to image objective `v18` and sample rock `v5` (type `v6`).
           
           For imaging and sending images:
           - Rover `v14` calibrates its camera `v10` at a suitable configuration (`#o3`) to view objective `v17`.
           - Then, `v14` takes an image of `v17` using camera `v10` in mode `v11`.
           - Finally, `v14` sends the image to lander `v9` from a communication-enabled configuration (`#o0`).
           - Similarly, Rover `v12` will perform these steps for objective `v18`.
           
           For sampling and sending analysis:
           - Rover `v14` moves to a configuration (`#o5`) above rock `v1` (type `v2`) and samples it using store `v16`.
           - Then, `v14` sends the analysis of `v1` to lander `v9` from the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           - Similarly, Rover `v12` will sample rock `v5` (type `v6`) and send its analysis.
           
           The problem states that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are configurations present in the initial state. To comply with the requirement of providing continuous values for each (rover, target object) pair for `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, I will specify coordinates for `#o3` and `#o0` based on the specific rover and target, and for `#o5` based on the specific rover and rock. These configurations are assumed to be reachable from the rovers' current positions and provide collision-free line-of-sight for imaging and communication, and to be above the specified rocks for sampling. The `move` actions provided are self-loops and do not change the rover's `atconf` state, so they are not necessary for the plan as the rovers are already at their base configurations or can directly use the specified configurations for the actions.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     I apologize for the oversight. I incorrectly assumed that the various `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions were available, when in fact, the provided list of valid action instances only included `move` and `drop_rock`.
           
           Given the highly restricted set of valid actions:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action means rover `v12` moves from configuration `v13` to `v13` via a trajectory `#o2`. This action effectively does not change the state of `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similarly, this action does not change the state of `atconf(v14, v15)`.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action would make `free(v12, v16)` true if `full(v12, v16)` was true. Currently, `free(v12, v16)` is already true in the initial state.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similar to `v12`, `free(v14, v16)` is already true.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the initial state with the *actual* allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True in initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True in initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in initial state.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in initial state.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: No rock of type `v2` has received analysis in the initial state.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: No rock of type `v6` has received analysis in the initial state.
           
           Since the available actions are only `move` (self-loops) and `drop_rock` (which is not useful as stores are already free), there are no actions to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. The actions for `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are explicitly not in the list of valid actions.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided valid actions.
           
           No plan can be returned.
