(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable placements for this little square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is defined by the line segment between (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object needs to stay entirely within the surface boundaries, and I need a good spread of positions and orientations (theta, x, y).
           
           First, I'm thinking about the geometry. The surface is basically a rectangle, and the object's going to be a square. Rotation matters, but since it's a square, some rotations (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) don't *change* its effective bounding box extents, it'll still look like a square on the surface. However, other rotations will.
           
           To determine stability, I need to account for rotation (theta). With `theta = 0`, I can basically just move the object around, but it has a minimum and maximum extent it can reach.
           - For `theta = 0, pi`, half-extents will be `obj_half_x = size_x/2` and `obj_half_y = size_y/2` (which is just 0.035 in this case).
           - For `theta = pi/2, 3pi/2`, half-extents switch.
           - For everything else, the width and height depend on `cos(theta)` and `sin(theta)`. Since the object is square, the effective bounding box dimensions are given by
           `half_W_eff = (0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))) / 2`
           `half_H_eff = (0.07 * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))) / 2`
           So `half_W_eff = half_H_eff`. 
           
           The maximum effective size occurs at 45 degrees, where the maximum value of `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` occurs. This would be `0.07 * sqrt(2)`.
           
           I can put many objects on the surface. The effective width, the length of the surface is 0.6, and with the center of the surface at -0.6 and 0, and the effective half_size = 0.035, the width of the possible placement is `0.6 - 2 * 0.035 = 0.53`. With this, I will need to get a reasonable separation distance. If I place 7 in each direction, they should not overlap. So, the placement centers will be such that x = 0.53/6 = step_val, or 4.235, and then 4.235 + step_val, up to 4.765. Same with the y values, which are (-0.565, 0).
           The y values will then be -0.565 and -0.565 + step_val and up to -0.035.
           Thus I can have a 7x7 grid.
           
           I'll start by filling the surface with objects at a simple orientation (theta = 0).  I'll place 49 objects in a 7x7 grid. This should be a good start.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll rotate it by 45 degrees (pi/4) and put it roughly in the center of the remaining space for diversity.  I'll recalculate the maximum `x` and `y` available. This rotation changes the size of the objects bounding box. I will make sure the object is within the valid area (which will be slightly smaller due to the increased extent).
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           *   **First 49 placements:** Surface index 0, theta = 0,  x and y values arranged in a 7x7 grid as described.
           *   **50th placement:** Surface index 0, theta = pi/4, and a x and y value to be roughly the middle of the valid range.
           
           Here are the 50 placements as I've calculated them:
           
           ```
           [
               (0, 0.0, 4.2350000000000003, -0.5650000000000002),
               (0, 0.0, 4.323333333333333, -0.
