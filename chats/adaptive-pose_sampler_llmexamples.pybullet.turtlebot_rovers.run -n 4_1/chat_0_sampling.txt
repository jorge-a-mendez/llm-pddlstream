User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The fixed obstacles define a mostly open central area, with some smaller obstacles scattered. There's a central vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0. The outer walls are defined by obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4. There are several smaller obstacles, including some near the corners (7, 8, 9, 10) and some smaller, scattered boxes. I need to select positions that are within a 4-unit radius of the target point `(1.2 -1.2)`, and within the overall bounds of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. I will prioritize positions that are not directly in front of the central wall (obstacle 5) if the target is on the other side.
           
           The target point is (1.2 -1.2). This is in the bottom-right quadrant. Obstacle 5 (the central wall) will block any view from x < 0. So I should focus on the x > 0 region.
