(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to come up with 50 stable placement configurations for this object (ID 4) on surface 0.  The object is practically square, and the surface is a square as well.  The main challenge is finding those 50 positions given that my only constraints are to ensure the object is fully within the surface boundary and that rotations are accounted for. Since I have no prior information, I'm starting from scratch.
           
           First, I calculated the size of the surface and object, noting the near-square dimensions of the object.  This simplifies things. Since the object is almost square, any rotation is going to give me roughly the same bounding box dimensions.  I can treat it with this assumption.
           
           I determined that to ensure stability, the object's center needs to be within a certain inner region of the surface. I started with a simple setup: I'll use the surface index (0) for all placements. Then, I needed to figure out x, y, and theta (rotation angle).
           
           The initial idea was to vary both x and y and then use a set of rotations across these points. I determined the minimum and maximum coordinates along both axes by considering the size of the object and the given boundaries of the surface, calculating the bounds such that the object is fully contained on the surface.
           
           To efficiently populate the placements, I came up with a grid setup for x and y.  Then, to maximize diversity, I decided to use a couple of key rotations: 0 and pi/4 (45 degrees). This gives a nice distribution across positions and rotations and is very easy to scale.  I chose a set of x and y coordinates (-0.07, -0.035, 0, 0.035, 0.07) to place the object's center. This range ensures I stay away from the edge (for both x and y).
           
           I did some bounding box calculation to determine safe placement zones and confirmed that the chosen grid ensures stable and valid placements across all angles in my range. For the final placements, I set up a loop that uses this grid: I used x and y pairs in the grid, set the first 25 positions with a zero-degree rotation, and for the next 25 positions I rotated them to 45 degrees. The plan is executed via the Python script that ensures the final result contains exactly 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable, Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           Alright, I've got the feedback on object ID 4's successful placement at `(0, 0, -0.07, -0.07)`. That's a stable anchor point. Now, I'm tasked with placing object ID 5 on surface 0, and crucially, I need to avoid any collisions with object 4.  Surface 0 has bounds of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 5 is almost square with dimensions `(0.08476, 0.08476)`.
           
           First, I calculated the permissible center ranges for object 5, considering rotations of 0 and 45 degrees (`pi/4`).  At 0 degrees, the safe x and y ranges are approximately `[-0.0926, 0.0926]`. With 45-degree rotation, they're roughly `[-0.075, 0.075]`.
           
           Next, I analyzed the footprint of object 4. Its dimensions are roughly `(0.0742, 0.0742)`, so its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is approximately `[-0.1071, -0.0329]` for both x and y.  This is the region I need to steer clear of.
           
           My core strategy is as follows: I'm generating a fine grid of candidate center points within the surface bounds, for both 0- and 45-degree rotations.  For each candidate, I'm meticulously checking for AABB overlap between the potential object 5 placement and the known location of object 4. I've defined a `check_collision` function to quickly verify this and return `True` (collision) or `False` (no collision).
           
           To improve the chances of avoiding a collision, I generated a 10x10 grid.  That yields 100 potential candidate center points for each of the two rotation angles, for a total of 200 possible placements.  The grid points range from -0.09 to +0.09 in steps of 0.02. I did the math and generated the AABB's precisely. After running my calculations, I can extract 50 non-colliding placements from the 100 possible placements.
           
           The resulting list of placements contains the valid x, y, and rotation for each placement. It should meet the requirements. It has diversity in that some are theta = 0, and some are theta = pi/4, and the strategy is logically sound.

(Thoughts: **My Goal: Secure 50 Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got a new object, object ID 6, that I need to place 50 times on surface 0. This object is nearly square, with dimensions `size_x = 0.08145871860159382` and `size_y = 0.0814587186015938`.  I'm dealing with the challenge of not colliding with existing objects on the surface.
           
           I've got two already-placed objects to contend with: Object 4, at coordinates (0, 0.0, -0.07, -0.07) and Object 5, at coordinates (0, 0.0, -0.01, -0.09). Their sizes and AABBs are carefully calculated.
           
           I need to meticulously check for collisions. I know the surface bounds, so placements must also stay within that limit.  First,  I'll start with calculating axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) to represent the space occupied by Objects 4 and 5. This will help determine the possible placements of object 6.
           
           I need to consider placements at both 0 and 45-degree rotations. So, I will calculate AABBs for the object rotated at those angles. These boxes are also a function of the rotation angle. Then, for each position, I calculate its AABB to test for collisions with the obstacles.
           
           To find valid placements, I'll systematically generate a grid of candidate x and y center coordinates and test each point for collision for the two rotation angles. This grid is constructed to be evenly spaced to minimize gaps. The goal is to maximize the number of valid placements while covering the whole surface area.  The function `check_collision_with_placed` is crucial for verifying that the potential location for the new object will not intersect with existing objects. If there's overlap in both x and y dimensions, I mark it as a collision.
           
           I will iterate through these candidates for the x and y coordinates, calculate Object 6's AABB for each coordinate, and then check for collisions using an overlap function.  If it doesn't collide, I'll add the placement to my growing list. To ensure complete surface coverage with different rotations, I'm choosing a few rotations to test.
           
           I'll keep repeating these steps, calculating the AABBs for all potential positions in both rotations and appending the placement if it is valid. Since the surface and object dimensions are already known, I'll create a structured loop to determine these coordinates.
           
           I am meticulously going through each x and y combination, checking for overlaps and avoiding previously-placed objects. The goal is that, after the check, the number of placements will be 50.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with placing 50 units of object ID 7, which is pretty close to a square, onto surface 0. That surface is defined as a rectangle, and I've got to make sure these placements are stable. I'm leveraging my knowledge of AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection to achieve this.
           
           First, I need to account for objects already on the surface. Object 4 is placed, and its AABB is calculated. Then there's object 5, which has two possible AABB configurations. Lastly, object 6 is also placed, and I know its AABB. These are my constraints, and I have all the bounds defined.
           
           I've got the dimensions of object 7.  The key is, I've got to figure out its AABB for both a 0-degree rotation and a 45-degree rotation. At 0 degrees, the AABB extents are straightforward, calculated using half its x and y dimensions. But the 45-degree rotation requires some trigonometric calculation to determine the extent of its bounding box, with all the sin and cos. 
           
           I've made my code handle the cases, checking and rejecting placements that either exceed the surface bounds or collide with already-placed objects. I'll define my candidate centers on a fine grid to give the system enough spots to test.
           
           I'm checking all the points within that surface for each rotation to find a valid placement and iterating through the various angles for the object. The `is_placement_valid` function neatly encapsulates the surface bounds check, the AABB collision logic, and the calculation of each object's AABB.
           
           The objective is to iterate over a grid of x, y values and use a few common rotations. For efficiency, I first determine how far each rotation allows me to travel along the x and y axes. This creates bounds to keep any object on the surface.
           
           So I'll start the process, with each rotation. The goal is to reach 50 valid locations using this methodical AABB-based approach. The code has been designed to take this on.
