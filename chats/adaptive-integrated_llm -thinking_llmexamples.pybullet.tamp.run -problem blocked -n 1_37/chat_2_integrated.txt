User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.303, -0.277), (-4.232, -0.206)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.267, -0.241, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.006).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           My task is to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means placing an object (let's call it "?green") onto a specific surface, verifying both its `type` and its `on` condition. After analyzing the given axioms and initial state, I've concluded the most efficient route is to manipulate object `v8`, which is of the desired type and present in the environment.
           
           My strategy involves a three-step plan:
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** First, I need to position the robot's base close to object `v8` for picking and placing. My current base configuration is `v3` which is at (2.5, 0.0, 0.0), and my target base configuration is `#o3`. Based on the scene, `#o3 = (4.5, 0.0, 0.0)` seems like a good choice to facilitate the pickup. Then, I need to move the robot base using the action `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I need to pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`, which is located at (4.5, 0.3, 0.8). I plan to use the `pick` action `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` where `v4` denotes the arm.
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll place `v8` onto a suitable surface, namely `v18`. The `place` action I choose is `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           For this plan to succeed I need to calculate where to place the object and provide the object location, pose values.
           
           The key to the `on` predicate is placing `v8` in an appropriate pose on `v18`. By examining the constraints of `v18` and the dimensions of `v8`, I've determined that placing `v8` at `#o2 = (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` will satisfy the `on` condition, with the last value indicating the object rotation. Now, I have all I need to calculate the poses.
           
           Finally, while the problem does not necessitate a detailed joint configuration plan, I understand the robotic actions required and the necessary environment constraints. I know that the 'canmove()' is a crucial feature that is used to set the preconditions of movement, such as `move_base` and `pick`. I have already analyzed this.
           
           With this three-step plan, the goal `new-axiom@0()` can be fulfilled.
