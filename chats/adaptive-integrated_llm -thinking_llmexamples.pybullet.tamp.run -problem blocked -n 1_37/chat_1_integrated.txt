User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           #o1: object

           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.303, -0.277), (-4.232, -0.206)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.267, -0.241, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.006).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0`, which, essentially, translates to placing an object of a specific type (v17) onto object v18.  I've analyzed the problem, recognizing the critical role of the 'on' predicate, defined by 'supported' and 'atpose'.  I have to find a pose for a suitable object of type v17 such that it will satisfy the 'on' precondition. Initial state identifies two objects of the correct type: v8 and v12.
           
           **Analysis of Existing State and Potential Actions**
           
           I've examined the initial state and noticed that, while v8 and v12 *could* be candidates, their current poses (v9 and v13, respectively) don't meet the 'on v18' condition. The problem is complicated by the presence of `supported` facts in my initial state.  I can't just pick something at random.  The action instance must be one in the limited action instance list.
           
           To achieve 'on(object, v18)', I'd need to manipulate the object's pose. But here's the kicker: I am only allowed to use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action *only* moves the robot's base without affecting the 'atpose' of the objects. It *could* allow the robot to reset, but does not manipulate objects.
           
           **Impossibility and Conclusion**
           
           Given the restrictions, it is impossible for me to satisfy my objective. No matter how much I analyze and iterate, the limited action instance available precludes me from modifying the initial state such that any object v17 type is "on v18".  The robot base actions are sufficient for *re*positioning, but not achieving the goal. This goal is unreachable.
