           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.303, -0.277), (-4.232, -0.206)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.267, -0.241, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.006).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Task: Achieving a New Axiom**
           
           I'm tasked with creating a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be "on" the object `v18`. Initially, I've identified two potential candidates for this object: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. The challenge lies in placing either of these on `v18`.  `v18` has an AABB of ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), indicating it's a surface.
           
           To achieve "on," I need to ensure the object is supported by `v18` and in the correct pose.  The initial state provides some crucial information: facts like  `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` suggest there are valid poses for `v8` on `v18`.  
           
           **My Strategy: Place V8 on V18**
           
           Given the initial setup, I'll attempt to place `v8` on `v18`. This involves a standard pick-and-place operation: I'll need to use the robot arm (`v4`) to first pick up `v8` (currently at pose `v9` supported by `v11`) and then place it onto `v18`.
           
           **The Plan: Move, Pick, Move, Place**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, the robot's base configuration (`v3`) must move to a location, say `#q0`, that allows the arm to pick `v8`. I'll assume the robot has a `basemotion` from `v3` to a configuration `#q0`. The cost for this is simply the distance between `v3` and `#q0`.
           2.  **Pick:** Then, the arm (`v4`) will pick up `v8` from pose `v9`. I'll use the action `pick v4 v8 v9 ...`, assuming the appropriate kinematic relationships hold between arm, object, and pose. The cost here is `pickcost()`, which is stated to be 1.
           3.  **Move Base (Again):**  Now I need the robot to move again. The arm should move to a pose `#q1` which is a valid location for the arm's base to allow the placement of `v8` at the goal. I'll utilize `move_base`. The cost of the move is the distance between `#q0` and `#q1`.
           4.  **Place:** Finally, the arm places `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#p0` using the action `place v4 v8 #p0 ...`.  The cost of the place action is `placecost()`, which is also 1.
           
           **Crucial Continuous Value: The Pose of V8 on V18**
           
           The key to all this is the continuous value of the target pose, `#p0`. Since the problem demands a stable placement, meaning I must ensure `v8` can be *fully contained* within the bounds of surface `v18`, and the problem states to "provide a continuous value for the pose such that, given the geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement". And the initial state gives `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` is given. In other words,  I must provide a valid `(x, y, z, theta)` pose.
           
           The AABB of `v18` is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  I'm interpreting this as a ground plane projection of a flat table-like object. In this case, `v8` AABB is (4.465, 0.265) to (4.535, 0.335). Since the Y range for the object is above the table, they don't overlap. Since the provided geometry conflicts with the instructions about the stable AABB, I must assume the predicate `supported` implies a feasible geometric relationship.
           
           Given that `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` is true, I must assume there exists a stable pose and I should try to find that using the center. So, for `#p0`, I'll place the object in the center and will *assume* the `supported` predicate means it's valid.
           
           I'll assume z of `0.8` to match other objects. So, the pose is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Goal Verification**
