User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.303, -0.277), (-4.232, -0.206)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.267, -0.241, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.006).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal and Strategy**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` onto `v18`. I first identify possible candidates for this object -  `v12` and `v8`. The initial state, however, shows that I can only manipulate `v8`. Therefore, my strategy will be to place `v8` onto `v18`. To achieve this, I must fulfill the axiom `on(?o, ?r)`.
           
           **Analyzing the Initial State and Available Actions**
           
           The axiom `on(?o, ?r)` requires the object to be supported and at the correct pose on the target surface. My initial examination reveals that I need to move `v8` from its current pose `v9` (supported by object `v11`) to a pose on `v18`.  `v18` is a table, and from its AABB range, I surmise a placement height to be `z = 0.8`. The available action instances comprise a `move_base` action that I judge to be unnecessary as base movement isn't required and `pick` and `place` actions that I will utilize.
           
           **Action Selection and Preconditions**
           
           I'll proceed with the following actions:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #at0)`: I select the arm `v4`, object `v8`, current pose `v9`, grasp `#o1`, base configuration `v3`, and define trajectory `#at0` for picking. The critical preconditions are `atpose(v8, v9)` (which is true), `handempty(v4)` (true), and `atbconf(v3)` (also true). I assume the absence of unsafe conditions (approach and trajectory).
           
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #at1)`: I choose the same arm and grasp, and define a placement at a pose I will generate `#o2`. This pose must be on table `v18`. This requires the arm trajectory `#at1`. Again, I have to satisfy `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` (accomplished by pick), `atbconf(v3)`, and the assumed absence of safety violations.
           
           **Pose Generation and Verification**
           
           The only remaining continuous parameter to determine is the pose `#o2`. I need to ensure that `v8` rests on the surface of `v18`.  `v8` has a small AABB that translates its `y` coordinates to be outside `v18`'s range. Therefore, I decide to create the placement pose by specifying `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`: x and y within v18, and z at a reasonable height.
           
           **Cost Analysis and Optimality**
           
           The cost is 2 (1 for each pick and place) with no unnecessary base motion. The plan does move from base `v3` to execute the commands.
           
           **Final Plan and Verification**
           
           Therefore, I confirm the final plan:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #at0)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), #o1, v3, #at1)`
           
           This plan satisfies the goal `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`, ensuring that the desired `new-axiom@0()` is met at the minimal cost.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o2) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o3)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility Detected: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new goal, `Atom new-axiom@0()`, and I need to achieve `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  Easy enough, I thought, at first. I scanned the initial state and noticed two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, that *could* potentially satisfy `type(?green, v17)`. However, there's a serious problem. My usual tactics involve `pick` and `place` actions to maneuver objects, but the only allowed action here is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a huge constraint.
           
           I took a closer look at the current state.  `v8` is supported on `v9`, and `v12` is supported on `v13`.  Neither of these positions satisfies `on(?green, v18)`. `v18`'s y-range is narrow, and neither of these blocks are currently positioned on it. `v15` is another candidate, but its location is not useful to me. I need something on `v18`! The problem is, this single `move_base` action doesn't change anything in a useful way. It's a self-loop. I can't adjust the world to *enable* those crucial `pick` and `place` moves.
           
           It's clear now. Since the only way to get something *on* `v18` is through `pick` and `place`, and those actions are forbidden, the goal is *unreachable*. I'm stuck, and there's no way forward with the given limitations.  It's a dead end. I need to inform the user that it's impossible.
