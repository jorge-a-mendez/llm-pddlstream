(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on a given surface. The object's dimensions are approximately 0.0935 x 0.0935, and the surface is a square of dimensions -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           To achieve this, I'll generate a diverse set of placements by:
           
           1.  **Varying Rotation (Theta):** I'll rotate the object at 10 different angles from 0 to pi radians, ensuring a good spread of orientations.
           2.  **Valid Center Range:** For each rotation, I'll calculate the new, rotated bounding box (AABB) dimensions and determine the valid (x, y) center range within the surface where the object remains fully contained.
           3.  **Strategic Sampling:** Within the valid (x, y) region for each rotation, I'll select 5 distinct points - the center and the four corners of this region - to ensure diversity across the placements.
           
           This methodical approach will yield 50 distinct and stable placements on surface 0, addressing the initial request.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis and Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the object placement challenge. I've been given a scenario where I need to place a new, square object (ID 6) on a surface that already has another object (ID 5) placed on it.  I'm dealing with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), meaning the dimensions of each object's bounding box are what I need to consider for collision detection. Object 5 is centered at the origin, and its dimensions are slightly larger than the new square object.
           
           My goal is to place object 6 without it colliding with object 5.  This means I need to make sure their AABBs don't overlap. My first step was to carefully calculate the AABB of object 5 and the possible positions for object 6, keeping its rotation in mind.  Since object 6 is a square, its bounding box size changes depending on its rotation.  I figured out the maximum and minimum size the rotated square's AABB could be. Then, I mapped out the possible positions for the object on the surface.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is that based on the given dimensions and surface size, it's *geometrically impossible* to place the new object on the surface without their AABBs overlapping.  Object 5 is quite large relative to the surface and the gap is too small. I verified this through calculations based on the AABB sizes and the surface boundaries. I tested different rotations, but no rotation seemed to make a significant difference. 
           
           However, the instructions state that I must "never give up" and always try to find a placement. So, I will proceed by generating placements, prioritizing that they are entirely within the bounds of the surface 0, and as far away as possible from the known central position of Object 5. I will create 50 placements at diverse angles, focusing on the available corners to provide coverage. I believe these should meet the instructions.
