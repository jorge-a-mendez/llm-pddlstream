           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.158, -0.557), (1.299, -0.416)).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.991, 2.066), (-1.919, 2.138)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           4. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a stone (type v2)
           5. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a soil (type v6)
           
           Let's analyze the initial state and how we can achieve these conditions.
           
           **Conditions 1 and 2:**
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true initially.
           These conditions are already met.
           
           **Condition 3: `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`**
           To achieve `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, we need to:
           1. `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)`: This requires `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`, `onboard(?c, ?v)`, `supports(?c, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, and `~blocked(?y)`. This action makes `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)` true and `calibrated(?c, ?v)` false.
           2. `calibrate(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c)`: This requires `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`, `onboard(?c, ?v)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `~blocked(?y)`. This action makes `calibrated(?c, ?v)` true.
           3. `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)`: This requires `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `objective(?o)`, `mode(?m)`, `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `~blocked(?y)`. This action makes `receivedimage(?o, ?m)` true.
           
           Let's look at available image visibility:
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` for rover `v12`.
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` for rover `v14`.
           
           We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and both can see `v17` and `v18` from configuration `#o3` with camera `v10` in mode `v11`. Lander `v9` is visible for communication from configuration `#o0` for both rovers.
           
           To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - We can use rover `v12` to take images of `v17` and `v18`, and then send them.
               - Calibrate `v10` for `v17` at `#o3` (since `calibrated` is not initially true).
               - Take image of `v17` with `v10` at `#o3`.
               - Calibrate `v10` for `v18` at `#o3`.
               - Take image of `v18` with `v10` at `#o3`.
               - Send image of `v17` at `#o0`.
               - Send image of `v18` at `#o0`.
           
           **Condition 4: `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2)**
           There are three rocks of type v2: `v1`, `v3`, and `v4`.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)`, we need to:
           1. `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)`: This requires `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`, `store(?s)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `free(?v, ?s)`. This makes `full(?v, ?s)` and `analyzed(?v, ?r)` true.
           2. `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)`: This requires `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`, `rock(?r)`, `analyzed(?v, ?r)`, `atconf(?v, ?q)`, and `~blocked(?y)`. This makes `receivedanalysis(?r)` true.
           
           We have `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`. Let's pick `v4` (type v2) and rover `v12`.
           - Sample `v4` using `v12` at `#o5` with `v16` store.
           - Send analysis of `v4` using `v12` at `#o0`.
           
           **Condition 5: `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6)**
           There are three rocks of type v6: `v5`, `v7`, and `v8`.
           We have `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`. Let's pick `v8` (type v6) and rover `v14`.
           - Sample `v8` using `v14` at `#o5` with `v16` store.
           - Send analysis of `v8` using `v14` at `#o0`.
           
           Both rovers have `onboard(v10, <rover>)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           The available actions are just `move` and `drop_rock`. This means we cannot take images, send images, sample, or send analysis if those actions are not explicitly provided in the list of available actions. However, the problem statement provides all possible actions the robot *can* perform, and then lists *valid action instances*. This is a crucial distinction. The general actions are available, but their specific instantiations must be from the allowed set. The allowed set only contains `move` and `drop_rock`, which cannot achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided *instances* of actions.
           
           Wait, I need to re-read the problem statement carefully: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means only `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16` are allowed.
           
           This is highly restrictive. If only move and drop_rock are allowed, then the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which requires receiving images and analyses) is absolutely not achievable. The initial state already satisfies `atconf` and `free`. However, `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are false. None of the allowed actions can make these true.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. The initial state does not contain any of these predicates as true. The available actions are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions can change the state of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
