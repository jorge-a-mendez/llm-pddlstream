User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three valid (x, y) positions for a robot's base near the target point (-1.0, 0.0). These positions must be within a 2-meter radius of the target, avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles I was given, and maintain a clear line of sight to the target. The robot's orientation will be set to face the target automatically, so that part's easy.  I also need to ensure the positions stay within the room's operating limits of [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y.
           
           I've carefully examined the provided list of fixed AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes), which represent the walls and obstacles in the environment.  The central vertical wall at x=0 is the most critical obstacle for line-of-sight considerations, as it effectively splits the space. Since the target is on the left side (x < 0), I'm primarily looking for positions that also keep the robot on the left side, or at least close enough to the central wall to maintain a clear line of sight.
           
           Based on this analysis and the need to have a diverse set of positions, I've selected the following:
           
           1.  **(-2.4, 0.0):** This position is on the left side of the room, near the x boundary, but *just* inside to avoid wall collision. It is 1.4 meters away from the target, and the line of sight (horizontal) is clear.
           2.  **(-1.0, 1.5):** This position is 1.5 meters away and directly above the target. The line of sight is vertical, and all the relevant obstacles are either too far away or outside of the y-range of my line-of-sight.
           3.  **(-1.0, -1.5):** This position, also 1.5 meters away, is directly below the target. The line of sight is again vertical, with no obstacles present.
           
           I've meticulously checked for collisions and line-of-sight obstructions for each of these candidate positions. They all meet the criteria, so I'm confident in these three answers.
