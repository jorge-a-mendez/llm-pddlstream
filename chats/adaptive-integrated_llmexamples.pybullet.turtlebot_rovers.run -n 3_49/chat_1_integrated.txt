           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. Rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. There are multiple rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19). The lander v9 is also present, which is needed to send images and analyses. The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` (This implies any rock of type v2 needs to be analyzed and received)
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where ?stone is any rock of type v2)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` (This implies any rock of type v6 needs to be analyzed and received)
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where ?soil is any rock of type v6)
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - The `type` predicates indicate:
               - `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` are of type `v2` (stone).
               - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Therefore, the main tasks are to:
           1. Obtain and send images for objectives v17, v18, and v19.
           2. Sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type `v2` (stone) and at least one rock of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Let's use rover v12 for image tasks and rover v14 for sampling and analysis.
           
           For images (objectives v17, v18, v19):
           Rover v12 is currently at `v13`. We need to move it to `#o3` (which is `conf(v12, #o3)` and also has `imagevisible` to all three objectives) to take images. Then, it can move to `#o0` to `comvisible` to the lander and send the images.
           
           For analysis (rocks of type v2 and v6):
           Rover v14 is currently at `v15`. We need to move it to `#o5` (which is `conf(v14, #o5)` and has `above` predicates for all rocks) to sample rocks. We will pick one rock of type v2 (e.g., v1) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). After sampling, it can move to `#o0` to `comvisible` to the lander and send the analyses.
           
           Since both rovers are currently at a configuration that is not used in the plan (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14), we will need to move them to their respective starting configurations for the tasks.
           
           The order of operations:
           1. Rover v12 moves to `#o3`.
           2. Rover v12 calibrates its camera.
           3. Rover v12 takes images of v17, v18, v19.
           4. Rover v12 moves to `#o0`.
           5. Rover v12 sends images of v17, v18, v19.
           6. Rover v14 moves to `#o5`.
           7. Rover v14 samples rock v1 (type v2).
           8. Rover v14 samples rock v5 (type v6).
           9. Rover v14 moves to `#o0`.
           10. Rover v14 sends analysis for v1 and v5.
           
           This plan achieves all required conditions.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. Rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. There are multiple rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19). The lander v9 is also present, which is needed to send images and analyses. The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` (This implies any rock of type v2 needs to be analyzed and received)
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where ?stone is any rock of type v2)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` (This implies any rock of type v6 needs to be analyzed and received)
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where ?soil is any rock of type v6)
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - The `type` predicates indicate:
               - `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` are of type `v2` (stone).
               - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Therefore, the main tasks are to:
           1. Obtain and send images for objectives v17, v18, and v19.
           2. Sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type `v2` (stone) and at least one rock of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Let's use rover v12 for image tasks and rover v14 for sampling and analysis.
           
           For images (objectives v17, v18, v19):
           Rover v12 is currently at `v13`. We need to move it to `#o3` (which is `conf(v12, #o3)` and also has `imagevisible` to all three objectives) to take images. Then, it can move to `#o0` to `comvisible` to the lander and send the images.
           
           For analysis (rocks of type v2 and v6):
           Rover v14 is currently at `v15`. We need to move it to `#o5` (which is `conf(v14, #o5)` and has `above` predicates for all rocks) to sample rocks. We will pick one rock of type v2 (e.g., v1) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). After sampling, it can move to `#o0` to `comvisible` to the lander and send the analyses.
           
           Since both rovers are currently at a configuration that is not used in the plan (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14), we will need to move them to their respective starting configurations for the tasks.
           
           The order of operations:
           1. Rover v12 moves to `#o3`.
           2. Rover v12 calibrates its camera.
           3. Rover v12 takes images of v17, v18, v19.
           4. Rover v12 moves to `#o0`.
           5. Rover v12 sends images of v17, v18, v19.
           6. Rover v14 moves to `#o5`.
           7. Rover v14 samples rock v1 (type v2).
           8. Rover v14 samples rock v5 (type v6).
           9. Rover v14 moves to `#o0`.
           10. Rover v14 sends analysis for v1 and v5.
           
           This plan achieves all required conditions.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. Rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. There are multiple rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19). The lander v9 is also present, which is needed to send images and analyses. The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `type(?stone, v2)` (This implies any rock of type v2 needs to be analyzed and received)
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where ?stone is any rock of type v2)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` (This implies any rock of type v6 needs to be analyzed and received)
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where ?soil is any rock of type v6)
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - The `type` predicates indicate:
               - `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` are of type `v2` (stone).
               - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           Therefore, the main tasks are to:
           1. Obtain and send images for objectives v17, v18, and v19.
           2. Sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type `v2` (stone) and at least one rock of type `v6` (soil).
           
           We need to find collision-free configurations for rover v12 to take images and communicate, and for rover v14 to sample and communicate. The previous configurations (0.0, 0.0) were in collision with obstacle v20 (AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))). This obstacle is a thin wall or object along the y-axis at x=0.0. We should choose configurations that avoid this x=0.0 line.
           
           Let's adjust the x-coordinate for the new configurations to avoid the collision.
           
           For images (objectives v17, v18, v19) with rover v12:
           - v17 is at ((-1.854, 2.037), (-1.757, 2.134)).
           - v18 is at ((2.138, 1.846), (2.227, 1.936)).
           - v19 is at ((-0.414, 1.773), (-0.336, 1.851)).
           To view these objectives, rover v12 at configuration #o3 should be within 2 units.
           Let's try (1.0, 1.0) for #o3. This avoids x=0.0.
           Then to communicate to lander v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)), rover v12 at configuration #o0 should be within 4 units.
           Let's try (-1.0, -1.0) for #o0. This avoids x=0.0.
           
           For analysis (rocks of type v2 and v6) with rover v14:
           - v1 (type v2) is at ((-1.393, -0.906), (-1.29, -0.803)).
           - v5 (type v6) is at ((0.702, -1.082), (0.843, -0.941)).
           To be above these rocks, rover v14 at configuration #o5 should be close to them.
           Let's try (0.0, -1.0) for #o5. This is likely to still be in collision with v20 if the rover's body extends beyond x=0.0. Let's try (0.5, -1.0) to sample rock v5 and (-1.5, -1.0) to sample rock v1, then moving to a common point. The initial state has `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)` etc., suggesting one configuration `#o5` can be used for all. Let's pick a configuration that is close to the average of the rock locations and avoids x=0.0. For example, considering v1 and v5, which are at x approx -1.3 and x approx 0.7. So an x around -0.3 might be good, but that could hit v20. Let's try x=0.2. So, for #o5, let's try (0.2, -1.0).
           Then to communicate to lander v9, rover v14 at configuration #o0 should be within 4 units.
           Let's try (-1.0, -1.0) for #o0 (same as rover v12 for communication).
           
           The plan is the same, only the configurations need to be updated.

           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (initially true)
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2`
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6`
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations, considering the reachability and collision with `v20` (AABB at x=0).
           Rover v12 is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover v14 is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           **For Rover v12 (Image tasks):**
           Objectives: v17 (x near -1.8), v18 (x near 2.2), v19 (x near -0.4).
           Lander v9: (x near -2.4 to -1.4).
           
           To image all three objectives, a configuration for `#o3` must be able to see all of them. Since v17 and v19 are on the left side (negative x) and v18 is on the right side (positive x), a central location with a wide field of view might be needed. Or, we could use multiple image-taking actions, but the problem states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`, implying a single `#o3` can see all three. This would mean that the robot camera can pivot.
           
           Given the current position of v12 at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), a reachable configuration for `#o3` should be close.
           Let's try a configuration for `#o3` like (1.5, -1.75). From this position, it should be able to turn and view v17, v18, and v19, avoiding the x=0 collision. The max range is 2 for `imagevisible`.
           - From (1.5, -1.75):
               - To v18 ((2.138, 1.846), (2.227, 1.936)): dist approx sqrt((2.2-1.5)^2 + (1.9-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.7^2 + 3.65^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 13.32) = 3.7. This is too far for imagevisible (max 2).
           
           This suggests that a single configuration for `#o3` may not satisfy the distance requirement for all three objectives, or the default x=1.0, y=-1.75 is already near enough to some objectives that moving slightly is enough.
           Let's consider the initial configurations and the targets.
           Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75).
           - v17: ((-1.854, 2.037), (-1.757, 2.134)) -> dist to v13 is sqrt((-1.8-1)^2 + (2.1-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.8^2 + 3.85^2) = sqrt(7.84 + 14.82) = 4.75. Too far.
           - v18: ((2.138, 1.846), (2.227, 1.936)) -> dist to v13 is sqrt((2.2-1)^2 + (1.9-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.2^2 + 3.65^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 13.32) = 3.84. Too far.
           - v19: ((-0.414, 1.773), (-0.336, 1.851)) -> dist to v13 is sqrt((-0.3-1)^2 + (1.8-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.3^2 + 3.55^2) = sqrt(1.69 + 12.6) = 3.78. Too far.
           
           It seems the `imagevisible` predicates are given for `#o3`, which must be a different configuration than `v13`. If `#o3` needs to see all three, and given the robot can only move between current and defined configurations, there needs to be a specific `#o3` configuration that enables this.
           Let's try a central position for `#o3` that has a good view of all three objectives. For instance, roughly (0.0, 1.8). But (0.0, 1.8) collides with v20.
           How about (0.1, 1.8)? This could work for `imagevisible`.
           - From (0.1, 1.8):
               - To v17 (avg -1.8, 2.0): dist approx sqrt((-1.8-0.1)^2 + (2.0-1.8)^2) = sqrt((-1.9)^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 0.04) = sqrt(3.65) = 1.91. (OK)
               - To v18 (avg 2.1, 1.9): dist approx sqrt((2.1-0.1)^2 + (1.9-1.8)^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(4.0 + 0.01) = sqrt(4.01) = 2.00. (OK)
               - To v19 (avg -0.37, 1.8): dist approx sqrt((-0.37-0.1)^2 + (1.8-1.8)^2) = sqrt((-0.47)^2 + 0^2) = 0.47. (OK)
           
           So, `#o3 = (0.1, 1.8)` seems viable for image taking.
           Now, for communication `#o0` for v12 with v9 (lander at x between -2.4 to -1.4, y between -2.3 to -1.6). Rover v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (-1.5, -1.75) would be within 4 units of the lander and reachable from v13.
           - From (-1.5, -1.75):
               - To v9 (avg -1.9, -2.0): dist approx sqrt((-1.9-(-1.5))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.2225) = 0.47. (OK)
           This also avoids x=0.0.
           
           **For Rover v14 (Sample and Analyze):**
           Rocks: v1 (x near -1.3), v3 (x near 2.1), v4 (x near 1.9), v5 (x near 0.7), v7 (x near 1.7), v8 (x near 0.3).
           Rover v14 is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           We need to sample a type `v2` rock (v1, v3, v4) and a type `v6` rock (v5, v7, v8).
           The initial state shows `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, etc. indicating a single `#o5` for sampling.
           Let's choose a configuration for `#o5` that is reasonably central to the available rocks and avoids x=0.0 and is reachable from `v15`.
           A good candidate rock to sample of type v2 is v1 (x near -1.3) since v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           A good candidate rock to sample of type v6 is v5 (x near 0.7) or v8 (x near 0.3).
           Let's try a configuration for `#o5` like (0.2, -1.0) again. This was colliding before because of v20 at x=0.0. Let's try (0.6, -1.0). This will be near v5 and v8, and should be reachable from v15.
           - From (0.6, -1.0):
               - Above v1: This is not guaranteed given the x-coordinate difference. Let's pick a configuration that is above multiple rocks.
               - Since v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75), a configuration close to it like (-1.0, -1.0) for #o5 is reachable and would be above v1. This avoids v20. Then we can move to a different configuration to sample v5. However, `above` predicates are for *one* #o5. Let's reconsider.
           
           The problem implies `above(?v: object, ?q: object, ?r: object)` for a single `?q`. This means that `#o5` must be above *all* rocks we plan to sample. This is difficult given their spread.
           
           Let's assume the provided `above(v14, #o5, v1)` implies that there exists a valid `#o5` where v14 can be above v1. Same for v5.
           We need one rock of type `v2` (stone) and one of type `v6` (soil).
           From the initial state: `type(v1, v2)` and `type(v5, v6)`.
           Let's use `v1` and `v5`.
           For `#o5` to be above both v1 and v5, it needs to be near both. v1 is around (-1.3, -0.8), v5 is around (0.7, -1.0).
           This means `#o5` would need to be around (-0.3, -0.9). This x-coordinate is very close to 0. Let's try (-0.1, -1.0) as `#o5`. This will still collide with v20.
           How about we re-examine the `above` predicates. `above` does not imply visibility or range, it's just a pose.
           
           Perhaps the original statement means that multiple different `#o5` configurations can be used. But the format requires one # for each, so it must be one #o5 for rover v14 to be above *some* rocks.
           Let's try to find a single `#o5` configuration that is *above* at least one type v2 rock and at least one type v6 rock, and is collision-free.
           The rocks are spread out. It is highly unlikely that one configuration `#o5` is above v1 (x=-1.3) and v5 (x=0.7).
           The prompt states: `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`. This means there is *one* `#o5` for `v12` that can be above many rocks. Similar for `v14`. This is the intended meaning.
           
           So, for rover v14 to sample v1 (type v2) and v5 (type v6) at `#o5`.
           v1: ((-1.393, -0.906), (-1.29, -0.803))
           v5: ((0.702, -1.082), (0.843, -0.941))
           A point near both might be difficult to be collision free with v20.
           Let's try (-0.5, -0.9) for `#o5`. This is close to the average y, and x is to the left of 0.
           - From (-0.5, -0.9):
               - Above v1 (x=-1.3): OK (within reasonable arm reach for sampling).
               - Above v5 (x=0.7): OK (within reasonable arm reach for sampling).
           This is reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For communication `#o0` for v14 with v9 (lander):
           - Let's try (-1.5, -1.75) for `#o0`, same as v12's communication point. This avoids x=0.0 and is reachable from `v15`.
           
           **Summary of proposed configurations:**
           - Rover v12 image configuration (`#o3`): (0.1, 1.8)
           - Rover v12 communication configuration (`#o0`): (-1.5, -1.75)
           - Rover v14 sampling configuration (`#o5`): (-0.5, -0.9)
           - Rover v14 communication configuration (`#o0` - for v14): (-1.5, -1.75)
           
           Note that the same `#o0` is used for both rovers to communicate with the lander. The prompt says "if the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs... then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". Since the rover-target pair (v12, v9) and (v14, v9) are different, we need to specify `#o0` for v12 and `#o0` for v14. Let's use #o0_v12 and #o0_v14 to be explicit and assign the same coordinates if they work.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The issue with the previous plan was the use of `#o0_v12` and `#o0_v14` as distinct configuration names in the actions, while the provided list of valid actions only includes `#o0`. This means that `#o0` must represent a single configuration that both rovers can potentially use for communication. Similarly, `#o3` and `#o5` are generic configuration names.
           
           Let's adjust the plan to use the generic `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` configurations as defined in the available actions. This implies that there must exist suitable physical values for these configurations that are collision-free and reachable for both rovers from their respective initial or intermediate positions to perform the intended actions.
           
           The goal remains the same:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (initially true)
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (initially true)
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2` (e.g., v1)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for rocks of type `v6` (e.g., v5)
           
           We will use:
           - Rover v12 for image tasks (objectives v17, v18, v19) and sending images.
           - Rover v14 for sampling rocks (v1 and v5) and sending analyses.
           
           **Configuration Strategy:**
           1.  **#o3 (Image-taking configuration):** For rover v12 to take images of v17, v18, and v19.
               *   v17 (x near -1.8), v18 (x near 2.2), v19 (x near -0.4).
               *   Previous attempt: (0.1, 1.8) worked for image range and avoided v20 (AABB at x=0). This should be reachable from v12's start v13 (1.0, -1.75).
           2.  **#o0 (Communication configuration):** For both rovers to send data to lander v9 (x near -1.9, y near -2.0).
               *   Previous attempt: (-1.5, -1.75) worked for communication range and avoided v20. This should be reachable from v12's start v13 (1.0, -1.75) and v14's start v15 (-1.0, -1.75).
           3.  **#o5 (Sampling configuration):** For rover v14 to sample rocks v1 (type v2, x near -1.3) and v5 (type v6, x near 0.7).
               *   Previous attempt: (-0.5, -0.9) worked for being "above" both rocks and avoided v20. This should be reachable from v14's start v15 (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           Let's check reachability for these configurations from the initial positions:
           *   v12 from v13 (1.0, -1.75) to #o3 (0.1, 1.8): Movement is roughly (-0.9, 3.55). This is a significant move but likely within the robot's capabilities.
           *   v12 from #o3 (0.1, 1.8) to #o0 (-1.5, -1.75): Movement is roughly (-1.6, -3.55). Also a significant move.
           *   v14 from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) to #o5 (-0.5, -0.9): Movement is roughly (0.5, 0.85). This is a shorter move, more easily reachable.
           *   v14 from #o5 (-0.5, -0.9) to #o0 (-1.5, -1.75): Movement is roughly (-1.0, -0.85). Also a reasonable move.
           
           The plan will now use the general `#o0` configuration for all communication actions, and similarly for `#o3` and `#o5`.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous configurations resulted in collisions or unreachability. Let's re-evaluate the object positions and constraints carefully to find suitable configurations.
           
           **Obstacles:**
           *   `v20`: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)) - This is a thin wall at x=0.
           *   `v21`: AABB(lower=(0.25, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(0.75, 2.25, 0.1)) - This is an obstacle around x=0.5, y=2.0.
           *   `v9`: AABB(lower=(-2.4, -2.3), upper=(-1.3, -1.6)) - This is the lander itself, which is a fixed obstacle. The rover should be *near* it for `comvisible`, but not *in* it.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12`: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14`: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **Tasks:**
           1.  **Images for v17, v18, v19** (max range 2 for `imagevisible`) using `v12` from `#o3`.
               *   `v17`: ((-1.85, 2.03), (-1.75, 2.13))
               *   `v18`: ((2.13, 1.84), (2.22, 1.93))
               *   `v19`: ((-0.41, 1.77), (-0.33, 1.85))
           
               To avoid `v20` (x=0) and `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25), and be within range of the objectives, we need a configuration that has a clear line of sight to all three and is reachable from `v13`. Given the spread of x-coordinates for the objectives, a single configuration that can view all of them is tricky. However, the problem statement implies a single `#o3` works. Let's try to place `#o3` at a location with positive X to avoid `v20` and `v21`, but not too far from `v17` and `v19`.
           
               Let's try `#o3` = (1.5, 0.0).
               *   From (1.5, 0.0) to `v17` (avg -1.8, 2.0): `dist = sqrt((-1.8-1.5)^2 + (2.0-0.0)^2) = sqrt(3.3^2 + 2.0^2) = sqrt(10.89 + 4) = sqrt(14.89) = 3.8`. Too far (max 2).
           
               It seems highly unlikely that a single position `#o3` can satisfy the `imagevisible` range requirement for all three objectives (v17, v18, v19) given their separation and the limited range of 2. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of how `#o3` is used or the camera's field of view. However, the initial state provides:
               `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
               `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
               This means such a configuration `#o3` *must* exist. The coordinates provided are for the robot base. The camera itself can pan and tilt. This means we only need a base configuration that allows the camera to see the targets from that position, respecting the 2m range.
           
               Let's try placing `#o3` closer to the objectives and avoiding obstacles.
               *   `v19` is at ((-0.41, 1.77), (-0.33, 1.85)).
               *   `v17` is at ((-1.85, 2.03), (-1.75, 2.13)).
               *   `v18` is at ((2.13, 1.84), (2.22, 1.93)).
           
               A good compromise might be near `v19`. Let's try `#o3` = (-0.7, 1.5).
               *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No, x=-0.7 is clear.
               *   Collision with `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25)? No, x=-0.7, y=1.5 is clear.
               *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? Yes, `dist = sqrt((-0.7-1.0)^2 + (1.5-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.7)^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(2.89 + 10.56) = sqrt(13.45) = 3.6`. This is a long move but probably within reach of a rover.
               *   Image range check from (-0.7, 1.5):
                   *   To `v17` (avg -1.8, 2.0): `dist = sqrt((-1.8-(-0.7))^2 + (2.0-1.5)^2) = sqrt((-1.1)^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.46) = 1.2`. (OK)
                   *   To `v18` (avg 2.1, 1.9): `dist = sqrt((2.1-(-0.7))^2 + (1.9-1.5)^2) = sqrt(2.8^2 + 0.4^2) = sqrt(7.84 + 0.16) = sqrt(8) = 2.8`. (Too far, max 2).
           
               This suggests a central point is not working. The problem might be indicating that the coordinates should allow *some* objectives to be visible, not necessarily all simultaneously. However, the action sequence implies taking all three images from a single `#o3`.
               If the provided actions allow multiple `take_image` actions from the same `#o3` to different objects, that is the interpretation. The collision message for `v21` was for (0.1, 1.8).
           
               Let's try moving v12 to a location where it can see v18 (positive x) and then move to another where it can see v17/v19 (negative x). But this would require separate #o3 configurations. The problem structure implies only one `#o3`.
               This means a global configuration for `#o3` is expected. Maybe the camera can zoom or has a wider field of view than strictly 2m point-to-point. Given the constraints, I must choose a configuration that is *not* in collision and is reachable, and hope the imagevisible predicate is satisfied.
           
               What if we put `#o3` on the far right, near `v18`?
               Let `#o3` = (1.8, 1.5)
               *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No.
               *   Collision with `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25)? No.
               *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? Yes, `dist = sqrt((1.8-1.0)^2 + (1.5-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.8^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(0.64 + 10.56) = sqrt(11.2) = 3.3`. (OK).
               *   Image range check from (1.8, 1.5):
                   *   To `v18` (avg 2.1, 1.9): `dist = sqrt((2.1-1.8)^2 + (1.9-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 0.4^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5`. (OK)
                   *   To `v17` (avg -1.8, 2.0): `dist = sqrt((-1.8-1.8)^2 + (2.0-1.5)^2) = sqrt((-3.6)^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(12.96 + 0.25) = sqrt(13.21) = 3.6`. (Too far)
           
               This implies that for the given `imagevisible` predicates, the implicit camera range/FOV is much larger than just 2m from base to object center, or that the configurations for `#o3` in the initial state *are* such that all objectives are visible from that single base position. I will assume the latter and select a configuration that satisfies collision and reachability, and hope it satisfies the implicit vision requirements. Let's try `#o3` = (1.0, 1.0) again. It failed for reachability before, but perhaps I can choose a path. Also the previous collision was with `v20`. (1.0, 1.0) is clear of `v20`. But it's also clear of `v21` (y=1.0 < 1.75).
               Let's use `(1.0, 1.0)` for `#o3` as it avoids `v20` and `v21`. Reachability will be assumed for the planner.
           
           2.  **Communication for v12 and v14 to v9** (max range 4 for `comvisible`) from `#o0`.
               *   `v9`: (lower=(-2.4, -2.3), upper=(-1.3, -1.6)).
               *   Previous `#o0` = (-1.5, -1.75) was *in collision with v9 itself*. This means the rover cannot occupy the same space as the lander. The rover needs to be *near* the lander, but not on it.
               *   Let's pick a point adjacent to the lander, say (-1.0, -1.75). This is actually `v15`, the start config for v14. This is a valid config and should be fine for communication for both rovers.
                   *   Check `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `#o0` (-1.0, -1.75): `dist = sqrt((-1.0-1.0)^2 + (-1.75-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-2.0)^2 + 0^2) = 2.0`. (Reachable).
                   *   Check `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `#o0` (-1.0, -1.75): This is `v15` itself. No movement needed if `v15` is used as `#o0`.
           
               So, let's use `#o0` = (-1.0, -1.75) for both.
           
           3.  **Sampling for v1 and v5** using `v14` from `#o5`.
               *   `v1` (type v2): ((-1.39, -0.90), (-1.29, -0.80))
               *   `v5` (type v6): ((0.70, -1.08), (0.84, -0.94))
               *   `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Previous `#o5` = (-0.5, -0.9) was not reachable for robot base. This means the path from v15 to (-0.5, -0.9) might be blocked or the coordinate is simply too far. The 'above' predicate implies a specific pose to sample.
               *   Let's try `#o5` = (-1.0, -0.8). This is close to `v1` (x=-1.3) and reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
                   *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No, x=-1.0 is clear.
                   *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? Yes, `dist = sqrt((-1.0-(-1.0))^2 + (-0.8-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + 0.95^2) = 0.95`. (Reachable).
                   *   Above `v1` (x near -1.3): Yes, close.
                   *   Above `v5` (x near 0.7): No, this is too far from `v5`. The problem implies a single `#o5` for sampling multiple rocks. This is the hardest part. The definition of `above` implies a direct vertical relationship, suggesting the rover base has to be close to the rock's location.
           
               Given that multiple `above` predicates exist for *one* `#o5` (`above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)` etc.), I must assume such a configuration `#o5` exists in the scene and is reachable. Let's try to find an `#o5` that is a compromise between v1 (x~-1.3) and v5 (x~0.7).
               How about `(0.0, -0.9)`? This collides with `v20`.
               Let's try `(0.1, -0.9)`. This avoids `v20`.
               *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((0.1-(-1.0))^2 + (-0.9-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + 0.85^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.7225) = sqrt(1.9325) = 1.39`. (Reachable).
               *   Above `v1` (x near -1.3)? `dist_x = abs(-1.3-0.1) = 1.4`. May be too far.
               *   Above `v5` (x near 0.7)? `dist_x = abs(0.7-0.1) = 0.6`. Good.
           
               If a single `#o5` must be used, it needs to be near both. The initial state implies `above` means the rover's sampling arm can reach it. This is not strictly a robot base position. I must pick one point that is reasonable for *both* v1 and v5. Let's try placing `#o5` at x=-0.5, y=-0.9 again. The previous error was "not reachable for robot base". This could mean the path to it, not the point itself, was blocked. Let's assume a clear path can be found for it.
           
           Let's refine the configurations based on the latest feedback:
           
           *   **#o3 (Image-taking):** For `v12` (from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)). Targets: `v17` (x~-1.8), `v18` (x~2.2), `v19` (x~-0.4). `v20` at x=0. `v21` at x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25.
               *   Need to avoid `v20` and `v21`. The closest to all objectives without collision seems to be in the positive x, above `v21` in y, or to the left of `v20` in x.
               *   Let's try placing `#o3` at (-1.0, 1.0).
                   *   Collision with `v20`, `v21`? No.
                   *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-1.0-1.0)^2 + (1.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(4 + 7.56) = 3.4`. (Reachable).
                   *   Image range for `v18` (x~2.2, y~1.9) from (-1.0, 1.0): `dist = sqrt((2.2-(-1.0))^2 + (1.9-1.0)^2) = sqrt(3.2^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(10.24 + 0.81) = sqrt(11.05) = 3.3`. (Too far for 2m range).
           
               Given the hard limit of 2m for `imagevisible`, and the spread of targets, it seems impossible for a single configuration to view all three.
               However, the PDDL initial state *explicitly lists* `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`. This implies such a configuration `#o3` must exist and be valid for all three *with the given rays*. The problem is asking me for *a value* for `#o3`, not to verify its visibility, as long as it's collision-free and reachable.
           
               Let's choose a relatively central and collision-free location for `#o3`.
               *   `v19` is at x between -0.4 and -0.3.
               *   `v17` is at x between -1.8 and -1.7.
               *   `v18` is at x between 2.1 and 2.2.
               *   Y-coordinates are all around 1.8-2.1.
               *   `v20` is at x=0. `v21` is at x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25.
               Let's try `#o3` at (0.0, 1.5). This location *is* in collision with `v20`. So, let's try (0.1, 1.5). This avoids `v20`.
               *   Collision with `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25)? No, x=0.1 is clear.
               *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((0.1-1.0)^2 + (1.5-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + 3.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 10.56) = sqrt(11.37) = 3.37`. (Reachable).
           
           *   **#o0 (Communication):** For `v12` (from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)) and `v14` (from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)). Target `v9` (lander at x between -2.4 to -1.3, y between -2.3 to -1.6). `v9` itself is an obstacle.
               *   The previous attempt (-1.5, -1.75) collided with `v9`. This is because the configuration was inside the lander's bounding box.
               *   Let's place `#o0` adjacent to `v9`, e.g., slightly outside its x-range but within comrange 4m.
               *   `v9`'s max X is -1.395. Let's try `#o0` at (-1.3, -1.75). This is outside the AABB of v9 on the positive x side, but very close.
                   *   Reachable for `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-1.3-1.0)^2 + (-1.75-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-2.3)^2 + 0^2) = 2.3`. (Reachable).
                   *   Reachable for `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-1.3-(-1.0))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.3)^2 + 0^2) = 0.3`. (Reachable).
                   *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No, x=-1.3 is clear.
           
           *   **#o5 (Sampling):** For `v14` (from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)). Target rocks `v1` (x~-1.3) and `v5` (x~0.7).
               *   Previous attempt (-0.5, -0.9) was not reachable.
               *   Again, need a single `#o5` for both rocks.
               *   Let's try placing `#o5` at (-0.7, -1.0).
                   *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No, x=-0.7 is clear.
                   *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-0.7-(-1.0))^2 + (-1.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + 0.75^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.5625) = sqrt(0.6525) = 0.8`. (Reachable).
                   *   Above `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9): `abs(x_diff) = abs(-1.3 - (-0.7)) = 0.6`. Good for arm reach.
                   *   Above `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0): `abs(x_diff) = abs(0.7 - (-0.7)) = 1.4`. This is quite a reach, but might be acceptable given the `above` predicate in the initial state.
           
           Final proposed configurations:
           *   `#o3` (Image-taking for v12): (0.1, 1.5)
           *   `#o0` (Communication for v12 and v14): (-1.3, -1.75)

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent issues with collisions and reachability suggest that the chosen coordinates are still problematic, especially with the `v20` obstacle at `x=0` and `v9` (lander) itself being an obstacle. The collision of `(0.1, 1.5)` with `v20` is particularly confusing, as `0.1` should be outside `(-0.05, 0.05)`. This implies either the robot's footprint is larger, or my interpretation of the AABB for `v20` is too simplistic (e.g., it is a thick wall, or the rover's effective collision radius is large). Let's assume the rover has a small radius and `v20` is truly only at `x=0`.
           
           Given the consistent collision feedback with `v20` for any `x` close to 0, I must assume the rover's footprint (or collision model) means `x=0.1` is still considered a collision for `v20` (AABB for v20 is between -0.05 and 0.05). So, I will avoid x coordinates between -0.1 and 0.1 for any configuration.
           
           Let's re-strategize with the following in mind:
           *   Avoid `x` values between -0.1 and 0.1 for any configuration to steer clear of `v20`.
           *   Avoid overlapping with the `v9` (lander) AABB for communication. Position just outside its bounds.
           *   Ensure reachability from the rover's current base pose.
           *   A single `#o3` for all images, and a single `#o5` for all samples are required by the provided actions.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12`: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14`: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):**
              *   Targets: `v17` (x~-1.8, y~2.0), `v18` (x~2.2, y~1.9), `v19` (x~-0.4, y~1.8).
              *   `v20` (x=0), `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25).
              *   Let's try a configuration with `x > 0.1` and not overlapping `v21`. How about `(1.0, 1.0)`? This avoids `v20` and `v21`. The reachability issue might be with the path, not the point. Let's assume the path is resolved and the point itself is not in collision.
              *   Alternatively, to the left of `v20`: `(-0.5, 1.0)`.
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-0.5-1.0)^2 + (1.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 7.5625) = sqrt(9.8125) = 3.13`. This seems within reasonable bounds for reachability.
                *   No collision with `v20` (x=0) or `v21` (x=0.25-0.75).
                *   Visual check:
                    *   To `v17` (avg -1.8, 2.0) from (-0.5, 1.0): `dist = sqrt((-1.8-(-0.5))^2 + (2.0-1.0)^2) = sqrt((-1.3)^2 + 1.0^2) = sqrt(1.69 + 1) = sqrt(2.69) = 1.64`. (OK for 2m range).
                    *   To `v19` (avg -0.37, 1.8) from (-0.5, 1.0): `dist = sqrt((-0.37-(-0.5))^2 + (1.8-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.13^2 + 0.8^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.64) = sqrt(0.6569) = 0.81`. (OK).
                    *   To `v18` (avg 2.1, 1.9) from (-0.5, 1.0): `dist = sqrt((2.1-(-0.5))^2 + (1.9-1.0)^2) = sqrt(2.6^2 + 0.9^2) = sqrt(6.76 + 0.81) = sqrt(7.57) = 2.75`. (Too far). This is the consistent problem. The problem must assume camera FOV or multiple camera calibration. Given the strict 2m range, this is hard. However, I'm forced to use `#o3` for all images, so I'll put it at a place that's generally "visible" or the planner is expected to find such a valid configuration from the provided predicates.
           
           Let's retry a location that's more central to all the *imagevisible* predicates while avoiding obstacles. Since `v17` and `v19` are on the left side (negative x) and `v18` is on the right side (positive x), a `y` coordinate around 1.8-2.0 is common for objectives.
           How about `(1.0, 1.0)`? (This was previously problematic for reachability for `v12` from `v13`). `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). `(1.0, 1.0)` has same x, diff y. `dist = abs(1.0 - (-1.75)) = 2.75`. This is reachable. Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No, x=1.0 is clear. Collision with `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25)? No, x=1.0 is outside.
           Let `#o3` = (1.0, 1.0).
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   `v9` (lander): `AABB(lower=[-2.4, -2.3], upper=[-1.3, -1.6])`.
              *   Previous `#o0` = (-1.3, -1.75) collided with `v9`. This `x=-1.3` is at the edge of the lander AABB upper X.
              *   Let's place `#o0` just outside the lander's AABB. For example, `x=-1.2`, which is `x=-1.395 + 0.1` approx. Let's try `(-1.2, -1.75)`.
                *   Collision with `v9`? No, x=-1.2 is > -1.395.
                *   Reachable for `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-1.2-1.0)^2 + (-1.75-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-2.2)^2 + 0^2) = 2.2`. (Reachable).
                *   Reachable for `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-1.2-(-1.0))^2 + (-1.75-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.2)^2 + 0^2) = 0.2`. (Reachable).
                *   No collision with `v20` (x=0).
           
           Let `#o0` = (-1.2, -1.75).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):**
              *   Rocks: `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Need to sample a `v2` rock (v1) and a `v6` rock (v5).
              *   Previous `#o5` = (-0.7, -1.0) was not reachable.
              *   Let's try putting `#o5` very close to `v14`'s starting position, to ensure reachability, and assume the robot arm can extend. How about `(-1.0, -1.0)`?
                *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? Yes, same x, `dist = abs(-1.0 - (-1.75)) = 0.75`. (Reachable).
                *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No, x=-1.0 is clear.
                *   Above `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9)? Yes, `abs(-1.3 - (-1.0)) = 0.3`. This is good for sampling.
                *   Above `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0)? No, `abs(0.7 - (-1.0)) = 1.7`. This might be too far for the sampling arm given that it's just `above` predicate, but the problem implies such a config exists.
           
           This is the best I can do while adhering to all constraints and learning from previous errors. The image range and single-point sampling of disparate rocks is the most challenging.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent "not reachable for robot base" errors for all proposed configurations strongly suggest that the robot's movement capabilities are severely limited, or there are unstated obstacles making these paths impossible. The initial state `conf(v12, v13)` and `conf(v14, v15)` imply these are the only initial, known configurations. The "motion" predicates are crucial here.
           
           Let's examine the available `motion` predicates for the rovers:
           
           **For Rover v12 (initial at v13):**
           The only moves from `v13` are:
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` (stay in place)
           
           This means rover `v12` can only directly move to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` from `v13`. It cannot move to any other intermediate configurations first. If these target configurations themselves are not reachable, then `v12` cannot complete its tasks.
           
           **For Rover v14 (initial at v15):**
           The only moves from `v15` are:
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           *   `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)` (stay in place)
           
           Similarly, rover `v14` can only directly move to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` from `v15`.
           
           The error "not reachable for robot base" seems to be coming from the path planning aspect, even for direct moves between *defined* configurations. This implies there are hidden obstacles or constraints that make even these direct transitions impossible for the currently chosen values of `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           Let's reconsider the scene geometry and the *existing* valid `motion` definitions for these `#` parameters. The fact that the `motion` predicates *exist* for these specific `#` objects implies that these are indeed intended target configurations that should be reachable. The error suggests that the *values* I assign to them are problematic.
           
           Given `v20` (AABB at x=0), `v21` (AABB at x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25), and `v9` (lander AABB), I need to find coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that respect these.
           
           Let's pick locations that are far away from all known obstacles, to try and ensure collision-freeness, and hope they are reachable.
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):**
              *   Rover v12 starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Objectives `v17, v18, v19` are roughly in the upper half of the environment.
              *   To avoid `v20` (x=0) and `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25).
              *   Let's try a very isolated spot in the negative x, positive y quadrant for `#o3`, far from `v20` and `v21`. How about `(-2.0, 1.0)`?
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-2.0-1.0)^2 + (1.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-3.0)^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(9 + 7.5625) = sqrt(16.5625) = 4.07`. This might be stretching reachability given the implied limited movement. But it's an extreme attempt to avoid collision.
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   Lander `v9` is at `x` between -2.4 and -1.3.
              *   Rover v12 starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Rover v14 starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   To avoid `v9` (collision) and `v20` (x=0).
              *   Let's place `#o0` to the right of `v9` and clear of `v20`. How about `(-0.5, -2.0)`?
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-0.5-1.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(2.3125) = 1.52`. (OK).
                *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-0.5-(-1.0))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.3125) = 0.56`. (OK).
                *   No collision with `v9` (x between -2.4 and -1.3, y between -2.3 and -1.6). `(-0.5, -2.0)` is to the right of v9's x-range, and y is within.
                *   No collision with `v20` (x=0).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):**
              *   Rover v14 starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Rocks: `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   Need to be "above" both.
              *   Let's try a spot that is reachable from `v15` and avoids `v20`. How about `(-1.0, -1.0)` again? The previous "not reachable" might have been due to a conflict with other configuration paths. If it's a direct move, it should be fine. It is only 0.75m away in Y from `v15`.
                *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? Yes, `dist = abs(-1.0 - (-1.75)) = 0.75`. (OK).
                *   No collision with `v20` (x=0).
                *   Above `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9): x-diff is 0.3. Close.
                *   Above `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0): x-diff is 1.7. This is the biggest stretch. I will assume "above" allows for this arm reach.
           
           Let's try this set of configurations.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem is becoming increasingly difficult due to newly revealed obstacles and continued reachability issues. The new obstacles are:
           *   `v22`: AABB(lower=(-2.16, 1.10), upper=(-2.02, 1.24)) - This is an obstacle around (-2.1, 1.17). My chosen `#o3` = (-2.0, 1.0) was inside this.
           *   `v23`: AABB(lower=(-0.51, -1.91), upper=(-0.39, -1.78)) - This is an obstacle around (-0.45, -1.85). My chosen `#o0` = (-0.5, -2.0) was inside this.
           
           The `not reachable for robot base` error for `#o5` = (-1.0, -1.0) persists. This implies that even a relatively short, direct movement from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, -1.0) is not possible, suggesting there's either a path blockage or a very tight restriction on movement distance. However, since the `motion` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are listed directly from the initial configuration, these *should* be reachable as direct moves if the coordinates are chosen correctly (i.e., not in collision).
           
           Let's try to place the configurations at new, clear locations, carefully considering all known obstacles: `v20` (x=0), `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25), `v9` (lander at x between -2.4 and -1.3, y between -2.3 and -1.6), `v22` (x between -2.16 and -2.02, y between 1.10 and 1.24), `v23` (x between -0.51 and -0.39, y between -1.91 and -1.78).
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12`: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14`: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):**
              *   Objectives `v17, v18, v19` are roughly in the upper half.
              *   Need to avoid `v20`, `v21`, `v22`.
              *   Let's try a location far to the right, to avoid `v20`, `v22`, and `v21` (which is mostly positive x, so `x > 0.75`).
              *   How about `(1.5, 0.5)`?
                *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No.
                *   Collision with `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25)? No, x=1.5 is outside its x range.
                *   Collision with `v22` (x=-2.16 to -2.02)? No, x=1.5 is far from it.
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((1.5-1.0)^2 + (0.5-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.25^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) = 2.3`. This seems very reasonable for reachability.
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   Lander `v9` is at `x` between -2.4 and -1.3, `y` between -2.3 and -1.6.
              *   Need to avoid `v9`, `v20`, `v23` (x between -0.51 and -0.39, y between -1.91 and -1.78).
              *   Let's try placing `#o0` further to the right of `v23`, and outside `v9`.
              *   How about `(0.5, -2.0)`?
                *   Collision with `v9`? No, x=0.5 is far to the right.
                *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? Yes, x=0.5 is fine.
                *   Collision with `v23` (x=-0.51 to -0.39)? No, x=0.5 is clear.
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((0.5-1.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.3125) = 0.56`. (OK).
                *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((0.5-(-1.0))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.5^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(2.3125) = 1.52`. (OK).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):**
              *   Rocks: `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   Need to avoid `v20`, `v23`.
              *   Let's try a location far to the left of `v20` and `v23`, and reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   How about `(-1.5, -0.5)`?
                *   Collision with `v20` (x=0)? No.
                *   Collision with `v23` (x=-0.51 to -0.39)? No, x=-1.5 is far to the left.
                *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((-1.5-(-1.0))^2 + (-0.5-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + 1.25^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 1.5625) = sqrt(1.8125) = 1.34`. (OK).
                *   Above `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9)? x-diff `abs(-1.3 - (-1.5)) = 0.2`. Good.
                *   Above `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0)? x-diff `abs(0.7 - (-1.5)) = 2.2`. This is still a very long reach for `above`, but again, the PDDL implies a single `#o5` works.
           
           This combination attempts to put each configuration in a clear, relatively close space to its respective starting rover while avoiding all currently known obstacles.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The repeated "not reachable for robot base" error for all configurations, despite careful selection to avoid known obstacles and ensure reasonable distances, strongly indicates that the available `motion` primitives or the underlying environment model is more restrictive than anticipated, or I'm misunderstanding a fundamental aspect of reachability in this domain.
           
           Given that `motion(rover, start_conf, #o2, target_conf)` is the only way to move, and the listed `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are the *only* named continuous configurations a rover can directly move to (other than its own starting `v13`/`v15`), the problem essentially asks for valid values for *these specific* configurations. If no such values can be found that satisfy collision-free and reachability constraints, then the task might be impossible, or I'm missing a critical piece of information.
           
           The problem implies that a solution *exists* if I can provide one. The `motion` predicates in the initial state like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` are *facts*, not just potential actions. This means there *is* a path from `v13` to `#o3`, etc. The issue must be with the specific (x,y) coordinates I'm assigning to these `#` objects.
           
           Let's assume the reachability issues are due to an unknown, very dense obstacle field or extremely limited movement range for the robot. Given the objects v12 and v14 have coordinates (1.0, -1.75) and (-1.0, -1.75) respectively, the accessible area might be very constrained around these points or along certain axes.
           
           Instead of trying to calculate distances, let's try to infer a pattern from the existing named configurations and their relative positions.
           *   `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           *   `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           These are symmetrical positions on the x-axis, both at y = -1.75.
           
           Let's try to keep the configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` also along this y = -1.75 axis, or at very small deviations, to minimize movement "cost" and potentially avoid more complex path planning issues. This assumes movement along x is easier than along y.
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):**
              *   Rover `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Objectives `v17, v18, v19` are roughly at y = 1.8-2.1.
              *   Known obstacles `v20` (x=0), `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25), `v22` (x=-2.16 to -2.02, y=1.10 to 1.24).
              *   Placing `#o3` at a high `y` value seems necessary for imaging the objectives. The repeated failure on reachability indicates a path problem.
              *   What if the robot can only move on a grid or along certain paths? Since I cannot know the exact path, I must choose a point that is 'logically' reachable and collision-free.
              *   Let's try a configuration that is *very close* to `v13` (1.0, -1.75) for `#o3`, e.g., `(1.0, -1.0)`. This would be a small vertical move.
                *   Collision with `v20`, `v21`, `v22`? No.
                *   Reachability from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(1.0, -1.0)`: `dist = abs(-1.0 - (-1.75)) = 0.75`. This is a short move. This configuration is unlikely to see all the objectives at y=1.8, but the `imagevisible` predicates state it is possible.
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   Lander `v9` (x between -2.4 and -1.3, y between -2.3 and -1.6).
              *   Obstacle `v23` (x between -0.51 and -0.39, y between -1.91 and -1.78).
              *   `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Let's place `#o0` at `(-0.2, -1.75)`. This is clear of `v20` (x=0), `v9` (x range is far negative), `v23` (x range -0.51 to -0.39). It's directly on the initial y-axis.
                *   Reachable for `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.2, -1.75)`: `dist = abs(1.0 - (-0.2)) = 1.2`. (OK).
                *   Reachable for `v14` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.2, -1.75)`: `dist = abs(-1.0 - (-0.2)) = 0.8`. (OK).
                *   `comvisible` to `v9` from `(-0.2, -1.75)`: `v9`'s closest point (x=-1.3, y=-1.75) to `(-0.2, -1.75)` is `dist = abs(-1.3 - (-0.2)) = 1.1`. (OK for 4m range).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):**
              *   Rocks: `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Need to avoid `v20`, `v23`.
              *   Let's place `#o5` at `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This was previously not reachable. But it's a very short vertical move from `v15`. Maybe the path was blocked by *other* temporary configurations?
                *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.0, -1.0)`: `dist = abs(-1.0 - (-1.75)) = 0.75`. This is a short, direct move.
                *   Collision with `v20`, `v23`? No.
                *   Above `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9): x-diff `abs(-1.3 - (-1.0)) = 0.3`. Good.
                *   Above `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0): x-diff `abs(0.7 - (-1.0)) = 1.7`. This is the one I have to trust the `above` predicate on.
           
           This approach assumes the "not reachable" errors were due to collisions with *unseen* obstacles on the path, or temporary conflicts with other planned configurations, rather than the points themselves being unreachable from a base distance perspective. By choosing simple, axial movements that are far from *known* obstacles, I hope to find a valid solution.

Model:     The situation is becoming increasingly difficult. All previous attempts have failed due to a combination of collision, out-of-range, and "not reachable for robot base" errors. This points to a highly constrained environment or very specific interpretation of reachability and interaction.
           
           Let's break down the errors again:
           *   `#o3 = (1.0 -1.0)` for `v12` (image-taking):
               *   "not reachable for robot base": This implies the path from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(1.0, -1.0)` is blocked, even though it's a short vertical movement. This is extremely restrictive.
               *   "out of range" for `v17`: `(1.0, -1.0)` is indeed too far from `v17` (x~-1.8, y~2.0). My assumption that `imagevisible` implies a wide FOV from a generally central position might be wrong; it might strictly apply to the robot's base position within 2m. This makes `imagevisible` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` from a single `#o3` almost impossible given their spread.
           *   `#o0 = (-0.2 -1.75)` (communication): "in collision with `v20` (x=0)". This confirms that `v20` (AABB x=-0.05 to 0.05) means any x between -0.2 and 0.2 is likely a collision due to robot footprint.
           *   `#o5 = (-1.0 -1.0)` (sampling): "not reachable for robot base". This short vertical move from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) is also blocked.
           
           Given these strict constraints, I must make new assumptions:
           
           1.  **Robot Movement/Reachability:** The "not reachable" errors on short, direct moves suggest the robot can only move *very* minimally, or only along specific axes, or there are unseen obstacles very close to the rovers' starting positions. If `(1.0, -1.0)` is not reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`, the robot's mobility is extremely limited in the y-direction. This could mean it essentially cannot move *at all* from its initial `y` positions, or only negligibly. If so, `#o3` must have y=-1.75 (for v12) and `#o5` must have y=-1.75 (for v14).
           2.  **`v20` collision:** The robot's footprint extends to at least `x=0.2` on either side of its center, or `v20` is a very wide obstruction. I will assume any `x` value between -0.5 and 0.5 is risky due to `v20` or other central obstacles.
           3.  **`imagevisible` range:** The 2m limit is strict. A single `#o3` cannot see `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` (which are very spread out) from a single base position if this is strictly interpreted. However, the initial PDDL *states* `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, etc. This implies such a configuration *exists*. I must choose a configuration that is very close to at least one of the objectives, and assume the others are within some extended camera range.
           4.  **`comvisible` range:** The 4m limit is strict.
           5.  **`above` predicate:** For sampling, the robot base needs to be physically "above" the rock. This implies proximity.
           
           **New Strategy based on Extreme Constraints:**
           
           *   **Focus on Rover `v14` (sampling and analysis):** It starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   **#o5 (Sampling):** Since `(-1.0, -1.0)` is unreachable, and y=-1.75 seems to be the constraint, let's try keeping y=-1.75 and just moving x slightly. `v1` is at x~-1.3, `v5` is at x~0.7.
                   *   Try `#o5` = `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is `v15` itself. If rover can't move, it has to sample from where it is.
                       *   Collision with `v20`, `v23`? No.
                       *   Reachable? Yes, it's the current config.
                       *   Above `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9)? x-diff `abs(-1.3 - (-1.0)) = 0.3`. Y-diff `abs(-0.9 - (-1.75)) = 0.85`. This is a big y-difference for "above".
                       *   Above `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0)? x-diff `abs(0.7 - (-1.0)) = 1.7`. Y-diff `abs(-1.0 - (-1.75)) = 0.75`.
                   *   If the robot literally cannot move in y, then the `above` predicate is satisfied by the arm, not the base, which is consistent with my initial assumption.
               *   **#o0 (Communication for `v14`):** From `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` is at `x` between -2.4 and -1.3, `y` between -2.3 and -1.6.
                   *   Try `#o0` = `(-1.5, -1.75)`. This is close to `v9` and avoids `v20`, `v23`.
                       *   Collision with `v9` (AABB includes x from -2.4 to -1.39)? `(-1.5, -1.75)` is within the x range of `v9`'s AABB. This will cause collision.
                       *   Let's try placing it to the right of `v9` and clear of `v20`/`v23`. How about `(0.8, -1.75)`?
                           *   Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = abs(0.8 - (-1.0)) = 1.8`. (OK for x-move).
                           *   Collision with `v20`, `v23`? No, x=0.8 is clear.
                           *   `comvisible` to `v9` from `(0.8, -1.75)`: `v9`'s closest point (x=-1.3, y=-1.75) is `dist = abs(-1.3 - 0.8) = 2.1`. (OK for 4m range).
           
           *   **Focus on Rover `v12` (image-taking and analysis):** It starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   **#o3 (Image-taking):** Since `(1.0, -1.0)` is unreachable and `v17` is out of range, this task is impossible if `v12` is stuck at y=-1.75. The `imagevisible` predicates are likely what I should trust here. The fact that the problem implies a single `#o3` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` (which are all at high y, around 1.8-2.1) means that `#o3` *must* be at a high y-coordinate, and that it *must* be reachable.
                   *   This is a fundamental conflict. If a small y-move is unreachable, but `imagevisible` implies a large y-move, then either the environment is set up for failure, or my interpretation of "reachable" is off.
                   *   Let's assume the "not reachable" for `(1.0, -1.0)` was context-specific.
                   *   Consider `v18`: ((2.138, 1.846), (2.227, 1.936)). A good `#o3` for just `v18` would be `(2.0, 1.8)`.
                       *   Collision with `v20`, `v21`, `v22`? No.
                       *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((2.0-1.0)^2 + (1.8-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.0^2 + 3.55^2) = sqrt(1 + 12.6) = sqrt(13.6) = 3.68`. This is a large move, but not explicitly ruled out by distance.
                   *   This configuration `(2.0, 1.8)` would be in range for `v18` (`dist` is very small). However, it's far from `v17` and `v19`.
           
           This is indicating that the domain setup is extremely specific and my general assumptions are not holding. I have to trust the `imagevisible` and `above` predicates as true if I can find collision-free and reachable points for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. The "not reachable" means *no path exists* from the start to that point. The only paths are defined by the `motion` predicates.
           
           The only way for these `motion` predicates to be true is if the objects `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *are* reachable. The system is rejecting my proposed *values* for these continuous objects, not the action itself.
           
           Let's assume the simplest possible movements that *might* be reachable and collision-free.
           If `v12` cannot move in Y, and it has to image high Y objectives, this is impossible.
           If `v14` cannot move in Y, and it has to sample objects at different Y, this is impossible.
           The constraint seems to be on `x` movement avoiding `v20` (x=0) and `v23` (-0.5 to -0.39).
           
           **Let's assume the problem expects the configurations to be near the starting point, only moving x, or minimum y:**
           
           *   **#o3 (Image-taking for v12):** Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Need to take images of `v17` (x~-1.8, y~2.0), `v18` (x~2.2, y~1.9), `v19` (x~-0.4, y~1.8).
               *   Let's try to put `#o3` very near one of the objectives. To see `v18`, try `(2.0, -1.75)`. This is a purely x-axis move for `v12`.
                   *   Collision with `v20`, `v21`, `v22`? No.
                   *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = abs(2.0 - 1.0) = 1.0`. (OK for x-move).
                   *   Range to `v18` from `(2.0, -1.75)`: `dist = sqrt((2.1-2.0)^2 + (1.9-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 3.65^2) = 3.65`. (Still out of range for 2m).
           
           This implies that if a config is not near a target, it's out of range. The *only* way the problem has `imagevisible` predicates from `#o3` to ALL objectives (v17, v18, v19) is if I place `#o3` somewhere such that the *camera* (not the base) can rotate to view them, and its base is within 2m of ALL of them simultaneously, which is impossible given their spread. Or, the distances in `imagevisible` are calculated from the *camera itself*, which is not at the robot's base. The `conf` predicate is for the robot's base. This is a crucial ambiguity. Given `imagevisible` must be true for all three, there must be a valid configuration.
           
           Let's consider the maximum coordinate values of the environment: The AABBs indicate that the environment spans roughly x from -2.5 to 2.5 and y from -2.5 to 2.5.
           
           **Let's assume the initial coordinates of the rovers are special and they *cannot* move in y-direction, only x.**
           *   If `v12` stays at `y=-1.75`, it cannot see objectives at `y=1.8`. This means the task is impossible under this assumption.
           
           This implies my assumption about not being able to move in y is wrong. So, what *is* "reachable"? Perhaps `(1.0, 1.0)` was not reachable because of a path collision, not the destination itself or the distance.
           
           Let's try `(1.0, 1.0)` again for `#o3` (image taking for v12) as it was far from obstacles `v20`, `v21`, `v22`. The "not reachable" might be due to a specific path that needs to avoid intermediate points.
           For communication, `#o0`, let's try `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           *   Collision with `v9` (x -2.4 to -1.3, y -2.3 to -1.6)? `(-1.0, -2.0)` is *within* the x-range of `v9`. It is also within the y-range of `v9`. This is a collision.
           *   Collision with `v23` (x -0.51 to -0.39, y -1.91 to -1.78)? No, x=-1.0 is clear.
           
           This is extremely challenging. The available information about obstacles and mobility is very sparse compared to the complexity of the errors. I will try one last strategy: keep configurations as close to the initial position of their respective rovers as possible, while absolutely avoiding direct collisions with any AABB, even if it makes the image/sample operations seem implausible by distance. The PDDL setup guarantees `imagevisible` and `above` will be true if the point is otherwise valid.
           
           **Final Attempt Strategy:**
           1.  **#o3 (Image-taking for v12):** From `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Objectives are all in positive Y.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     This is an extremely difficult problem. Each proposed configuration is leading to new obstacles being revealed or persistent "not reachable" errors. The incremental feedback is uncovering a very dense and complex environment that is making path planning extremely challenging.
           
           New Obstacles:
           *   `v24`: AABB(lower=(0.67, -0.11), upper=(0.82, 0.02)) - This is an obstacle around (0.75, -0.05). My chosen `#o3` = (1.0, 0.0) was colliding with this.
           
           Persistent Issues:
           *   `#o3` (image taking for `v12`): `(1.0, 0.0)` collided with `v24`. `(1.0, 0.0)` for `v19` is "not reachable". This again suggests pathing issues or very fine-grained unstated obstacles.
           *   `#o0` (communication): `(-0.1, -2.0)` collided with `v20` (x=0). This indicates that even `x=-0.1` is considered within `v20`'s bounds, meaning the collision region around `x=0` is wider than just `(-0.05, 0.05)` or the robot's footprint is large.
           *   `#o5` (sampling for `v14`): `(-1.0, -0.5)` is "not reachable".
           
           At this point, it is clear that simple heuristics for picking coordinates will not work, as every attempt reveals new information or confirms extremely strict implicit constraints. The problem requires a precise understanding of the allowed collision-free space and the robot's exact movement capabilities which are not fully specified.
           
           However, I must assume a solution exists. I will attempt a radically different approach: try to place configurations directly at the *edges* of existing named objects or obstacles where possible, or in very extreme corners of the known navigable space, to minimize overlap. The "not reachable" errors are still the most puzzling, as direct `motion` predicates are given.
           
           Let's assume the rovers can move only along very clear paths.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12`: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14`: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **Known Obstacles:**
           *   `v20`: AABB(x=(-0.05, 0.05), y=(-2.5, 2.5)) - Main central wall. Avoid `x` values between -0.1 and 0.1 for sure.
           *   `v21`: AABB(x=(0.25, 0.75), y=(1.75, 2.25)) - Upper right block.
           *   `v22`: AABB(x=(-2.16, -2.02), y=(1.10, 1.24)) - Upper left block.
           *   `v23`: AABB(x=(-0.51, -0.39), y=(-1.91, -1.78)) - Lower left block near x=0.
           *   `v24`: AABB(x=(0.67, 0.82), y=(-0.11, 0.02)) - Mid-right block near y=0.
           *   `v9` (Lander): AABB(x=(-2.4, -1.3), y=(-2.3, -1.6)) - Lower left lander.
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):** Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Objectives `v17, v18, v19` are roughly at y = 1.8-2.1.
              *   Avoid `v20, v21, v22, v24`.
              *   Trying to get to high Y for images, while avoiding everything. Let's try to find a clear spot very far to the right and high up.
              *   How about `(2.0, 1.0)`?
                *   Collision `v20, v21, v22, v24`? No.
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((2.0-1.0)^2 + (1.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 2.75^2) = sqrt(1 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.5625) = 2.9`. This is a significant move but theoretically within the possible range of a rover. Let's hope the path is clear.
                *   Range check for `v17` (x~-1.8, y~2.0) from `(2.0, 1.0)`: `dist = sqrt((-1.8-2.0)^2 + (2.0-1.0)^2) = sqrt(3.8^2 + 1.0^2) = sqrt(14.44+1) = sqrt(15.44) = 3.9`. (Out of range for 2m image range.) This is the consistent image range problem. Given the PDDL, I have to pick *some* valid location for `#o3` and trust that the imagevisible predicate is true.
           
           Let's rethink this. The goal must be achievable. The fact that the predicates `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` are in the initial state means a suitable value for `#o3` *exists*. The same for `above` and `comvisible`. The "not reachable" means the path is blocked, or the point itself is invalid.
           
           What if the initial problem description implies the *existence* of valid configurations, and I just need to specify them, and the `motion` predicates implicitly refer to these valid configurations? I should select values that are not in explicit collision with any AABB *given so far*. The "not reachable" and "out of range" errors are the actual checks being performed, not explicit AABB collisions.
           
           This indicates that my coordinate selection needs to be extremely precise or follow some hidden grid. Since the "not reachable" is not explained by visible obstacles, it means the robot either cannot move that far, or there's an invisible wall.
           
           Given the symmetrical setup of `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), let's try to exploit this symmetry.
           
           **Strategy: Stay very close to the starting positions, or move to clearly open extreme corners.**
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):** `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Image objectives at high Y.
              *   Let's try to place `#o3` far away from all known obstacles, to the extreme positive X, high Y. Say `(2.4, 2.4)`.
                *   Collision with `v20, v21, v22, v24, v9, v23`? No.
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((2.4-1.0)^2 + (2.4-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.4^2 + 4.15^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 17.22) = 4.37`. This is at the edge of plausible movement.
                *   Range to `v18` from `(2.4, 2.4)`: `dist = sqrt((2.1-2.4)^2 + (1.9-2.4)^2) = sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.34) = 0.58`. (OK for 2m range).
                *   Range to `v17` (x~-1.8, y~2.0) from `(2.4, 2.4)`: `dist = sqrt((-1.8-2.4)^2 + (2.0-2.4)^2) = sqrt((-4.2)^2 + (-0.4)^2) = sqrt(17.64 + 0.16) = sqrt(17.8) = 4.2`. (Out of range). This means the PDDL statement `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is false for my `(2.4, 2.4)` guess. This is extremely frustrating.
           
           This means that my chosen value for `#o3` *must* satisfy the 2m range for `imagevisible` to all three targets. This is only possible if they are very close together, which they are not, or if the `conf` means the base and the camera is far away.
           
           This implies there is *no single* `#o3` configuration that satisfies all `imagevisible` predicates with a 2m range from a single robot base location. If this is the case, the problem is not solvable as written. However, I have to provide a plan.
           The most plausible explanation is that the `imagevisible` predicate is not based on the robot's base position `conf`, but some other, hidden aspect of the robot's sensor suite. I must choose a single `#o3` that is collision-free and reachable.
           
           Since all my chosen locations have been deemed "not reachable", I will try to stay at the initial position or move as minimally as possible along the x-axis, assuming y-moves are inherently problematic.
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):** `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Let's try `(1.0, -1.0)` again. Previous error: "not reachable". This is a short y-move.
              *   What about `(1.0, 1.0)`? This was also deemed "not reachable".
           
           There is some fundamental misunderstanding of reachability. If moving from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, -1.0)` is not reachable, the robot cannot perform any Y movement, or almost none. If it cannot perform Y movement, it cannot image objects at y=1.8. This leads to a contradiction.
           
           Given the constraints, it may be that the only "reachable" configurations are those *identical* to initial `v13` or `v15` or extremely close to them.
           Let's try to put `#o3` to `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `#o5` to `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) and `#o0` to some compromise point.
           
           If `#o3 = v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`:
              *   Reachable? Yes.
              *   Collision? No known obstacle.
              *   `v17` (x~-1.8, y~2.0): `dist = sqrt((-1.8-1.0)^2 + (2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.8^2 + 3.75^2) = 4.67`. (Out of range). This makes the task impossible.
           
           I am forced to conclude that there's a misunderstanding of the task, the environment, or the robot model. However, I must provide a plan. The only way `imagevisible` for all objectives can be true from one `#o3` is if the range check is very loose or it's not base-to-base.
           I'll try one last time with very minimal movements that avoid collisions, and if those fail, then the problem is unsolvable with the information given.
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):** `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Obstacles `v20, v21, v22, v24`.
              *   Let's try (1.0, 0.5) to clear `v24` and `v21` on X.
                *   Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = abs(0.5 - (-1.75)) = 2.25`. (OK).
                *   Collision with `v24` (x=0.67-0.82, y=-0.11-0.02)? No, x=1.0 is clear. y=0.5 is clear.
                *   Collision with `v21` (x=0.25-0.75, y=1.75-2.25)? No.
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   Obstacles `v20, v23, v9`.
              *   Let's try `(0.1, -2.0)`. This was rejected previously because of `v20` collision. It means my interpretation of `v20`'s AABB or robot footprint is wrong. If `x=0.1` is a collision for `v20` (x=-0.05 to 0.05), then a very wide area around x=0 is blocked.
              *   This implies moving to a positive `x` value that is very large to avoid `v20`, `v23`, `v9`.
              *   How about `(1.5, -2.0)`?
                *   Reachable from `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((1.5-1.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-0.25)^2) = 0.56`. (OK).
                *   Reachable from `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((1.5-(-1.0))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.5^2 + (-0.25)^2) = 2.51`. (OK).
                *   Collision `v20, v23, v9`? No, x=1.5 is far right.
                *   `comvisible` to `v9` (x -2.4 to -1.3) from `(1.5, -2.0)`: `dist = sqrt((-1.3-1.5)^2 + (-1.6-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-2.8)^2 + 0.4^2) = 2.8`. (OK for 4m range).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):** `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Rocks `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   Let's try `(-1.0, -0.8)`. This is a short vertical move. It was previously "not reachable". This is the most confusing error.
                *   If this simple vertical move is "not reachable", it suggests the robot is truly stuck or movement is disallowed.
           
           If even short moves along an axis from initial configurations are "not reachable", there must be unstated obstacles blocking even these simple movements, or the problem statement implies fixed positions for the '#' configurations which are then checked against reachability.
           I'm at a point where the constraints are too contradictory for a logical solution. The only way forward is to try configuration values that are very close to the *known valid* starting points and hope they don't trigger the "not reachable" constraint.
           
           Let's try for the sampling point `#o5` to be identical to `v15` itself, `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           And for image point `#o3` to be identical to `v13` itself, `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           And then for communication `#o0` to be a compromise.
           
           If `#o3 = v13`: `(1.0, -1.75)`. It fails `imagevisible` range to `v17`. The task is impossible if this is the only option for `#o3`.
           This task is unsolvable with the current set of constraints and feedback.
           
           The problem implies an executable plan exists. The contradiction is between the "not reachable" errors on simple moves, the strict ranges, and the PDDL predicates implying that these operations *are* possible. I've tried to move away from all known obstacles and keep movements minimal.
           
           Let me try to place the continuous configurations on the exact same spot as the rover that uses them, and use the communication configuration (`#o0`) as a common point slightly away from obstacles. This makes movement minimal or zero, making "reachable" most likely true for the non-`move` steps.
           
           *   `#o3` = `v13` = `(1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `#o5` = `v15` = `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `#o0` = `(1.5, -2.0)` (from previous attempt, seems to avoid all known collision and reachable for both)
           
           This leaves the "out of range" issues for `imagevisible`. If the task is solvable, the PDDL must imply that even from these base positions, the camera system allows for the images to be taken.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I made a critical error in the last attempt by directly substituting `v13` and `v15` into actions like `calibrate` and `take_image` which explicitly require `#o3` or `#o5` as arguments, not `v13` or `v15`. The available actions list confirms that `calibrate` and `take_image` always take `#o3`, and `sample_rock` always takes `#o5`. I must use these specific placeholder objects in the action calls, and provide a valid coordinate for them.
           
           The problem implies that such configurations exist and are reachable. The repeated failures indicate a very strict and possibly non-intuitive environment. I will revert to the plan structure that uses `#o3`, `#o5`, and `#o0` for the continuous arguments, and provide coordinates.
           
           The repeated errors also mean that the `(rover, configuration, target)` relationship for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` is critical, and my chosen coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are not satisfying these.
           
           Let's carefully re-examine the set of initial predicates that *guarantee* the possibility of these actions:
           *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           *   `above(v14, #o5, v1)`
           *   `above(v14, #o5, v5)` (I chose v1 and v5 as the target rocks for analysis).
           *   `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           *   `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           *   `motion` predicates define allowed moves between `v13`/`v15` and `#o0`/`#o3`/`#o5`.
           
           The error "not reachable for robot base" on simple moves (e.g., from (1.0, -1.75) to (1.0, -1.0)) is key. This implies that even short vertical moves are blocked, or that the path must be extremely specific. This implies the environment's `y` movement is very restricted, or the coordinates for `v13` and `v15` are critical starting positions in a very narrow corridor.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty, I will try to place `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` at locations that are *just outside* known obstacle AABBs, and very close to the initial rover positions, prioritizing horizontal (x) moves or minimal vertical (y) moves.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12`: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14`: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **Known Obstacles:**
           *   `v20`: AABB(x=(-0.05, 0.05), y=(-2.5, 2.5)) - Central wall. Avoid x in `[-0.1, 0.1]`.
           *   `v21`: AABB(x=(0.25, 0.75), y=(1.75, 2.25)) - Upper right block.
           *   `v22`: AABB(x=(-2.16, -2.02), y=(1.10, 1.24)) - Upper left block.
           *   `v23`: AABB(x=(-0.51, -0.39), y=(-1.91, -1.78)) - Lower left block near x=0.
           *   `v24`: AABB(x=(0.67, 0.82), y=(-0.11, 0.02)) - Mid-right block near y=0.
           *   `v9` (Lander): AABB(x=(-2.4, -1.3), y=(-2.3, -1.6)) - Lower left lander.
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):** Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Objectives `v17, v18, v19` are roughly at y = 1.8-2.1.
              *   Trying to place `#o3` where it can see all three, avoiding `v20, v21, v22, v24`.
              *   Let's try a spot where `v12` is likely to be able to go from (1.0, -1.75) without immediate collision, and high enough in y to attempt images. What if `y=1.0` is a "safe" height?
              *   Let's try `(1.0, 1.0)`. (This was repeatedly deemed "not reachable" or colliding). However, it clears `v20`, `v21`, `v22`, `v24`. The path itself might be the issue. If it's a direct move allowed by `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, then `(1.0, 1.0)` is a logical target. I will persist with this choice due to lack of better info for path constraints.
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   Lander `v9` is at `x` between -2.4 and -1.3, `y` between -2.3 and -1.6.
              *   Avoid `v20, v23, v9`.
              *   Let's try `(-0.5, -2.0)`. This was previously deemed in collision with `v23`. `v23` is x=[-0.51, -0.39], y=[-1.91, -1.78]. My chosen `(-0.5, -2.0)` is `x=-0.5`, which is at the edge of `v23`'s x-bound, and `y=-2.0` is outside `v23`'s y-bound. This suggests the robot's footprint is larger.
              *   Let's try `(-0.6, -2.0)`. This should be clear of `v23` and `v20`.
                *   `comvisible` to `v9` from `(-0.6, -2.0)`: `v9`'s closest point (x=-1.3, y=-1.75) is `dist = sqrt((-1.3-(-0.6))^2 + (-1.75-(-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.7)^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(0.49+0.0625) = 0.74`. (OK for 4m range).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):** Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Rocks `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   Avoid `v20, v23`.
              *   Let's try `(-1.0, -0.8)`. This was previously "not reachable". This is a short vertical move. Given the `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)` exists, `(-1.0, -0.8)` should be reachable *if collision-free*.
              *   Collision `v20, v23`? No.
              *   Above `v1` and `v5` (relying on implicit arm reach and PDDL truth).
           
           This plan attempts to use coordinates that have previously been checked for direct collision with AABBs, and assumes that "not reachable" either pertains to a hidden path or is due to interactions with *other* configurations in the plan, which is not how these systems typically work. I have to select a position which, in a clear-path scenario, should be reachable.

Model:     This is an extremely challenging problem given the persistent "not reachable" errors even for very short, seemingly clear moves, and the revelation of new obstacles with each attempt. The cumulative feedback has shown a highly constrained and possibly non-intuitive environment.
           
           Let's summarize the current state of affairs and the contradictions:
           *   **Reachability:** Almost all suggested configuration coordinates, even for minimal (e.g., vertical) moves from the rover's starting point, are deemed "not reachable for robot base." This directly contradicts the existence of `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` and similar predicates, which imply a path *exists*. This can only mean that the actual navigable space is severely limited, or there are many more invisible obstacles, or the robot's specific path planning constraints are extremely tight.
           *   **Collisions:** New obstacles (`v22`, `v23`, `v24`) are revealed, making it harder to find clear space. The collision of `(-0.6, -2.0)` with `v23` (x=[-0.51, -0.39]) implies my assumption about avoiding AABBs by going just outside is incorrect, and the robot's collision footprint is significant.
           *   **Image Range:** The `imagevisible` predicate's strict 2m range, combined with the wide spread of objectives (v17, v18, v19) at high y-coordinates, makes it practically impossible for a single `#o3` to fulfill all `imagevisible` conditions from a "reachable" lower-y base position. However, the initial PDDL *asserts* these predicates are true for some `#o3`.
           
           Given these contradictions, the only way to proceed is to make very strong assumptions based on the PDDL structure:
           1.  **The `motion` predicates *guarantee* reachability if the destination configuration is collision-free.** The "not reachable" errors are effectively saying the destination I chose is not truly free, or the path to it is blocked by unstated means.
           2.  **The `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates *guarantee* that a suitable configuration exists for these actions.** I must find collision-free coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` that, when plugged into these predicates, result in true statements according to the environment's internal logic, regardless of what my manual distance checks imply.
           
           This forces me to find tiny, obscure, collision-free spots. The most consistent collisions have been around x=0 (`v20`), and `v23` around x=-0.45.
           Let's try to place `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` at positions that are *extremely close* to the rovers' starting points, but shifted to completely clear any known obstacle AABBs.
           
           **Rover Initial Positions:**
           *   `v12`: `v13` (1.0, -1.75)
           *   `v14`: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **New Strategy: Minimal, Explicitly Clear Moves**
           
           **1. #o3 (Image-taking for v12):** Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Objectives are high in Y.
              *   Avoid `v20, v21, v22, v24`.
              *   The "not reachable" errors for `(1.0, 1.0)` and `(1.0, 0.0)` are baffling given `v13` is at (1.0, -1.75).
              *   Let's try moving `v12` only in X, as minimal as possible, and hope for the best with `imagevisible`. This contradicts the Y-position of targets, but seems like the only way to satisfy "reachable".
              *   How about `(1.1, -1.75)`? (Tiny x-move, same y). This clears `v20, v21, v22, v24`.
                *   Reachable? It's a tiny move. Assuming yes.
                *   `imagevisible` for targets at y~2.0 from y=-1.75? Unlikely by geometry, but PDDL asserts it exists.
           
           **2. #o0 (Communication for v12 and v14):**
              *   Avoid `v20, v23, v9`.
              *   `v23` is at x=[-0.51, -0.39]. My previous `(-0.6, -2.0)` collided. This means the robot is wider than 0.1 units. So x should be less than -0.6 or greater than -0.39.
              *   Let's try a safe large positive x. `(1.5, -2.0)`.
                *   Reachable from `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((1.5-1.0)^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = 0.56`. (OK).
                *   Reachable from `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75)? `dist = sqrt((1.5-(-1.0))^2 + (-2.0-(-1.75))^2) = 2.51`. (OK).
                *   Collision `v20, v23, v9`? No.
                *   `comvisible` to `v9` (x -2.4 to -1.3) from `(1.5, -2.0)`: `dist = 2.8`. (OK for 4m range).
           
           **3. #o5 (Sampling for v14):** Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
              *   Rocks `v1` (x~-1.3, y~-0.9), `v5` (x~0.7, y~-1.0).
              *   Avoid `v20, v23`.
              *   `(-1.0, -0.8)` was "not reachable". This again points to very strong Y-axis movement restrictions.
              *   Let's try moving only in X. `(-1.1, -1.75)`. This is a tiny move left.
                *   Reachable? It's a tiny move. Assuming yes.
                *   Collision `v20, v23`? No.
                *   `above` v1 (x~-1.3) and v5 (x~0.7) from `(-1.1, -1.75)`. This is geometrically very difficult, but I must rely on the PDDL truth.
           
           I am forced to assume that the environment's collision/reachability checks are based on a very precise, perhaps hidden, model, and that the listed `motion` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` refer to *very specific coordinates* that are not directly derivable from simple geometry or distance, but are hard-coded in the problem's solution space. My current attempts are trying to "find" these coordinates through trial and error, but with such tight constraints, it's like finding a needle in a haystack.
           
           I will use these coordinates for the final attempt, assuming these minor adjustments satisfy the implicit constraints.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.1 -1.75) for rover v12 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.1 -1.75) for rover v12 at target v17 is out of range. The maximum range is 4, but the distance to the target is 4.90.
           Configuration #o5 = (-1.1 -1.75) for rover v14 at target v1 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-1.1 -1.75) for rover v14 at target v5 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (1.5 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     At this point, it is clear that the provided problem is unsolvable under any reasonable interpretation of robot movement and environmental interaction, given the feedback.
           
           Every single configuration I propose, no matter how conservative, how far from obstacles, how minimal the movement, or how aligned with the initial `y` positions, results in one or more of the following:
           1.  **"Not reachable for robot base"**: This is the most pervasive error. It implies that the robot cannot move from its initial position `v13` or `v15` to *any* other configuration I've specified, even for a tiny `0.1` unit change in X or Y. This directly contradicts the presence of `motion(rover, start_conf, #o2, target_conf)` predicates in the initial state, which explicitly define allowed moves. If these moves are "not reachable," then the initial state itself describes an impossible scenario.
           2.  **"Out of range"**: For `imagevisible` and sometimes `comvisible`. This occurs because the objectives/lander are far from the robot's initial position, and any attempt to move the robot closer (which would necessitate a "reachable" configuration) is met with the "not reachable" error. If the robot cannot move, and the targets are out of range from its starting point, then the `imagevisible` predicates from `#o3` (which, again, is a configuration the robot is supposed to move to) are fundamentally contradictory.
           3.  **"Collision with fixed obstacles"**: New obstacles are revealed with each attempt, indicating an extremely dense environment. However, even when meticulously avoiding all *known* obstacles, the "not reachable" error persists.
           
           The problem effectively states: "Here are actions that can be taken, and here are configurations the robot *can* move to (implied by `motion` predicates), but every single configuration you suggest for those actions is invalid."
           
           Given that I must provide a plan that "achieves the goal and satisfies all the preconditions of each action," and the system is rejecting every attempt to define the necessary continuous parameters (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) as impossible to reach or use, it indicates the goal is fundamentally unachievable *under the provided constraints and feedback*.
           
           Therefore, I cannot provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state because, according to the repeated feedback, the necessary configurations are consistently deemed unreachable or invalid, making the preconditions for the actions impossible to satisfy.
