           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which can be satisfied by `receivedanalysis(?r)` for rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil), and `receivedimage(?o, v11)` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           
           Looking at the initial state:
           - Rover `v12` is at `v13`. Rover `v14` is at `v15`.
           - `v10` is a camera, onboard both `v12` and `v14`, and supports `v11` (mode).
           - `v16` is a store, and both `v12` and `v14` are free (can sample).
           - There are various rocks: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
             - `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are type `v2` (stone).
             - `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are type `v6` (soil).
           - Objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           - Lander `v9`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?r)`: we need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           For `receivedimage(?o, v11)`: we need to `calibrate`, `take_image`, and then `send_image`.
           
           The available actions are limited:
           - `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`: Rover `v12` moves from `v13` to `v13`. This is a no-op move, essentially staying at the same configuration.
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`: Rover `v14` moves from `v15` to `v15`. Also a no-op.
           - `drop_rock v12 v16`: Drops a rock if `v12`'s store `v16` is full.
           - `drop_rock v14 v16`: Drops a rock if `v14`'s store `v16` is full.
           
           Crucially, the initial state *already contains* the `new-axiom@0()` as part of its definition, which means the goal is already satisfied by the initial state. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as a conjunction of specific conditions, some of which are about the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. However, the axioms themselves are the conditions, and the goal is just to make the axiom true.
           
           Upon careful review, the provided axiom `new-axiom@0()` (and its repeated definitions) states that the goal is met if `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a stone type `v2`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a soil type `v6` are true, among other facts about `atconf` and `free`.
           
           Since none of the initial `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates are true, we need to achieve them. The available action instances for moving are essentially no-ops (moving to the same configuration). There are no `sample_rock`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `send_analysis` actions listed as valid instances. Given the provided limited set of *valid action instances*, it is impossible to generate a plan to achieve the goal of having `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates true.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given valid action instances.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as a conjunction, one of which is `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for type `v2` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for type `v6`, and `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`. None of these are true in the initial state. The available actions are only `move` (which are no-ops) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be used as the store is free). There are no `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `send_image` actions available. Thus, the goal cannot be achieved.
