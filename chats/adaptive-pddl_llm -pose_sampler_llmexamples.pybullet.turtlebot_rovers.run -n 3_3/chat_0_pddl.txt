           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by a perimeter of obstacles, specifically AABBs 0-4. There's also a central vertical obstacle (AABB 5) at x=0, which divides the space. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout. I need to find 3 positions within a radius of 2 from the target point that avoid these fixed obstacles and any previously encountered non-fixed obstacles. Given the target is at (0.0, 0.0), I will try positions at various angles and distances from the target within the allowed range. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have clear line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.0)
           (-1.5 0.0)
           (0.0 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempt to place the robot around (0.0, 0.0) failed. The target is now at (0.32, 2.18). The previous positions (1.5, 0.0) and (-1.5, 0.0) had no line of sight, likely due to the central vertical obstacle (AABB 5) or other obstacles in between. (0.0, 1.5) collided with AABB 5, which is `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. This confirms that the region around x=0 is obstructed.
           
           The new target point (0.32, 2.18) is in the upper part of the scene. Obstacles 19, 20, 21, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7, and 17 are in this general area. I need to find positions within 2 units of (0.32, 2.18) and avoid all known obstacles, especially AABB 5, and any others that might block line of sight.
           
           Since the target is at (0.32, 2.18), positions slightly off the central vertical axis and within the 2-unit radius would be appropriate. I will try positions that are to the right and left of the target, and slightly further away from the central divider.
           
           Positions:
           (0.32 0.5)
           (1.5 2.18)
           (-1.0 2.18)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My previous attempts at finding a position for the target point (0.32, 2.18) were unsuccessful.
           (1.5, 0.0) and (-1.5, 0.0) failed due to no line of sight, likely because of AABB 5 and potentially others.
           (0.0, 1.5) collided with AABB 5.
           (0.32, 0.5) and (1.5, 2.18) were marked as "not reachable for robot base." This could mean they were outside the allowed x/y range of [-2.5, 2.5] or too far from the target. Looking at (1.5, 2.18), it's within the overall bounds, and its distance from (0.32, 2.18) is `sqrt((1.5-0.32)^2 + (2.18-2.18)^2) = 1.18`, which is less than 2. This suggests a more subtle issue, possibly a collision with an obstacle or being too close to the boundary for robot base placement. (0.32, 0.5) has distance `sqrt((0.32-0.32)^2 + (2.18-0.5)^2) = 1.68`, also within range. The "not reachable" error likely implies collision with some complex obstacle geometry.
           
           Given the target is at (0.32, 2.18), I need to be careful with the obstacles in the upper part of the scene (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20, 21, 17) and the central divider (AABB 5). The target itself is very close to AABB 20 ((0.28, 2.14) to (0.36, 2.22)). Placing the robot directly in front of this, e.g., slightly to the left, right, or below, while avoiding other obstacles, seems like the best approach.
           
           I will try positions that are still within the 2-unit radius but are more cautiously placed, especially considering the "not reachable" feedback. I will try to stay away from existing obstacles and the central axis.
           
           Positions:
           (0.32 1.0)
           (2.0 2.0)
           (-2.0 2.0)
