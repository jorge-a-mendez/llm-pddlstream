           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom defined as a conjunction of several facts:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12's store v16 is free.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14's store v16 is free.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 has been received in mode v11.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 has been received in mode v11.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective v19 has been received in mode v11.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object `?stone` is of type `v2`.
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of `?stone` has been received.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object `?soil` is of type `v6`.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of `?soil` has been received.
           
           Let's examine the initial state and how it relates to the goal:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true in the initial state.
           
           So, the first four conditions of the axiom are already satisfied. We need to achieve the remaining conditions: receiving images for v17, v18, and v19, and receiving analysis for a rock of type v2 and a rock of type v6.
           
           Let's look at the rocks and their types:
           - `v7` is of type `v6` (soil).
           - `v3` is of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v4` is of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v1` is of type `v2` (stone).
           - `v8` is of type `v6` (soil).
           - `v5` is of type `v6` (soil).
           
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
           The initial state also shows:
           - `onboard(v10, v14)` and `onboard(v10, v12)`: Camera v10 is on both rovers.
           - `supports(v10, v11)`: Camera v10 supports mode v11.
           - `lander(v9)`: v9 is the lander.
           
           Let's analyze the image reception part of the goal. We need to `receivedimage` for `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. This can be achieved by first taking an image and then sending it.
           
           For taking images:
           `take_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c, ?m)` requires:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `supports(?c, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `calibrated(?c, ?v)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           For sending images:
           `send_image(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?o, ?m)` requires:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `objective(?o)`
           - `mode(?m)`
           - `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           Let's check the initial state for image visibility:
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           All three objectives are visible to both rovers at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           
           For communication visibility:
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           Both rovers can communicate with the lander v9 at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           Neither rover is initially calibrated. So, we'll need to `calibrate` the camera first.
           `calibrate(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o, ?c)` requires:
           - `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`
           - `onboard(?c, ?v)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           Let's use rover `v12` for imaging and sending.
           1. Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17` at `#o3` using ray `#o4`.
              `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2. Take image of `v17` with `v12` using `v10` in `v11` at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
              `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. Send image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` in `v11` at `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
              `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
              Note: After `take_image`, the camera `v10` will no longer be calibrated. We need to recalibrate it for each image. Or, since we're taking three images, we can calibrate once and take all three, then re-calibrate for the analysis or if we need to take more images. However, `take_image` explicitly uncalibrates the camera. So we must calibrate for each.
           
           The process for each image will be:
           `calibrate(rover, image_conf, image_ray, objective, camera)`
           `take_image(rover, image_conf, image_ray, objective, camera, mode)`
           `calibrate(rover, comm_conf, comm_ray, lander, camera)` (This calibration might not be strictly needed for `send_image` as `send_image` doesn't require `calibrated`, but it is often part of a sequence to enable further imaging after sending.) Wait, `send_image` does not require a calibrated camera. `take_image` makes the camera uncalibrated. So we only need to calibrate the camera before each `take_image`.
           So, the sequence for each image would be:
           1. Calibrate (rover, #o3, #o4, objective, camera)
           2. Take_image (rover, #o3, #o4, objective, camera, mode)
           3. Send_image (rover, #o0, #o1, lander, objective, mode)
           
           Let's do this for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` using `v12`.
           Since `onboard(v10, v12)` is true, and `supports(v10, v11)` is true, and `mode(v11)` is true, `v10` is the camera, `v11` is the mode.
           
           For analyzing rocks:
           `sample_rock(?v, ?q, ?r, ?s)` requires:
           - `above(?v, ?q, ?r)`
           - `store(?s)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `free(?v, ?s)`
           
           `send_analysis(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l, ?r)` requires:
           - `comvisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?l)`
           - `rock(?r)`
           - `analyzed(?v, ?r)`
           - `atconf(?v, ?q)`
           - `~blocked(?y)`
           
           We need to analyze one rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`.
           Available rocks:
           - `v7` (type `v6`)
           - `v3` (type `v2`)
           - `v4` (type `v2`)
           - `v1` (type `v2`)
           - `v8` (type `v6`)
           - `v5` (type `v6`)
           
           Let's use `v7` (type v6) and `v3` (type v2).
           `above` predicates in initial state:
           - `above(v12, #o5, v7)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v7)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v8)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v8)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v1)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v1)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v3)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v3)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v4)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v5)`
           
           Both rovers can be above all the rocks at configuration `#o5`.
           Both rovers have `store(v16)` and it's free. `conf(v12, #o5)` and `conf(v14, #o5)` are given.
           Let's use `v12` to sample `v7` (type v6) and `v14` to sample `v3` (type v2).
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13`, and rover `v14` is at `v15`. The sampling configuration `#o5` is different from `v13` and `v15`. However, there are no `move` actions to `#o5` available in the given list of valid actions. Only `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` are available, which means the rovers can only move to their current configurations via a given continuous parameter `#o2`. This implies that the rovers are already at the required configuration `#o5` or that the initial `atconf` implies they are at `#o5` which is not the case. The problem statement says any fact not explicitly stated is false. `atconf(v12, #o5)` and `atconf(v14, #o5)` are not in the initial state. The `conf` predicates just define possible configurations, not current ones. This means we cannot use `#o5` to sample rocks.
           This is a critical issue. The `sample_rock` action requires `atconf(?v, ?q)`. Since there are no move actions to `#o5`, and no `atconf` statements for `#o5` in the initial state, we cannot sample any rocks. Therefore, the goals `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are unachievable.
           
           Rechecking the problem statement: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*."
           `atconf(v12, v13)` is true. `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           `above(v12, #o5, v7)` is true. `conf(v12, #o5)` is true.
           But `atconf(v12, #o5)` is *not* true.
           To sample a rock, say `v7` with `v12`, we would need to be at `conf #o5`. This requires a `move` action. The only move actions available are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which don't change the configuration from the initial one. This means no rock can be sampled.
           
           Therefore, the goal `receivedanalysis(?r)` for a rock `r` cannot be achieved. The goal `new-axiom@0()` includes `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, which makes the overall goal unachievable.
           
           Let me double check the interpretation of `conf(v12, #o5)`. This fact typically indicates that `#o5` is a valid configuration for `v12`. It does not mean `v12` is currently *at* that configuration. `atconf` specifies the current configuration.
           
           Given the restricted list of valid actions, and no `move` actions that change the rover's configuration from its initial `atconf` to the `above` configuration (`#o5`), it's impossible to satisfy the `atconf` precondition for `sample_rock`.
           Thus, the goal is unachievable.
           The only available actions are:
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13)) - moves v12 from v13 to v13 (no change)
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15)) - moves v14 from v15 to v15 (no change)
           ((drop_rock v12 v16)) - cannot drop if not full, and cannot be full if cannot sample
           ((drop_rock v14 v16)) - same as above
           
           All other actions, like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are *not* in the provided list of "valid action instances." This is a new constraint that I did not fully process in my previous attempts. "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           This is a critical piece of information. The given list of valid action instances only includes move actions that effectively do nothing (move to the same configuration) and drop_rock actions which are not applicable without sampling first.
           
           If only these four actions are allowed, then the goal is absolutely unachievable. The goal requires taking and sending images, and sampling and sending analysis of rocks. None of these actions are allowed according to the provided "valid action instances" list.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable given the very limited set of allowed action instances.
           
           ```
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires achieving several subgoals, including `receivedimage` for objectives v17, v18, and v19, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type v2 and a rock of type v6.
           
           The initial state already satisfies `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`.
           
           However, the problem statement specifies: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The provided list of valid action instances is extremely limited:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           To achieve `receivedimage` subgoals, actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` are required. None of these are present in the list of allowed action instances.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis` subgoals, actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are required. None of these are present in the list of allowed action instances. Furthermore, even if `sample_rock` were allowed, it would require the rover to be `atconf` a configuration where it is `above` a rock (e.g., `#o5`). The `move` actions available do not allow the rovers to change their configuration from their initial positions (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) to `#o5`. The `drop_rock` actions are only applicable if a rover is `full` in its store, which would only happen after a `sample_rock` action, which is not allowed.
           
           Since the necessary actions to take images, send images, sample rocks, and send analyses are explicitly disallowed by the given list of valid action instances, the goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be achieved.
           ```
