           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is quite a handful, but I can break it down. It requires me, or rather, the rovers `v12` and `v14`, to accomplish a few things: receive images of two objectives, analyze two types of rock (stone and soil), and be at specific configurations while doing all this.  The first four conditions, specifically `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)` are already met in the initial state. The challenge lies in the latter half: getting those images and analyses.
           
           My initial thought is to identify the necessary actions: `take_image`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis`. To capture an image, I need the `take_image` action, which requires me to be in the correct configuration (`atconf(?v, ?q)` matching the image visibility `imagevisible(?v, ?q, ?y, ?o)`). To send the image and analysis, I need to be in configuration `#o0` for communication. I'll need to use the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, both requiring the correct communication visibility.
           
           Now, let's look at the rocks and the actions associated with them. Rocks `v1`, `v3`, and `v4` are stone and `v5`, `v7`, and `v8` are soil. To analyze and receive data, I'll have to use `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.
           
           Here's the problem: *My* starting configurations. I'm currently at `v13` (Rover `v12`) and `v15` (Rover `v14`).  The initial state specifies the rovers as `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  However, `take_image` and `calibrate` actions need me at configuration `#o3` (where the image is visible), and sending image and analysis requires `#o0` (communication configuration). Looking at the `move` actions, I see the only moves are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. This is a bit odd; it looks like these actions leave me right where I started. They are self-moves from the same configuration. No trajectory or parameter lets me move to configuration `#o3` or `#o0`.  This means I'm stuck at my initial configuration and can't reach the required communication or image acquisition positions.  My assumption of  `blocked(?y)` being false is also correct as there are no negated `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` in the initial state or that can be derived.
           
           Thus, I'm stuck. I cannot change my configuration, and the actions I need to achieve the goal state require configurations I cannot reach. *Therefore, I must conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable given the constraints of the initial state and the available actions.* No matter how I try to piece it together, I'm geographically locked. The only move actions provided will keep me at the initial configuration and the necessary predicates for image and data transfer can never be achieved given those constraints.
