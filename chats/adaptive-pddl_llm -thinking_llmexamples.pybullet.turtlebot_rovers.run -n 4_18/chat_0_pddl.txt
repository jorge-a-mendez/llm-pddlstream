           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem and Determining Unachievability**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. This boils down to ensuring several conditions are met, including receiving images of four objectives and receiving analysis of two specific rocks (one stone, one soil). Initially, some conditions are already true, but the image and analysis reception are not.
           
           My approach: I need to devise a plan using only the allowed actions. To accomplish the image and analysis reception, I need actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, upon examining the provided allowed actions, I find only `move` (which are essentially no-ops in this case) and `drop_rock` actions available.
           
           The issue arises because the actions that *can* change the relevant predicates (like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) are not available for use.  Even if I were to utilize the actions that are available, those don't have any impact on meeting the goal. Furthermore, the necessary actions to achieve the conditions involve actions not on the allowed list. 
           
           I've carefully examined the initial state and the implications of each action. I've concluded that the `new-axiom@0()` goal is unachievable with the given set of permissible actions. The key problem is the absence of actions like `send_image` and `send_analysis` which are necessary to satisfy the goal.
