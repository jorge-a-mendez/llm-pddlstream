           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan for a New Axiom**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've got this goal: to establish a new axiom, essentially placing a specific object of a certain type onto another object. Let's break it down. We need an object that's the right type (v17) and we need to have it 'on' another object, specifically 'v18'.  Looking at the current state, we've got two candidates, v8 and v12, both of the correct type.
           
           To get an object 'on' another, it has to be supported at a certain pose.  In this case, v18 *already* supports both v8 and v12 at pose #o2. So, logically, we need to move either v8 or v12 to that #o2 pose.
           
           Let's focus on v8 first. It's graspable, and it's currently at pose v9. So, the plan is: Pick up v8 from v9 and place it at #o2. Simple enough.
           
           However, the `pick` action has a precondition that's proving to be the real bottleneck: `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v8)`.  This means that for the pick to work, there can't be *any* other graspable objects in the scene. Unfortunately, there are: v12 and v15.  This means the robot *cannot* pick up an object from a pose and move it to a different pose given the constraint of multiple graspable objects.
           
           My first thought was that perhaps this axiom's definition wasn't a standard, strict implication (iff), but rather an implication of some kind. That is, the conjunction must be true for `new-axiom@0` to be true.  But this interpretation does not solve the problem.
           
           Let's also look at the other axiom that defines `on`. If it is the standard interpretation of the axiom, then this would be fine.
           
           It seems the `unsafeatraj(#o4)` condition, given how it's defined and how it's stated in the failure trace, is the problem here. I'm limited to using only the available action instances. My conclusion is that it's impossible to execute a pick because of the safety constraint tied to the trajectory, and therefore it is impossible to move an object into the new goal state.
