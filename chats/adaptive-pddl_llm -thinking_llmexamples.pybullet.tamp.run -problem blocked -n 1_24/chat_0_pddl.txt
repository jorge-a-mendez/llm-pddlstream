           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning on Goal Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object, let's call it `?green`, is placed *on* `v18` and has a specific *type* (`v17`). I immediately check the initial state for objects of type `v17`. Looks like we have two candidates: `v12` and `v8`.
           
           To be "on" `v18`, an object needs to be both supported by `v18` and positioned at a specific pose. For instance, if `v12` is *supported* by `v18` and its *current pose* were such that it's also true, we're golden. Same goes for `v8`.
           
           I start by evaluating `v12`. I see that `v12` is *supported* by `v14` in the initial state. Though, I do see a promising fact: `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. If only `v12` were *at pose* `#o2`, it would be supported by `v18` and fulfil the `on` requirement! 
           
           Similarly, for `v8`, I discover that, it is *supported* by `v11` initially. And also has the same promising `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` fact, so if only it were *at pose* `#o2`, it would be successful too.
           
           It appears the challenge is to move either `v12` or `v8` to that `#o2` pose. I start pondering on how to reposition `v8`. To achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`, I recognize the necessity of `pick`ing `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) and then `place`ing it at the desired `#o2` pose.
           
           Here's where it gets tricky. The `pick` action requires various preconditions, including specific kinematic parameters (`kin`) and a *grasp* (`grasp(v8, #o1)` in our case). Crucially, it needs continuous parameters, that are missing from the action instance list.  
           
           The problem statement's constraint is critical: only the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted. This action is simply moving the robot's base without affecting object poses. This restricts any manipulation of objects.
           
           Thus, the goal is unattainable.
