           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical partition along x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including two in the top right and top left corners (7 and 8), two near the top center (9 and 10), and one near the bottom center (6). Several smaller obstacles are also present. I will aim for positions within the max_range of 2 from the target point, and attempt to diversify the positions to explore different viewing angles and avoid potential occlusions.

Model:     The previous attempts collided with obstacle 16, which is located at `((-0.8687484496102532, 0.13970135815284646), (-0.7402426964773933, 0.2682071112857064))`. The target point is at `(-0.682, 2.056)`. This means I need to avoid placing the robot base in that region. Also, one position was not reachable, so I must stay within the x and y limits. I'll aim for positions that are further away from x=-0.8 and y=0.2, trying to stay within the max range of 2. I'll try to find positions on different sides of the target to ensure line of sight.

Model:     The target point is now `(0.625, 2.128)`. The previous attempts for *this* target point failed as follows:
           - `(1.0, 1.0)` collided with obstacle 18 `((0.925, 0.670), (1.065, 0.810))`
           - `(2.0, 0.5)` had no line of sight. This position is quite far to the right and low.
           - `(0.5, 2.0)` collided with obstacles 9 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` and 22 `((0.576, 2.079), (0.673, 2.177))`. This position was very close to the target, but clearly inside an obstacle.
           
           It appears there are obstacles directly surrounding the target point at `(0.625, 2.128)`. Obstacle 9 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` is a large rectangular block covering the area immediately around the target. Obstacle 22 `((0.576, 2.079), (0.673, 2.177))` is even tighter around the target.
           I need to find a position outside these obstacles but still within 2 units of the target.
           Since the target is between x=0.25 and x=0.75, and between y=1.75 and y=2.25, I should try to move away from this region. Given the target's high y-coordinate, I will try positions with slightly lower y, and varying x, making sure to avoid the obstacle 9 and 22. Also avoid obstacle 18.
