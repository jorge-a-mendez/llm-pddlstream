           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable: A Deep Dive into Blocked Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which, as a seasoned roboticist, I immediately recognize as `on(?green, v18)`.  And since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, it's clear that `?green` needs to be `v12`. So, the real target here is `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Now, to make `v12` *on* `v18`, it needs to be *at* the correct pose. Given that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, the plan hinges on getting `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. The plan: pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           Here's where things get interesting, and the plan falls apart. The `pick` action has crucial preconditions. It needs `handempty(v4)`, `atbconf(#o3)`, and, most importantly, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. This last condition is a killer.
           
           Let's unpack that `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.  The parameterized axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)` essentially says "there's another graspable object around besides `?o`."  The *negated* version, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`, means the opposite: "there's *no* other graspable object around, only `?o`".  This is the catch.
           
           In the initial state, we have both `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)`.  Thus, *any* `pick` action will fail. If I try to pick `v12`, `v15` breaks the "only graspable object" rule. If I try to pick `v15`, `v12` breaks the rule. It's a double whammy.
           
           On top of that, the initial state is missing an important condition, `atbconf(#o3)`. The `pick` and `move_base` actions require the base configuration to be explicitly *at* `#o3`, however, the information given only establishes that `bconf(#o3)` is a static predicate, and since the problem statement establishes that "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is false," no actions can be executed.
           
           Since no pick action can be taken, `v12`'s `atpose` status cannot be changed. This means `atpose(v12, #o2)` cannot be made true, and thus `on(v12, v18)` remains false, making the goal unreachable. The problem lies with this `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition that blocks any object manipulation at the start, along with the required `atbconf(#o3)` being false.
