           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain.**
           
           My objective is to get an object, either `v8` or `v12`, onto the receptacle `v18`. I know that both `v8` and `v12` are the right type of object.  Initially, they're both on different locations, currently `v8` is `on(v11)` and `v12` is `on(v14)`.  The plan is to move the robot base, pick up the object, and then place it on the receptacle `v18`.
           
           I'll start with the base, and move it to a suitable configuration `#o3` (this is determined by the planning system).
           
           Next, comes the trickier part: *picking*.  This is where things get interesting because of a predicate called `new-axiom@0(?o)`.  Based on the PDDL, it *seems* to mean that I can *only* pick an object if there's no *other* graspable object in the scene. That would make this impossible, because there are several graspable objects right now: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. However, I'm assuming that this might not be the *exact* interpretation I'm meant to follow. There's a chance this is a clearance check and the planner is able to handle this. So, even though it's problematic, I'm *assuming* the pick action is possible.
           
           After picking up the object, I'll place it on the receptacle, `#o2`.
           
           So, the actions are:
           1.  `move_base` from `v3` to  `#o3` (a configuration found by the TAMP solver).
           2.  `pick` an object  (either `v8` or `v12` will work)
           3.  `place` the object onto `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           There are a few key constraints I have to ensure are true, specifically the *negative preconditions*: `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach`, `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj`, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0`. The last one is the most significant, and I am assuming that the solver finds parameters to make the condition false, because no pick could be done otherwise.  I *really* hope the planner finds the right continuous values for trajectories and grasps and that I can make the plan.
