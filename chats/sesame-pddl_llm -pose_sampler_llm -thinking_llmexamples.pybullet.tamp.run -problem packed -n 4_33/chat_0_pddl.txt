(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to place an object (ID 4) with dimensions approximately 0.0981 x 0.0981 onto a surface defined by the AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I need 50 unique, valid (surf_idx, theta, x, y) placements, ensuring the object remains entirely within the surface bounds.
           
           Given the object is nearly square, the rotation angle (`theta`) will not dramatically impact the effective bounding box dimensions.  However, for complete coverage, I'm considering 9 distinct orientations: `0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, `pi/2`, `2pi/3`, `3pi/4`, `5pi/6`, `pi`.  Each orientation generates a slightly different effective width/height which I then carefully adjust the center point's placement range to accomodate.
           
           To ensure valid placements, I am calculating the *effective* width and height of the rotated object using the formula:
           `effective_w = obj_size_x * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_size_y * abs(sin(theta))` and `effective_h = obj_size_x * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_size_y * abs(cos(theta))`. Given the object's square nature, the values will be nearly identical, but the calculation is required for precision.  Knowing these effective dimensions, I am calculating the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates of the object. For each rotation angle, I am restricting the placement center, based on the effective widths/heights, to stay within the surface limits. 
           
           I'm generating a grid of placements.  I've chosen `x_center_count=4` and `y_center_count=3` to determine a distribution of object center points. The code generates 108 valid points with these settings (a total of 9 angle variations times 4 points along x times 3 points along y, totaling 108 unique grid points) from which I'll choose the first 50.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Placing Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object ID 4 previously, good to keep that in mind for future conflicts. Now, it's time to tackle placing object ID 5 on surface 0.  The geometry is straightforward: surface 0 is a simple square,  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object ID 5's dimensions are almost square too at `(0.081384439752682, 0.08138443975268195)`.
           
           Since this is the first time I'm placing object ID 5, and I'm asked for *just* 50 stable placements, I can ignore any collision checks with previously placed objects (the instructions make it clear that I only need to consider conflicts between already-placed and *new* objects if they're both present in the scene, which isn't the case here).
           
           My plan is simple:
           1.  **Rotation:** I'll use different rotation angles (`theta`) to generate varied placements.  
           2.  **Effective Dimensions:** For each `theta`, I'll calculate the effective width and height of object ID 5.
           3.  **Valid Range:** Based on the effective dimensions and surface 0's boundaries, I'll calculate the valid range for the center (x, y) of the object.  This ensures it stays within the surface.
           4.  **Grid Generation:**  I'll create a grid of center points within that valid range.
           5.  **Collection:** I'll need to make sure to collect 50 unique placements.
           
           Here's the breakdown:
           
           *   Object ID 5's dimensions: `obj_size_x = 0.081384439752682`, `obj_size_y = 0.08138443975268195`
           *   Surface 0's bounds: `s0_lx = -0.135`, `s0_ly = -0.135`, `s0_ux = 0.135`, `s0_uy = 0.135`
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective dimensions are the object's original dimensions.
           
           I'll calculate the valid range. Because these calculations are straightforward, I'll avoid showing them step by step. I've already determined that the valid x and y coordinates are approximately  `[-0.0943, 0.0943]`.
           
           To create a diverse grid, for `theta=0`, I'll use a 5x5 grid in the x and y directions. This gives me 25 placements. Now, to get the full 50, I need a good second rotation. The most obvious one is to rotate the object to `pi/2` (90 degrees). In practice, since the object is nearly square, this gives almost the same set of placements.
           I can be more efficient and choose a `pi/4` (45 degrees) rotation instead. Then `x` and `y` coordinates will be reduced to the range `[-0.077, 0.077]`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, I'll also use a 5x5 grid.
           
           This should give me 50 unique placements: 25 for `theta = 0` and 25 for `theta = pi/4`.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Placement Strategies for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 6 on surface 0. This is a square object, about 9 cm on each side. The surface itself is about 27 cm x 27 cm, and I know I need to avoid colliding with two objects that are already placed there: ID 4 and ID 5. Crucially, these aren't just *fixed* obstacles; I'm told I need to treat them as *non-fixed* obstacles that are now "fixed" within the problem space, meaning I need to *explicitly avoid them*. This is a critical distinction!
           
           The challenge is that the instructions state, "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This gives me the crucial insight that the provided list of successful placements (ID 4 and ID 5) represents the "final" set of non-colliding configurations in the scene. In my reasoning, I recognize that if objects ID 4 and ID 5 *were* colliding, then those configurations would have failed. This suggests that even if there is overlap in the bounding box, they are "simultaneously present" because that is the "known state."
           
           After examining the AABBs of objects ID 4 and ID 5, it's clear they are close, and overlap. This means that I *must* calculate the combined area of those two objects to ensure collision-free placements of ID 6. Basically, I need to treat the space *already* taken by ID 4 and ID 5 as a combined, fixed obstacle.
           
           I need to make sure to account for rotation as well. I need to calculate the *effective* width and height of ID 6 at different rotation angles. The square object's *effective* dimensions depend on theta, its value will range from the given size to a diagonal equivalent (about 12.8cm). I'll start with the simplest case, theta=0, so the x, y values of the center can be easily validated.
           
           I'm now implementing the checks in my head. I'll test points for ID 6 that would ensure that its AABB does not overlap with the existing objects, ID 4 and ID 5, using a bounding-box collision detection method.  I've chosen the algorithm to filter out collisions. After this, a deeper grid is run.
           
           The plan is to iterate through several rotation values and, for each, test a grid of possible center points. If a placement *doesn't* collide with ID 4 or ID 5 (which means it doesn't collide with the union of their areas), I record that placement and keep going. I'll increase the grid density if I don't find enough placements on the first pass. The most critical point is that I cannot treat this as a simple problem of placing a square; it's placing *a square in a space that has already been occupied* and has to adjust for these rotations, object size, and collision zones. I'll need to carefully track the regions, taking the effective width and height into account. I believe my strategy should generate valid points.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 7 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, a 0.27 x 0.27 area centered at the origin. I need to avoid collisions with previously placed objects: ID 4, ID 5, and ID 6.
           
           First, I established the bounding boxes of the obstacles, which are defined as AABBs centered at x,y with no rotation. I computed the AABB for ID 7 which has size `0.094` to allow efficient checking. The effective dimensions change based on the rotation angle (theta).
           
           I use a collision detection function to determine overlap between the bounding boxes to solve the placement problem. I am then implementing a systematic search approach. For each possible rotation (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2, ...), I generate a grid of center points within the bounds of Surface 0, checking for collisions with the existing objects at each point.  The grid will be refined from previous iterations.
           
           I calculate a grid for valid center points for `theta = 0`. With that knowledge, I refine a filter of points far from the obstacles and calculate the valid placements.
           
           My approach will first use a grid of points, and then will verify these points for valid locations.  I'm generating a bounding box and comparing it with the existing obstacle locations. I will also incorporate additional rotation angles.
