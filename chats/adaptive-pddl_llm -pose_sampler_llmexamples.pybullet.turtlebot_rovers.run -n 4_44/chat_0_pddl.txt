User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including some in the corners and some along the central vertical wall, and several small boxes in various locations.
           
           The target point is (1.0, 0.0). I need to find positions within 2 units of this point. This means positions (x,y) such that (x-1)^2 + y^2 <= 2^2 = 4.
           
           I will try to place the robot at various angles and distances from the target point, ensuring it's within the bounding box [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y. I will avoid the central wall at x=0. The target is on the positive x side of the central wall.
           
           Given the target point is (1.0, 0.0), a circle with radius 2 centered at (1.0, 0.0) covers x values from -1 to 3 and y values from -2 to 2. This area is mostly within the bounds of the environment. I need to avoid the vertical wall at x=0. The target is to the right of this wall. I also need to be mindful of the other smaller obstacles.
           
           I will prioritize positions with positive x values to be on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 1.5)
           (2.0 0.0)
           (1.0 -1.5)
