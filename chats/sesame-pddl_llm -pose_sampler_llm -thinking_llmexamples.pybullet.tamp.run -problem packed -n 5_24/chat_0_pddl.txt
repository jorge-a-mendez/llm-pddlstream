(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square object with dimensions approximately 0.0865 x 0.0865, on surface 0, which is a square AABB defined by the points (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Since the object is square, its bounding box size won't change regardless of rotation.  This simplifies things considerably! My placement definition involves the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x,y coordinates for the object's center.  Stability, in this context, boils down to full containment within the surface and avoiding collisions, which isn't a factor yet since this is the first placement of object 4.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center (x, y) so it stays completely within the surface bounds.  Half of the object's dimension is roughly 0.043. Therefore, the object's center can move within the range from  -0.135 + 0.043 = -0.092 to 0.135 - 0.043 = 0.092 for both x and y.
           
           To achieve this, I'm going to create a 7x7 grid of placements within this valid range, using a step size of roughly 0.0306.  These 49 points will all have a rotation angle of 0.  I'll then add a 50th placement at the center of the surface (0,0) with a 45-degree rotation (pi/4 radians). This approach will allow me to cover a broad range of placements while ensuring stability and avoiding any current collision concerns.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to safely place Object 6, a square object, on Surface 0, taking into account the prior successful placement of Object 4, which is also square and already in place.  I've got the exact dimensions and positioning details for both objects, which is critical.
           
           First, I need to define the "forbidden zone" where Object 6 *cannot* be placed to avoid collisions. I know Object 4 is located at the bottom-left corner of the surface with no rotation. I've calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for Object 4 using its dimensions, half-extents, and its known center.  This tells me the exact area Object 4 occupies on the surface.
           
           Next, I'll figure out the valid placement area for Object 6. I know the surface's total extent. Using Object 6's half-extents, I've calculated the minimum and maximum *x* and *y* coordinates to keep the object completely within the surface bounds.  This defines my initial valid area *before* considering Object 4.
           
           The core of this problem is collision avoidance. To avoid a collision I calculated the cutoff region for Object 6 using Object 4's dimensions.
           
           The strategy is:
           
           1.  **Calculate the Collision Zone:** Based on Object 4's AABB, I've determined a "no-go" zone for Object 6's center point. Basically, if Object 6's center falls within a certain bottom-left region of the surface, it will collide with Object 4.
           2.  **Define Valid Placement Region:** I've identified the valid placement region (L-shaped) where Object 6's center can be located without causing a collision. This is basically the full surface area, minus the bottom-left corner where Object 4 is.
           3.  **Generate Placement Candidates:** I'll generate a set of candidate placements by creating a grid of potential center points for Object 6.  I'll ensure these points are *outside* the calculated collision zone.  I'll perform this by generating an 8x8 grid and performing the logic explained above. That will give 48 valid locations.
           4.  **Add Rotated Placements:** Because Object 6 is square, I'll add a few placements where the object is rotated by 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  This will use the same strategy to find two rotated points. These will be added to the 48 above to have 50 placements total.
           
           By sticking to this approach, I can guarantee that all generated placements will be collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object 5 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with objects 4 and 6. Surface 0's dimensions are pretty straightforward, and object 5 is a square with a known size.  My initial approach will be to generate a grid of potential positions for object 5, check them for collisions, and keep the valid ones. I'll start with object 5 unrotated (at theta = 0) to get some placements. If I don't get enough valid placements, I'll incorporate a rotation of pi/4 to fill the spaces.
           
           **Collision Detection and Free Space Analysis**
           
           The key here is accurate collision detection. I've calculated the half-extents of all objects. Using these, I'll determine the AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes) for each. I'll need to check the AABB of object 5 against the AABBs of objects 4 and 6 for overlaps. I've also calculated the AABB for object 5 after rotating it to pi/4.
           
           To avoid collisions with object 4, the center of object 5 must not fall within the region covered by object 4 plus a buffer equal to object 5's half extent. Similarly, for object 6. This forms some exclusion zones that I need to account for.
           
           **Generating and Filtering Placement Candidates**
           
           My plan is to create a 12x12 grid of candidate positions for object 5 on surface 0. I'll calculate `x` and `y` coordinates to center the object. I'll calculate the 12 possible `x` positions. Then I'll check each of the 144 positions against the collision criteria. I will iterate through this list and discard any positions where there's a collision. I'll keep doing this until I have 50 unique placement positions. If not, I'll then move on to generating rotated placements, and repeating this process until I have sufficient valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to place 50 stable instances of a new object (ID 7) on Surface 0, ensuring they avoid collisions with three existing objects (IDs 4, 6, and 5).
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints: Surface 0 is a square area with bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The new object is a square of size 0.09545. I’ll calculate valid placement boundaries considering the object's half-extents. Object 4, at a known location, has a bounding box. Object 6 has a bounding box. Object 5 has a bounding box.
           
           The strategy involves two steps.
           
           First I generate a grid of potential center points for object 7. I’ll generate a 10x10 grid.  For each center point, I'll calculate the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). This is the critical step to check for collisions: is the potential bounding box overlapping any of the bounding boxes of existing objects? Initially, I'll consider object 7 unrotated (theta = 0).
           
           If I haven't reached 50 placements, I'll repeat the process, but this time I'll consider the object rotated by 45 degrees (theta = pi/4).  For this, I must also recalculate object 7's AABB.  I'll use a slightly smaller grid.
           
           A function checks if two AABBs overlap. If no overlap, the placement is valid.
           
           I am now confident that the methodology will generate exactly 50 non-colliding placements.
