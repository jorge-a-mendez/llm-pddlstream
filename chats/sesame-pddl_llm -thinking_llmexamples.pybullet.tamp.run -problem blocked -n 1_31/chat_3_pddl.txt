           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My initial thought is that I need to satisfy both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The initial state gives me `type(v12, v17)`, meaning I can use `v12` as my `?green` object. So, I need to focus on getting `v12` to be `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To make `on(v12, v18)` true, I must ensure that `v12` is both supported by a pose `?p` and that `v12` is at pose `?p`. Luckily, I have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` in my initial state, so I need `v12` to be at `#o2`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13`. I've got a plan:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Using the `pick` action with `v4` (the manipulator), I'll pick `v12` up from its current location, `v13`. I need to ensure the preconditions of this action are met, specifically that I can manipulate `v12` and it's safe to do so. Based on the initial state, everything is looking good for the pick.
           2.  **Place:** After picking, I'll use the `place` action to place `v12` at `#o2`, which is supported by `v18`. Again, I will check that preconditions for the place are met to ensure successful completion.
           
           With these two actions, I will have `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Since the initial state provides `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, I'll have the combined state I need for `on(v12, v18)`. Since the type of `v12` matches a part of `new-axiom@0()`, I'm confident I can prove it with this state.
           
           I've reviewed the possible base move and decided it is unnecessary since the robot arm's kinematics, `kin()`, are satisfied in the current base configuration. I do not have unsafe conditions, so it can operate safely. Since the `kin` facts and other necessary initial conditions seem to be met, my plan with pick and place appears to be the most direct, and hopefully the least costly given the least cost requirement.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Problem: A Missing Piece in the Puzzle**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan fell apart because of the `atbconf(#o3)` condition not being satisfied. Let's dig into this. I've been given a complex initial state description, and it's clear something's amiss.
           
           Initially, I noted that `bconf(#o3)` *is* present in the initial state. But, after a more careful look, I realize my mistake. The problem here is the distinction between `bconf` and `atbconf`. The initial state has `bconf(#o3)`, indicating that `#o3` is a base configuration. However, it *lacks* the crucial `atbconf(#o3)` predicate. This means that, while `#o3` is a possible configuration, the robot *isn't currently at* that configuration. This is the root of the issue.
           
           Now, let's examine the actions. The `pick` and `place` actions, the heart of the plan, all *require* `atbconf(?q)` as a precondition. The `move_base` action does as well. Without an initial `atbconf`, we are stuck. No action can be taken because they all depend on an initial state that is not present. This makes the goal unreachable given the state.
           
           The robot must be at a base configuration (specified by `atbconf`) to perform picking, placing, or any base movement actions. But, the provided initial state doesn't have it. I need to be sure. I'm going to look again at the actions and states again.
           
           Looking at the problem again, the fact that `atbconf` is missing from the initial state means the goal is impossible to achieve with the provided actions. None of the available actions have an open route. The plan cannot succeed because the robot is not initialized at any base. I can verify.
