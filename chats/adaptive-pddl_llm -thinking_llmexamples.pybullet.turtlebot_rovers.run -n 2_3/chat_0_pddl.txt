           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Rover Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, I've got a handle on this. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to getting images and analysis of both stone and soil samples.  I can see that the initial state already satisfies the 'atconf' and 'free' conditions, so those are good. The challenge is in the "receivedimage" and "receivedanalysis" atoms.
           
           To receive an image, I need to 'take_image' and then 'send_image'. The 'send_image' part is straightforward – the rovers are visible to the base station, the mode is set, and the way is clear (no blocked paths).  So, I need to get the rovers to *take* an image first.
           
           The problem is that the 'take_image' action requires calibration, onboard camera, and also needs my rovers to be in the correct locations to view and image the target. All of these requirements seem easy to satisfy *except* for the 'atconf' (at configuration) condition for `sample_rock`. The available *move* actions are useless as they do not change the configuration. This means I'm stuck, and I can't move my rovers from their starting locations (`v13` and `v15`).
           Let's see:
           
           *   I can't calibrate the cameras, or *take* images for the soil and stone sample. This is an issue.
           *   The rovers are also stuck.
           *   No matter what I do, my actions will be unsuccesful.
           *   Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           I'm confident in my analysis. Given the provided actions, I can't meet the preconditions necessary to achieve the goal state. The initial rover configurations and the constraints imposed by the move actions are the showstoppers. I need to make sure I am in the correct state to act, and the actions given do not allow for that. This plan is impossible with the current set of actions and initial conditions.
