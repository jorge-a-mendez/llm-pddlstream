User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.044, -0.31, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.023).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.24, -0.136, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.762, 0.647).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.197, -0.233, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.788, 0.615).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.14, -0.5), (0.233, -0.407)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.007, -0.347), (0.081, -0.274)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.199, -0.176), (0.28, -0.096)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.186, -0.454, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.539, 0.842).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.24, -0.275), (-0.155, -0.19)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Summary: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My objective is to achieve the state where objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all located *on* object `v18`. Initially, these objects are resting on `v11`.  My usual approach would involve crafting a series of "pick" and "place" actions, utilizing a robot arm to move these objects from `v11` onto `v18`. I'd analyze available `kin` facts—which relate arm configurations to object poses and grasp points—to define valid arm movements. These `kin` facts would dictate the allowable actions for a robotic arm `v4`.
           
           However, a critical constraint has been imposed: I can only use a specific action instance. I'm given a very short list: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options, as it's a movement of the robot's *base* from configuration `v3` to the same configuration `v3`. This 'base' movement has no real impact, as no actual displacement happens.
           
           The "on" predicate can only be changed by the actions pick and place, and pick and place actions are not allowed.
           
           This constraint, combined with the initial state and goal, means that it is impossible to move the objects as specified.
           
           Therefore, the only conclusion I can make is that the goal is currently unachievable, given the actions available.
