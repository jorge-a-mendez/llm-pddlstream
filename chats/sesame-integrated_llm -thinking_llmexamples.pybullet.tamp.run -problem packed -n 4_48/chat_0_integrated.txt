           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.206, 0.237, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.927, 0.375).

           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           My goal is to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16), currently all located on surface v11, onto surface v18. I'm leveraging the robot arm (v4) and its base (v3) for this task. The crucial aspect is positioning each object on v18, ensuring a collision-free solution.
           
           First, I reviewed the problem setup, including the initial positions of the objects and the goal state. I've noted the poses associated with each object, their respective AABBs, and the AABBs for surfaces v11 and v18. Surface v18 is small, so careful placement is necessary. Since the actions use symbolic poses named '#o2', I've interpreted this as indicating the use of different continuous poses for placing the objects. I will use the '#o2' symbol but assign unique (x,y,z,theta) values for each object on the surface.
           
           To create the plan, I decided to use a pick-and-place strategy for each object. I will *move_base* the robot to config `#o3` and then *pick* each object from its initial pose on v11 and *place* it at a new pose on surface v18. I'm assuming that the height of each object on the new pose will be similar to its starting height, so I will ensure that the placement is at roughly z = 0.781. The height of the surface on which the objects will rest, the surface v18, is at this height.
           
           The available poses for the objects are:
           -   `v8` at (0.206, 0.237, 0.781, 0)
           -   `v12` at (0.191, 0.547, 0.781, 0)
           -   `v14` at (0.158, -0.364, 0.781, 0)
           -   `v16` at (0.03, 0.344, 0.781, 0)
           
           I have decided that on the new surface v18, each object will be placed in a 2x2 grid, with a center around the center of the surface: (-0.08, 0.08), (0.08, 0.08), (-0.08, -0.08), (0.08, -0.08). The original poses had high z component and low w component which is usually indicative of a rotation of about 90 degrees. However, to keep it simple, I will set all theta values to zero.  The bounding boxes for the objects and the new placement positions will need to be checked. For my placement strategy I have calculated the maximum extents of the AABBs for each of the objects. I checked for collisions by ensuring each object doesn't overlap on x and y axes. I verified that the new positions do not overlap and each object will be fully contained within v18, maintaining a 0.06m gap.
           
           I've checked the constraints, including those on unsafe approaches, and ensured that the poses do not create any such unsafe conditions.
           
           The final plan is as follows:
           1.  *move_base* to `#o3`
           2.  *pick* object v8 from its initial location
           3.  *place* object v8 at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0) on v18.
           4.  *pick* object v12 from its initial location
           5.  *place* object v12 at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0) on v18.
           6.  *pick* object v14 from its initial location
           7.  *place* object v14 at (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0) on v18.
           8.  *pick* object v16 from its initial location
           9.  *place* object v16 at (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0) on v18.
           
           This sequence of actions ensures that all objects reach their destination without collisions, given my chosen configuration.
