           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` onto object `v18`. Initial analysis suggests focusing on objects `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates since they are already identified as type `v17`. The crucial step involves manipulating these objects to be "on" `v18`, necessitating establishing the predicate `on(?green, v18)`.  This requires ensuring two preconditions: the object is supported by `v18` (`supported(?green, ?p, v18)`) and has a specific pose within `v18`'s scope (`atpose(?green, ?p)`).
           
           Examining the initial state, I've identified that both `v8` and `v12` are supported by `v18` with respect to a pose `#o2`. This implies that if either object's pose could be manipulated to be `#o2`, the goal would be attainable. My initial instinct is to use `pick` and `place` actions to modify the respective poses of `v8` and `v12`. However, a crucial constraint is introduced: only the provided action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted.  
           
           The sole allowable action, `move_base`, solely alters the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) and `canmove()` (from true to false). This action does not impact the objects' positions within the environment, which is controlled by the `atpose` predicate. Because the plan requires repositioning the object to a specific `atpose` relation, and only a trivial `move_base` action is available, it is not possible for me to alter the `atpose` relations, which is essential to achieving `on(?green, v18)`. Consequently, based on the problem constraints (allowing only `move_base` action), the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable in this environment. Therefore, I must conclude there is no feasible plan to satisfy this particular goal.
