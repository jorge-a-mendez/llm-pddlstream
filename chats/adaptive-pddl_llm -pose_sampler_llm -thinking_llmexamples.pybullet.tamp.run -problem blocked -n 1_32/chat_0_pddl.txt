(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. This surface is defined by its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0), which gives us a nice 0.6x0.6 area to play with.  Object 5 is pretty tiny, only 0.07 x 0.07, so we've got plenty of room. A "stable placement" means the rotated object's AABB has to fit entirely within the surface's AABB, and for this, we consider theta the rotation angle.
           
           Since this object is close to a square (0.07 x 0.07), rotation won't drastically change its effective size.  We need to calculate the rotated AABB's dimensions. After rotation, the rotated width is 0.07 \* (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|), and the rotated height is 0.07 \* (|sin(theta)| + |cos(theta)|). At theta = 0, both the rotated width and height will be 0.07. At pi/4, the rotated width and rotated height will both be 0.07 * (sqrt(2)) or about 0.099.
           
           We'll systematically vary theta (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). For each theta, we calculate the bounds for the object's center (x, y).  The center's minimum x coordinate is calculated by: `4.2 + (rotated_width/2)` and maximum at `4.8 - (rotated_width/2)`. Same logic applies for the y bounds using `rotated_height`, using -0.6 for surface minimum y and 0.0 for maximum y.
           
           Now, we'll pick 2 x values for even spacing across x_range.  We will pick 5 y positions in the same way, and for these y values, we pick five points in y_range. This yields 2 \* 5 = 10 configurations per theta angle. These positions will ensure complete coverage within the valid surface range for each orientation.  In the case of `theta = pi/4`, we will have to calculate those exact ranges, as well as the bounds for all of our thetas.
           
           Here's the plan for generating each point `(<surf_idx>, <theta>, <x>, <y>)`:
           - First, we iterate the thetas from 0 to pi/2 in 5 increments, where we obtain the value for rotated_width and rotated_height.
           - In each theta loop, we determine the valid x and y bounds given the dimensions of surface 0 and the current rotation.
           - For each rotation, generate 2 (x, 5y) combinations, yielding a total of 10 points per rotation.
           - This creates 5 \* 10 = 50 configurations, and the final list will be composed of exactly 50 points.
           - Output each coordinate as (<surf_idx>, <theta>, <x>, <y>) to fulfill the requirements, and all valid configurations will be ready!
           
           Finally, each placement is checked for validity during setup to make sure that each AABB is entirely contained within the surface, and that our 50 placements are well-distributed.
