(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.08952529383563307) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).  My primary concern is ensuring the object's bounding box is entirely within the surface's bounds for stability. Because the object and surface are both squares, the object's bounding box doesn't change with rotation. This means that *any* rotation is technically valid as long as the center point is properly contained.
           
           First, I calculated the permissible range for the object's center (x, y).  The object's half-width (0.044762646917816535) is subtracted from the surface bounds to define the valid range:  -0.09023735308218347 <= x <= 0.09023735308218347  and the same for *y*.
           
           To get 50 diverse placements, I'll generate a 7x7 grid (49 placements) across the valid x and y ranges. I calculated the step size for the grid as 0.030079117694061156.  For most points in the grid I'll use a `theta` of 0 radians to keep the computation easy.
           
           Finally, I'll add one additional placement at the center (0, 0) with an angle of pi/3 to ensure 50 total placements.

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Placement Challenge:**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 4, to place, and I know object ID 5 was successfully placed in the same scene before. The tricky part? I *must* avoid collisions between the two. The instruction states that the previous successful placement of object 5 acts as an obstacle for this new object. Got it.
           
           **Understanding the Terrain:**
           
           First, let's break down the playing field. The scene is this simple square surface, Surface 0, which spans from coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I'm dealing with squares here, so the dimensions simplify things a bit.
           
           **Object ID 4's Profile:**
           
           Object 4 is another square, with sides of 0.077147355360624 units. That means its half-width and half-height are roughly 0.0386 each.
           
           **Calculating a Safe Zone (Without Object 5):**
           
           Now, if I were placing object 4 in isolation, I'd know it has to stay within the surface's boundaries. But I need to leave a buffer to avoid edge overlap. This translates to valid center coordinates (x, y) falling in the range: `[-0.0964, 0.0964]` for both.
           
           **The Obstacle: Object 5's Influence:**
           
           The previous placement of object 5, which was on the surface 0, is the key here. It’s located in the bottom left corner, approximately at (-0.0902, -0.0902) (centered). Object 5 has dimensions of approximately `0.0895 x 0.0895`. Its AABB is approximately `[-0.135, -0.0455]` x `[-0.135, -0.0455]`. So it takes up that portion of the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           **Avoiding Collisions (The Crux of the Matter):**
           
           To find the correct placements, I need to account for this obstruction. I’ve defined the region for all possible positions for object 4. Then I check for the forbidden region where object 4 would overlap with the AABB of object 5. The collision constraint means that the new valid positions need to be either to the right of or above object 5.
           
           I’m going to skip placements inside an overlapping area.
           The valid region is then `(x_center, y_center)` within `[-0.0964, 0.0964]` of x and y. If I place a grid of possible center placements, I only need to exclude one center point. And then I can apply rotation for even greater diversity, and get 50 valid placements without too much trouble.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 8**
           
           Alright, my goal is to find 50 stable placements for this new object, ID 8, on Surface 0, taking into account the existing objects, ID 5 and ID 4, as obstacles. First, I need to define the object's properties. Object 8 is basically a square with sides of approximately 0.075 units. I'll take half of this value as its effective radius, 0.0377, for collision detection simplicity.
           
           Surface 0 is a square region spanning from -0.135 to 0.135. Given the object's dimensions, its center must be within the smaller region from -0.097 to 0.097 to stay within the surface bounds. Next, the placement of the existing objects becomes key. 
           
           Object 5, located near the surface's origin, has dimensions near to 0.09 units. I've calculated its AABB coordinates, and it occupies a square region around x=-0.09 and y=-0.09. 
           
           Object 4 has very similar properties: a near square near to 0.077 units and also positioned around the surface origin. Its position gives me its AABB coordinates.
           
           To avoid collisions, I determine the forbidden regions for Object 8's center. For Object 5, I calculate the maximum and minimum x,y values for the object 8's center to ensure it won't collide with object 5. Similarly, I calculate it for object 4. The union of these two collision regions determines the overall forbidden area for Object 8's center. 
           
           I've determined a 9x9 grid to create placements. From this, a quick analysis gave that 20 collision regions exist. I've generated a bunch of coordinates that I know won't collide. Since I need exactly 50 placements, I'll take a grid 9x9, for 81 points. Since 20 of these regions are collision zones, it gives 61 possible placements, which is more than enough for what I need. From here I need to place these without collision. These will give me my 50 distinct object placements.

(Thoughts: **My Thinking Process for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 7 on surface 0, making sure I don't collide with objects 5, 4, and 8. First things first, I've got to define the problem. I've calculated the object's dimensions (`0.070955...` x `0.070955...` – it's a square!) and its half-dimensions (`0.0354...`). I know the surface's boundaries, which gives me the valid *range* for object 7's center: `[-0.0995, 0.0995]` for both x and y.
           
           Next, I look at the obstacles. I've got the placement and dimensions for objects 5, 4, and 8. From there, I've calculated their AABBs. I need to make sure none of my placements overlap any of these forbidden AABBs.
           
           Now, to determine where to *avoid*. I can calculate these regions to avoid by considering the placement of the previous objects, plus the size of the new object. I check for overlap between the object 7 AABB and the existing obstacle AABBs, considering its valid center range. This gives me a "forbidden" region within the valid surface range for each object. The forbidden region is where object 7's center *cannot* be.
           
           I've generated a grid of points within the valid surface area, which I can use as starting placement points. For each grid point, I do a collision check. I can iterate over all the grid points, checking for collisions with objects 5, 4, and 8 using the *AABBs* for each.
           
           I've made a function `check_collision` that considers the object 7 AABB and checks if it overlaps with any AABB for the existing obstacles. This will be more accurate than trying to make calculations about forbidden region boundaries!
           
           Finally, I'll return the placements and I am pretty sure I will achieve the needed 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6) on a square surface.  The key challenge is avoiding collisions with four other previously placed objects (IDs 5, 4, 8, and 7), which are also squares.  First, I calculated the valid range for the center of object 6, ensuring it stays within the surface boundaries.
           
           Then, for each of the pre-placed objects, I determined their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). I carefully considered the rotation of these objects, but based on the problem specification, the object's AABB dimensions remained constant, representing the given object sizes in x and y. These AABBs define the "forbidden zones" where object 6's center cannot be.
           
           To find valid placement locations, I initially tried a more analytical approach, calculating the forbidden regions by taking into account the object 6's AABB relative to the others. This required calculating unions of ranges, which became complex quickly.  So I decided to use a more robust, but precise brute-force approach.
           
           I then created a grid of potential center points within the valid surface area. I will iterate through this grid, and at each point, I checked if the potential placement of object 6 would collide with any of the pre-placed objects using a basic AABB-overlap test.  This check ensures that any potential collision would be detected. Once 50 non-colliding locations are found, I'll stop searching. Finally, all the resulting placements will include an angle.
