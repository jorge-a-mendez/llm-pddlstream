           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` which are `graspable` and `stackable` onto `v10` and `v18`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`. Arm `v4` is currently at `aconf v5`, while `v6` is at `aconf v7`. Both arms are `handempty`. The robot base is at `bconf v3`.
           
           The initial state shows `v8` is `atpose v9` and `v12` is `atpose v13`. `v15` is `atpose v16`.
           `v8` is supported by `v11` at `pose v9`.
           `v12` is supported by `v14` at `pose v13`.
           `v15` is supported by `v11` at `pose v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true for some object `?green`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So, if `v8` or `v12` is placed on `v18`, the goal will be satisfied.
           
           Let's pick `v8` as the object to place on `v18`.
           `v8` is `atpose v9` and `type(v8, v17)`. To satisfy the goal, we need `on(v8, v18)`. This means `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `pose(v8, #o2)`. So, if we place `v8` at `pose #o2`, the goal will be achieved.
           
           To achieve this, we need to `pick v8` and then `place v8` at `pose #o2` on `v18`.
           
           The `pick` action requires:
           - `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)`: We have `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. This means arm `v4` can pick `v8` from `pose v9` with `grasp #o1` at `bconf #o3` using `atraj #o4`.
           - `atpose(?o, ?p)`: `atpose(v8, v9)` is true.
           - `handempty(?a)`: `handempty(v4)` is true.
           - `atbconf(?q)`: We need `atbconf(#o3)`. Currently, `atbconf(v3)` is true. This means we need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`. However, the only available `move_base` action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the base configuration. This implies that `#o3` must be `v3` for the `pick` action to be possible without an explicit base movement. Assuming `#o3` is `v3` based on available kin.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(?o, ?p, ?g)`: No information about this. We assume it's not unsafe.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(?t)`: No information about this. We assume it's not unsafe.
           
           So, for `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`:
           - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)` (assuming `#o3` is `v3`) - given
           - `atpose(v8, v9)` - given
           - `handempty(v4)` - given
           - `atbconf(v3)` - given
           - `unsafeapproach` - assume false
           - `unsafeatraj` - assume false
           
           After picking, `v4` will be `holding v8`.
           
           Then, the `place` action requires:
           - `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)`: We need `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, ?q_place, ?t_place)`. We have `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. Again, assuming `#o3` is `v3`.
           - `atgrasp(?a, ?o, ?g)`: This will be true after the `pick` action: `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`.
           - `atbconf(?q)`: `atbconf(v3)` must be true. It remains `v3` if `pick` did not move the base.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafepose(?o, ?p)`: No information. Assume not unsafe.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(?o, ?p, ?g)`: No information. Assume not unsafe.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(?t)`: No information. Assume not unsafe.
           
           So, for `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`:
           - `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)` (assuming `#o3` is `v3`) - given
           - `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` - achieved by pick
           - `atbconf(v3)` - given/maintained
           - `unsafepose` - assume false
           - `unsafeapproach` - assume false
           - `unsafeatraj` - assume false
           
           After placing `v8` at `pose #o2`, `atpose(v8, #o2)` will be true. Since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` are also true, `on(v8, v18)` will be true, and `type(v8, v17)` is true, satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` goal.
           
           The only `move_base` action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which effectively does nothing. Since `kin` actions include `#o3` (which is a `bconf`) and the current `atbconf` is `v3`, we assume `#o3` in the `kin` predicates is `v3`. This allows the `pick` and `place` actions to be performed from the current base configuration.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan used `pick` and `place` actions which were not in the provided list of valid action instances. The only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, effectively doing nothing useful for changing the state.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state:
           - `type(v8, v17)`
           - `type(v12, v17)`
           - `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` are given.
           - `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are given.
           
           The initial state also includes `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. This means that `v8` is currently at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`, not at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           To satisfy the goal, an object of type `v17` (e.g., `v8` or `v12`) needs to be placed on `v18`. This would require a `pick` action to lift the object and a `place` action to put it on `v18`. However, `pick` and `place` actions are not available in the given list of valid actions. The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the position of any object or the robot's grasp state. Therefore, it is impossible to move `v8` or `v12` to `v18` with the available actions.
           
           Since the necessary `pick` and `place` actions are not available, the goal is not achievable from the initial state using only the allowed actions.
