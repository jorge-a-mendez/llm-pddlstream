           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially requires achieving two sets of conditions: receiving images from four distinct objectives and receiving analyses of six different rocks (three of a specific type and three of another). Initially, I broke down the problem, identifying the necessary actions: calibrating cameras, taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, sending analyses, and dropping rocks. I meticulously examined the preconditions and effects of each action to determine the proper sequence.
           
           However, a crucial constraint emerged: I am only allowed to use a highly restricted set of actions – essentially, just two "move" actions (which are, in fact, no-ops) and two "drop_rock" actions. These limited actions are insufficient to achieve the goal of `new-axiom@0()`. None of these actions can generate either the image-receiving or analysis-receiving conditions in the initial state. Moreover, the "drop_rock" actions are not even valid in the initial state (the rovers have stores, but the stores are `free` not `full`).
           
           In short, there is no way to reach the goal with the given and limited set of actions. The problem is thus unsolvable.
