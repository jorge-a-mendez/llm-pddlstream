           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.096x0.096.
           
           To find stable placements, I will consider placing the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its AABB, so I can use 0 radians for theta for simplicity. I will center the object on the surface and then explore various positions by moving it within the bounds of the surface.
           
           The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           The object has a size of 0.09614105735662484 in both x and y.
           For the object to be fully contained within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + (0.09614105735662484 / 2) <= x <= 0.135 - (0.09614105735662484 / 2)
           -0.135 + (0.09614105735662484 / 2) <= y <= 0.135 - (0.09614105735662484 / 2)
           
           This simplifies to:
           -0.135 + 0.04807052867831242 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04807052867831242
           -0.08692947132168758 <= x <= 0.08692947132168758
           And similarly for y.
           
           I will generate placements by varying x and y within this range, prioritizing central placements and then exploring the corners and edges. I will use a theta of 0 radians since the object is square.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, with a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           There is now a new object (ID: 7), which is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.096x0.096.
           Previously, object (ID: 5) was successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), meaning it is centered on surface 0.
           
           Now I need to place object (ID: 7) on surface 0, making sure it does not collide with object (ID: 5).
           Object 5 (ID: 5) has dimensions 0.09614105735662484 x 0.09614105735662484 and its center is at (0.0, 0.0). This means it occupies the space from approximately -0.048 to 0.048 in both x and y.
           
           Object 7 (ID: 7) has dimensions 0.09604473585581473 x 0.09604473585581474.
           
           To avoid collision with object 5, object 7's AABB should not overlap with object 5's AABB. Since object 5 is centered, any placement of object 7 needs to be far enough from the origin.
           
           The maximum extent for object 7's center for it to be contained on surface 0 is:
           -0.135 + (0.09604473585581473 / 2) <= x <= 0.135 - (0.09604473585581473 / 2)
           -0.135 + 0.048022367927907365 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.048022367927907365
           -0.08697763207209263 <= x <= 0.08697763207209263
           
           So, the allowed range for the center of object 7 is roughly [-0.087, 0.087] in both x and y.
           Object 5 occupies [-0.048, 0.048] in x and y.
           Therefore, for object 7 to not collide with object 5, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           |x| > (0.04807052867831242 + 0.048022367927907365) / 2 = 0.048046448303109895 in x, or
           |y| > (0.04807052867831242 + 0.048022367927907365) / 2 = 0.048046448303109895 in y.
           Approximately, the center of object 7 needs to be outside the range (-0.048, 0.048) in both dimensions to be clearly separated. A safer threshold would be 0.048 + 0.048 = 0.096 if one object is to be entirely to one side of the other. However, the condition for collision is based on the sum of half-extents.
           If x_obj5 = 0, y_obj5 = 0.
           Then x_obj7 must satisfy: abs(x_obj7 - x_obj5) > (width_obj5/2 + width_obj7/2)
           And y_obj7 must satisfy: abs(y_obj7 - y_obj5) > (height_obj5/2 + height_obj7/2)
           This means abs(x_obj7) > 0.04807052867831242 + 0.048022367927907365 = 0.09609289660621978.
           This is greater than the maximum allowed center position of 0.087. This implies that if both objects are on the same surface, they will inevitably collide if the objects are axis aligned. This is incorrect. The bounding boxes are for the object, not its half-extents. Let's re-evaluate.
           
           The first object (ID: 5) is placed at (0, 0, 0, 0). Its AABB extends from -0.04807 to 0.04807 in both x and y.
           The second object (ID: 7) has half-extents of 0.04802 in both x and y.
           To avoid collision, the center of object 7 must be at least 0.04807 + 0.04802 = 0.09609 away from the origin in x or y.
           However, the maximum x and y for the center of object 7, while still on the surface, is 0.08697.
           This means that it is not possible to place object 7 without colliding with object 5 if both are axis-aligned and on the same surface.
           Wait, my understanding of the problem statement for collision detection is based on the feedback. The problem statement mentions "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This is my first request for object 7. I'm inferring the geometry from object 5's placement being a "fixed obstacle".
           
           Let's assume the collision detection is based on the axis-aligned bounding boxes.
           Object 5: AABB_5 = [ -0.04807, 0.04807 ] x [ -0.04807, 0.04807 ]
           Object 7: center (cx, cy), half-extents (0.04802, 0.04802)
           AABB_7 = [ cx - 0.04802, cx + 0.04802 ] x [ cy - 0.04802, cy + 0.04802 ]
           
           Collision occurs if:
           (max(0.04807, cx+0.04802) - min(-0.04807, cx-0.04802)) < (0.04807 - (-0.04807)) + ( (cx+0.04802) - (cx-0.04802) )
           OR
           (max(0.04807, cy+0.04802) - min(-0.04807, cy-0.04802)) < (0.04807 - (-0.04807)) + ( (cy+0.04802) - (cy-0.04802) )
           
           A simpler way: A collision occurs if the absolute distance between the centers is less than the sum of their half-extents in that dimension.
           For x: |cx - 0| < 0.04807 + 0.04802 => |cx| < 0.09609
           For y: |cy - 0| < 0.04807 + 0.04802 => |cy| < 0.09609
           
           As calculated before, the maximum possible center coordinate for object 7 is ~0.0869. Since 0.0869 < 0.09609, it means any placement of object 7 on the surface, with theta=0, will collide with object 5.
           
           However, the problem statement says "you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene". It does not say that previously placed objects are fixed in a way that prevents *any* interaction. It states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". This is my first time placing object 7. I should try to place it.
           
           What if I rotate the object? Since it's square, rotation by multiples of pi/2 does not change its AABB. However, rotation by pi/4 (45 degrees) would change its AABB such that its diagonal would become its effective width.
           The diagonal length of object 7 is sqrt(2) * 0.09604473585581473 = 0.13583.
           Half of this diagonal is 0.067915.
           If rotated by pi/4, the effective half-extents of the AABB would be 0.067915.
           So, the object's AABB will be [cx - 0.067915, cx + 0.067915] x [cy - 0.067915, cy + 0.067915].
           
           The surface limit for the center would then be:
           -0.135 + 0.067915 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.067915
           -0.067085 <= x <= 0.067085
           
           Now, for collision with Object 5 (AABB from -0.04807 to 0.04807):
           If Object 7 is rotated by pi/4, its effective half-extents are ~0.0679.
           Collision condition:
           |cx| < 0.04807 + 0.067915 = 0.115985
           |cy| < 0.04807 + 0.067915 = 0.115985
           
           The maximum valid cx or cy for object 7 when rotated is 0.067085.
           Since 0.067085 < 0.115985, this still means that any placement of rotated object 7 will collide with object 5 if both are on the same surface.
           
           This implies that if the previous object (ID 5) truly acts as a fixed obstacle using its AABB, then it's impossible to place object 7 on surface 0 without collision. This contradicts the instruction "you will always try to find a new placement".
           
           Perhaps the "non-fixed obstacle" phrase implies that the other object is *not* a fixed obstacle in the same way as the scene geometry. The problem says "learn about the geometry of the scene" and "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". This suggests an iterative learning process. Since I haven't received feedback for placing object 7 yet, I should try to place it even if my AABB calculations predict a collision with object 5. It's possible the simulation uses a more fine-grained collision detection, or that the previous placement is simply *information* about a placed object, not necessarily a hard constraint.
           
           Given the constraints, I will generate placements for object 7 that are as far away from object 5 as possible while still being on surface 0, and also explore some rotated placements, hoping that the collision detection in the simulator is more lenient or that the "fixed obstacles" are not defined by other placed objects. I will prioritize the edges and corners of the surface.
           
           Let's use the maximum allowed center coordinates for Object 7, which is ~0.08697.
           I will use theta = 0 for most, but include some pi/4 rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           Two objects have been successfully placed:
           Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.09614105735662484 x 0.09614105735662484.
              AABB for ID 5: [-0.04807, 0.04807] x [-0.04807, 0.04807].
           Object 7 (ID: 7) at (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.09604473585581473 x 0.09604473585581474.
              AABB for ID 7: [0.086 - 0.04802, 0.086 + 0.04802] x [-0.04802, 0.04802]
              Which is: [0.03798, 0.13402] x [-0.04802, 0.04802].
           
           Now I need to place Object 4 (ID: 4). Dimensions: 0.07684593447203412 x 0.07684593447203414.
           Half-extents for ID 4: 0.03842.
           The object 4 is square, so theta=0 is sufficient for its AABB.
           
           First, determine the allowed range for Object 4's center (cx, cy) to stay on surface 0:
           -0.135 + 0.03842 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.03842
           -0.09658 <= cx <= 0.09658
           Similarly for cy.
           
           Next, consider collisions with Object 5 and Object 7.
           
           Collision with Object 5 (at (0,0), half-extents 0.04807):
           No collision if |cx_4 - 0| >= 0.04807 + 0.03842 = 0.08649
           No collision if |cy_4 - 0| >= 0.04807 + 0.03842 = 0.08649
           
           Collision with Object 7 (at (0.086,0), half-extents 0.04802):
           No collision if |cx_4 - 0.086| >= 0.04802 + 0.03842 = 0.08644
           No collision if |cy_4 - 0| >= 0.04802 + 0.03842 = 0.08644
           
           Let's find regions where Object 4 can be placed.
           Surface bounds for center: x in [-0.09658, 0.09658], y in [-0.09658, 0.09658].
           
           Avoid Object 5 (centered at (0,0)):
           Requires |x| >= 0.08649 OR |y| >= 0.08649.
           This means for x-axis, x must be in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658]
           And for y-axis, y must be in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658]
           The region between -0.08649 and 0.08649 in both x and y is occupied by Object 5's influence.
           
           Avoid Object 7 (centered at (0.086, 0)):
           Requires |x - 0.086| >= 0.08644 OR |y| >= 0.08644.
           For x:
           x - 0.086 >= 0.08644 => x >= 0.17244 (Too large, outside surface)
           x - 0.086 <= -0.08644 => x <= -0.00044
           So, x must be in [-0.09658, -0.00044].
           For y:
           y must be in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658].
           
           Combining all conditions:
           For x: [-0.09658, 0.09658] AND ([-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658]) AND [-0.09658, -0.00044]
           Intersection gives: x in [-0.09658, -0.08649]. This is a very narrow strip.
           
           For y: [-0.09658, 0.09658] AND ([-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658]) AND ([-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658])
           Intersection gives: y in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658].
           
           So, possible placement regions for (cx, cy):
           1. x in [-0.09658, -0.08649] and y in [-0.09658, 0.09658] (without further restriction from y-avoid-obj5/7)
           2. y in [-0.09658, -0.08649] and x in [-0.09658, -0.00044]
           3. y in [0.08649, 0.09658] and x in [-0.09658, -0.00044]
           
           Let's try to place it in the region x in [-0.096, -0.087] and y in [-0.096, 0.096] while avoiding the y collision areas.
           Example for region 1:
           Let x = -0.09.
           If y is in [-0.09658, 0.09658], for collision avoidance with object 5, y must be in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658].
           For collision avoidance with object 7, y must be in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658].
           Combining y: y in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658].
           
           So, an example point is (-0.09, -0.09).
           Check if it's stable:
           x = -0.09. Is -0.09658 <= -0.09 <= 0.09658? Yes.
           y = -0.09. Is -0.09658 <= -0.09 <= 0.09658? Yes.
           
           Check for collision with Object 5 (at (0,0), half-extents 0.04807):
           |x - 0| = |-0.09| = 0.09. Is 0.09 >= 0.08649? Yes. (Avoids x-overlap with 5)
           |y - 0| = |-0.09| = 0.09. Is 0.09 >= 0.08649? Yes. (Avoids y-overlap with 5)
           So (-0.09, -0.09) does not collide with Object 5.
           
           Check for collision with Object 7 (at (0.086,0), half-extents 0.04802):
           |x - 0.086| = |-0.09 - 0.086| = |-0.176| = 0.176. Is 0.176 >= 0.08644? Yes. (Avoids x-overlap with 7)
           |y - 0| = |-0.09| = 0.09. Is 0.09 >= 0.08644? Yes. (Avoids y-overlap with 7)
           So (-0.09, -0.09) does not collide with Object 7.
           
           This placement looks valid. I'll generate more placements in this region and other valid regions.
           The available space is largely in the 'L' shape formed by the intersection of the two 'donut hole' exclusions.
           
           Specific ranges for center (cx, cy) of object 4:
           Surface: [-0.09658, 0.09658] x [-0.09658, 0.09658]
           Not colliding with ID 5: (|cx| >= 0.08649 or |cy| >= 0.08649)
           Not colliding with ID 7: (|cx - 0.086| >= 0.08644 or |cy| >= 0.08644)
           
           Let's refine the non-collision zones:
           No Collision 5 (NC5): (x in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658]) OR (y in [-0.09658, -0.08649] U [0.08649, 0.09658])
           No Collision 7 (NC7): (x in [-0.09658, -0.00044]) OR (x in [0.17244, 0.09658] -> NO X on surface) OR (y in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658])
              So NC7 is (x in [-0.09658, -0.00044]) OR (y in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658])
           
           Let's pick an x in [-0.096, -0.087] (satisfies NC5 for x, and NC7 for x, as it's < -0.00044).
           Let cx be -0.09.
           Then cy can be anything in [-0.09658, 0.09658].
              - This satisfies NC5 because |cx| = 0.09 >= 0.08649.
              - This satisfies NC7 because cx = -0.09 is in [-0.09658, -0.00044].
           
           So, if cx is in [-0.09658, -0.08649], then cy can be any value within [-0.09658, 0.09658].
           This gives a strip of valid placements.
           Let's try cx = -0.09.
           Possible cy values: 0.0, 0.09, -0.09, 0.05, -0.05, etc.
           
           Similarly, if cx is in [0.08649, 0.09658]:
              - This satisfies NC5 because |cx| >= 0.08649.
              - For NC7: we need (cx in [-0.09658, -0.00044]) OR (y in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658])
                Since cx is in [0.08649, 0.09658], it's not in [-0.09658, -0.00044].
                So, we *must* satisfy y in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658].
                Example: cx = 0.09, cy = 0.09.
                  Check surface: 0.09 in range. Yes.
                  Check NC5: |0.09| >= 0.08649. Yes.
                  Check NC7: 0.09 not in x range. So |cy| >= 0.08644? |0.09| >= 0.08644. Yes.
                  This is a valid placement.
           
           Let's try cy in [-0.09658, -0.08649]:
              - This satisfies NC5 because |cy| >= 0.08649.
              - For NC7: we need (cx in [-0.09658, -0.00044]) OR (cy in [-0.09658, -0.08644] U [0.08644, 0.09658])
                Since cy is in [-0.09658, -0.08649], it is also in [-0.09658, -0.08644].
                So, NC7 is satisfied regardless of x.
                Example: cy = -0.09. cx can be anything in [-0.09658, 0.09658].
                  Let cx = 0.0.
                  Check surface: 0.0 in range. Yes.
                  Check NC5: |cy| = 0.09 >= 0.08649. Yes.
                  Check NC7: |cy| = 0.09 >= 0.08644. Yes.
                  This is a valid placement.
           
           Let's try cy in [0.08649, 0.09658]:
              - This satisfies NC5 because |cy| >= 0.08649.
              - For NC7: Same as above, NC7 is satisfied.
                Example: cy = 0.09. cx can be anything in [-0.09658, 0.09658].
                  Let cx = 0.0.
                  Check surface: 0.0 in range. Yes.
                  Check NC5: |cy| = 0.09 >= 0.08649. Yes.
                  Check NC7: |cy| = 0.09 >= 0.08644. Yes.
                  This is a valid placement.
           
           I'll generate placements from these derived regions, focusing on the corners and edges of these valid areas. I will keep theta = 0 for simplicity since it's a square object.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           Three objects have been successfully placed:
           Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.09614105735662484 x 0.09614105735662484.
              AABB for ID 5 (half-extents 0.04807): [-0.04807, 0.04807] x [-0.04807, 0.04807].
           Object 7 (ID: 7) at (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.09604473585581473 x 0.09604473585581474.
              AABB for ID 7 (half-extents 0.04802): [0.086 - 0.04802, 0.086 + 0.04802] x [-0.04802, 0.04802] = [0.03798, 0.13402] x [-0.04802, 0.04802].
           Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.07684593447203412 x 0.07684593447203414.
              AABB for ID 4 (half-extents 0.03842): [-0.09 - 0.03842, -0.09 + 0.03842] x [-0.03842, 0.03842] = [-0.12842, -0.05158] x [-0.03842, 0.03842].
           
           Now I need to place Object 6 (ID: 6). Dimensions: 0.0930186947640656 x 0.09301869476406563.
           Half-extents for ID 6: 0.04651.
           Object 6 is square, so theta=0 is sufficient for its AABB.
           
           First, determine the allowed range for Object 6's center (cx, cy) to stay on surface 0:
           -0.135 + 0.04651 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.04651
           -0.08849 <= cx <= 0.08849
           Similarly for cy.
           
           Next, consider collisions with Object 5, Object 7, and Object 4.
           
           Collision with Object 5 (at (0,0), half-extents 0.04807):
           No collision if |cx - 0| >= 0.04807 + 0.04651 = 0.09458
           No collision if |cy - 0| >= 0.04807 + 0.04651 = 0.09458
           
           Collision with Object 7 (at (0.086,0), half-extents 0.04802):
           No collision if |cx - 0.086| >= 0.04802 + 0.04651 = 0.09453
           No collision if |cy - 0| >= 0.04802 + 0.04651 = 0.09453
           
           Collision with Object 4 (at (-0.09,0), half-extents 0.03842):
           No collision if |cx - (-0.09)| >= 0.03842 + 0.04651 = 0.08493
           No collision if |cy - 0| >= 0.03842 + 0.04651 = 0.08493
           
           Let's find regions where Object 6 can be placed.
           Surface bounds for center: x in [-0.08849, 0.08849], y in [-0.08849, 0.08849].
           
           Non-collision with Object 5 (NC5): (|cx| >= 0.09458 OR |cy| >= 0.09458)
              However, the maximum cx or cy for Object 6 on the surface is 0.08849.
              Since 0.08849 < 0.09458, it is *impossible* to avoid collision with Object 5 using axis-aligned bounding boxes if we place Object 6 on the same surface.
           
           This is the same situation encountered when placing Object 7. The problem statement's explicit instruction to "always try to find a new placement" and the fact that previous placements for Object 7 were accepted despite my AABB-based collision prediction suggests that my AABB collision model might be overly strict, or that "fixed obstacles" don't include other placed objects in a way that prevents any further placements.
           
           Given that Object 5 is at (0,0), and Object 7 at (0.086,0), and Object 4 at (-0.09,0), it seems the x-axis around y=0 is becoming quite crowded.
           
           I will try placing Object 6 at the corners of the surface, as far away from the existing objects as possible, prioritizing the y-direction, given the x-axis is filling up.
           
           Let's try a large y coordinate, such as the upper-right corner for Object 6.
           Maximum cx for ID 6 on surface: 0.08849.
           Maximum cy for ID 6 on surface: 0.08849.
           
           Let's try (0.08, 0.08) for Object 6.
           Check stability (on surface):
             x: 0.08 is within [-0.08849, 0.08849]. Yes.
             y: 0.08 is within [-0.08849, 0.08849]. Yes.
           
           Check collision with Object 5 (0,0), half-extents 0.04807:
             |0.08 - 0| = 0.08. Is 0.08 >= 0.09458? No. (X collides with 5)
             |0.08 - 0| = 0.08. Is 0.08 >= 0.09458? No. (Y collides with 5)
             Based on AABB, this would collide.
           
           Since my AABB collision check predicts collision for any placement with object 5, but previous successful placements (like object 7) suggest this prediction is not always accurate, I will proceed to generate placements. I will focus on the corners of the surface, trying to maximize distance from the existing objects, especially Object 5. I will also try some placements in the middle of the "empty" strips as much as possible.
           
           Since all previous objects are near y=0, I will try to maximize the absolute y-coordinate.
           I'll also try a pi/4 rotation. Object 6 diagonal half-extent: sqrt(2) * 0.04651 = 0.06577.
           Surface bounds for rotated Object 6: -0.135 + 0.06577 <= cx <= 0.135 - 0.06577 => [-0.06923, 0.06923].
           If rotated, new collision threshold with object 5:
           |cx| >= 0.04807 + 0.06577 = 0.11384. This is also outside the range [-0.06923, 0.06923].
           
           It seems that, by AABB calculations, no placement is possible. However, the system has accepted placements that my AABB logic indicates would collide. I must proceed. I will try to cover the available space on the surface with diverse placements for Object 6, prioritizing areas away from (0,0), (0.086,0) and (-0.09,0).

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene has changed. There are now two surfaces:
           Surface 0: ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)) - This is a larger surface, 0.6x1.2, centered at the origin.
           Surface 1: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) - This is the original smaller surface, 0.27x0.27, centered at the origin.
           
           An object (ID: 6) has been successfully placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.088) on Surface 1 in the previous request.
           Now I am given a request for object ID: 6 again. This likely means the previous placement of ID 6 collided with some "non-fixed obstacle" that I was not aware of, or perhaps it implies the *previous* ID 6 was a different object instance. Given the exact same ID, it's safer to assume it's the same object and the previous placement failed due to collision.
           
           The "fixed obstacles" from previous placements are:
           Object 5 (ID: 5) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.09614105735662484 x 0.09614105735662484.
              AABB for ID 5 (half-extents 0.04807): [-0.04807, 0.04807] x [-0.04807, 0.04807].
           Object 7 (ID: 7) at (0, 0.0, 0.086, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.09604473585581473 x 0.09604473585581474.
              AABB for ID 7 (half-extents 0.04802): [0.086 - 0.04802, 0.086 + 0.04802] x [-0.04802, 0.04802] = [0.03798, 0.13402] x [-0.04802, 0.04802].
           Object 4 (ID: 4) at (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0). Dimensions: 0.07684593447203412 x 0.07684593447203414.
              AABB for ID 4 (half-extents 0.03842): [-0.09 - 0.03842, -0.09 + 0.03842] x [-0.03842, 0.03842] = [-0.12842, -0.05158] x [-0.03842, 0.03842].
           
           The current Object (ID: 6) has slightly different dimensions now: 0.09291073264217359 x 0.0929823081498754.
           Half-extents for ID 6: sx/2 = 0.046455, sy/2 = 0.046491.
           It's nearly square. I will use theta=0 or theta=pi/2 which will swap size_x and size_y.
           
           The previous placement for ID 6 was (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.088) on Surface 0. This seems to be an error in my previous understanding, as the placement should be `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The previous successful placement for ID 6 was `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.088`. This indicates surface 0 was indeed the smaller surface in the previous request, which is now surface 1.
           
           So, the previous placement for ID 6 was on Surface 1 (the 0.27x0.27 one), at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.088). Since this is the current request for the same ID 6, I must assume that (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.088) on Surface 1 is no longer a valid placement (collided with some other non-fixed obstacle). This means Surface 1 is effectively quite crowded now.
           
           I will try to place Object 6 on the *new* Surface 0 (the larger one). This new surface is much larger and should have plenty of space. Since there are no existing objects on Surface 0, I can simply place it centrally or at corners/edges.
           
           Let's calculate the valid placement range for Object 6 on Surface 0 ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)):
           Half-extents for ID 6: sx/2 = 0.046455, sy/2 = 0.046491.
           For x: -0.3 + 0.046455 <= cx <= 0.3 - 0.046455 => [-0.253545, 0.253545]
           For y: -0.6 + 0.046491 <= cy <= 0.6 - 0.046491 => [-0.553509, 0.553509]
           
           I will choose placements on Surface 0. I can start by placing it at the center, then move to edges and corners of this larger surface. There's no need to consider existing objects 4, 5, 7 as they are on Surface 1, not Surface 0.
