(Thoughts: **Placing a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           Alright, here's my plan for placing this square object (ID 7) on the square surface (ID 0). I need to generate 50 stable placements, which means the object's bounding box, no matter the rotation, has to stay within the surface bounds.
           
           First, I need to understand the dimensions. The object is a square with side length `0.0926...`, and the surface is a square centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27 (from -0.135 to 0.135).
           
           Because it's a square object, the bounding box changes with rotation, but not in a complicated way. The dimensions oscillate between the object's side length and its diagonal.  I have calculated that the smallest bounding box occurs when the object is aligned with the axes (theta = 0, pi/2, etc.) and has a half-dimension of about `0.046...`. The largest bounding box occurs when the object is rotated 45 degrees, and the half-dimension becomes about `0.065...`.
           
           To ensure the object is *fully* within the surface, I'll calculate the safe zone for (x, y) positions based on the rotated half-dimensions. I'll need to choose angles, `theta`, to test a sufficient number of rotations.  Since the object's bounding box has symmetries, I'll only need to consider rotations between 0 and pi.
           
           For each `theta`, I'll determine the half-dimension of the bounding box. Then, I'll find the available (x, y) range within the surface. After this, I'll select several (x, y) points in that valid area.
           
           Specifically, I'll use 10 different `theta` values, spaced pretty evenly from 0 to 9*pi/8 (slightly more than pi). For each rotation, I'll place the object at 5 carefully selected locations.  The placements are: (x, y) = (0, 0), and 4 corners of an inner square.
           
           Using this systematic approach of carefully selecting the angular rotations, (theta), and then the object's central (x, y) coordinates, I'll quickly generate the necessary 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **New Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I'm being asked to place the same square object (ID 7, size: 0.0926 x 0.0926) on the same square surface (ID 0, size: -0.135 to 0.135) again, requesting 50 stable placements. Since there's no collision feedback, I'll assume my previous placements were good and just create a new, diverse set of placements. I'll stick with the bounding-box approach to ensure they all fit on the surface, keeping in mind the object's rotation.
           
           My strategy:
           
           1.  **Define Variables:**
               *   `s_obj = 0.09263950246993369` (object size).
               *   `s_surf_half = 0.135` (half the surface size).
           
           2.  **Calculate Limits:** For each rotation, I'll need to figure out the maximum allowed center coordinates.
               *   `rotated_half_dim = (s_obj / 2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` (AABB half-dimensions).
               *   `max_abs_coord = s_surf_half - rotated_half_dim` (the largest coordinate allowed for the object's center).
           
           3.  **Rotation Angles:** I'll use 10 different rotation angles (`theta`) to generate diverse placements. I am using different values of theta than before, to further improve the diversity.
           
               *   `theta_vals = [pi/16, 3*pi/16, 5*pi/16, 7*pi/16, 9*pi/16, 11*pi/16, 13*pi/16, 15*pi/16, 17*pi/16, 19*pi/16]`
           
           4.  **Placement Coordinates:** For each `theta`, I'll use a set of 5 coordinate offsets `(x, y)` relative to the center `(0, 0)`:
               *   `(0, 0)` (the center of the surface)
               *   `(-0.6 \* max_abs_coord, -0.6 \* max_abs_coord)` (bottom-left)
               *   `(0.6 \* max_abs_coord, 0.6 \* max_abs_coord)` (top-right)
               *   `(-0.6 \* max_abs_coord, 0.6 \* max_abs_coord)` (top-left)
               *   `(0.6 \* max_abs_coord, -0.6 \* max_abs_coord)` (bottom-right)
           
           5.  **Calculations:**
               *   I'll calculate `rotated_half_dim`, `max_abs_coord`, and `0.6 * max_abs_coord`, for all rotation angles.
               *   For each combination of `theta` and coordinate offsets I will find a valid placement that is within the surfaces bounds, and store it.
               *   Finally, I will generate the output in the requested format.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable, Non-Colliding Placements**
           
           Alright, I've got a new object, ID 5, and I need to place it on surface 0 without it colliding with the existing object 7.  Object 7 is already placed, and I've calculated its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) based on its dimensions and rotation.  The goal is 50 stable placements, all non-colliding.
           
           Object 5 is a square with side length ~0.092. Surface 0 is a square with side length 0.27. I know object 7 occupies the bottom-left of the surface and its AABB runs from [-0.10277, 0.00608] x [-0.10277, 0.00608].
           
           To find placements, I'll generate potential positions and filter out any that collide with the AABB of object 7. I'll take a grid-based approach.
           
           Here's my plan:
           1.  **Rotation:**  I'll consider object 5 at 16 different angles between 0 and `pi` - this gives enough variety in orientation while accounting for the symmetries of a square.
           2.  **Position Generation:** For each angle, I'll calculate the maximum distance from the center that object 5 can be placed without extending beyond the surface boundaries.  Then I'll create a grid of (x, y) positions within that range, but will choose a set of locations covering the other quadrants to avoid the area of object 7.
           3.  **Collision Check:** I'll calculate the AABB for each potential placement of object 5, and compare it against the AABB of object 7.
           4.  I will test a few for the theta = 0.
               1.  `(0, 0)`: Collides with object 7.
               2.  `(0.079906, 0.079906)` - this does *not* collide, so this is one placement.
           
           After extensive tests and modifications to the logic to filter for the collisions, I am confident with the logic. Now I will run the code and output the results.

           1.  **Understanding the Space:** I first define the surface (a square with center (0,0) and half-side 0.135) and the new object (also a square with side 0.09793...).
           
           2.  **Existing Objects AABBs:**  To check for collisions efficiently, I calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for objects 7 and 5. For Object 7, which is rotated, I need to account for the rotation (pi/16 radians). I calculate a "rotated half-dimension" based on the rotation and then create the AABB. For Object 5, which is aligned with the axes, it's simpler.
           
           3.  **Placement Strategy:** I'll place Object 8 by:
               *   **Rotation:** Trying the object at several different rotation angles (10 angles from 0 to 9*pi/8 radians)
               *   **Positioning:** At each angle I'll generate candidates on a grid system within the bounds of the surface, but modified so that it doesn't leave the surface. This creates a dense grid of candidate locations.
               *   **Collision Detection:** Then, for each position, I calculate the AABB of the rotated object, then check if it collides with either object 7 or object 5 (by comparing the x and y coordinate ranges). If it doesn't collide, I'll store the placement information.
           
           I'm using the `is_colliding` function to determine if two AABBs are overlapping, which means a collision.
           
           I started with 10 thetas and positions, 5 per theta, but I decided this would likely produce few placements due to collisions. Therefore I increased the density of my position checking to make sure I get a good diversity of placements. The grid system will likely ensure 50, even with collisions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Finding Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 4) on surface 0, ensuring that these placements don't collide with the existing objects (ID: 7, ID: 5, ID: 8). I'll approach this by first thoroughly analyzing the scene. I know the surface is a square of half-side length `0.135`. I've already calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for the three existing objects, taking into account their sizes and orientations (object 7 is rotated slightly, while the others are axis-aligned).
           
           My core strategy is to iterate through different orientations (theta) for the new object. I will consider 16 different theta values, from 0 to 15π/16. For each theta, I calculate the maximum possible distance the center of the new object can be from the origin, ensuring it stays within the bounds of the surface. This depends on the rotated dimensions of the new object (ID:4). Then, I'll generate a grid of potential center points within this bound. I'm using a fairly coarse grid for speed, with multipliers [-0.9, -0.7, -0.5, -0.3, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9] of the calculated max distance. I then calculate the AABB of the new object given its position and theta and check for collisions with the AABBs of the existing objects.
           
           I'm using a simple `is_colliding` function to test whether the AABBs overlap. If no collision is detected, I add the placement (surface index, theta, x-coordinate of center, y-coordinate of center) to my list of placements. If I hit 50 valid placements before iterating through all the grids, I break out early. If less than 50 placements are found, it might mean the existing objects occupy too much space, or the object dimensions and their rotations doesn't leave enough free space. However, I expect that this strategy and parameterization should allow me to compute a list of valid placements. I will then use these calculations to generate the desired output.

(Thoughts: **My Task: Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID: 6) onto a surface (Surface 0) and need to ensure I find 50 stable positions. My approach involves carefully considering the existing objects already placed on the surface (IDs: 7, 5, 8, and 4) to avoid any collisions.
           
           **Surface Definition:**
           
           *   I've established the boundaries of Surface 0, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both the x and y directions.
           *   This means the half-width and half-height, `s_surf_half`, are 0.135.
           
           **Existing Object Analysis (AABBs):**
           
           I've already calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each existing object. This is a critical first step for collision detection, as it simplifies the process by approximating the objects with rectangles. Let's recap:
           
           *   **Object 7 (ID: 7):** Center at approximately (-0.048, -0.048), rotated by pi/16. Its AABB is approximately ((-0.102, -0.102), (0.006, 0.006)).
           *   **Object 5 (ID: 5):** Center at approximately (-0.080, 0.080), not rotated. Its AABB is approximately ((-0.126, 0.034), (-0.034, 0.126)).
           *   **Object 8 (ID: 8):** Center at approximately (0.069, 0.069), not rotated. Its AABB is approximately ((0.020, 0.020), (0.118, 0.118)).
           *   **Object 4 (ID: 4):** Center at approximately (-0.083, -0.083), not rotated. Its AABB is approximately ((-0.126, -0.126), (-0.040, -0.040)).
           
           **Placement Strategy for Object 6:**
           
           Now, for object 6, I will use the established AABBs as part of a structured approach:
           
           1.  **Rotation:** I'll explore 16 different rotation angles from 0 to 15\*pi/16 radians (`angles`).
           2.  **AABB Size:** Based on the rotation, the dimensions of object 6 will change, so I will compute the rotated AABB dimension based on object size `s_obj6` (0.075) using the formula `rotated_half_dim = obj_half_dim * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           3.  **Candidate Grid:** To find suitable placements, I will create a grid of potential centers within Surface 0. For the grid, I will use `position_fractions = [-0.9, -0.8, -0.7, -0.6, -0.5, -0.4, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]`. This will give me a grid of 19\*19 = 361 candidates.
           4.  **Collision Check:** For each candidate position, I will compute the `AABB6` and compare it against the AABBs of the existing objects using a simple and efficient collision detection function: `if (A_max_x > B_min_x AND A_min_x < B_max_x)` AND `(A_max_y > B_min_y AND A_min_y < B_max_y)`.
           5.  **Output:** I will keep a list of `(0, theta, x_c, y_c)` for valid placements that don't cause collisions.
           6.  **Stop:** Once I generate 50 valid placements, I will halt the algorithm.
           
           **Important Notes:**
           
           *   I've double-checked my AABB calculations and collision logic to ensure accuracy.
           *   I'm confident that this approach will find a good set of stable positions for Object 6 within the constraints of Surface 0 and the existing objects.
           *   The generated output list will have 50 or more entries, and each one will
