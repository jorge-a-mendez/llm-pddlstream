           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is also rectangular with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0. A stable placement means the object is entirely within the bounds of the surface. Since the object is square, its orientation (rotation) doesn't affect its bounding box, but I will still vary it to provide a diverse set of placements. I will try to place the object at various positions, starting from the lower-left corner and moving across the surface, and also trying different orientations like 0, pi/2, pi, and 3*pi/2 radians.
           
           Surface 0: x from 4.2 to 4.8, y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           Object size: 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           For a stable placement, if the object is oriented at 0 or pi radians, its bottom-left corner (x_obj, y_obj) must satisfy:
           4.2 <= x_obj <= 4.8 - 0.07
           -0.6 <= y_obj <= 0.0 - 0.07
           
           If the object is oriented at pi/2 or 3*pi/2 radians, its bottom-left corner (x_obj, y_obj) must satisfy (with respect to its original orientation's x/y):
           4.2 <= x_obj <= 4.8 - 0.07 (size_y becomes the extent along x)
           -0.6 <= y_obj <= 0.0 - 0.07 (size_x becomes the extent along y)
           Since the object is square (0.07x0.07), the conditions are the same for all orientations.
           
           Let's pick various x and y coordinates within the valid ranges, and vary the orientation.
           
           Valid x range for object's origin: [4.2, 4.73]
           Valid y range for object's origin: [-0.6, -0.07]
           
           I will generate placements by incrementing x and y within these ranges and varying theta.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received feedback on previous placements for object ID 5. It seems that my calculation for the object's AABB relative to its origin was slightly off, causing instability due to the object extending beyond the surface's lower and left bounds. The feedback explicitly states that the object's AABB extends outside the surface. This means that the given (x, y) coordinates for the object's placement must refer to the *center* of the object's base, or some other reference point, from which the AABB is computed differently than my assumption of a lower-left corner. The failures consistently show the object's AABB starting around x=4.16 and y=-0.635, when the surface starts at x=4.2 and y=-0.6. This indicates that the (x, y) coordinates I provide correspond to the *center* of the object's base, not its lower-left corner. Therefore, if the object's size is `sx` by `sy`, then the object's AABB extends `sx/2` to the left/right of `x` and `sy/2` to the front/back of `y`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the stable placement conditions based on this understanding for a new object with ID 10 and size 0.0783614034667206 x 0.0783614034667206.
           
           Surface 0: x from 4.2 to 4.8, y from -0.6 to 0.0.
           Object size (sx, sy): (0.0783614034667206, 0.0783614034667206).
           Half sizes: hsx = 0.0391807017333603, hsy = 0.0391807017333603.
           
           For a stable placement, if (x, y) represents the center of the object's base:
           4.2 + hsx <= x <= 4.8 - hsx
           -0.6 + hsy <= y <= 0.0 - hsy
           
           Placing the center (x, y):
           x_min = 4.2 + 0.0391807017333603 = 4.23918070173336
           x_max = 4.8 - 0.0391807017333603 = 4.76081929826664
           
           y_min = -0.6 + 0.0391807017333603 = -0.5608192982666397
           y_max = 0.0 - 0.0391807017333603 = -0.0391807017333603
           
           I will generate 50 placements within these new valid ranges, varying x, y, and theta (although for a square object, orientation only affects the internal representation, not its AABB, I will still vary it for diversity).
