           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to ensuring several conditions are met within the `rovers` domain.  I see that this requires getting images (`receivedimage`) of some objectives, and getting analysis results (`receivedanalysis`) of a stone and a soil sample.  The initial state provides `atconf` and `free` facts, which are a good start.
           
           Looking at the action definitions, I figured I'd need the actions `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` to achieve the necessary `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  I identified that the rover `v14` might be a good candidate since it's initial `atconf` location doesn't prevent any obvious actions.
           
           I then started laying out a plan where `v14` would calibrate its onboard camera `v10` on objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20`, take the images, and then send them to the lander `v9`. Additionally, I had in mind using `v14`'s store `v16` to sample a stone and soil rock and then sending those samples to the lander as well.
           
           Here's the problem, and this is where it falls apart. The *only* action instances explicitly allowed are: `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, `(drop_rock v12 v16)`, and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.  That's it.  No `calibrate`, no `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, no `send_analysis`. 
           
           Given this extremely narrow set of allowed actions, there is *no* way to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`.  The actions *needed* to create and send images and the sample analyses just aren't available.  Therefore, no valid plan can be constructed to satisfy the problem constraints.
