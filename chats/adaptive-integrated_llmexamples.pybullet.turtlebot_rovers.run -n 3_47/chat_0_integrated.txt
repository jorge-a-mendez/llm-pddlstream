           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` axiom, which requires `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `type(?stone, v2)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `type(?soil, v6)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)` means `v2` is the type for "stone".
           - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` means `v6` is the type for "soil".
           
           The remaining subgoals are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)` (since `type(v1, v2)`)
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)` (since `type(v4, v2)`)
           - `receivedanalysis(v3)` (since `type(v3, v2)`)
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)` (since `type(v5, v6)`)
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)` (since `type(v7, v6)`)
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)` (since `type(v8, v6)`)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`:
           1. Calibrate a camera for the rover at a configuration from which the objective is visible.
           2. Take an image of the objective.
           3. Send the image to the lander.
           
           We have `v10` as a camera, `v11` as a mode, and `v9` as a lander.
           `v17`, `v18`, `v19` are objectives.
           Rover `v14` has `imagevisible` predicates for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           Rover `v12` also has `imagevisible` predicates for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`:
           1. Sample a rock.
           2. Send the analysis of the rock to the lander.
           
           We need to analyze rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil).
           For type `v2`: rocks are `v1`, `v4`, `v3`.
           For type `v6`: rocks are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Both `v12` and `v14` are at their initial configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively. They are both onboard `v10` and `free(v, v16)`.
           The action instances provided are only `move` and `drop_rock`. This indicates that the problem needs to be solved using only the initial configurations `v13` and `v15` for the rovers. Any action that requires a configuration starting with `#` will need to be enabled if a `move` action is used, but in this case, `move` actions don't change the configuration for `#o2`. The only provided `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, which are essentially no-op moves. This means we must utilize the existing configuration `v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14` for all actions, or the problem is unsolvable with the provided actions.
           
           Let's re-examine the available action instances. They are only `move` and `drop_rock`. This means no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions are directly provided as valid instances. This implies that the goal state should already be reachable or that the actions needed must be constructed by fulfilling the preconditions, but the problem statement also says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Given that the only valid action instances are `move` and `drop_rock`, and the goal involves `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates which are effects of `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, this implies that the goal must be achievable *without* using these actions directly. This typically means the initial state already satisfies these conditions or an axiom can be used to derive them.
           
           Let's check the axioms again:
           The `new-axiom@0()` has three identical definitions. Let's use the first one:
           `Conjunction atconf(v12, v13) AND atconf(v14, v15) AND free(v12, v16) AND free(v14, v16) AND receivedimage(v17, v11) AND receivedimage(v18, v11) AND receivedimage(v19, v11) AND type(?stone, v2) AND receivedanalysis(?stone) AND type(?soil, v6) AND receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True
           - `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`: implies `?stone` can be `v1`, `v4`, or `v3`.
           - `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`: implies `?soil` can be `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`.
           
           The issue is that `receivedimage` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and `receivedanalysis` for any rock (`?stone` or `?soil`) are *not* in the initial state. Since the provided valid action instances list does not include `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, it's impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. The only available actions (`move` and `drop_rock`) cannot produce these effects. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
