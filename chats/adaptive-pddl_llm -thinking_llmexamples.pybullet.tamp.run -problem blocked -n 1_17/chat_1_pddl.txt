           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for a Solution to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that fulfills the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`, specifically, placing an object of a particular type onto a specific location. Upon analyzing the initial state, I identify potential candidates for this object, specifically `v8` and `v12`, both of which satisfy the type constraint. My analysis highlights that I can move either one of these to achieve the desired state.  I choose to focus on `v12` as a specific example.
           
           The plan hinges on the initial condition where v12 is `atpose(v12, v13)` while needing to be placed on v18.
           
           Here's my proposed plan, which is to:
           
           1.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`: The robot arm (`v4`) will grasp `v12` from its initial pose (`v13`) using grasp `#o1`, base configuration (`#o3`, interpreted as `v3`), and moving along trajectory `#o4`.
           
           2.  **Place:** `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: The arm (`v4`), holding `v12` with grasp `#o1`, will place it at the target pose (`#o2`), again assuming base configuration v3, and following trajectory `#o4`.
           
           By executing these two actions in sequence, I guarantee that `v12` ends up `on` `v18`, fulfilling the requirement of `new-axiom@0()`. This logic rests on assuming the continuous parameter of the base configuration (`#o3`) must match the existing discrete object in the initial state. The existing `move_base` action would make the `canmove()` predicate false, but it's unnecessary to achieve the goal in this case.  It's simpler and more likely to succeed without it.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, the previous plan was invalid because it used actions outside the allowed set. My understanding is that only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted.  That's a pretty restrictive constraint.
           
           Let's break this down again, focusing on the goal: `on(?green, v18)`. This means finding an object of a certain type that's *on* a specific surface.  The initial state provides some clues: `v12` and `v8` are both of the correct type (`v17`).  We need to get one of them onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, `v12` is *supported* by `v14`, and `v8` by `v11`. There's a potential pose, `#o2`, for both that *could* put them on `v18`. The problem is the only permitted action. The `move_base` action doesn't change the pose or support of anything.  It just moves the base, and in this case, doesn't even actually change its configuration.
           
           To get an object *on* something, I'd need to change its `atpose` and ensure it's `supported` by the target. `pick` and `place` actions would be the obvious route, but they're forbidden.  Since `move_base` doesn't alter object positions or support relationships, it's irrelevant.
           
           So, I need to check if the goal is already satisfied. Looking at the initial state, neither `v8` nor `v12` are *on* `v18`. They're supported by different surfaces. Since I can't move them, this goal is unreachable.  The `move_base` action, while potentially incurring cost, is useless. It does nothing to change the object's relationship to `v18`.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the goal `on(?green, v18)` cannot be achieved. It's simply impossible with the allowed actions.
