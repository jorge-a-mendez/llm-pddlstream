           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. My objective is to create a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in this PR2-TAMP domain. This `new-axiom@0()` is defined as the conjunction of `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The core challenge seems to be figuring out how to make `on(?green, v18)` true, since `type(?green, v17)` is already satisfied by several objects in the initial state.
           
           **Initial Considerations and Variable Instantiation**
           
           First, I looked at the initial state and identified potential objects for `?green` that satisfy `type(?green, v17)`.  I found `v8` and `v12` to be valid options. I decided to explore the possibilities with `?green = v12` first.
           
           With `?green = v12`, the goal effectively becomes "get `v12` *on* `v18`". This means I need to make `on(v12, v18)` true.  The definition of `on` tells me I need both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` to hold true, for some pose `?p`.  I scanned the initial state to find a suitable pose.
           
           **Finding a Support and Identifying a Pose**
           
           I found that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is true in the initial state. This meant `?p` could be `#o2`, giving me `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. The other crucial part is to satisfy  `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           However, the current state shows that `atpose(v12, v13)` is true, meaning `v12` is *not* at `#o2`. I need to *move* `v12` from `v13` to `#o2`.
           
           **Action Analysis and the Crucial Constraint**
           
           Now I have to look for actions to move `v12`. `pick` and `place` are the prime candidates since they change the `atpose` predicate.  Unfortunately, the problem explicitly states that I can ONLY use actions *listed*. And that list is pitiful: it only has one action `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           `move_base` changes the robot's base configuration. While potentially useful for *some* planning problems, it is entirely useless for moving an object around.  I need pick and place actions, and they're not there.
           
           **Unachievable Goal Given the Restrictions**
           
           Given that I'm limited to a single action (`move_base`), it's crystal clear that I can't achieve `on(v12, v18)` by moving the object from its initial state to the support location. Thus, I've concluded that the goal cannot be achieved with the given action set.
           
           After a thorough re-evaluation, I confirmed that both `on(v8, v18)` and `on(v12, v18)` are false initially. They require the object being at `atpose` with some pose `?p`. This requires `place`. Since there are no `pick` and `place` available, the goal cannot be achieved. It's a fundamental mismatch between the problem's goal and the provided actions.
