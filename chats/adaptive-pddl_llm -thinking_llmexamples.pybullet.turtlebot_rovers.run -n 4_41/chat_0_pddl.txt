           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning for Goal Achievement**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My primary objective is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom's structure, I recognize that the first four conditions, `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`, are already satisfied in the initial state. The remaining focus is on achieving:
           
           1.  **Image Reception:** `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, and `receivedimage(v20, v11)`.
           2.  **Analysis and Type Determination:**  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for a stone object, and `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for a soil object.
           
           From the initial state, I can ascertain the following:
           
           *   The rovers are at fixed configurations. Rover v12 is at configuration v13 and rover v14 is at configuration v15. They're both free in their respective stores (v16).
           *   Stone types are represented by v1, v3, v4 with type v2.
           *   Soil types are represented by v5, v7, v8 with type v6.
           
           To address the image reception aspect, I'll need to use the `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions. Since the camera (v10) is onboard rover v12, I'll direct all image-related actions through v12. Notably, calibration is necessary before each imaging, and my analysis shows a loss of calibration after *take_image*. Thus, a `calibrate` call needs to proceed prior to `take_image` calls. To meet communication requirements, I will assume the absence of any blocks preventing line of communication.
           
           For analysis, I will use `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. Considering the initial free state of store v16 and that above predicates also use v13 (using v12), I will leverage v12 for this as well.
           
           Based on this analysis, the complete plan looks like:
           
           **Image Plan**: Rover v12, starting at position v13.
           1. `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v19, v10)`
           2. `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           4. `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10)`
           5. `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           6. `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           7. `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10)`
           8. `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           9. `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           10. `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v20, v10)`
           11. `take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v20, v10, v11)`
           12. `send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v20, v11)`
           
           **Analysis and Transmission** (v12, v13, v16)
           13. `sample_rock(v12, v13, v1, v16)`
           14. `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v1)`
           15. `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           16. `sample_rock(v12, v13, v5, v16)`
           17. `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v5)`

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Incomplete Action Set**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new constraint: only use the actions listed. My previous plan was clearly off-base. I need to re-evaluate this from scratch with the limited tools I'm provided.
           
           The goal I'm targeting is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. This expands into a conjunction of predicates. Critically, many of these predicates - like `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` - rely on actions I *don't* have access to. I can see that `atconf` and `free` are already true, so there is no work needed to get those satisfied. However, I absolutely *must* achieve these image and analysis predicates. 
           
           Let's break it down: To get `receivedimage`, I'd need to `send_image`.  To send the image, I need to have the image. To have the image, I need to take the image. And taking the image requires a calibration step. None of these actions are available to me. Similarly, for `receivedanalysis`, I need to be able to analyze the rock. The only route to that is `sample_rock`.
           
           My options are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. `move` is useless since the destination doesn't change.  And `drop_rock` seems to only undo the effects of a potential *future* `sample_rock` action (which I don't have access to). I don't see how I can use `drop_rock` to advance towards the goal state, since the goal requires `sample_rock` to be used for multiple variables and types, and I'm not able to use that action.
           
           Therefore, given *only* the actions I'm allowed to use, this goal is *unachievable*. It's a fundamental mismatch between the desired outcome and the actions at my disposal. I need a more complete action set to solve this problem.
