           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasible Plan Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan that fulfills the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to ensuring several conditions are met, primarily related to having received both images and analyses for specific rock and soil samples.
           
           Initially, I reviewed the pre-existing state. I noted that conditions concerning the rovers' initial configurations and available free spaces are already true.  This leaves us needing to satisfy these crucial conditions: receiving images for two unidentified objects (`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`) and receiving analyses for specific rock and soil samples (`receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`).
           
           The challenge stems from the limited action instances I can employ.  I've identified several rock samples with known types. My current focus is to identify instances of the `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions that I need.
           
           My attention was then drawn to the available action instances:
           1.  `move` actions that don't effectively change the position of the rovers.
           2.  `drop_rock` actions which cannot be implemented because they need the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. The initial state has `free(v12, v16)`, so this is not applicable.
           
           Here's the problem: The problem description explicitly states that any action not included in the list of available actions is off-limits. Unfortunately, I realized that I cannot achieve my objective with the available action instances.  I need actions such as `take_image` and `send_image` to satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates and actions such as `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` to satisfy the `receivedanalysis` predicates. These are not provided. Therefore, I conclude that the goal state of `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable given the constraints imposed on the available actions.
