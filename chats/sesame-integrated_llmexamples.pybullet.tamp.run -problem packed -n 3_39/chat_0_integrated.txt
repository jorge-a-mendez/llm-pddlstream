           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.258, -0.5, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.058, 0.998).

           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.106, -0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.193).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on surface v16. Currently, v8, v12, and v14 are on surface v11. The robot's arm v4 is empty. The robot is at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. There are poses available on v16 for all three objects.
           
           The plan will involve picking up each object from its current location and placing it onto the target surface v16. Since there's only one arm (v4) mentioned in the actions, we will use v4 for all pick and place operations. We will need to define the continuous values for the poses on v16.

           The AABB of v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           The AABB of v8 is ((-0.297, -0.539), (-0.219, -0.462)). This is a very small object.
           The AABB of v12 is ((-0.152, -0.398), (-0.06, -0.307)). This is also a small object.
           The AABB of v14 is ((-0.019, -0.29), (0.063, -0.208)). This is also a small object.
           
           We need to choose new x, y coordinates for the center of the objects such that their AABB is within the AABB of v16.
           For v8, its current AABB has width 0.078 and height 0.077.
           For v12, its current AABB has width 0.092 and height 0.091.
           For v14, its current AABB has width 0.082 and height 0.082.

           Let's try to place them around the center of v16.
           For v8, we can place it at (0.0, 0.0). Its AABB would be ((-0.039, -0.0385), (0.039, 0.0385)) which is within v16.
           For v12, we can place it at (0.0, 0.05). Its AABB would be ((-0.046, 0.0045), (0.046, 0.0955)) which is within v16.
           For v14, we can place it at (0.0, -0.05). Its AABB would be ((-0.041, -0.091), (0.041, -0.009)) which is within v16.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on surface v16. Currently, v8, v12, and v14 are on surface v11. The robot's arm v4 is empty. The robot is at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. There are poses available on v16 for all three objects.
           
           The plan will involve picking up each object from its current location and placing it onto the target surface v16. Since there's only one arm (v4) mentioned in the actions, we will use v4 for all pick and place operations. We will need to define the continuous values for the poses on v16, ensuring stability.
           
           The error "Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!" indicates that I used a base configuration `v35` which was not available in the initial state or achieved by a `move_base` action. In the provided initial state, only `v3` and `#o3` are mentioned as base configurations, and `atbconf(v3)` is true. The kin facts also use `#o3` as the base configuration for picks and places. Therefore, I should ensure to use either `v3` or `#o3` for the base configuration. The available `kin` predicates explicitly use `#o3` for the base configuration, so I will use that. Since `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, and the pick/place actions use `#o3`, I need to insert a `move_base` action if `v3` and `#o3` are different, or ensure that `#o3` is equivalent to `v3`. The `basemotion` facts indicate that `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` exists, implying `v3` and `#o3` might be different, but also `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` exist which imply no movement is needed. If `#o3` is just a placeholder that can represent `v3` at no cost, then no `move_base` action is needed. Assuming `#o3` can be `v3` for simplicity and cost optimization.
           
           Let's ensure the stability of the poses again.
           The AABB of v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           The AABB of v8 is ((-0.297, -0.539), (-0.219, -0.462)). This means its dimensions are 0.078 x 0.077.
           The AABB of v12 is ((-0.152, -0.398), (-0.06, -0.307)). This means its dimensions are 0.092 x 0.091.
           The AABB of v14 is ((-0.019, -0.29), (0.063, -0.208)). This means its dimensions are 0.082 x 0.082.
           
           For placement, we consider the object's AABB centered at the new pose (x, y). For an object with width W and height H, its AABB relative to its center is (-W/2, -H/2) to (W/2, H/2). We need (x - W/2, y - H/2) to be within ((-0.135, -0.135)) and (x + W/2, y + H/2) to be within ((0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Let's place the objects with some offset within v16:
           For v8 (W=0.078, H=0.077):
           x: -0.135 + 0.078/2 = -0.096, y: -0.135 + 0.077/2 = -0.0965. Let's try (0.0, 0.0). AABB: (-0.039, -0.0385) to (0.039, 0.0385). This is inside v16.
           For v12 (W=0.092, H=0.091):
           x: -0.135 + 0.092/2 = -0.089, y: -0.135 + 0.091/2 = -0.0895. Let's try (0.0, 0.05). AABB: (-0.046, 0.0045) to (0.046, 0.0955). This is inside v16.
           For v14 (W=0.082, H=0.082):
           x: -0.135 + 0.082/2 = -0.094, y: -0.135 + 0.082/2 = -0.094. Let's try (0.0, -0.05). AABB: (-0.041, -0.091) to (0.041, -0.009). This is inside v16.
           
           Since `atbconf(v3)` is true and the actions use `#o3`, we need to see if `v3` and `#o3` can be the same. The `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` suggest that #o3 can indeed be `v3` and no movement is needed, with cost 0. The existence of `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` does not force `#o3` to be different from `v3`. Therefore, we assume `#o3` can be equivalent to `v3` and thus `atbconf(#o3)` is true initially.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on surface v16. Currently, v8, v12, and v14 are on surface v11. The robot's arm v4 is empty. The robot is at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. There are poses available on v16 for all three objects.
           
           The previous error "Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!" implies that `#o3` is not considered equivalent to `v3` by the system, and that `v35` was some internal continuous object not defined in the problem. The available `kin` predicates explicitly use `#o3` for the base configuration. The initial state only has `atbconf(v3)`. To satisfy `atbconf(#o3)` for the pick/place actions, we must execute `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           
           Let's re-verify the stability of the poses for placing objects v8, v12, and v14 on v16.
           The AABB of v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           The AABB of v8 (width 0.078, height 0.077).
           The AABB of v12 (width 0.092, height 0.091).
           The AABB of v14 (width 0.082, height 0.082).
           
           New proposed poses:
           For v8: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0) -> AABB: (-0.039, -0.0385) to (0.039, 0.0385) (within v16)
           For v12: (0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0) -> AABB: (-0.046, 0.0045) to (0.046, 0.0955) (within v16)
           For v14: (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0) -> AABB: (-0.041, -0.091) to (0.041, -0.009) (within v16)
           
           The plan will now include a `move_base` action to transition from `v3` to `#o3`.
