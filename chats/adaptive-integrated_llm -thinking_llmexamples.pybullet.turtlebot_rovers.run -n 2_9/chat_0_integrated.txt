           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Goal is Unachievable**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be true: specific rovers (`v12`, `v14`) at certain configurations (`v13`, `v15`), their stores (`v16`) being free, the lander receiving images (`receivedimage`) from objectives (`v17`, `v18`) in a specific mode (`v11`), and the lander receiving analyses (`receivedanalysis`) of rocks (both of type `v2` and `v6`).
           
           First, I checked the initial state. The configuration and store conditions are already met. However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are *not* present initially.  This means I need to *take* images and analyze rocks.
           
           My attention immediately goes to the available actions.  The problem explicitly states that I'm only allowed to use action instances *in* the given list. And that list is... limited. I can only *move* the rovers between their base configs (which doesn't help) and *drop* rocks, but only if their stores are full.  Crucially, none of the actions required to achieve the goal are in the list.
           
           To clarify: I need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. These actions are necessary to fulfill the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  Based on the problem definition, I can't deviate from this given action list.
           
           Given the extreme limitations on the available actions, it's definitively *impossible* to achieve the specified goal. I would need actions from outside the provided list to change the world state in a way that satisfies `new-axiom@0()`.
