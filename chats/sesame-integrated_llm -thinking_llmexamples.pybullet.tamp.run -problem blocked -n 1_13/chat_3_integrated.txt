           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, -0.352, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.006, 1.0).

           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).

           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.092, -1.436), (4.44, -0.426)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q0', '#t4'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t1', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan to Achieve the Goal new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem. My primary goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object, say `?green`, of type `v17` *on* surface `v18`.  I have to work with the given initial state and the available actions.
           
           First, I need to figure out which object, `v8` or `v12`, I'm going to manipulate. Both are of the correct type (`v17`) and both can potentially be placed on `v18`.  Initially, I thought of placing `v8`, but I'll have to revisit that because of a crucial collision issue.
           
           The initial state reveals a problem: `v15` is *in the way* of picking `v8`. The failed plan from the past shows that trying to pick `v8` from pose `v9` results in a collision with `v15` at pose `v16`. So I can't simply move `v8` to `v18` directly.
           
           To get around this, I'm going to rearrange the objects. I have two main options: (1) Pick `v15` first, move it out of the way, and then pick `v8`, or (2) switch objects to v12.  Since the failure was explicitly regarding picking `v8` due to the presence of `v15`, it makes sense to try resolving the collision.
           
           The plan:
           1.  **Move the Robot Base:** Move the robot base to a suitable base configuration. `v3`, is the initial base config, and  I need to get to base config `#o3`, where all the actions are kinematically specified. The actual continuous position or orientation of this base config remains uncertain, however, it must be the same configuration for the pick and place, and it may be more suitable for picking `v12` or `v8`. 
               - `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`. The cost of this action is the distance between these two configurations.
           2.  **Move the Blocking Object (v15)**: Pick `v15`, which is blocking the path, and place it out of the way on `v18` at a coordinate I'll specify. 
               - `pick(v4, v15, v16, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
               - `place(v4, v15, #o2_v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           3.  **Pick the Target Object (v8)**: Once `v15` is out of the way, pick `v8`.
               - `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           4.  **Place the Target Object (v8)**: Finally, place `v8` on `v18`, at a separate location to avoid collision.
               - `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           Important assumptions:
           -   `#o3` is a base configuration that enables the successful execution of both pick and place operations, given that `kin` facts are associated with that base config.
           -   The continuous values (#o2 pose) that I provide for placement on the surface `v18` are collision-free and stable, and they meet all constraints on pose requirements.
           
           The cost will be minimal with the cost of 5 actions. It's the cost of moving the base configuration and the actions for picking `v15`, placing it, then picking `v8`, and placing it, and my solution meets the final goal with collision resolution.

User:      Pose #o2 = (4.3 0.0 0.8 0.0) for object v15 on surface v18 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(4.265000190734863, -0.035), upper=(4.335000190734863, 0.035))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(4.2, -0.6), upper=(4.8, 0.0))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Stability and Plan Execution**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that the previous placements for objects `v15` and `v8` on surface `v18` weren't stable. My initial analysis was correct in identifying the problem: the object's `y` coordinate needed adjustment.  I need to make sure the AABB of the object is *fully* within the AABB of the surface.
           
           I've got the surface AABB: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. This means I need to keep the object's `y` coordinate negative and more than -0.6 to be sure to avoid instability.
           
           My calculations using the object's AABB (`y` half-width of 0.035, centered at 0.0, resulting in a height from -0.035 to 0.035) pointed out the core issue. I need to bring the object's lower `y` coordinate down to be safe.  
           
           Therefore, I've decided to place both `v15` and `v8` at a `y` coordinate of -0.1, instead of 0.0. I can visualize that the new AABBs for each will be stable at:
           
           *   For `v15` at (4.3, -0.1, 0.8, 0.0), `x` would be in the range (4.265, 4.335) and `y` would be in the range (-0.135, -0.065), well inside the support surface, as required.
           
           *   And `v8` at (4.7, -0.1, 0.8, 0.0), `x` would be in the range (4.665, 4.735) and `y` would be in the range (-0.135, -0.065). Again this will be well supported, with no instability.
           
           This ensures their AABBs will be fully contained within the surface's AABB.  The `x` coordinates are fine as they are. This is a sound approach and these configurations make physical sense for a stable placement.
           
           The plan remains as is: move base, pick `v15`, place `v15` on `v18` with adjusted `y`, pick `v8`, place `v8` on `v18` with adjusted `y`. This will directly address the previous collision issue with the pick sequence. The cost is a single move base, two picks, and two places, which is the logical minimum.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` (on(?green, v18) and type(?green, v17)) will definitely be met. Putting `v8` on `v18` in this configuration fulfills this, assuming `v8` has the type specified. The problem now should be resolved and robust. The new y-placement should make the placement stable.

           The plan remains as is: move base, pick `v15`, place `v15` on `v18` with adjusted `y`, pick `v8`, place `v8` on `v18` with adjusted `y`. This will directly address the previous collision issue with the pick sequence. The cost is a single move base, two picks, and two places, which is the logical minimum.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` (on(?green, v18) and type(?green, v17)) will definitely be met. Putting `v8` on `v18` in this configuration fulfills this, assuming `v8` has the type specified. The problem now should be resolved and robust. The new y-placement should make the placement stable.
