           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, -0.352, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.006, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).

           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.516, -0.387), (-4.445, -0.316)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Alright, the goal is clear: achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of `type v17` (which could be v8, v12, or even v15) onto the surface `v18`. After reviewing the initial state, I've determined that `v8` or `v12` are the candidates since they are of the correct type and have relevant placement information. Let's make a plan to move one of them to `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the current setup, `v8` is currently resting at pose `v9`, supported by surface `v11`, while `v12` sits at pose `v13` on surface `v14`. Both `v8` and `v12` are stackable on `v18`, so they can be placed there. Now, the key is to choose which of them to move. Moving `v8` seems to be the most efficient since it is closer to `v18`. Therefore, my plan is focused on `v8`.
           
           To place `v8` onto `v18`, I need to prepare for the "pick" and "place" actions using the robot arm `v4`. The first step is to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`. The precondition for the "pick" action tells me that I need to have my base at `v3` *or* the base configuration `#o3` must align with the "kin" predicate and available "pick" action instance. Assuming that `#o3` represents the base configuration required for the subsequent actions.
           
           The base motion cost will depend on where `#o3` is. I notice there is an action to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`, so I include that if required. If `#o3` happens to be at `v3`, which seems very possible given the initial scene data, the move base action is unnecessary. The available actions and their costs will be my guides.
           
           Now, to pick `v8`, I'll use the available `pick` action instance using `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4` which are grasp, base config, and arm trajectory. After picking it, I will use `place` action using the same parameters, and an additional parameter `#o2` for an appropriate placement. The surface `v18` will be the destination.
           
           The final action would be:  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           Since the problem also asks for coordinate values for some parameters, I need to provide `#o2` with a stable placement for `v8` on `v18`. I know that `#o2` should be on the target surface `v18` and inside the available AABB. With the initial pose `v9` for `v8` and the `v18` dimensions, I'll calculate the coordinates. Based on that, the coordinates for `#o2` (for `v8` on `v18`) are (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), which are x, y, z and theta. The full, proposed plan is then:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`  (If `#o3` is *not* equal to `v3` and the given `kin` action instance requires it. Base motion may be avoided if `#o3` is set as `v3`).
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           And `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for `#o2`, used specifically for placing `v8` on `v18`.
           
           This plan guarantees that `v8` will be securely positioned on `v18`, fulfilling the goal condition, `new-axiom@0()`.
