           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, -0.352, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.006, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.516, -0.387), (-4.445, -0.316)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get an object, which I'll call `?green`, onto `v18` and ensure it's of a certain type.  I've got three candidates for `?green` based on what's available and their types: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`.  However, only `v8` and `v12` are stackable on `v18`. Let's pick `v8`.
           
           The initial state reveals a key fact:  `v8` is currently at `v9`,  and `atpose(v8, v9)` is true. I also know `v8` is already the right type (`type(v8, v17)`), so I've only got to get it `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           Now, according to my axioms, "on" means supported and at a pose. From the initial state and the definition of what constitutes an `on` relation, the goal simplifies to achieving `supported(v8, #p0, v18)` and `atpose(v8, #p0)`. The initial state already tells me that `v8` is *supported* at the correct pose on v18. So all that's left is to *move* `v8` to that position.
           
           My plan breaks down into these steps:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** I need the robot to be in the right place to pick up `v8`. Currently, it's at `v3`, and I've got to move it to a suitable pose, I'll call it `#q1`, and a related approach and trajectory `#t3`.
           2.  **Pick Up:** I then need to grasp `v8` from `v9`. This requires the arm `v4`, a grasp I'll denote as `#g0`, and a trajectory `#t1` to the configuration `#q1`.
           3.  **Move the robot base:** Once I have `v8`, I've got to relocate the robot base to a suitable pose `#q0` where I can place `v8` onto `v18` at the position `#p0`, and trajectory `#o0`.
           4.  **Place the object on v18:** Finally, I must place `v8` on `v18` via the `#g0` grasp, with the trajectory `#t0`.
           
           To sum up the actions:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #q1 #t3)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q1 #t1)`
           3.  `(move_base #q1 #q0 #o0)`
           4.  `(place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q0 #t0)`
           
           Let's check the preconditions:
           
           To perform the pick action, the robot needs to be at a suitable base configuration `#q1`. I also need the arm configuration `#t1`, that's free of collisions.
           To perform the place action, the robot must be at another suitable base configuration `#q0`. We also need the approach `#t0` to be collision-free.
           
           Since the base and arm need to move, and they can only execute one action at a time, I've got to make sure I'm managing the "can move" predicate by setting it to false after the move_base actions and setting it to true after the pick and place actions.
           
           To comply with the instruction, I've also assigned a continuous value for `#p0` as I can compute it, because it references the pose of an initial object in the initial state. The pose `#p0` can be `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` which will be the center of a stable and non-colliding placement. The robot can use the `pick` and `place` trajectory parameters to find the `#g0`, `#q0`, `#q1`, `#t0`, `#t1`, and `#t3`.
           
           This should guarantee that `new-axiom@0()` is achieved.
