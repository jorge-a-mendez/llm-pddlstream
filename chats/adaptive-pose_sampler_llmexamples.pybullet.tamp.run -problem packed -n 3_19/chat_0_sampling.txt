           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is a square with side length approximately 0.098. Since the object is square, its orientation does not affect its AABB. I will try to place the object in various positions on the surface, ensuring it is fully contained. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a half-side length of approximately 0.049. This means its center can range from -0.135 + 0.049 = -0.086 to 0.135 - 0.049 = 0.086 in both x and y. I'll sample a grid of positions within this range.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is the same as before, a single square surface at the origin. I have successfully placed object 5 at (0, 0, 0). The new object, ID 6, is also a square, with side length approximately 0.0923. Its half-side length is about 0.04615. The valid range for its center on surface 0 is from -0.135 + 0.04615 = -0.08885 to 0.135 - 0.04615 = 0.08885 in both x and y. I need to ensure that the placement of object 6 does not collide with the previously placed object 5 at (0, 0, 0). Object 5 has an AABB from -0.04913 to 0.04913 in both x and y. This means I should avoid placing the center of object 6 too close to (0,0). Specifically, the x and y coordinates of object 6's center should be outside the range of approximately -0.04913 - 0.04615 = -0.09528 to 0.04913 + 0.04615 = 0.09528 if I want to avoid a collision. Since the maximum extent for object 6 is about 0.08885, it's impossible to avoid collision with object 5 at (0,0) on this surface. This implies that the prompt is not about avoiding collision with *previously placed* objects but rather ensuring future placements are also stable and do not collide with *fixed obstacles*. The previous successful placement of ID 5 was centered at (0,0), so I can place object 6 anywhere on the surface, as long as it is contained within the surface boundaries.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same single square surface. I have received feedback on previous successful placements for objects 5 and 6. For this new request, I need to place object ID 4, which is a square with side length approximately 0.0819. Its half-side length is about 0.04097. The valid range for its center on surface 0 is from -0.135 + 0.04097 = -0.09403 to 0.135 - 0.04097 = 0.09403 in both x and y.
           
           The crucial information from the success feedback is that there are no hidden fixed obstacles preventing placements at (0,0) or at (-0.05, -0.05), (-0.05, 0.0), (-0.05, 0.05). Since the problem states "you must avoid collision between objects i and j", and it also states "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene.", this implies that the feedback applies to *all* previously placed objects, not just the single one mentioned in the "positive examples" list. However, given the phrasing "You may reuse previous placements if they are stable, but if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement.", and given that my previous reasoning about avoiding collisions between objects 5 and 6 was ignored (both were placed at 0,0), I will continue to assume that I am only concerned with the *current* object's stability on the surface and against *fixed obstacles* which are not explicitly given. The problem statement says "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This is a new instruction.
           
           Ok, so I must avoid collision with previously placed objects. The successfully placed objects are:
           - Object 5: centered at (0, 0, 0). Its AABB is approximately `[(-0.04913, -0.04913), (0.04913, 0.04913)]`.
           - Object 6: has multiple successful placements. I should assume *all* of these are present.
             - centered at (0, 0, 0). Its AABB is approximately `[(-0.04615, -0.04615), (0.04615, 0.04615)]`.
             - centered at (-0.05, -0.05). Its AABB is `[(-0.05-0.04615, -0.05-0.04615), (-0.05+0.04615, -0.05+0.04615)]` which is approx `[(-0.09615, -0.09615), (-0.00385, -0.00385)]`.
             - centered at (-0.05, 0.0). Its AABB is `[(-0.09615, -0.04615), (-0.00385, 0.04615)]`.
             - centered at (-0.05, 0.05). Its AABB is `[(-0.09615, 0.00385), (-0.00385, 0.09615)]`.
           
           This interpretation means I need to find a placement for object 4 that does *not* overlap with any of these. This seems to imply that there are multiple objects (5 and multiple instances of 6) currently on the table, which seems inconsistent with a single "scene".
           The prompt says: "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This strongly implies that only *one instance* of an object with ID `i` is placed. Given that object 5 was successfully placed at (0,0), and object 6 also had a successful placement at (0,0), it implies that these objects are *not* simultaneously present. I interpret "successfully placed" as a list of *possible* stable placements for that object, not that they are all simultaneously present on the surface.
           
           The most reasonable interpretation for "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j" given the context of a "new request" for ID `j`, is that *one* instance of each previously successful object (ID 5 and ID 6) might be on the table. However, since the feedback showed *multiple* successful placements for ID 6, this makes the interpretation tricky.
           
           I will proceed under the assumption that the "successes" list provides candidate stable placements, and when it says "avoid collision between objects i and j", it refers to avoiding collision with a *single instance* of object i which has been previously placed. Which instance of object i is placed? The first one in the "successes" list seems like a reasonable default.
           
           So, for object 4, I will assume object 5 is at (0, 0, 0) and object 6 is at (0, 0, 0). This is the most conservative approach if I must avoid collisions.
           Object 5 (size 0.09826) at (0,0) -> AABB `[-0.04913, 0.04913]` in both x and y.
           Object 6 (size 0.09230) at (0,0) -> AABB `[-0.04615, 0.04615]` in both x and y.
           Object 4 (size 0.08194) needs to be placed. Its half-size is 0.04097.
           
           If both 5 and 6 are at (0,0), the combined occupied area is the union of their AABBs, which is simply the AABB of the larger object, object 5. So, object 4 needs to be placed such that its AABB does not overlap with `[(-0.04913, -0.04913), (0.04913, 0.04913)]`.
           The smallest x/y coordinate for object 4's center to avoid collision with object 5's AABB: `0.04913 + 0.04097 = 0.0901`.
           The largest x/y coordinate for object 4's center within surface bounds: `0.135 - 0.04097 = 0.09403`.
           
           So, the center of object 4 must have `abs(x) >= 0.0901` and `abs(y) >= 0.0901` to be outside the central occupied region. The surface limit is `0.09403`. This leaves a very small margin.
           For example, a placement at `(0.0901, 0.0901)` would place the lower-left corner of object 4 at `(0.0901 - 0.04097, 0.0901 - 0.04097) = (0.04913, 0.04913)`. This would touch the upper-right corner of object 5's AABB. This would be a valid non-colliding placement according to AABB rules.
           
           Given the small allowed space, I will place object 4 at the very corners of the surface to maximize distance from the center, while staying within the allowed range.
