User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There are several obstacles within this room. Some are thin walls or lines (5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), and others are smaller square or rectangular obstacles (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22).
           
           Given the target point (1.2982461993416187, -0.9254093844626154), I will try to place the robot in various locations around it, within the max_range of 4. I will prioritize locations that are not directly behind the known obstacles or that are not inside of them. I'll attempt a circular pattern around the target point, and also try some straight line approaches if a collision is detected. I'll make sure the proposed positions are within the allowed x and y limits [-2.5, 2.5]. I will avoid the central vertical obstacle (5) and the wall obstacles (0-4).
