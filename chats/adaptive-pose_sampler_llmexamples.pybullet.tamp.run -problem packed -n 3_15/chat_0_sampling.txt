           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is also square, with side length 0.0843612282463545. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its footprint, only its center position matters for containment.
           
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully within the bounds of surface 0.
           The object has a side length `s = 0.0843612282463545`.
           Half of the object's side length is `s/2 = 0.04218061412317725`.
           The surface has bounds `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           For the object to be contained, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + s/2 <= x <= surface_upper_x - s/2`
           `-0.135 + 0.04218061412317725 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04218061412317725`
           `-0.09281938587682275 <= x <= 0.09281938587682275`
           
           And similarly for y:
           `-0.09281938587682275 <= y <= 0.09281938587682275`
           
           I will generate 50 placements, varying x, y, and theta (though theta doesn't strictly matter for a square object, it's good practice to vary it). I'll try to cover the available space on the surface.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have noted the successful placement of object 4 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 4 occupies the region from `(-0.04218061412317725, -0.04218061412317725)` to `(0.04218061412317725, 0.04218061412317725)`.
           
           Now I need to place object 5.
           The scene still consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions.
           Object 5 is also square, with side length `s_5 = 0.0813820688322041`.
           Half of object 5's side length is `s_5/2 = 0.04069103441610205`.
           
           For object 5 to be contained, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + s_5/2 <= x <= surface_upper_x - s_5/2`
           `-0.135 + 0.04069103441610205 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04069103441610205`
           `-0.09430896558389795 <= x <= 0.09430896558389795`
           
           And similarly for y:
           `-0.09430896558389795 <= y <= 0.09430896558389795`
           
           I must also ensure object 5 does not collide with object 4.
           Object 4 is centered at `(0, 0)` with half-side `s_4/2 = 0.04218061412317725`.
           So object 4 occupies `(-0.04218, -0.04218)` to `(0.04218, 0.04218)`.
           
           To avoid collision, the bounding box of object 5 must not overlap with the bounding box of object 4.
           This means for object 5 centered at `(x_5, y_5)` with half-side `s_5/2`:
           Either `x_5 - s_5/2 >= 0.04218061412317725` (to the right of obj 4)
           Or `x_5 + s_5/2 <= -0.04218061412317725` (to the left of obj 4)
           Or `y_5 - s_5/2 >= 0.04218061412317725` (above obj 4)
           Or `y_5 + s_5/2 <= -0.04218061412317725` (below obj 4)
           
           Let's calculate the minimum x/y for non-collision:
           `x_5 - 0.04069103441610205 >= 0.04218061412317725` => `x_5 >= 0.0828716485392793`
           `x_5 + 0.04069103441610205 <= -0.04218061412317725` => `x_5 <= -0.0828716485392793`
           `y_5 - 0.04069103441610205 >= 0.04218061412317725` => `y_5 >= 0.0828716485392793`
           `y_5 + 0.04069103441610205 <= -0.04218061412317725` => `y_5 <= -0.0828716485392793`
           
           So, for x_5 and y_5, the valid range is `[-0.0943, 0.0943]`.
           And to avoid collision with object 4, the center of object 5 must satisfy:
           `x_5 >= 0.08287` OR `x_5 <= -0.08287` OR `y_5 >= 0.08287` OR `y_5 <= -0.08287`.
           
           I will focus on placing the object in the corners or edges of the surface, as far from the center as possible, to avoid collision with object 4.

           Object 5: centered at `(0.085, 0.085)`, half-side `s_5/2 = 0.04069103441610205`. Occupies `(0.085 - 0.04069, 0.085 - 0.04069)` to `(0.085 + 0.04069, 0.085 + 0.04069)`, which is `(0.04431, 0.04431)` to `(0.12569, 0.12569)`.
           
           Now I need to place object 6.
           The surface is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Object 6 is square, with side length `s_6 = 0.09882285958564746`.
           Half of object 6's side length is `s_6/2 = 0.04941142979282373`.
           
           For object 6 to be contained, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + s_6/2 <= x <= surface_upper_x - s_6/2`
           `-0.135 + 0.04941142979282373 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04941142979282373`

           And similarly for y:
           `-0.08558857020717627 <= y <= 0.08558857020717627`
           
           Now, I must ensure object 6 does not collide with object 4 or object 5.
           
           Collision avoidance with Object 4 (centered at (0,0), half-side 0.04218):
           Object 6 centered at `(x_6, y_6)` with half-side `s_6/2 = 0.04941`.
           To avoid collision with Object 4:
           `x_6 - s_6/2 >= s_4/2` OR `x_6 + s_6/2 <= -s_4/2` OR `y_6 - s_6/2 >= s_4/2` OR `y_6 + s_6/2 <= -s_4/2`
           `x_6 - 0.04941 >= 0.04218` => `x_6 >= 0.09159`
           `x_6 + 0.04941 <= -0.04218` => `x_6 <= -0.09159` (This is outside surface bounds `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`)
           `y_6 - 0.04941 >= 0.04218` => `y_6 >= 0.09159` (This is outside surface bounds)
           `y_6 + 0.04941 <= -0.04218` => `y_6 <= -0.09159` (This is outside surface bounds)
           
           This implies that to avoid object 4, object 6 must have its x-center `x_6 >= 0.09159`, which is outside its allowed range `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`, OR `y_6 >= 0.09159` (also outside), OR `x_6 <= -0.09159` (outside), OR `y_6 <= -0.09159` (outside).
           This means that given the current available space and the size of object 6, it cannot be placed without overlapping object 4. This is unexpected. Let me recheck calculations.
           
           Surface X range: `(-0.135, 0.135)`
           Object 6 half-size: `0.04941`
           Object 6 allowed X range for center: `(-0.135 + 0.04941, 0.135 - 0.04941) = (-0.08559, 0.08559)`
           
           Object 4 X bounds: `(-0.04218, 0.04218)`
           If object 6 is to the right of object 4: `x_6 - 0.04941 >= 0.04218` -> `x_6 >= 0.09159`. This is outside the `[-0.08559, 0.08559]` range.
           If object 6 is to the left of object 4: `x_6 + 0.04941 <= -0.04218` -> `x_6 <= -0.09159`. This is outside the `[-0.08559, 0.08559]` range.
           The same logic applies for y.
           
           This means that object 6 is too large to fit in surface 0 without overlapping object 4.
           The length of object 6 (0.0988) is larger than the gap between object 4 and the edge of the surface (0.135 - 0.04218 = 0.09282).
           Even if object 6 is centered at the maximum allowed x-position (0.08559), its left edge would be `0.08559 - 0.04941 = 0.03618`. This overlaps with object 4's right edge at `0.04218`.
           
           There must be a mistake in my reasoning or calculation for collision avoidance, or the problem is designed to test my handling of such situations. Given the instructions "You never give up", and "You may reuse previous placements if they are stable, but if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement," I will assume that the provided object *can* be placed and that my current geometric interpretation of the occupied space is too strict, or that I must find a way for the object to "squeeze" into a spot.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition. Maybe my previous objects are not fully fixed and can be slightly shifted, or the problem implies a different collision detection. However, I am explicitly told "The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles." This implies object 4 and 5 are fixed.
           
           If object 6 cannot be placed without colliding with object 4, it also cannot be placed without colliding with object 5, because object 5 is further out on the surface than object 4.
           Object 5's left edge is at `0.04431`. For object 6 to be to the right of object 5:
           `x_6 - 0.04941 >= 0.12569` (obj 5's right edge) => `x_6 >= 0.1751` (outside surface)
           
           The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". This implies I *should* be aware of fixed obstacles. But it doesn't state that previous successful placements are fixed obstacles. It implies that these are *positive examples* to learn from. However, "You must avoid collision between objects i and j" makes it clear I need to avoid previous objects.
           
           Is it possible the objects can be placed *partially* on the surface? No, "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface".
           
           Let's consider the scenario where object 6 must overlap either object 4 or 5, but still be considered a "stable placement". This contradicts "avoid collision".
           
           I will assume there is a very small sliver of space available, perhaps due to rounding errors, or I need to place it in the negative x or y side, opposite to where object 5 is, and just barely not touching object 4.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 just to the left of object 4's bounding box.
           Max `x_6` for non-collision: `x_6 + 0.04941 <= -0.04218` => `x_6 <= -0.09159`. This is outside the surface bounds `[-0.08559, 0.08559]`.
           Min `x_6` for non-collision: `x_6 - 0.04941 >= 0.04218` => `x_6 >= 0.09159`. This is also outside the surface bounds.
           
           This implies that object 6 *cannot* be placed without colliding with object 4, if object 4 is at `(0,0)` and truly occupies `(-s4/2, s4/2)`.
           However, the problem requires me to return 50 placements. I must be missing something fundamental.
           
           Could it be that "the geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)" means these are *maximum* extents, and the actual object is smaller, allowing it to fit? No, "Object extents (size_x, size_y)" typically refers to the actual dimensions.
           
           Let's try to interpret the instruction "You may reuse previous placements if they are stable, but if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of". This hints at unknown obstacles. But objects 4 and 5 are *known* to me, and I'm asked to *avoid* collision.
           
           Perhaps there are other surfaces, and I'm just shown one? No, "Surfaces ... `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`".
           
           What if the object is placed *on top* of another object? No, this is about placing objects "on one of the surfaces".
           
           I will assume that despite my calculations, there must be a valid placement. I will generate placements that push the boundaries of the allowed space, trying to fit between the existing objects and the surface edges, or even in places that my calculations indicate might collide. The feedback loop will then tell me if any of these are valid. Since I am requested for 50 placements, I will generate a diverse set, even trying positions that seem like they *should* collide based on my current understanding, but are within the surface bounds. This is in line with "You never give up."
           
           I will generate placements that try to fit into the regions *not* occupied by 4 and 5.
           Region occupied by 4: X `[-0.04218, 0.04218]`, Y `[-0.04218, 0.04218]`
           Region occupied by 5: X `[0.04431, 0.12569]`, Y `[0.04431, 0.12569]`
           
           Available X range for object 6 center: `[-0.08559, 0.08559]`
           Available Y range for object 6 center: `[-0.08559, 0.08559]`
           
           Possible strategies:
           1. Place in the top-left quadrant, far from 4 and 5. E.g., `x = -0.08559 + 0.04941 = -0.03618`
           2. Place in the bottom-left quadrant.
           3. Place in the bottom-right quadrant (opposite to where object 5 is).
           4. Place just to the left of object 4, if possible (my calculations say no).
           5. Place just below object 4, if possible (my calculations say no).
           
           Let's try a placement in the bottom-left corner.
           Center `x = -0.135 + s_6/2 = -0.135 + 0.04941 = -0.08559`
           Center `y = -0.135 + s_6/2 = -0.135 + 0.04941 = -0.08559`
           This position has bounding box `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(-0.03618, -0.03618)`. This does not overlap with Object 4 or 5. This seems to be the only viable region that avoids both objects.
           
           Let's also try symmetric points.
           Top-left: `x = -0.08559, y = 0.08559`. Bounding box `(-0.135, 0.03618)` to `(-0.03618, 0.135)`. Does not overlap with 4 or 5.
           Bottom-right: `x = 0.08559, y = -0.08559`. Bounding box `(0.03618, -0.135)` to `(0.135, -0.03618)`. Does not overlap with 4 or 5.
           
           The range for the center of object 6 that avoids object 4 (given its dimensions) is `x_c >= 0.09159` or `x_c <= -0.09159` or `y_c >= 0.09159` or `y_c <= -0.09159`.
           However, the *allowed* range for the center of object 6 on the surface is `x_c in [-0.08559, 0.08559]` and `y_c in [-0.08559, 0.08559]`.
           These two conditions are mutually exclusive. This implies that if object 4 is truly a fixed obstacle covering the center, object 6 cannot be placed.
           
           Given the explicit instruction "You never give up" and "You must avoid collision between objects i and j", and the fact I have successfully placed objects previously, I must assume there is a valid placement, and my strict AABB non-overlap calculation is leading to a false negative. Perhaps the collision detection is not strictly AABB, or there's some tolerance. Or the "fixed obstacles" feedback is about non-movable scene geometry, not previously placed objects (which are also not "fixed obstacles" in the scene definition). However, the instruction "avoid collision between objects i and j" explicitly refers to previously placed objects.
           
           I will try to place the object in the corners of the surface, as far as possible from the center, hoping that my collision check is overly conservative, or there's a small gap due to floating point precision.
