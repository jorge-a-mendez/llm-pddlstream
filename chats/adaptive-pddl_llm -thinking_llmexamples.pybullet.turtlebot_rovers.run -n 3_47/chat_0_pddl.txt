           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable**
           
           My goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition in the `rovers` domain.  Breaking it down, I see I need to achieve several things:  get images of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) in mode `v11`, and obtain analyses of a rock of type `v2` and a rock of type `v6`.  I immediately notice that some conditions, such as the rovers being at certain configurations and having free storage, are already met in the initial state.  My primary focus, therefore, must be on acquiring images and analyses.
           
           To get the images, I need to use the `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions.  To get the rock analyses, I need `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.  The problem quickly becomes apparent when I start looking at the preconditions:  *both* the imaging and the sampling actions require the rovers to be at specific configurations (locations), which are *not* where they currently are.  Specifically, to image the objectives, the rovers need to be at configuration `#o3`, and to sample the rocks, they need to be at `#o5`.
           
           Crucially, the only allowed "move" actions in this scenario are essentially null moves: the rovers can only stay in their current configurations. This immediately blocks me. There are no available moves that allow them to *actually* go to `#o3` or `#o5`. I meticulously reviewed the "move" actions: they keep the rovers at their initial location (v13 or v15) . This leaves me completely unable to satisfy the configuration preconditions for taking images and sampling rocks.  I can't move the rovers where they need to go.
           
           Therefore, because the rovers cannot move to the requisite locations to execute the actions necessary to receive the images and rock analyses, I've concluded the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently impossible to achieve.
