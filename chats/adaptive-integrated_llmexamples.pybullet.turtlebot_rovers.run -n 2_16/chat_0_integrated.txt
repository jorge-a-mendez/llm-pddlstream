           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     This problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, means satisfying several conditions related to two rovers (v12 and v14), a store (v16), objectives (v17 and v18), a mode (v11), and various types of rocks (v2, v6). Specifically, the goal requires:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (these are already true in the initial state).
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (these are already true in the initial state).
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. This means both objectives v17 and v18 must have images taken and sent with mode v11.
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`. This means any rock of type `v2` must be analyzed and the analysis sent.
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. This means any rock of type `v6` must be analyzed and the analysis sent.
           
           Let's break down the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates:
           To achieve `receivedimage(O, M)`, the rover must first `take_image(V, Q, Y, O, C, M)` and then `send_image(V, Q, Y, L, O, M)`. The `take_image` action requires the camera `C` to be calibrated. The `send_image` action requires a lander `L` to send the image to.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(R)`, the rover must first `sample_rock(V, Q, R, S)` and then `send_analysis(V, Q, Y, L, R)`.
           
           Based on the initial state and available actions:
           - **Rovers:** `v12` (at `v13`) and `v14` (at `v15`).
           - **Camera:** `v10` is onboard both rovers and supports mode `v11`.
           - **Lander:** `v9` is available.
           - **Store:** `v16` is free for both rovers.
           - **Objectives:** `v17` and `v18`.
           - **Rocks:**
               - Type `v2`: `v3`, `v4`, `v1`.
               - Type `v6`: `v8`, `v7`, `v5`.
           
           We need to make sure all preconditions are met for each action. The continuous parameters (configurations like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` and rays like `#o1`, `#o4`) must be chosen carefully to avoid collisions and ensure visibility.
           
           Let's plan to satisfy the goal:
           
           1.  **Received Image for v17 and v18:**
               *   Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `imagevisible` predicates for both `v17` and `v18` with configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
               *   Let's use rover `v12` to handle objective `v17` and rover `v14` for objective `v18`.
               *   For `v12` and `v17`:
                   *   `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)` (needs `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, `not blocked`)
                   *   `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)` (needs `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, `not blocked`)
                   *   `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)` (needs `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, `not blocked`)
               *   For `v14` and `v18`:
                   *   `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` (needs `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `atconf`, `not blocked`)
                   *   `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)` (needs `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, `not blocked`)
                   *   `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)` (needs `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, `not blocked`)
           
           2.  **Received Analysis for rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4):**
               *   Let's have `v12` analyze `v1` and `v3`, and `v14` analyze `v4`.
               *   For `v12` and `v1`:
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)` (needs `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`). Since `v12` starts `free(v12, v16)`, this is fine.
                   *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)` (needs `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, `not blocked`).
               *   For `v12` and `v3`:
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)` (needs `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`). Since `v16` becomes full after sampling `v1`, we need to `drop_rock` first.
                   *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)`
                   *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
               *   For `v14` and `v4`:
                   *   `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)` (needs `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`). `v14` starts `free(v14, v16)`.
                   *   `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           
           3.  **Received Analysis for rocks of type v6 (v8, v7, v5):**
               *   Let's have `v12` analyze `v5` and `v7`, and `v14` analyze `v8`.
               *   For `v12` and `v5`:
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)` (needs `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`). Will need to drop if `v16` is full from `v3`.
                   *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
                   *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
               *   For `v12` and `v7`:
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v7, v16)` (needs `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`). Will need to drop.
                   *   `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
                   *   `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v7, v16)`
                   *   `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
               *   For `v14` and `v8`:
                   *   `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)` (needs `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`). Will need to drop if `v16` is full from `v4`.
                   *   `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
                   *   `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)`
                   *   `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           
           All `move` actions are self-moves, so they don't change the configuration and are likely for refreshing or ensuring certain states. In this case, since the `atconf` predicates are already satisfied by `v13` and `v15`, we don't need to explicitly use the `move` actions if all other preconditions are met at the current configurations.
           
           The problem specifies that if a configuration starting with '#' is used, and `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state, and it is the second argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, then a continuous value must be provided.
           - `conf(v14, #o0)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v14` needs to see `v9`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)`.
           - `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`: `v14` needs to see `v18`. `v18` is at `(1.879, 2.051), (1.958, 2.13)`. This is a long distance, so `#o3` will likely be a pose far from `v15`.
           - `conf(v14, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v14` needs to see `v17`. `v17` is at `(0.266, 2.035), (0.342, 2.111)`.
           - `conf(v12, #o0)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: `v12` needs to see `v9`. `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is at `(-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)`.
           - `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`: `v12` needs to see `v18`. `v18` is at `(1.879, 2.051), (1.958, 2.13)`.
           - `conf(v12, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`: `v12` needs to see `v17`. `v17` is at `(0.266, 2.035), (0.342, 2.111)`.
           - `conf(v14, #o5)` and `above(v14, #o5, R)`: `v14` needs to be above various rocks.
           - `conf(v12, #o5)` and `above(v12, #o5, R)`: `v12` needs to be above various rocks.
           
           Since `imagevisible` and `comvisible` require specific line-of-sight configurations, `#o0` and `#o3` for each rover will likely be different. `#o5` for `above` predicates will also be different for each rock.
           The objects `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are rocks. The `above` predicate indicates the rover is positioned above the rock for sampling.
           Let's assign specific continuous values to the configurations. For `imagevisible`, the distance is at most 2, and for `comvisible`, it is at most 4.
           
           For `imagevisible` (rover, config, ray, target):
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v17` (center approx (0.3, 2.07)). Distance ~sqrt((1-0.3)^2 + (-1.75-2.07)^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 14.59) = sqrt(15.08) ~3.88, which is too far for imagevisible max distance 2.
           - `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v18` (center approx (1.9, 2.09)). Distance ~sqrt((1-1.9)^2 + (-1.75-2.09)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 14.74) = sqrt(15.55) ~3.94, also too far.
           
           This indicates that `imagevisible` for `v17` and `v18` with `v12` and `v14` from their current positions (`v13` and `v15`) at the given `#o3` are likely not intended to be at `v13` or `v15`. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that... reachable from the rover's current configuration". This means that `#o3` for `v12` and `#o3` for `v14` are distinct configurations, reachable from `v13` and `v15` respectively, and also within visibility range.
           
           Let's assume there are suitable `#o3` and `#o0` configurations that allow `imagevisible` and `comvisible` from the initial locations or reachable via `move` actions if they existed. But `move` actions only allow self-move here. The key is that `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are given as true in the initial state, implying there exist valid configurations. We just need to define these configurations appropriately when used.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the plan. The problem gives:
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           This means `#o3` is a specific configuration that works for both `v17` and `v18` and both rovers. This simplifies the configuration assignments. Same for `#o0` for `comvisible`.
           
           Let's use `v12` for `v17` and `v14` for `v18`.
           For `v12` (at `v13`):
           1.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           
           For `v14` (at `v15`):
           1.  `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           Now for the rocks:
           Rocks of type `v2`: `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           Rocks of type `v6`: `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           Let's organize the rock sampling and analysis by rover.
           Rover `v12` will sample: `v1`, `v3`, `v5`, `v7`. (4 rocks)
           Rover `v14` will sample: `v4`, `v8`. (2 rocks)
           
           `v12` plan:
           - Sample `v1` (type `v2`): `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           - Send analysis for `v1`: `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           - Drop `v1`: `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           - Sample `v3` (type `v2`): `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v3, v16)`
           - Send analysis for `v3`: `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v3)`
           - Drop `v3`: `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           - Sample `v5` (type `v6`): `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v5, v16)`
           - Send analysis for `v5`: `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           - Drop `v5`: `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           - Sample `v7` (type `v6`): `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v7, v16)`
           - Send analysis for `v7`: `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           - Drop `v7`: `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           
           `v14` plan:
           - Sample `v4` (type `v2`): `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v4, v16)`
           - Send analysis for `v4`: `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v4)`
           - Drop `v4`: `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           - Sample `v8` (type `v6`): `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v8, v16)`
           - Send analysis for `v8`: `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v8)`
           - Drop `v8`: `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           The initial state includes `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. The `conf` predicates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for both rovers are also in the initial state, meaning those configurations exist. We need to assign specific values for these.
           
           Let's assume for simplicity, the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for `v12` are at `v13` (or very close to it with the right orientation), and similarly for `v14` at `v15`. This is a strong assumption as `imagevisible` and `comvisible` have range constraints. However, the problem states that if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state and is used as an argument to `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, then we *must* provide a continuous value for it. This implies such a value exists given the problem setup. If we were to calculate the values, we would need to find collision-free poses for the rover that have line-of-sight to the targets within the specified ranges. Given the problem statement's hint about using existing configurations if sufficient, and the presence of `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)` and similar for `v14` in the initial state, we assume that these configurations are distinct and valid for their respective tasks.
           
           Let's use distinct configurations for each (rover, target) pair where necessary for clarity, although the PDDL syntax implies `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` might be generic references. "If your plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           Since `#o0` is used for `comvisible` with `v9` for both `v12` and `v14`, and `#o3` for `imagevisible` with `v17` and `v18` for both `v12` and `v14`, we need to provide specific configs.
           Let's name them `#o0_v12_v9`, `#o0_v14_v9`, `#o3_v12_v17`, `#o3_v14_v18`.
           For `above` predicates, `above(v12, #o5, R)` and `above(v14, #o5, R)`, we need a separate `#o5` for each (rover, rock) pair.
           Let's name them `#o5_v12_v1`, `#o5_v12_v3`, `#o5_v12_v5`, `#o5_v12_v7`, `#o5_v14_v4`, `#o5_v14_v8`.
           
           For the coordinates:
           - `v9` (lander): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. Let's use its center: `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           - `v12` (rover) current at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `v14` (rover) current at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - `v17` (objective): `((0.266, 2.035), (0.342, 2.111))`. Center: `(0.304, 2.073)`.
           - `v18` (objective): `((1.879, 2.051), (1.958, 2.13))`. Center: `(1.9185, 2.0905)`.
           - `v1` (rock): `((0.938, 1.195), (1.038, 1.295))`. Center: `(0.988, 1.245)`.
           - `v3` (rock): `((1.667, -1.924), (1.767, -1.823))`. Center: `(1.717, -1.8735)`.
           - `v4` (rock): `((-0.616, -2.11), (-0.525, -2.019))`. Center: `(-0.5705, -2.0645)`.
           - `v5` (rock): `((0.831, 0.207), (0.969, 0.345))`. Center: `(0.9, 0.276)`.
           - `v7` (rock): `((1.826, -0.111), (1.964, 0.027))`. Center: `(1.895, -0.042)`.
           - `v8` (rock): `((1.157, -0.583), (1.282, -0.457))`. Center: `(1.2195, -0.52)`.
           
           Let's compute suitable configurations. For `comvisible` to `v9` (center `(-1.9, -2.0)`) from `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`), the distance is large (~2.9). From `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`), the distance is ~1.0. So `v14` is a better candidate for `comvisible` from its current location. For `v12` to see `v9`, it will need to move. However, `move` actions are restricted to self-moves in the provided list. This implies the given `comvisible` predicate with `#o0` already describes a reachable and valid configuration.
           
           Let's pick an example for `#o0_v14_v9`. A config for `v14` (x,y,theta) might be `(-1.0, -1.75, 3.14159/2)` to look at `v9`.
           For `#o0_v12_v9`, `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) would need to turn significantly. Let's assume `(1.0, -1.75, 3.14159)`.
           
           For `imagevisible` to `v17` (center `(0.304, 2.073)`) from `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`), distance is ~3.88. This is out of range.
           For `imagevisible` to `v18` (center `(1.9185, 2.0905)`) from `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`), distance is ~3.94. This is also out of range.
           This strongly suggests that `#o3` must represent a configuration different from `v13` or `v15` where the rover can get closer to the objective, and yet the only `move` actions available are `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` (self-moves), which won't change the position.
           This is a critical point. If the given `imagevisible` predicates are true, they must be true at *some* configuration that is reachable. Since no movement is allowed, the configuration `#o3` for `v12` must be `v13` (or very close), and for `v14` must be `v15`. However, the distances computed show that `v13` and `v15` are too far from `v17` and `v18` for `imagevisible`.
           
           This contradiction implies either:
           1.  My distance calculation is wrong or the problem defines "imagevisible" range differently. (Max distance 2).
           2.  The problem setup intends for the `#o3` configurations to be *different* from `v13`/`v15` and reachable *somehow* even if `move` actions are self-moves, or the initial `imagevisible` implies the existence of configurations `#o3` such that `atconf(rover, #o3)` is true initially, which is not stated. The problem says `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)` are true.
           3.  The problem is designed to have a solution using only the given actions, and the continuous parameters should be chosen to satisfy the preconditions.
           
           Let's assume the problem statement intends for the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates to be satisfiable at configurations `#o3` and `#o0` which are distinct from `v13` and `v15` but for which `atconf(rover, #o3)` or `atconf(rover, #o0)` are *not* necessarily initially true, but that are reachable. However, if `atconf(rover, #o3)` isn't true, then the `calibrate` or `take_image` actions can't be performed.
           The initial state *does* include `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. It does *not* include `atconf(v12, #o3)` or `atconf(v14, #o3)`. This means we *cannot* directly use `#o3` for `take_image` or `calibrate` unless `#o3` is `v13` or `v15` and `imagevisible` is true for it. This is a problem with the problem statement if the calculated distances are correct.
           
           Re-reading: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
           This implies that `conf(rover, #<name>)` being in initial state is enough, *not* `atconf(rover, #<name>)`. However, actions like `take_image` require `atconf(V, Q)`. This means `Q` must be `v13` or `v15` for the respective rovers.
           
           This leads to a contradiction unless `#o3` is meant to be `v13` or `v15`, and the `imagevisible` predicate somehow gets satisfied despite the distance. Or, there is a `move` action that changes the `atconf` predicate to `#o3`. But the `move` actions are self-moves.
           
           Let's check the given available action instances. Only `move` and `drop_rock` are explicitly listed.
           This is a severe constraint. No `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions are listed as available instances. This means *the goal is not achievable with the provided available action instances*.
           
           If the list of available actions is literally "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan.", and only `move` and `drop_rock` instances are provided, then any plan requiring `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` (which are all necessary to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal) would be invalid.
           
           Conclusion: The goal is not achievable with the provided list of allowed action instances. The required actions for imaging and analysis are not in the allowed list.
           
           The problem statement said: "Here is a list of valid action instances (applications of actions to specific objects). Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This is a very strict constraint.
           
           Since the goal involves `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, and the only allowed actions are `move` (self-moves) and `drop_rock`, it's impossible to generate images or analyses. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           The problem description then states: "If the goal is not achievable from the initial state, in which case you should not return any plan and simply explain why the goal is not achievable."
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` for two objectives and `receivedanalysis` for all rocks of type `v2` and `v6`. To achieve `receivedimage`, actions `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` are necessary. To achieve `receivedanalysis`, actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are necessary. However, the list of valid action instances provided only includes `move` and `drop_rock` actions. Since the required actions for image acquisition, image transmission, rock sampling, and analysis transmission are not present in the allowed action instances, the goal is unachievable.
