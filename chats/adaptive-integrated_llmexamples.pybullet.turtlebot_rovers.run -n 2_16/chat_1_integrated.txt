           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.938, 1.195), (1.038, 1.295)).
           Object v7 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.826, -0.111), (1.964, 0.027)).

           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.879, 2.051), (1.958, 2.13)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which is a conjunction of several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (which corresponds to `type(v1, v2)` and `type(v4, v2)`)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (which corresponds to `receivedanalysis(v1)` and `receivedanalysis(v4)`)
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (which corresponds to `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (which corresponds to `receivedanalysis(v8)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`)
           
           Let's break down how to achieve each of these:
           
           Initial state already provides:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Already true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Already true.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Already true.
           - `type(v1, v2)`: Already true.
           - `type(v4, v2)`: Already true.
           - `type(v8, v6)`: Already true.
           - `type(v7, v6)`: Already true.
           - `type(v5, v6)`: Already true.
           
           So, we need to achieve:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)`
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)`
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(objective, mode)`:
           1. `calibrate(rover, conf, ray, objective, camera)`
           2. `take_image(rover, conf, ray, objective, camera, mode)`
           3. `send_image(rover, conf, ray, lander, objective, mode)`
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(rock)`:
           1. `sample_rock(rover, conf, rock, store)`
           2. `send_analysis(rover, conf, ray, lander, rock)`
           
           We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, both with camera `v10` and store `v16`.
           Lander is `v9`. Mode is `v11`.
           
           Let's plan for the image objectives first using rover `v14` as it has more potential movements given in the valid actions:
           - `v17` is an objective. `v14` can image it at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           - `v18` is an objective. `v14` can image it at `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           
           Plan for images:
           1. Calibrate `v10` for `v17` using `v14` at `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           2. Take image of `v17` using `v14` at `#o3`, ray `#o4`, camera `v10`, mode `v11`.
           3. Calibrate `v10` for `v18` using `v14` at `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           4. Take image of `v18` using `v14` at `#o3`, ray `#o4`, camera `v10`, mode `v11`.
           5. Send image of `v17` to `v9` using `v14` at `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           6. Send image of `v18` to `v9` using `v14` at `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           
           Now for the rock analysis. Rover `v14` is currently at `v15`.
           Rocks to analyze: `v1`, `v4`, `v8`, `v7`, `v5`. `v3` is also a rock.
           
           Rover `v14` can sample `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` from configuration `#o5`.
           Rover `v12` can sample `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` from configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for sampling since it's already used for imaging.
           We need to sample and send analysis for all rocks.
           We can use the `drop_rock` action if the store `v16` becomes full and we still need to sample more. However, the goal only requires `receivedanalysis`, not that the rovers are `full`. Also, the problem statement says `free(v14, v16)` and `free(v12, v16)` initially, which means the store is empty.
           The `sample_rock` action sets `full(v,s)` and `analyzed(v,r)`. We can only sample one rock per store if we don't drop. Since there are 5 rocks to analyze and each rover has only one store, we might need to drop.
           However, `analyzed(?v, ?r)` and `receivedanalysis(?r)` do not depend on the store staying full. `analyzed` means the rover has analyzed it. `send_analysis` then makes it `receivedanalysis`.
           We have 5 rocks to analyze (`v1`, `v4`, `v8`, `v7`, `v5`). Rover `v14` and `v12` each have one store `v16`. Since the goal does not require the stores to be full or free at the end, and only `receivedanalysis`, we can sample with one rover and immediately send, then sample another, or use both rovers.
           The current `atconf(v14, v15)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. To sample, they need to be at `#o5`. To send, they need to be at `#o0`.
           
           Let's use `v14` to do all rock analysis and `v12` to handle any remaining images/analysis if needed.
           The current plan is to use `v14` for both image and analysis.
           To send image, `v14` needs to be at `#o0`. To take image, `v14` needs to be at `#o3`. To sample rock, `v14` needs to be at `#o5`.
           
           Let's plan out the movements for `v14`:
           1. Move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3` (for imaging).
           2. Calibrate and take images of `v17` and `v18`.
           3. Move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o0` (for sending images).
           4. Send images of `v17` and `v18`.
           5. Move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5` (for sampling rocks).
           6. Sample `v1`, then move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0` to `send_analysis(v1)`.
           7. Move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5` again. Sample `v4`, then move to `#o0` to `send_analysis(v4)`.
           This will be inefficient.
           
           Let's consider the number of rocks. Rover `v14` has onboard camera `v10` and store `v16`. Rover `v12` also has onboard camera `v10` and store `v16`. This means the camera is shared. This isn't usually how it works in PDDL, `onboard` is typically exclusive. If `v10` is on `v12`, it cannot be on `v14`. Let's re-examine `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)`. This seems to imply `v10` can be used by either rover, which is fine, as `calibrated` becomes `calibrated(camera, rover)`.
           The store `v16` is also shared, which is odd. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` mean both rovers have access to the same store. This also means if `v12` samples, `v16` becomes `full(v12, v16)` and not free, so `v14` cannot sample.
           
           The goal requires all analyses AND images.
           Let's use `v14` to handle all the image tasks and some analysis, and `v12` to handle the rest of the analysis.
           
           Images for `v17` and `v18`:
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o3` to take images.
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o0` to send images.
           
           Analyses for `v1`, `v4`, `v8`, `v7`, `v5`:
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o5` to sample rocks.
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o0` to send analysis.
           - `v12` needs to be at `#o5` to sample rocks.
           - `v12` needs to be at `#o0` to send analysis.
           
           The `store(v16)` is shared. This is a critical constraint. If one rover samples, `v16` becomes full. Then the other cannot sample. To sample another rock, `drop_rock` must be used.
           So, for each rock: sample, then send, then drop.
           
           Let's structure the plan:
           1. `v14` handles images:
               - Move `v14` to `#o3`.
               - Calibrate and take images for `v17` and `v18`.
               - Move `v14` to `#o0`.
               - Send images for `v17` and `v18`.
           2. `v14` handles rock analysis:
               - Move `v14` to `#o5`.
               - Sample rock `v1`.
               - Move `v14` to `#o0`.
               - Send analysis for `v1`.
               - Drop rock `v1` (to free `v16`).
               - Move `v14` to `#o5`.
               - Sample rock `v4`.
               - Move `v14` to `#o0`.
               - Send analysis for `v4`.
               - Drop rock `v4`.
               - Repeat for `v8`, `v7`, `v5`.
           
           This plan for `v14` ensures `atconf(v14, v15)` and `free(v14, v16)` are restored as the last actions will be `drop_rock`.
           The `new-axiom@0` definition does not require `atconf` or `free` at the end, but the initial state has them. The goal just needs `receivedanalysis` and `receivedimage`.
           So we don't need to restore `free(v14, v16)` and `free(v12, v16)` if the goal is already met.
           
           Let's prioritize the most direct path.
           Goal: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v4)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for all image related tasks and `v12` for all rock analysis tasks. This way they don't block each other on the camera or store unless `v10` or `v16` are genuinely shared resources.
           Given `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)`, the camera `v10` is shared, meaning only one rover can be `calibrated` at a time. This implies `calibrate` and `take_image` actions need careful sequencing.
           Given `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` and `store(v16)`, `v16` is a shared resource.
           This means `sample_rock` by `v12` would set `full(v12, v16)` and `v14` couldn't sample until `v12` does `drop_rock`.
           
           Revised plan for both rovers to cooperate with shared resources:
           
           Rover `v14` will handle images of `v17` and `v18` and `v1` analysis.
           Rover `v12` will handle analysis of `v4`, `v8`, `v7`, `v5`.
           
           Initial state: `atconf(v14, v15)`, `atconf(v12, v13)`. Both `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`. `onboard(v10, v14)` and `onboard(v10, v12)`.
           
           **Images by v14:**
           1. Move `v14` to `#o3` (from `v15`).
           2. Calibrate `v10` for `v17` with `v14`.
           3. Take image of `v17` with `v14`.
           4. Calibrate `v10` for `v18` with `v14` (re-calibration needed because taking image uncalibrates, and `v10` is shared, so better to explicitly calibrate for each usage).
           5. Take image of `v18` with `v14`.
           6. Move `v14` to `#o0` (from `#o3`).
           7. Send image of `v17`.
           8. Send image of `v18`.
           
           **Analysis by v12 and v14 (alternating due to shared store):**
           Let `v14` do `v1`, and `v12` do the others.
           Sequence for `v1`:
           9. Move `v14` to `#o5` (from `#o0`).
           10. Sample `v1` with `v14`. (`v16` is now full for `v14`)
           11. Move `v14` to `#o0` (from `#o5`).
           12. Send analysis for `v1` with `v14`.
           13. Drop rock `v1` with `v14` (`v16` is now free for `v14`, and thus for `v12`).
           
           Sequence for `v4` by `v12`:
           14. Move `v12` to `#o5` (from `v13`).
           15. Sample `v4` with `v12`. (`v16` is now full for `v12`)
           16. Move `v12` to `#o0` (from `#o5`).
           17. Send analysis for `v4` with `v12`.
           18. Drop rock `v4` with `v12` (`v16` is now free for `v12`).
           
           Sequence for `v8` by `v12`:
           19. Move `v12` to `#o5` (from `#o0`).
           20. Sample `v8` with `v12`. (`v16` is now full for `v12`)
           21. Move `v12` to `#o0` (from `#o5`).
           22. Send analysis for `v8` with `v12`.
           23. Drop rock `v8` with `v12` (`v16` is now free for `v12`).
           
           Sequence for `v7` by `v12`:
           24. Move `v12` to `#o5` (from `#o0`).
           25. Sample `v7` with `v12`. (`v16` is now full for `v12`)
           26. Move `v12` to `#o0` (from `#o5`).
           27. Send analysis for `v7` with `v12`.
           28. Drop rock `v7` with `v12` (`v16` is now free for `v12`).
           
           Sequence for `v5` by `v12`:
           29. Move `v12` to `#o5` (from `#o0`).
           30. Sample `v5` with `v12`. (`v16` is now full for `v12`)
           31. Move `v12` to `#o0` (from `#o5`).
           32. Send analysis for `v5` with `v12`.
           33. Drop rock `v5` with `v12` (`v16` is now free for `v12`).
           
           This plan covers all required goals by interleaving actions due to shared resources.
           The coordinates of obstacles and robot bounding boxes are not directly used in the symbolic planning but help identify which `#o` configurations are valid. Here we assume the given `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, `above`, `motion` predicates are valid given the geometric constraints.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` at the end. My plan leaves `v14` at `#o0` and `v12` at `#o0`. This needs to be corrected. After sending the last analysis, the rovers need to move back to `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           Let's refine the analysis part to ensure rovers return to their initial configurations for the final state check.
           
           Revised analysis by v12 and v14:
           
           **Images by v14:**
           1. (move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)
           2. (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           3. (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           4. (calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)
           5. (take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           6. (move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)
           7. (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           8. (send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           
           **Rock Analysis:**
           `v1`, `v4`, `v8`, `v7`, `v5`
           Let `v14` sample `v1` and `v12` sample the rest.
           
           9. (move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5) ; v14 moves to sample v1
           10. (sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)
           11. (move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0) ; v14 moves to send analysis
           12. (send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)
           13. (drop_rock v14 v16) ; v16 is free for v12
           14. (move v14 #o0 #o2 v15) ; v14 returns to original config
           
           15. (move v12 v13 #o2 #o5) ; v12 moves to sample v4
           16. (sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16)
           17. (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0) ; v12 moves to send analysis
           18. (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)
           19. (drop_rock v12 v16) ; v16 is free
           20. (move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5) ; v12 moves to sample v8
           21. (sample_rock v12 #o5 v8 v16)
           22. (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0) ; v12 moves to send analysis
           23. (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)
           24. (drop_rock v12 v16) ; v16 is free
           25. (move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5) ; v12 moves to sample v7
           26. (sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16)
           27. (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0) ; v12 moves to send analysis
           28. (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)
           29. (drop_rock v12 v16) ; v16 is free
           30. (move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5) ; v12 moves to sample v5
           31. (sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)
           32. (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0) ; v12 moves to send analysis
           33. (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)
           34. (drop_rock v12 v16) ; v16 is free
           35. (move v12 #o0 #o2 v13) ; v12 returns to original config
           
           This plan ensures all `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are true, and `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` and `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are also true, thus satisfying the axiom.
           
           Collision checking for continuous parameters:
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)` mean `v14` at config `#o3` has line of sight to `v17` and `v18`.
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` mean both rovers at config `#o0` have line of sight to `v9`.
           - `above(v14, #o5, rock)` and `above(v12, #o5, rock)` mean both rovers at config `#o5` can sample the rocks.
           
           Given the AABBs:
           `v12` is at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)` (Rover v12 AABB not given but current pos is v13).
           `v14` is at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)` (Rover v14 AABB not given but current pos is v15).
           
           Obstacles:
           `v1: ((0.938, 1.195), (1.038, 1.295))` (rock)
           `v7: ((1.826, -0.111), (1.964, 0.027))` (rock)
           `v12: ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571))` (rover) -> Wait, `v12` is both a rover and an object. This is a type mismatch. The object `v12` is an AABB, while `v12` is also a `rover` type. This indicates that `v12` refers to its bounding box when specified with AABB, and to the rover itself otherwise. I will assume `v12` as rover can move and the AABB of `v12` might represent its base or a part of it. `v14` has AABB `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`. This makes more sense: `v12` and `v14` are rovers at certain locations. The problem description lists `v12` and `v14` as type `object`, not `rover`. However, `rover(v12)` and `rover(v14)` are given in the initial state. The AABBs for `v12` and `v14` given in the description are for their physical body.
           `v8: ((1.157, -0.583), (1.282, -0.457))` (rock)
           `v17: ((0.266, 2.035), (0.342, 2.111))` (objective)
           `v3: ((1.667, -1.924), (1.767, -1.823))` (rock)
           `v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))` (lander)
           `v18: ((1.879, 2.051), (1.958, 2.13))` (objective)
           `v5: ((0.831, 0.207), (0.969, 0.345))` (rock)
           `v4: ((-0.616, -2.11), (-0.525, -2.019))` (rock)
           
           Let's compute the continuous values.
           For `v14` and `v17` (objective): `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. `v17` is at `(0.304, 2.073)`. `v14` is initially at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance from `v14` to `v17` is about `sqrt((0.304 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.073 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.304^2 + 3.823^2) = sqrt(1.70 + 14.61) = sqrt(16.31) approx 4.03`. This is greater than 2, so `#o3` must be closer to `v17`.
           For `v14` and `v18` (objective): `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. `v18` is at `(1.918, 2.09)`. Distance from `v14` to `v18` is about `sqrt((1.918 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.09 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(2.918^2 + 3.84^2) = sqrt(8.51 + 14.74) = sqrt(23.25) approx 4.82`. Also too far. `#o3` must be a pose within 2 units of `v17` and `v18`. Since both objectives are in the same direction (positive Y), a single `#o3` might work for both. A point like `(1.0, 1.0)` could work. Let's try to find a point from which `v14` can see both `v17` and `v18`.
           Average position of `v17` and `v18`: `((0.304+1.918)/2, (2.073+2.09)/2) = (1.111, 2.0815)`.
           A configuration `#o3` at `(1.111, 0.5)` for `v14` might work.
           Distance from `(1.111, 0.5)` to `v17 (0.304, 2.073)`: `sqrt((0.304-1.111)^2 + (2.073-0.5)^2) = sqrt((-0.807)^2 + 1.573^2) = sqrt(0.651 + 2.474) = sqrt(3.125) approx 1.76`. This is within 2.
           Distance from `(1.111, 0.5)` to `v18 (1.918, 2.09)`: `sqrt((1.918-1.111)^2 + (2.09-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.807^2 + 1.59^2) = sqrt(0.651 + 2.528) = sqrt(3.179) approx 1.78`. This is within 2.
           So `#o3` could be `(1.111, 0.5)`. The ray `#o4` would be directed from `#o3` to the target.
           
           For `v14` and `v9` (lander): `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v14` is initially at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93`. This is within 4. So `#o0` can be `(-1.0, -1.75)`. And for `v12` as well, `v12` is at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. Distance to `v9` is `sqrt((-1.9 - 1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-2.9)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) approx 2.91`. This is also within 4. So `#o0` can be `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14` and `(1.0, -1.75)` for `v12`. But `conf(#o0)` is a single configuration. This implies `#o0` needs to be reachable by both and from which both can see the lander. The prompt says "If your plan uses some object #<name> ... then you must provide a continuous value ... specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This means `#o0` should be a unique config for each rover if they are at different locations. Let's assume the problem statement means `conf(v14, #o0)` and `conf(v12, #o0)` are distinct instances of `#o0` for different rovers, or a common point. The initial `conf(v14, #o0)` and `conf(v12, #o0)` suggests distinct continuous parameters, which is better practice. Let's define `#o0_v14_v9` and `#o0_v12_v9`.
           But the provided actions use just `#o0`. This means `#o0` is a single pose, from which both `v14` and `v12` can see `v9`.
           Distance from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `v9 (-1.9, -2.0)` is 0.93.
           Distance from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `v9 (-1.9, -2.0)` is 2.91.
           So, `v15` for `v14` can be `#o0`. And `v13` for `v12` could also be `#o0`. Since `v15` and `v13` are different, `#o0` must be a separate point.
           Let's try `#o0 = (0.0, -2.0)`.
           Distance from `(0.0, -2.0)` to `v9 (-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - 0.0)^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.9)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(3.61) = 1.9`. This is within 4. So `#o0` at `(0.0, -2.0)` works for both.
           
           For `v14` and rocks: `above(v14, #o5, v8)`. `v8` is at `(1.2195, -0.52)`. `v14` is initially at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           For `v12` and rocks: `above(v12, #o5, v8)`. `v8` is at `(1.2195, -0.52)`. `v12` is initially at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           A single `#o5` for all rocks being above? That's unlikely. `above` implies the rover is close enough to sample.
           This is another instance where `#o5` is a single continuous parameter used for multiple objects.
           This implies `#o5` is a configuration from which multiple `above` predicates can be satisfied.
           Let's find a central point for the rocks `v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`.
           `v1: (0.988, 1.245)`
           `v3: (1.717, -1.8735)`
           `v4: (-0.5705, -2.0645)`
           `v5: (0.9, 0.276)`
           `v7: (1.885, -0.042)`
           `v8: (1.2195, -0.52)`
           
           The range of rocks: X from -0.57 to 1.885, Y from -2.06 to 1.245. This is a wide range. It is highly unlikely a single `#o5` exists from which all `above` predicates can be met for `v12` and `v14`.
           The problem structure `above(v14, #o5, v8)` for all `rock` and `rover` types suggests that `#o5` is a generic "sampling location" configuration, or that there are multiple `#o5` configurations if it's not a general sampling area.
           The `conf(v14, #o5)` implies `#o5` is a specific continuous value for `v14`. Given the action instances, there's only one `#o5` for `sample_rock`.
           This means `#o5` must be a pose from which both `v12` and `v14` can sample all rocks. This is geometrically problematic given the wide spread of rocks.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given by the `above` predicates are valid given the context of the problem and the available actions. I will provide values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` that respect the implicit geometric constraints.
           
           Given the `above(v14, #o5, v8)` and `above(v12, #o5, v8)` in the initial state, `#o5` must be a configuration that allows both rovers to sample all rocks. This sounds like an error in problem specification or a very generic interpretation of `above`. I will pick a central point from which a hypothetical arm could reach.
           Centroid of rocks:
           X: `(0.988 + 1.717 + (-0.5705) + 0.9 + 1.885 + 1.2195) / 6 = 6.139 / 6 approx 1.023`
           Y: `(1.245 + (-1.8735) + (-2.0645) + 0.276 + (-0.042) + (-0.52)) / 6 = -2.979 / 6 approx -0.496`
           So `#o5` could be around `(1.0, -0.5)`. This would be for the rover itself. The arm would then extend to each rock.
           
           Let's summarize required configurations:
           - `#o3`: For `v14` to take images of `v17` and `v18`. Need to be within 2 units.
               - Proposed: `(1.111, 0.5)` for `v14` to `v17` and `v18`. Ray `#o4` will be for this config.
           - `#o0`: For `v14` and `v12` to send images/analysis to `v9`. Need to be within 4 units.
               - Proposed: `(0.0, -2.0)` for `v14` and `v12` to `v9`. Ray `#o1` will be for this config.
           - `#o5`: For `v14` and `v12` to sample rocks.
               - Proposed: `(1.0, -0.5)` for `v14` and `v12` to various rocks.
           
           The ray parameters `#o1` and `#o4` are rays from the specified configuration to the target. These are direction vectors. I will provide them as a single point, assuming it's the target point, and the system can derive the ray. If it requires a vector, I'll update it. Usually a point is sufficient for a ray with origin = robot config.
           The requirement is: "you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The third argument to the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate is the ray from the configuration to the target object."
           I need to provide the coordinates for `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`. For rays (`#o1`, `#o4`), I'll specify the target point to which the ray is directed.
           
           Final check on the plan logic and goal:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Yes, last action is `(move v12 #o0 #o2 v13)`.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Yes, last action is `(move v14 #o0 #o2 v15)`.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Yes, last action affecting store is `(drop_rock v12 v16)`.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Yes, last action affecting store is `(drop_rock v14 v16)`.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Yes, `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Yes, `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`.
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)`: Yes, `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`.
           - `receivedanalysis(v4)`: Yes, `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)`.
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)`: Yes, `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v8)`.
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)`: Yes, `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`.
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)`: Yes, `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`.
           All conditions are met.
           
           ```
           The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with access to a shared camera v10 and a shared store v16. There are two objectives, v17 and v18, and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of two types (v2 for stone, v6 for soil). A lander v9 is present for communication. The goal is to receive images of both objectives and analyses of several rocks, while ensuring both rovers return to their initial configurations and leave the store free.
           
           The plan involves rover v14 first handling all image-related tasks (calibration, taking images of v17 and v18, and sending them). Then, v14 samples and sends analysis for one rock (v1). Following this, rover v12 takes over, sampling and sending analysis for the remaining four rocks (v4, v8, v7, v5). Due to the shared store v16, each sampling action is immediately followed by sending the analysis and then dropping the rock to free the store for the next sample. Both rovers return to their initial configurations (v15 for v14 and v13 for v12) after completing their tasks.
           
           The continuous parameters #o0, #o3, and #o5 are derived to facilitate these actions:
           - #o3 is a configuration for v14 to image objectives v17 and v18. It's chosen to be equidistant and within range (max 2 units) of both, assuming line-of-sight.
           - #o0 is a configuration for both v14 and v12 to communicate with the lander v9. It's chosen to be within range (max 4 units) of v9 for both rovers.
           - #o5 is a configuration for both v14 and v12 to sample rocks. It's a central point among the specified rocks, assuming the rover's arm can extend to reach each rock from this pose.

Model:     The previous plan failed due to unreachable configurations for imaging and collisions for communication. Let's re-evaluate the continuous parameters given the new obstacles `v19` and `v20`.
           
           New Obstacles:
           - `v19: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))` - A thin wall along the Y-axis at X=0.
           - `v20: AABB(lower=(-0.265, -2.215, 0.001), upper=(-0.124, -2.074, 0.401))` - A smaller block near `X=-0.2`, `Y=-2.1`.
           
           **Revisiting #o3 (image configuration for v14 imaging v17, v18):**
           The previously proposed `#o3 = (1.111, 0.5)` for `v14` was deemed "not reachable for robot base".
           `v14` is initially at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.
           `v17` is at `(0.304, 2.073)`. `v18` is at `(1.918, 2.09)`.
           `v14`'s AABB is `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`. The robot base is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Moving from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.111, 0.5)` involves crossing the X=0 line. The `v19` obstacle is a thin wall at X=0. This explains why `(1.111, 0.5)` is unreachable if `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and cannot cross `v19`.
           
           This means `v14` cannot cross the `x=0` barrier. `v12` starts at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. `v12` is on the right side of `v19`. `v14` is on the left side.
           So, `v14` can only operate on the left side of `x=0`. `v12` can only operate on the right side of `x=0`.
           
           Objectives:
           `v17: (0.304, 2.073)` (right of X=0)
           `v18: (1.918, 2.09)` (right of X=0)
           Rocks:
           `v1: (0.988, 1.245)` (right of X=0)
           `v3: (1.717, -1.8735)` (right of X=0)
           `v4: (-0.5705, -2.0645)` (left of X=0)
           `v5: (0.9, 0.276)` (right of X=0)
           `v7: (1.885, -0.042)` (right of X=0)
           `v8: (1.2195, -0.52)` (right of X=0)
           Lander:
           `v9: (-1.9, -2.0)` (left of X=0)
           
           This immediately clarifies which rover can handle which tasks:
           - `v14` (left side, at `(-1.0, -1.75)`):
               - Can communicate with `v9`.
               - Can sample `v4`.
           - `v12` (right side, at `(1.0, -1.75)`):
               - Can image `v17`, `v18`.
               - Can sample `v1`, `v3`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           
           This separation changes the plan structure significantly.
           
           **New plan structure:**
           
           **Rover v14 (left side):**
           1. Communicate with lander `v9`.
           2. Sample rock `v4`, send analysis, drop rock.
              - For communication: `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v14` is at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. Distance is 0.93 (within 4). `v19` at `x=0` is not an issue. `v20` is at `X=(-0.265, -0.124)` and `Y=(-2.215, -2.074)`.
              - `v14`'s AABB: `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`. If `#o0` is `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`, it's not in collision with `v20`. So `#o0 = (-1.0, -1.75)` for `v14` to `v9` looks good.
              - For sampling `v4`: `above(v14, #o5, v4)`. `v4` is at `(-0.5705, -2.0645)`.
                `v14` is at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. A config `#o5` for `v14` could be `(-0.7, -1.9)`.
                Let's check collision for `(-0.7, -1.9)` for `v14`. This should be clear of `v19` and `v20`.
                `v14` AABB `((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))`. So the center `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
                Config `(-0.7, -1.9)` is close to `v4`.
           
           **Rover v12 (right side):**
           1. Image `v17` and `v18`, send images.
           2. Sample `v1, v3, v5, v7, v8`, send analysis, drop rock (repeatedly).
              - For imaging `v17` and `v18`: `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
                `v12` is at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. `v12` AABB `((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571))`.
                `v17` is `(0.304, 2.073)`. `v18` is `(1.918, 2.09)`.
                Average X `(0.304+1.918)/2 = 1.111`. Average Y `(2.073+2.09)/2 = 2.0815`.
                Proposed `#o3 = (1.111, 0.5)` for `v12` this time. This is reachable for `v12` and clears `v19`.
                Distance from `(1.111, 0.5)` to `v17` is 1.76. To `v18` is 1.78. Both within 2.
                This `#o3` configuration is good for `v12`.
              - For communication: `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v12` is at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. Distance is 2.91 (within 4).
                `v19` at `x=0` creates an occlusion. `(1.0, -1.75)` for `v12` cannot see `(-1.9, -2.0)` for `v9` if `x=0` is a wall.
                This means `v12` cannot communicate with `v9` directly from the right side.
                However, the `comvisible` predicate states `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. This suggests `v12` at `#o0` *can* see `v9`. Given the obstacle, `#o0` must be on the left side. But `v12` cannot cross the `x=0` barrier. This is a problem.
           
           Let's re-read the axiom:
           `Axiom blocked(?y: object)`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom ray(?y)`
               `Atom conf(?v, ?q)`
               `Atom ~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`
               `Atom atconf(?v, ?q)`
           The provided `comvisible` facts imply no blockage for `#o1` from `#o0` to `v9`. This implies `v19` and `v20` are not actual ray blockers from the predefined `#o0`. This is strange. However, the system explicitly said `#o0 = (0.0, -2.0)` is in collision with `v19` and `v20`. This means I cannot pick `(0.0, -2.0)`. And if `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, it cannot see `v9` at `(-1.9, -2.0)` because of `v19` at `x=0`.
           
           This means `v12` cannot send data to `v9` if `v19` truly blocks communication.
           If `v12` cannot communicate, it cannot send images or analysis, making the goal unachievable for `v12`'s tasks.
           The `comvisible` predicates are given in the initial state. This usually means they are *possible*. The collisions are for the specific values I picked for `#o0`. So I need to pick a `#o0` that works.
           
           Let's re-evaluate `comvisible`.
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v14` is `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`. This is left of `v19`. The distance is 0.93. `v20` is `((-0.265, -2.215), (-0.124, -2.074))`.
           If `v14` stays at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)`, it's outside `v20`. And it's on the left of `v19`. So `v15` itself could be `#o0` for `v14`.
           `#o0` for `v14` at `v15 = (-1.0, -1.75)` with ray to `v9 = (-1.9, -2.0)`. This should be fine.
           
           For `v12` and `v9`: `v12` is at `v13 = (1.0, -1.75)`. This is right of `v19`. `v9` is left of `v19`. The `v19` wall (`x=0`) is between them.
           So `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is actually impossible with `v19` in the way.
           This means `v12` cannot send images/analysis to `v9`.
           The task of sending images of `v17` and `v18`, and analysis of `v1`, `v3`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` cannot be done by `v12`.
           
           This is a critical issue. If `v12` cannot communicate, then `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, `receivedanalysis(v5)`, `receivedanalysis(v7)`, `receivedanalysis(v8)` cannot be achieved, unless `v14` can also see all these objects.
           
           Let's check if `v14` can image `v17`, `v18`.
           `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v17` is at `(0.304, 2.073)`. This is on the other side of `v19`.
           `v18` is at `(1.918, 2.09)`. This is on the other side of `v19`.
           So `v14` cannot image `v17` or `v18` due to `v19`.
           
           This means the current goal of `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is unreachable.
           Also, `v14` cannot sample `v1, v3, v5, v7, v8` because they are on the other side of `v19`.
           This implies that almost all of the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` goals are unreachable due to the wall `v19` separating the rovers from most objectives and rocks, and `v12` from the lander.
           
           The only things `v14` can do are:
           - Sample `v4`. `v4` is at `(-0.5705, -2.0645)`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is possible.
           - Send analysis for `v4` to `v9`. `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. This is possible.
           
           So, `receivedanalysis(v4)` can be achieved by `v14`.
           The rest of the goals are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` - Unreachable.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)` - Unreachable.
           - `receivedanalysis(v1)` - Unreachable.
           - `receivedanalysis(v8)` - Unreachable.
           - `receivedanalysis(v7)` - Unreachable.
           - `receivedanalysis(v5)` - Unreachable.
           
           If the goal `new-axiom@0()` (which includes all these unreachable predicates) is indeed the full goal, then the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's confirm the axiom:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom atconf(v12, v13)`
               `Atom atconf(v14, v15)`
               `Atom free(v12, v16)`
               `Atom free(v14, v16)`
               `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)`  <-- Unreachable
               `Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)`  <-- Unreachable
               `Atom type(?stone, v2)`
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)`  <-- `receivedanalysis(v1)` unreachable, `receivedanalysis(v4)` reachable
               `Atom type(?soil, v6)`
               `Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`   <-- `receivedanalysis(v8)` unreachable, `receivedanalysis(v7)` unreachable, `receivedanalysis(v5)` unreachable
           
           Because `v19` separates the two sides, and `v9` is only accessible from `v14`'s side, `v12` cannot send any data. Also, `v14` cannot image `v17` or `v18` because they are on `v12`'s side.
           
           Given these constraints and the provided obstacles, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It's impossible to satisfy all `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the axiom.
           The problem states "If the goal is not achievable from the initial state, in which case you should not return any plan and simply explain why the goal is not achievable."
           This is the case.
           
           The wall `v19` at `x=0` physically separates the rovers' operational areas.
           - Rover `v14` starts at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`, which is on the left side (x < 0).
           - Rover `v12` starts at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`, which is on the right side (x > 0).
           - The lander `v9 (-1.9, -2.0)` is on the left side.
           - Objectives `v17 (0.304, 2.073)` and `v18 (1.918, 2.09)` are on the right side.
           - Rocks `v1, v3, v5, v7, v8` are on the right side.
           - Rock `v4 (-0.5705, -2.0645)` is on the left side.
           
           Therefore:
           1. `v14` cannot image `v17` or `v18` due to `v19` blocking the line of sight.
           2. `v14` cannot sample `v1, v3, v5, v7, v8` as they are on the other side of `v19`.
           3. `v12` cannot send images (`v17`, `v18`) or analyses (`v1, v3, v5, v7, v8`) to `v9` because `v19` blocks the line of sight to `v9`.
           
           Since the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis` for rocks `v1, v8, v7, v5` (which are on the right side), and `v12` cannot send this data due to the blocking wall, the goal is unachievable. `receivedanalysis(v4)` is achievable by `v14`, but not sufficient.
           The problem states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." This includes `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` which would cause `blocked(?y)` if the ray is occluded. It's clear that the configurations I picked for `comvisible` caused collisions, implying they are not free. But the larger point is that no configuration would allow `v12` to see `v9`, or `v14` to see `v17`/`v18`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
