           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom handempty(v4)

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve the goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  This necessitates moving these objects from their initial poses on `v11` to `v16`.  My approach involves utilizing `pick` and `place` actions, the standard means of manipulation in this robotic domain.  I analyzed the initial state, noting the positions and support relationships of the objects, as well as the robot's configuration.  The available actions were reviewed, focusing on `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`.
           
           However, the problem introduces a critical constraint: I can only use actions from a predefined list.  The permissible action instance is merely `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options, as `move_base` merely moves the base *to the same location*.
           
           To achieve the desired goal, I would need to use `pick` to grasp each object, and then `place` to position them correctly. Because neither pick nor place is allowed, the actions available do not permit me to move the objects to their target positions. This makes the specified goal unachievable within the given constraints.
