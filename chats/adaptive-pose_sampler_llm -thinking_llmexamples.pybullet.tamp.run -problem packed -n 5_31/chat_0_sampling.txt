(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 8, with dimensions roughly 0.097 x 0.097) on a square surface.  The surface is a square of side 0.27 centered at (0,0). I need to figure out the placement, which is basically the surface index (0 here), the rotation angle (theta), and the center coordinates (x, y) of the object's bounding box.  For stability, the object's rotated bounding box must be *fully* inside the surface's boundary.
           
           I need to calculate the *rotated* width and height of the object, which change with the rotation angle.  I can express them as functions of `theta` using absolute values of sine and cosine. Given the surface and object dimensions, the key is to ensure that the object's center doesn't get too close to the edge after rotation, as the rotated rectangle has its "corners" that extends.
           
           The object is almost a perfect square (obj_w is almost obj_h), so I know `rotated_w` and `rotated_h` are close. I need to make sure the object's center coordinates are within the range given by the rotated width and height, subtracting half of the maximum extension from either side of the surface limits, which depends on `theta`.  I'll use the maximum extent for the rotated box's half-width and half-height as this would be the largest range to keep the object *completely* inside.
           
           The trick is to strategically pick the `theta` values, and then make sure the center coordinates (x, y) are diverse enough to get 50 stable placements. I figured a good approach will be to vary `theta` from 0 to π/2 to capture the repeating nature of the bounding box due to the square shape.  I'll then distribute the (x, y) coordinates evenly across the available surface space.
           
           To create diverse placements, I'll use 10 different rotation angles within the 0 to pi/2 range.  Then, for each angle, I will use 5 different coordinate combinations (corners and center) inside the permissible region to get the required number of placements. I'll make sure there are at least 5 placements for each `theta`.
           
           I'll calculate the limits of x and y (the x_min, x_max and y_min, y_max) based on each rotation and put the coordinates within the boundary. Then, from these calculations I will be able to generate 50 stable placements for the object.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've got the placement of object 8 sorted. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 7 on surface 0 without them colliding.  Here's the plan:
           
           First, I've got the dimensions of object 7 (it's almost square). The surface is defined as a square region. I have to avoid the existing object 8.  I'm aiming for 50 valid placements.
           
           My approach will be based on *Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes* (AABBs). I'll choose 10 different rotation angles for object 7, from 0 to pi/2 in increments of pi/18. For each angle, I will then calculate 5 potential placement points.
           
           For object 8, I've identified it's AABB which is the unusable region of the available space. Now I need to do the same for object 7. I'll figure out what part of the surface is blocked by object 8 after computing where it could be based on its rotation, and then limit object 7 to an L-shaped region. That's a bit more complex, and requires calculations based on the angle (theta) and dimensions of object 7.
           
           To make things straightforward and consistent, I will define a small set of points that don't collide. Each point I choose satisfies one of two boundary conditions: the new object's x-coordinate is greater than the max x coordinate of object 8 or the y-coordinate is above the max y-coordinate of object 8. With each rotation I will repeat these calculations.
           
           I will use 5 points for the center of object 7:
           1.  Upper-right corner of the *overall* valid region
           2.  Lower-right corner of the *overall* valid region
           3.  Upper-left corner of the *overall* valid region
           4.  Center of the *overall* valid region
           5.  A point *just outside* the collision boundary.
           
           I will then use the coordinates of the center and the object dimensions to determine the correct placement. The main challenge is accounting for object 8. All this should allow me to generate 50 non-colliding placements for object 7 with various orientations.

(Thoughts: **Planning Object Placement: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           My objective is to place 50 stable instances of a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with existing objects (ID 8 and ID 7). Surface 0 is defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've determined that object 8 occupies a rectangular region approximately `[ -0.135, -0.03757 ] x [ -0.135, -0.03757 ]`, and object 7 occupies `[ 0.05064, 0.135 ] x [ 0.05064, 0.135 ]`.
           
           The new object (ID 5) is a square with dimensions `0.09442902474671533`. To handle rotations, I'll calculate the rotated bounding box dimensions `rw` and `rh`, ensuring they always equal each other. The rotation angle, `theta`, will be considered in increments of `pi/18` for diversity.
           
           My strategy involves identifying valid placement zones by carefully considering the areas occupied by objects 7 and 8. The collision logic is straightforward: an object's bounding box can't overlap with the bounding boxes of existing objects. The calculation will be as follows: The `(x, y)` coordinate of the new object (center of the object), which can take the values, should not be inside the bounding boxes of the existing objects.
           
           I've determined a series of possible placement strategies. The first, to use the area that the current objects do not intersect. The areas not used by the existing objects. I would take 25 points, and then sort them down to 5 points. I can now determine that 50 points can be placed for a valid object placement.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. I've got to figure out where to put this new object, ID 4, on Surface 0.  I need to find *at least* 50 stable placements, meaning no collisions. The surface is pretty simple, just a rectangle:  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           The problem?  There are already three objects on there: ID 8, ID 7, and ID 5. These guys are taking up space!  I've got the bounding boxes (AABBs) for all three, and I've crunched the numbers to get their exact positions.  Essentially, I'm dealing with:
           
           *   **Object 8:**  Bottom-left, dimensions are almost square `(0.09742705029833332, 0.09742705029833337)`. Located around `(-0.08628647485083334, -0.08628647485083332)`. Its AABB runs from `[-0.135, -0.03757] x [-0.135, -0.03757]`.
           *   **Object 7:** Top-right, dimensions almost square too. Located at about `(0.09281969160055936, 0.09281969160055935)`. Its AABB is `[0.05064, 0.135] x [0.05064, 0.135]`.
           *   **Object 5:** Centered, near the middle-left area `(-0.02926182920888077, 0.02926182920888077)`. Another square shape.  The AABB of this one is `[-0.07648, 0.01795] x [-0.01795, 0.07648]`.
           
           Now, the new object, ID 4, is also square and has the dimensions (0.07609926835521275, 0.07609926835521275).
           
           I'm thinking I'll rotate this new object through a range of angles and pick valid, non-colliding locations. I'm going to start with 0 up to pi/2, with 10 intermediate values. I will calculate its rotated AABB dimensions, considering how the rotation changes its effective size.
           
           I will define the valid region, by the coordinates.
           For `theta = 0`:
           The new object's half_d is `0.038049634177606375`.
           So the valid range for the center (x, y) is:
           `x_valid = -0.09695, 0.09695`
           `y_valid = -0.09695, 0.09695`
           
           Then, I'll generate a grid of potential locations, and for each one, I'll check if there's any overlap with the existing AABBs. I'll need to make sure the grid is dense enough to find suitable spots.
           
           I'm hoping I can find 50 of these stable, non-colliding locations through this process. I will choose a more granular grid search, or a better sampling if needed.
           
           After a few test rounds, I have a pretty solid grasp on how to get the 50 points I need.

           After a few test rounds, I have a pretty solid grasp on how to get the 50 points I need.
