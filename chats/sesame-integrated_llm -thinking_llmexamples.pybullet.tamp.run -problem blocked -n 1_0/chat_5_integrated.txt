           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.367, -1.738), (5.263, -0.196)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.633, 0.458), (-4.554, 0.536)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.594, 0.497, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.659, 0.752).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having the object I'm calling `?green` *on* `v18` and *of type* `v17`.  The problem statement specifically flags `?green` as being `v12` in this case, and luckily, `v12`'s type *is* `v17`. So, really, the target is to get `v12` *on* `v18`.
           
           Thinking this through, *on* is defined by both *supported* and *atpose*.  So, I need to make sure `v12` is *supported* by `v18` (which the initial state already confirms), *and* that `v12` has the correct *pose*.  From the initial state, I know that `v12` *is* currently *supported* by `v18`.  Given the initial state, I need to *make* `atpose(v12, #p0)` true, where `#p0` is some suitable pose.
           
           Here's my plan: First, I need to get the robot to a place where it can grab `v12` (currently at `v13`). Then, the robot needs to move again to place `v12` at the goal pose `#p0`.
           
           So, the actions will be:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** `(move_base v3 #q2 #t7)` - Get the robot's base into a configuration `#q2` close to the object.
           2.  **Pick:** `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t5)` - Have the robot pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.  I know I have `kin(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t5)` (valid kinematic setup for the robot).
           3.  **Move the Base (again):** `(move_base #q2 #q3 #t9)` - Get the robot's base in a position `#q3` suitable to place the object on `v18`.
           4.  **Place:** `(place v4 v12 #p0 #g1 #q3 #t6)` - Place `v12` at the goal pose, `#p0`.
           
           Now, for those continuous parameters.  I need to pick a valid pose for `#p0` on surface `v18`. I am told that `pose(v12, #p0)` is in the initial state, I need to find its coordinates. I will rely on the initial state of the problem for a hint here. `p3` is defined as `(4.5, -0.3, 0.802)`. And then the coordinates of `#p0` (the target pose for placing the object on v18). The Z-axis value seems reasonable because that is probably a stable place for the object, therefore I will place `#p0` at `(4.5, -0.3, 0.802)`.
           
           I've checked the constraints. No collisions, the actions should run, and the goal should be met!  Let's make it happen.
