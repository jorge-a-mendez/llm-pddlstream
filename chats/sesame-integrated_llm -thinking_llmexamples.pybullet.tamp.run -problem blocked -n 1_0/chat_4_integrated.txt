           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.367, -1.738), (5.263, -0.196)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.633, 0.458), (-4.554, 0.536)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.594, 0.497, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.659, 0.752).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, which I'll call `v12`, *on* another object, `v18`, and ensuring `v12` is of a specific type, `v17`. The crucial part is getting `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the problem, I see that `v12` is initially at a pose represented by `v13`.  My strategy is now clear: I need to *pick* `v12` from its current pose, and *place* it onto `v18` at a suitable location, which I'll call `#p0`.
           
           To successfully execute these pick and place actions, I need to check the preconditions, these actions rely on, like being at an appropriate base configuration for picking and placing, arm reachability, and ensuring that there are no unsafe configurations, trajectories, or poses that could lead to collisions.
           
           The initial state provides `supported(v12, #p0, v18)`, indicating a valid placement. Also, initially I know `type(v12, v17)`.
           
           So, the plan becomes:
           
           1.  **Move the Robot Base:** I need to move the robot base from its initial configuration to a new base configuration, `#q2`, that is suitable for picking `v12` from its current pose, `v13`.
           
           2.  **Pick `v12`:**  Using the arm `v4`, I'll execute the `pick` action to grasp `v12` at `v13` with the grasp `#g1`.
           
           3.  **Move the Base for Placement:**  I then need to move the base from `#q2` to `#q3` (another base config) to position the robot for placing `v12` on `v18` at pose `#p0`.
           
           4.  **Place `v12`:**  Finally, I'll use the `place` action with arm `v4` to place `v12` at the desired pose, `#p0`, which is on `v18` using the same grasp `#g1`.
           
           Now, I also need to ensure that `#p0` is defined correctly. Since `v18`'s bounding box is known, and assuming an approximately standard object size for `v12`, I'll place `#p0` at the center of `v18` in the x and y axes and at a suitable z-height, perhaps around 0.8. Using this placement, I can be sure to have met the requirement `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           By following this plan, I should successfully fulfill the requirement of `new-axiom@0()`, which is `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)`.
