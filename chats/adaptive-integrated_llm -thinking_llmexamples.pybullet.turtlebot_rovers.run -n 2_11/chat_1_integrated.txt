           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Core Plan: A Breakdown of a Complex Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan, as I see it. My primary objective is to make `new-axiom@0()` true.  This involves a bunch of sub-goals I've got to hit, all happening while making sure the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and their stores, `v16`, stay in the right state at the end. It's a bit like juggling, but with rovers, images, and soil samples!
           
           **The Basics:** Both rovers need to stay put (in their initial configurations) and their stores need to be empty at the end. That's a constraint I can't ignore! I have to make sure I *receive* images of two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, in mode `v11`. Then, I've gotta receive an analysis for a rock, that's of type "stone", and another for a soil sample, making sure that I don't fill the storage and leave the rovers blocked.
           
           **Getting the Pictures:** First things first, I've got to get those images of `v17` and `v18`. Either rover can handle this, and I've decided to have `v12` take the lead. This means moving `v12` from its starting position (`v13`) to a spot where it can see both objectives. That spot needs to be configured with the coordinates that I will provide. Then, I need to make sure the cameras are working, which requires calibration. Take the images. It's a multi-step process. But then, there is the tricky bit: get to the communication spot and send them to the lander, and get back to starting point.
           
           **Rock and Soil Analysis:** Now, for the real fun: getting the analyses. `v14` will go collect a rock from  a sample spot. Meanwhile, `v12` will go collect a soil sample from a sample spot. I need to get each rover from their base, to the sampling spot, make sure the analysis is sent (again, using a specific communication point) and that the store is freed after the samples are analyzed, so they are not blocked by the contents of the samples. 
           
           **Store Management is Critical!** The key here is the store: `v16`. Since I *need* the stores to be free *at the end*, I can't let any rover hold onto a sample permanently. That means: grab the sample, move to the comms point, send the analysis, and *drop the sample*. Otherwise, the rovers will not be free (blocked).
           
           **The Final Touches:** The order of the tasks is important. `v12` needs to go to `v13` (its initial position), and then move to a place to take pictures, after which it goes to `v00` for the image, then sample the soil. `v14` needs to go to v15 (its initial position) then move to the sample rock, take the rock, and finally move to v00. Finally, I will have to send the images and the analyses to the lander and make sure the rovers return to their initial positions with empty stores. It is essential.
           
           **Coordinate Configuration:** I also know I need to specify the coordinates for my locations. For `#o3` (imaging), the appropriate locations for `v12` and `v14` are (0.2, 0.8, 1.57) and (-0.2, 0.8, 1.57) - these will allow those rovers to capture the correct images of the objectives. To communicate with the lander (#o0), I need to choose configurations. I'm going to have  `v12` at (0.5, -1.5, -0.785), and `v14` at (-1.5, -1.5, 3.927).

To communicate with the lander (#o0), I need to choose configurations. I'm going to have  `v12` at (0.5, -1.5, -0.785), and `v14` at (-1.5, -1.5, 3.927).

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan had issues with configuration collisions and reachability. The primary problem is the obstacle `v19` (a wall at x=0), which is preventing rovers from taking images or communicating from the proposed `#o3` and `#o0` positions. Also, `#o0` for `v14` collided with the lander `v9`.
           
           I need to select new configurations for `#o3` (image capture) and `#o0` (communication) that avoid collisions with `v19` and `v9`, are reachable, and maintain line-of-sight/range requirements.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the object positions and select new configurations:
           
           *   **Obstacle `v19`**: AABB((-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), (0.05, 2.5, 0.1)). This is a wall at x=0. To avoid this, `v12` should stay on the positive x-side and `v14` on the negative x-side if they are trying to image targets on their respective sides, or move to a shared side if the targets are on one side.
           
           *   **Targets for imaging**:
               *   `v17`: ((-0.455, 1.881), (-0.366, 1.97)) - On the negative x-side.
               *   `v18`: ((0.638, 1.837), (0.733, 1.931)) - On the positive x-side.
               Given `v19` at x=0, `v12` (initial x=1.0) is better positioned for `v18`, and `v14` (initial x=-1.0) for `v17`.
           
           *   **Target for communication**:
               *   `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - On the negative x-side, lower y-values.
           
           **Revised Strategy:**
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75))**:
           1.  **Image `v18`**: `v18` is at (0.638, 1.837) to (0.733, 1.931). `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). A configuration `~#o3_v12_v18` at (0.7, 0.0, 1.57) should work, facing positive Y. It's on the positive X side, avoiding `v19`. Range: sqrt((0.7-0.7)^2 + (0.0-1.8)^2) = 1.8. Max 2. So, good.
           2.  **Communicate with `v9`**: `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v12` needs to move to a spot on the negative x-side, but it needs to avoid `v19`. A configuration `~#o0_v12_v9` at (0.1, -2.0, -2.356) could work. The `v19` wall is at x=0, so (0.1, -2.0) is still on the positive side. It needs to face `v9` which is at x=-1.8, y=-2.0. A configuration like (0.1, -2.0, -2.356) (facing roughly left-down) could work. Range: sqrt((0.1 - (-1.8))^2 + (-2.0 - (-2.0))^2) = 1.9. Max 4. So, good.
           3.  **Sample rock `v8`**: `v8` is at ((1.989, -1.969), (2.124, -1.834)). `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). `~#o5_v12_v8` near `v8` would be (2.0, -1.9, 0.0).
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75))**:
           1.  **Image `v17`**: `v17` is at ((-0.455, 1.881), (-0.366, 1.97)). `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration `~#o3_v14_v17` at (-0.4, 0.0, 1.57) should work, facing positive Y. It's on the negative X side, avoiding `v19`. Range: sqrt((-0.4 - (-0.4))^2 + (0.0 - 1.9)^2) = 1.9. Max 2. So, good.
           2.  **Communicate with `v9`**: `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `~#o0_v14_v9` at (-1.8, -1.8, -3.14) could work, facing right. Range: sqrt((-1.8 - (-1.8))^2 + (-1.8 - (-2.0))^2) = 0.2. Max 4. So, good. This is also far from lander itself.
           3.  **Sample rock `v3`**: `v3` is at ((-0.446, 0.978), (-0.353, 1.071)). `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `~#o5_v14_v3` near `v3` would be (-0.4, 1.0, 1.57).
           
           Let's refine the plan with these new configurations and ensure all movement paths are clear and available. The existing motion facts use generic `#o2` for trajectories, so as long as the start and end configurations are valid, the path is assumed to be feasible.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` still requires:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`
           *   `free(v12, v16)`
           *   `free(v14, v16)`
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)` where `type(?stone, v2)`
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)` where `type(?soil, v6)`
           
           **Revised plan:**
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           1.  Move from `v13` to `~#o3_v12_v18` for imaging.
           2.  Calibrate `v10` for `v18`.
           3.  Take image of `v18`.
           4.  Calibrate `v10` for `v17` (even if it's on the other side, `v12` can image it if it can see it. Let's assume it can, or perhaps it moves closer if necessary. However, since the goal requires both `v17` and `v18` to be received, `v12` will handle both. Re-evaluating. Given `v19` at x=0, `v12` (x>0) cannot easily image `v17` (x<0). So `v14` must image `v17`. )
           
           Revised Plan Split:
           **Rover `v12` (images `v18`, analyzes `v8` (soil))**
           1.  (move v12 v13 #o2 #o3_v12_v18) (to image v18)
           2.  (calibrate v12 #o3_v12_v18 #o4 v18 v10)
           3.  (take_image v12 #o3_v12_v18 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           4.  (move v12 #o3_v12_v18 #o2 #o0_v12_v9) (to communicate)
           5.  (send_image v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           6.  (move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 #o5_v12_v8) (to sample rock v8)
           7.  (sample_rock v12 #o5_v12_v8 v8 v16)
           8.  (move v12 #o5_v12_v8 #o2 #o0_v12_v9) (back to comms position)
           9.  (send_analysis v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o1 v9 v8)
           10. (drop_rock v12 v16)
           11. (move v12 #o0_v12_v9 #o2 v13) (return to initial)
           
           **Rover `v14` (images `v17`, analyzes `v3` (stone))**
           1.  (move v14 v15 #o2 #o3_v14_v17) (to image v17)
           2.  (calibrate v14 #o3_v14_v17 #o4 v17 v10)
           3.  (take_image v14 #o3_v14_v17 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           4.  (move v14 #o3_v14_v17 #o2 #o0_v14_v9) (to communicate)
           5.  (send_image v14 #o0_v14_v9 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           6.  (move v14 #o0_v14_v9 #o2 #o5_v14_v3) (to sample rock v3)
           7.  (sample_rock v14 #o5_v14_v3 v3 v16)
           8.  (move v14 #o5_v14_v3 #o2 #o0_v14_v9) (back to comms position)
           9.  (send_analysis v14 #o0_v14_v9 #o1 v9 v3)
           10. (drop_rock v14 v16)
           11. (move v14 #o0_v14_v9 #o2 v15) (return to initial)
           
           Need to make sure that the `#o3` and `#o0` configurations provided in the initial state are replaced with the new ones defined. Since these are continuous parameters starting with '#', I have the flexibility to define them. I will replace `#o3` with `#o3_v12_v18` for v12 and `#o3_v14_v17` for v14. Similarly for `#o0`.
           The `above` predicates already use `#o5`. I will just specify the value for `#o5` for the specific rover and rock.
           
           Initial state: `conf(v14, #o5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)` etc. And `conf(v12, #o5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)` etc. This `#o5` seems to be a general 'above' configuration, so I can provide two specific continuous values: one for v12 when sampling v8, and one for v14 when sampling v3.
           
           Let's rename the continuous parameters to be distinct for each use case, as per instructions.
           `#o3` used for `imagevisible(v12/v14, #o3, #o4, v17/v18)`
           `#o0` used for `comvisible(v12/v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `#o5` used for `above(v12/v14, #o5, vX)`
           
           So for Rover v12:
           - Image config for v18: `#q_v12_img_v18`
           - Comms config for v9: `#q_v12_com_v9`
           - Sample config for v8: `#q_v12_above_v8`
           
           For Rover v14:
           - Image config for v17: `#q_v14_img_v17`
           - Comms config for v9: `#q_v14_com_v9`
           - Sample config for v3: `#q_v14_above_v3`
           
           These will replace the generic `#o0, #o3, #o5` from the initial state where applicable. If any of the existing `#oX` in the initial state are used as `conf(rover, #oX)` but not in `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, I don't need to specify them. However, if they are used in imagevisible or comvisible, and start with `#`, I need to provide values. The provided configurations in the initial state are:
           `conf(v14, #o5)`
           `conf(v14, #o3)`
           `conf(v14, #o0)`
           `conf(v12, #o5)`
           `conf(v12, #o3)`
           `conf(v12, #o0)`
           
           So I need to provide specific values for all these instances.
           
           Rover v12 configurations:
           - `#q_v12_img_v18` for `v12` to see `v18`. (x,y,theta): (0.7, 0.0, 1.57) (facing north, at x=0.7 which is >0.05, clear of v19).
           - `#q_v12_com_v9` for `v12` to see `v9`. (x,y,theta): (0.1, -2.0, -2.356) (facing SW, at x=0.1 which is >0.05, clear of v19). `v9` is at x=-1.8, y=-2.0 roughly. So (0.1, -2.0) to (-1.8, -2.0) works.
           - `#q_v12_above_v8` for `v12` above `v8`. `v8` is at ((1.989, -1.969), (2.124, -1.834)). (x,y,theta): (2.05, -1.9, 0.0) (facing east).
           
           Rover v14 configurations:
           - `#q_v14_img_v17` for `v14` to see `v17`. `v17` is at ((-0.455, 1.881), (-0.366, 1.97)). (x,y,theta): (-0.4, 0.0, 1.57) (facing north, at x=-0.4 which is < -0.05, clear of v19).
           - `#q_v14_com_v9` for `v14` to see `v9`. (x,y,theta): (-1.8, -1.8, -3.14) (facing west, clear of v19 and v9). `v9` center is approx (-1.9, -2.0).
           - `#q_v14_above_v3` for `v14` above `v3`. `v3` is at ((-0.446, 0.978), (-0.353, 1.071)). (x,y,theta): (-0.4, 1.0, 1.57) (facing north).
           
           I will now construct the plan with these distinct configuration names.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revising the plan to accommodate generic configurations and continuous values:**
           
           I've learned from the previous failure that I *must* use generic configuration names (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) within the plan's actions. These generic names act as placeholders for continuous values, which will be provided separately in a `--Configurations--` section.  This allows me to leverage existing action instances while assigning specific continuous coordinates to rovers for achieving the plan's objectives.
           
           The initial goal `new-axiom@0()` still holds: complete the requested imaging and analysis tasks, while also sending image and analysis data to the lander. The goal can be defined as follows:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` must end at `v13`.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` must end at `v15`.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: Store `v16` on `v12` must be free.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: Store `v16` on `v14` must be free.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective `v17` (mode `v11`) received.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective `v18` (mode `v11`) received.
           7.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a rock of type `v2` (stone) received.
           8.  `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of a rock of type `v6` (soil) received.
           
           From the initial state, rovers `v12` and `v14` start at specific locations, store `v16` is free, cameras of mode `v11` are available, and the goal objectives are visible. The main constraint remains to use rovers to achieve all objectives, carefully managing their configuration so the visibility condition is satisfied.
           
           **Plan adjustments:**
           
           I have adapted the strategy to integrate the use of the generic configuration names. I've re-evaluated each rover's actions, selecting configuration coordinates to satisfy visibility conditions and obstacle avoidance. The general structure of both plans will be identical.
           
           **Rover v12's Actions:**
           
           1.  `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`
           2.  `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10`
           3.  `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`
           4.  `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0`
           5.  `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`
           6.  `move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5`
           7.  `sample_rock v12 #o5 v8 v16`
           8.  `move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0`
           9.  `send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v8`
           10. `drop_rock v12 v16`
           11. `move v12 #o0 #o2 v13`
           
           **Rover v14's Actions:**
           
           1.  `move v14 v15 #o2 #o3`
           2.  `calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10`
           3.  `take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
           4.  `move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0`
           5.  `send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`
           6.  `move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5`
           7.  `sample_rock v14 #o5 v3 v16`
           8.  `move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0`
           9.  `send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v3`
           10. `drop_rock v14 v16`
           11. `move v14 #o0 #o2 v15`
           
           Now, the main focus becomes defining the necessary continuous values for each *instance* of a generic config name. Specifically, I've identified the following (rover

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement and Coordinate Adjustments**
           
           Okay, so I went back to the drawing board after the previous attempts hit a wall with reachability and collisions, especially with that pesky `v19` wall and the `v9` lander. I need to be *much* more precise with these coordinates!
           
           I meticulously re-evaluated the layout: `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75), and `v14` starts at (-1.0, -1.75). The obstacle `v19` is the main thing to avoid: anything between -0.05 and 0.05 on the x-axis is blocked. The lander, `v9`, is a big box in the lower-left corner. This means `v12` generally needs to stay on the positive x-side (x > 0.05), and `v14` on the negative x-side (x < -0.05).
           
           **Rover `v12`'s Plan**
           
           *   **Targeting `v18` (image):** I had to rethink the earlier configuration (#o3). This time, I'm setting a pose at (1.0, 0.0, 1.57), still keeping the x coordinate. This gets me closer to `v18` (about 1.9 units away), and more importantly, it avoids `v19`. I'll call this `#o3_v12_v18`.
           *   **Targeting `v9` (comms):** I scrapped my previous attempt at a new `#o0`. The wall was a real problem. I realized `v12` *can* communicate with `v9` from its starting position, `v13`. So the simplest thing here is to change orientation on position `v13` (x=1.0), which I call `#o0_v12_v9`: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           *   **Targeting `v8` (sample):** Let's try to get a sample from here. The proposed (#o5) was unreachable, so I tried (1.9, -1.8, 0.0), close to the rock, which is near enough to `v8`, within reachable distance. New `#o5_v12_v8`: (1.9, -1.8, 0.0).
           
           **Rover `v14`'s Plan**
           
           *   **Targeting `v17` (image):** Using the exact same reasoning as for `v12`. I need to be in a configuration `(-1.0, 0.0, 1.57)` to keep x < -0.05, but to still allow line-of-sight to the image. `v15` will get the work done. I'll call this `#o3_v14_v17`.
           *   **Targeting `v9` (comms):** Again, `v14` *can* communicate from its starting spot, `v15`. Just need to change the orientation. So `#o0_v14_v9` is `(-1.0, -1.75, 3.14)`.
           *   **Targeting `v3` (sample):** Let's go with `(-0.5, 0.9, 1.57)`. We will call this `#o5_v14_v3`. This is a better location than the first one.
           
           **Important Note:** To make all this work, my motion plan will have to allow the rovers to change orientation. Since I am using `v13` and `v15` for the image visible and com visible scenarios, it will make the implementation of the plan easier, without unnecessary moves.
           
           The revised plan for `v12` is to go from its start `v13`, visit `#o3_v12_v18` to calibrate, take an image. Then, move to `#o5_v12_v8` to sample the rock. And then move to `#o0_v12_v9` to communicate. The same plan is applicable for `v14`.

           **Important Note:** To make all this work, my motion plan will have to allow the rovers to change orientation. Since I am using `v13` and `v15` for the image visible and com visible scenarios, it will make the implementation of the plan easier, without unnecessary moves.
           
           The revised plan for `v12` is to go from its start `v13`, visit `#o3_v12_v18` to calibrate, take an image. Then, move to `#o5_v12_v8` to sample the rock. And then move to `#o0_v12_v9` to communicate. The same plan is applicable for `v14`.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy and Coordinate Selection**
           
           Based on the previous failures, I've re-evaluated the problem's constraints. The core issue seems to be interpreting "reachable." The initial configuration and the movement actions between configurations are defined. I've been focused on picking coordinates which are *close* to the initial ones *and* meet all line-of-sight/above criteria. But, perhaps, the "not reachable" error refers to constraints beyond simple Euclidean distance, like collision detection with unlisted objects or the limitations of rover base movement in specific areas of the map.
           
           **Revised Coordinates for Improved Solution**:
           
           *   **Rover v12 (Initial (1.0, -1.75))**:
               *   **#o3 (Image v18)**:  I've decided on (1.0, 0.0, 1.57). It's close enough and is along the y-axis, allowing images of the north side of the map (where v18 is).
               *   **#o5 (Above v8)**: (2.0, -1.8, 0.0).  A safe config that is reasonably within reach of the start (1.0, -1.75) and a safe sampling position.
               *   **#o0 (Comms v9)**: (0.5, -1.5, 3.14).
               *   Rover will take an image, then sample soil rock.
           
           *   **Rover v14 (Initial (-1.0, -1.75))**:
               *   **#o3 (Image v17)**:  (-1.0, 0.0, 1.57). This position, along with the previous, meets the general layout of the map and meets the constraints.
               *   **#o0 (Comms v9)**: (-0.5, -1.5, 3.14).
               *   **#o5 (Above v3)**: (-0.4, 1.0, 1.57). This is set so that the object is above and along the center of the rock v3. I'm assuming that since `above(v14, #o5, v3)` is in the initial state, it is reachable.
               *   Rover will take an image.
           
           Now I'm hopeful that by selecting positions relative to the objects, and that I should ensure the images are taken, and then sample and communicate. The movement, image, communication will proceed as planned.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Reachability and Plan Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I've hit a wall with the "not reachable for robot base" and collision errors. It's clear that the environment or the robot's movement is more constrained than I initially thought. I need to keep the rover's starting positions and available space in mind. The consistent issue with obstacle `v19` (a wall at x=0) and the lander `v9` is keeping me from defining proper routes.
           
           My initial approach of just using easy math and distances seems to be failing. Let me rethink the configuration points to make sure they are very close to the initial position or in open areas and to always respect line-of-sight and collision avoidance. I see it's clear I must respect the `x` coordinates on each side of the `v19` wall and move the `y` positions as little as possible.
           
           The "not reachable" errors are a clue! This probably means the paths I’m trying to set up are either blocked or the move from the initial position to the objective is outside the robot's kinematic range. Since the problem mentions the use of existing configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, I should use those configurations since these are already assumed reachable in the initial state and are more likely to be accepted.
           
           My strategy needs to be focused on staying close to initial positions if possible, especially since `imagevisible` and `comvisible` both use those variables. This also simplifies the configurations that need to be defined. Also, if I can, it is important to minimize displacement, keeping line of sight and collision avoidance in mind. This is key!
           
           I've got this, this is the plan.
           *   **Rover `v12` (starts: (1.0, -1.75))**: `(1.2, 0.0, 1.57)` to image `v18`; `(2.0, -1.9, 0.0)` for above `v8`; `(0.15, -2.0, 3.14)` for comms with `v9`.
           *   **Rover `v14` (starts: (-1.0, -1.75))**: `(-0.8, 0.0, 1.57)` to image `v17`; `(-0.4, 1.0, 1.57)` for above `v3`; `(-0.15, -2.0, 3.14)` for comms with `v9`.
           
           Hopefully, this minimizes the distance traveled and ensures all line-of-sight and communication objectives will be achieved. This plan seems geometrically sound, avoids known obstacles, and respects the ranges.
