           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Action Selection**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several atomic facts, including receiving images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`). Breaking this down, I recognize that I must:
           
           1.  Obtain images for `v17` and `v18` using mode `v11`.
           2.  Analyze and send analyses for rocks of types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           I then inspect the initial state and available actions. The key actions I can consider are:
           *   `move` (useless since it moves to the same config)
           *   `take_image`,  `calibrate`, `send_image`,  `sample_rock`,  `send_analysis`, and `drop_rock`. However, the only *action instances* available are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           
           **Problematic Constraints and Unreachable Actions**
           
           I focus on the image acquisition aspect, aiming to use `take_image`, which needs `calibrate`, which needs `atconf` and a visible image. I check the configurations `v13` and `v15` for where rovers are and the visible images.
           *   I see `imagevisible` predicates, *but* they all involve configuration `#o3`, while the rovers are at `v13` or `v15`.
           *   Crucially, the provided action instances are limited to `move` and `drop_rock`, meaning I **cannot** use `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `send_image`.
           *    The available `move` actions simply keep the rover in the same config, and `drop_rock` can't be used since the initial state has free spaces.
           This critical limitation – the absence of necessary actions – renders the goal `new-axiom@0()` unattainable. The goal requires actions (images and analyses) that are not possible with only the `move` and `drop_rock` action instances.
