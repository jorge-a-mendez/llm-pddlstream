User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Robot Base Position Generation**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to generate 25 possible locations for the robot base to view a target at (0.02, 0.03). The robot can't be further than 4 units away from the target, and must stay within the scene bounds of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. I also need to avoid the fixed obstacles, and while there aren't any known non-fixed obstacles for this request, I'll keep that in mind. The robot's orientation will be automatically set to face the target.
           
           I've taken a good look at the fixed obstacles, given as AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). The scene is essentially a room defined by the outer walls, with inner dimensions of roughly (-2.45, -2.45) to (2.45, 2.45). The tricky part is the central vertical wall at x=0, which divides the space.  The target point is situated on the *right* side of this wall and very close to it.
           
           Given the target's location, and the fact that I need the robot to *see* the target point, the robot *must* be on the right side of the x=0 wall (x > 0.05, actually, with a little buffer to be safe).  Line-of-sight to the target, given the central wall is critical.
           
           So, the area I'm focusing on is the right half of the room, with the robot's x-coordinate greater than 0.1. I'm going to create a set of functions: `is_valid_position(px, py)`, that performs the following steps.
           
           1.  Checks if the distance between the potential robot position (px, py) and the target is within the maximum range (4 units).
           2.  Ensures the robot stays within the physical scene boundaries (room limits).
           3.  Implements line-of-sight: Ensures the robot is on the "correct" side of the central wall.
           4.  Excludes robot positions that are inside the bounding boxes of any of the fixed obstacles, ensuring collision avoidance. This is a simplification, a more comprehensive line-of-sight check would be ideal, but for the first iteration, this approach works to ensure the robot base is safely outside the obstacles.
           
           To generate the 25 positions, I will first generate a set of evenly spaced points on circles of incremental radii (0.5 to 3.5), centered on the target. Then, if I still need more candidates, I’ll generate a finer grid across the right half of the room (where x > 0.05), making sure that I don't select points that are within obstacles and don't duplicate positions generated from the circle. This two-pronged approach should find diverse set of valid positions.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Strategy for Target Acquisition**
           
           The system has presented me with a second request for the target point `(0.02, 0.03)`. This strongly suggests that my previous approach failed, likely due to a collision with a non-fixed obstacle. Since I have no explicit information on the nature or location of this obstacle, I must adjust my strategy to account for potential occlusions in the scene geometry.
           
           My core assumptions remain sound: the target point resides within the confines of fixed obstacle 5 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, thus requiring a line of sight that prevents the robot to move at the position in front of it. To ensure this, the robot's x-coordinate (`px`) must be greater than or equal to `0.1` for safety, essentially confining the robot to the right half of the environment. I'll maintain this restriction.
           
           To mitigate the risk of collision, I've re-examined the fixed obstacles located in the right half of the room, implementing a collision check that now includes a `0.05` unit buffer around these fixed obstacles to account for the robot's physical dimensions. This adds robustness to my obstacle avoidance.
           
           However, the key change is in how I'm generating candidate positions. To account for the unknown, non-fixed obstacle(s), I've shifted from a more localized sampling strategy to a more diverse, spread-out approach. I'm now generating points on a grid with a `0.15` unit step size in both the x and y directions, ensuring a fine-grained exploration of potential positions.
           
           I'm filtering candidates to ensure each potential position is no closer than `0.5` units to any other selected position. This prioritizes positions with better spatial distribution, mitigating the chance of clustering in a zone near the problematic unknown obstacle. This strategy seeks to find better placements in case the target acquisition fails multiple times, so the new approach should address the previous shortcomings.
           
           If, after applying this diverse sampling strategy, I'm unable to find 25 valid, diverse positions, I have a fallback: I'll fill in with the closest candidates. However, given the refined, spread-out approach, it is highly likely that this will not be necessary.
