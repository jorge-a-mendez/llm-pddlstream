User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.235, -0.447, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.12).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.089, 0.275), (0.186, 0.372)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.109, 0.327), (-0.017, 0.419)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.068, -0.272), (0.017, -0.187)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.137, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, -0.29).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, -0.49), (0.278, -0.405)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.063, 0.373, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.549, 0.836).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.025, -0.229, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.132).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to get four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18.  The key is that I can place all four of these on the same pose *v18* and its going to require precise placement.  They are all currently on a table surface *v11* and I can see their starting poses.
           
           Since the robot base can't move, this is a pick-and-place operation from a fixed base configuration. I'm going to leverage both of the robot arms, v4 and v6, to improve efficiency, assigning v4 to v14 and v8 and v6 to v12 and v16.
           
           For each object, I'll *pick* it up from its current location, *move* it to v18, and then *place* it at a specific pose.  The continuous poses are going to be key here.  I've got a single pose `v18` on which I have to place all four objects. The continuous variables involved will need to be defined.
           
           First, v14 will be picked from `v15` using arm `v4`. Then, it will be placed on v18 at the pose named `#o2_for_v14`. Second, v8 will be picked from `v9` using arm `v4` and placed on v18 at the pose named `#o2_for_v8`. Then, I'll repeat the same for v12 and v16, using arm `v6`.
           
           The robot has to perform all picks and places from the current base configuration `v3`.
           
           The constraints specify that all objects have to be within a space of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I'll place the objects on `v18` so I can't have them overlapping.
           
           Now, because the problem statement indicates I must provide distinct poses for the objects, and because the prompt says to specify values when the pose variable is used with the same `#`, so I must declare separate poses.
           
           Here's the approach and the precise plan:
           
           I'm making the following assumptions:
           1.  Collision-free trajectories and valid grasps can be planned.
           2.  The robot has sufficient reach.
           3.  The pick and place operations are successful.
           4. The objects have sufficient space on v18.
           
           **Poses:**
           
           - `#o2_for_v14`: (x = -0.08, y = -0.08, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0)
           - `#o2_for_v8`: (x = 0.08, y = -0.08, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0)
           - `#o2_for_v12`: (x = -0.08, y = 0.08, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0)
           - `#o2_for_v16`: (x = 0.08, y = 0.08, z = 0.781, theta = 0.0)
           
)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14_v4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14_v4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8_v4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8_v4) , (pick v6 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12_v6) , (place v6 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12_v6) , (pick v6 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v16_v6) , (place v6 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #t_place_v16_v6)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list:

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, I've got a problem. The previous plan I devised is useless because the system only allows `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  Essentially, the robot can't move its base *anywhere*! It's stuck right where it is.  And since I'm trying to arrange objects, specifically to get those four things - v8, v12, v14, and v16 - onto v18, I'm completely stymied.
           
           My initial state tells me the objects are already on v11 because they are supported by v11. To get them to v18 I'd need to pick them up from v11 and put them down on v18. That’s a classic pick-and-place operation! But here’s the rub: even though `pick` and `place` are available in the domain, there's *no* valid *instance* of these actions that the robot can actually perform. I'm limited to a move action that doesn't move.
           
           The list of actions I can use only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does absolutely nothing. The robot's stuck.
           
           So, realistically, with the provided constraints, my goal is unachievable. There's just no way for the robot to rearrange the objects without being able to move them from their initial positions. I should state that explicitly and explain the reasoning. It's not a solvable problem with this limited action space.
