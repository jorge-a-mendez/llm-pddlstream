User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.235, -0.447, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.12).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.089, 0.275), (0.186, 0.372)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.109, 0.327), (-0.017, 0.419)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.068, -0.272), (0.017, -0.187)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.137, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, -0.29).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, -0.49), (0.278, -0.405)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.063, 0.373, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.549, 0.836).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.025, -0.229, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.132).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to move the four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18.** I'll break down the process step-by-step, explaining my reasoning and assumptions.  My expertise in this area allows me to make some simplifying assumptions while still ensuring a feasible solution.
           
           First, I recognize the current setup: each object is supported by v11 at distinct locations.  The goal is to have all four objects on v18, supported at their new poses. The robot arm, v4, is handempty and in a known configuration. The robot's base, v3, is also in a known configuration, and its only available move action (a no-op with zero cost) isn't relevant to my plan. I can, therefore, effectively assume the robot's base remains stationary for the entire operation. This greatly simplifies the planning.
           
           My strategy is straightforward: For each object, I'll *pick* it up from its initial pose and *place* it onto v18 at its target pose.  This will be done sequentially.
           
           Let's illustrate with object v14. The plan will contain a `pick` action for v14 followed by a `place` action. The pick action will satisfy the `kin` predicate which is given, and make sure that the robot picks up the object correctly. The `place` action will place v14 onto surface `v18`. I will use continuous parameters for this. Since the problem states "If the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all), specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name", I must select a distinct pose on surface `v18` for each object. For v14, the final `atpose` condition after placing should be `atpose(v14, #p_v14_v18)`. And it should also satisfy that it is supported: `supported(v14, #p_v14_v18, v18)`. This strategy will be applied for all the other objects, v8, v12, and v16.
           
           This is my plan in action:
           
           1.  **Pick v14:** I'll execute the `pick` action `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)`.  The initial conditions are all met â€“ the arm configuration is appropriate, v14 is where it should be, and the arm is empty. I will assume the absence of any unsafe collisions, ensuring the plan remains valid.
           2.  **Place v14:** Next, I'll execute `(place v4 v14 #p_v14_v18 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Here, the *critical* continuous parameter `#p_v14_v18` represents the specific target pose for v14 on surface v18. I'll need to compute this pose to ensure v14 is stable on v18.
           
           This sequence of actions will repeat for objects v8, v12, and v16, each time using the `pick` and `place` action with distinct continuous parameters for placing onto the surface `v18`.
           
           I've made careful considerations for each of these actions, ensuring my plan adheres to the problem's constraints. Given the task requirements, the plan is as efficient as it can be.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal: A Consequence of Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the problem and the user is absolutely right. All my attempts to use `pick` and `place` were DOA. They're not valid actions according to the provided action list. I'm essentially hobbled. The only thing this robot *can* do is `move_base` from point `v3` to point `v3`. That's it. A total non-starter.
           
           The goal is to get several objects onto `v18`. Right now, they're all on `v11`. To even begin to address this, I'd need to manipulate the objects. I need to get them to the right poses (`atpose`) and have them supported in the desired location (`supported`). For example, getting object `v8` to `v18` means I need `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           
           Unfortunately, with *only* `move_base`, I'm completely stuck. I cannot change the `atpose` of these objects. I can't move them.  I am fundamentally incapable of achieving the goal state. Given the constraints, the problem is simply unsolvable. It's a non-starter.
