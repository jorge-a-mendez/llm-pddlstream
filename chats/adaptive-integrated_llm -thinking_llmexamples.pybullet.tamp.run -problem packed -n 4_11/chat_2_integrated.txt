           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.235, -0.447, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.12).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.089, 0.275), (0.186, 0.372)).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.109, 0.327), (-0.017, 0.419)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.068, -0.272), (0.017, -0.187)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.137, 0.324, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, -0.29).

           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.063, 0.373, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.549, 0.836).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.025, -0.229, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.991, -0.132).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process for tackling this object manipulation planning problem:**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get these four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current spot on surface v11 and onto surface v18.  The robot has an arm (v4) and a base (v3).  Easy enough to visualize!
           
           I see that the objects start supported on v11, and the goal is for each to be "on" v18. That implies I'll need to use the `pick` and `place` actions.  The action costs are 1 for pick/place and distance for moving the base. The problem specifically mentions that I can use the same base configuration for pick/place operations if it helps to minimize the cost. I will try that.
           
           There are continuous parameters. The poses that start with '#' are what I need to worry about.  `#o2` is the pose where each object needs to end up on v18.  I will have to figure out a safe and stable placement on v18 and provide a specific continuous value for each object's `#o2`.
           
           The initial object poses are given. I need to figure out where v18 is in relation to v11 and v3. If v3 is far away, I need a good base trajectory. I notice that the AABBs for the objects and v18 are given. This gives me valuable information to determine the placement locations.
           
           Now, a crucial detail: the `kin` predicates *all* use a base configuration `#o3`. This means I MUST move the base to a configuration that's compatible with picking up, moving, and placing the objects. However, since no explicit base configuration is given and `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is allowed, I will use `v3` for `#o3`.
           
           I should probably make a list of everything:
           *   Objects with their current poses
           *   The goal: objects *on* v18 (meaning supported at a valid `#o2` pose)
           *   The available actions: `pick`, `place`, `move_base`
           *   Costs:  1 for each pick and place; base movement = distance
           
           The general strategy is:
           1.  Move base to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick each object.
           3.  Place each object.
           Since all pick and place operations use `#o3`, I should probably pick and then place, repeating.
           
           To keep the plan simple, I'll move each object one at a time. The key task is to select appropriate placement locations on v18. I'll need to define a collision-free pose `#o2` for each object on v18. Also, I'll need to make sure I pick and place in the correct locations! I will check the AABB to verify if my proposed configuration is collision-free and stable.
           
           *   I'll try a 2x2 grid to space them out. v18 is small.
           *   The coordinates must all be within `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` of v18.
           *   The z coordinate will have to be 0.781 (based on the initial poses).
           
           Let's work this through.
           *   I will set `#o3` to `v3` to minimize any base movement cost and avoid unnecessary moving.
           *   I can have the robot pick up an object from v11 and place it onto v18 using a separate `pick` and a `place` for each object.
               I then need to define the positions for the places to put these objects using the `#o2`. I need to choose four different poses to place the objects.  I will generate four different poses on v18 that are collision-free:
               -   (0.04, 0.04, 0.781)
               -   (-0.04, 0.04, 0.781)
               -   (0.04, -0.04, 0.781)
               -   (-0.04, -0.04, 0.781)
           *   I will write a list to represent the plans.
           
           Based on my analysis, the plan is:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` (since I set `#o3 = v3`, this may be a dummy action with cost zero)
           2.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  
)
