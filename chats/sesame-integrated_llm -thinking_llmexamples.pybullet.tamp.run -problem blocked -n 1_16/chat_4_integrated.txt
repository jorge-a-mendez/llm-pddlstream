           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.034, -1.396), (4.958, -0.059)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.586, 0.392), (-4.488, 0.49)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.537, 0.441, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.94, -0.342).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `on(v12, v18)`**
           
           My goal is to figure out how to satisfy the condition `on(v12, v18)`.  I know that `type(v12, v17)` is already true, so I need to focus on placing object `v12` onto surface `v18`.  Since I'm an expert in this, I'm confident I can do this efficiently.
           
           I start by decomposing the problem:  to have `on(v12, v18)` be true, I need `atpose(v12, #p1)` and `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`.  Luckily, `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is already in the initial state, meaning the "support" aspect is already correct. So, I just need to get `v12` to a specific pose.
           
           From what I can see, `v12` is *currently* at `v13` because the initial state tells me that `v12` is `atpose(v12, v13)`. And, I have actions I can use to pick up and place objects with a robot arm. I know I have to formulate a plan with this in mind, and that the pick and place actions will have to handle most of the work.
           
           My plan unfolds like this:
           
           1.  **Move to Pick Location:**  I need to move the robot base to be near where it can pick up `v12`. Specifically, I need to get to base configuration `#q2`.
           2.  **Pick Up Object:**  Use the robot arm `v4` and the base configuration `#q2` to execute a `pick` action, picking up the object `v12` from its current location `v13`.
           3.  **Move to Place Location:**  Move the base to `#q3`, because I have to place the object somewhere else now.
           4.  **Place Object:**  With base configuration `#q3`, and with `v12` in the arm's grasp, I can use a `place` action to set the object down at the goal location, which I shall call `#p1` and which exists in `v18`.
           
           Now, I look at the low-level details of my approach:
           
           -   **Base Motion:** I need to use the `move_base` action to move the robot base from its initial configuration `v3` to `#q2`, and then to `#q3`. I have the necessary `basemotion` predicates to support this movement.
           -   **Picking and Placing:**  The robot arm needs `kin`ematic facts to support those movements. I have those kinematic facts, that allow the `pick` action to pick up the item at `v13` with grasp `#g1` and the `place` action to place `v12` at pose `#p1`. Also, I'll need to assume that all the trajectory assumptions and safety assumptions hold. I'll need to figure out appropriate values for the variables in the intermediate actions, and provide #p1.
           
           For this problem, the continuous parameter is `#p1`. I need to figure out a suitable position for `v12` on surface `v18`. I'll place the object at the *center* of the surface, at a height that's plausible based on typical objects:
            - Surface dimensions of `v18`: x from 4.2 to 4.8; y from -0.6 to 0.0. I can center in x and y. Z is assumed at `0.8` (since other objects also have similar z height above surfaces)  I can choose a reasonable height for `v12` above `v18`.  I will assume the object has `theta = 0`. This gives me an object pose `#p1` of `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Putting the whole plan together, I can produce a working sequence of actions to ensure that the goal `on(v12, v18)` is achieved.
