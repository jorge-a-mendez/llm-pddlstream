           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.586, 0.392), (-4.488, 0.49)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.537, 0.441, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.94, -0.342).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning:**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Examining this goal, I see it involves placing an object on a surface and ensuring the object has a specific type. Let's assume the first axiom.
           
           My primary approach involves finding an object, `?green`, and demonstrating it's "on" a specific surface (`v18`) and has the required type (`v17`). Based on the initial state, I see `type(v8, v17)`, so it seems `v8` is a potential candidate for `?green`. Therefore the goal is `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           The axiom for "on" requires `supported` and `atpose`. From the initial state, I see `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. So I need to set `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           **Action Sequencing and Preconditions:**
           
           I identify that I need to "pick" `v8` from its current pose and "place" it at `#o2`. I need to execute `move_base` action too.
           
           Before picking, I must address the base configuration, as the arm, `v4`, is currently at `v3` and the objects are situated around `(4.5, 0.0)`. I evaluate the preconditions for `pick`, which include `handempty(v4)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atbconf(#o3)` and a negation of `unsafeapproach`. These are true or easily satisfied.
           
           I introduce a `move_base` action to move the base from its initial configuration `v3` to a more suitable position `#o3`. I've chosen `(3.8, 0.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` because it is in a convenient location. This base movement has to be checked to be valid.
           
           The pick action is now executed. Preconditions are the same (and checked), and effects will be `atgrasp` (v4 with v8 at o1), `canmove()`, `NegatedAtom atpose(v8, v9)` and `NegatedAtom handempty(v4)`.
           
           With `v8` picked, I can now proceed to "place" it at `#o2`. This action will have `atpose(v8, #o2)` as an effect. The action's preconditions are `kin`, `atgrasp`, `atbconf`, and the absence of "unsafe" conditions, which are true.
           The place operation concludes the direct actions needed to satisfy the goal.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination:**
           
           Crucially, I need to provide values for `#o2`, a pose, and `#o3`, a base configuration. The prompt instructs me that when `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state, I need to provide a continuous value.
           
           For `#o2`, I determine that it must be a *stable* and *collision-free* pose. `#o2` is a pose supported by `v18`. Considering the AABBs of `v8` and `v18`, I calculate a suitable x-y center of (4.5, -0.3). I also assume a standard object height and a surface height to calculate a `z` of `0.8` (0,0) for the pose, providing `#o2` as `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. This should ensure that the object is not overlapping with a bounding box.
           
           For the base configuration, I have `#o3` is `(3.8, 0.0, 0.0)`. I ensure that `#o3` (robot base) is closer to the pick/place locations to minimize movement.
           
           **Final Assessment and Optimization:**
           
           My plan is now fully specified:
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4` while at base config `#o3`.
           3.  Place `v8` at `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4` while at base config `#o3`.
           
           I analyze the cost: base move (1.3) + pick (1) + place (1) = 3.3.
           
           This sequence satisfies the initial goal, `on(v8, v18)` as well as the precondition `type(v8, v17)`. The plan appears logically sound, complete, and considers any necessary continuous values.
