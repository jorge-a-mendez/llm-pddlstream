           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.034, -1.396), (4.958, -0.059)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.586, 0.392), (-4.488, 0.49)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.537, 0.441, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.94, -0.342).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process. The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having the green object (`v12`) "on" another object (`v18`) and be of a specific type (`v17`). Since `type(v12, v17)` is given, I need to focus on getting `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           The "on" predicate requires two things: `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  I'm given that `v12` is *already* supported by a pose I'll call `#o2` on `v18`, so I just need to move `v12` to that pose.  Currently, `v12` is at `v13`.
           
           My primary means of manipulation is a robot with two arms (`v4` and `v6`).  Let's use `v4` for this task. I see actions for picking and placing with a specific base config (`#o3`), meaning that there is a possible action to move the base.
           
           The plan looks like this:
           
           1. **Move Base:** I will need to move the base configuration from its initial state (`v3`) to a new configuration (`#o3`) so I can then pick the object.
           
           2. **Pick:** I need to pick `v12` up from its current pose (`v13`) using arm `v4`.  The preconditions for this are a base configuration, robot kinematics matching, and the robot hand being empty. So, I will move the base first and then execute the pick.
           
           3. **Place:** Finally, I must place `v12` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           I'll check the preconditions.  The `move_base` action involves the `basemotion` predicate.  Picking and Placing rely on `atbconf`, `kin`, and `handempty`.  There are also *negative* constraints (things I *don't* want to be true, like "unsafe").  However, I'm going to assume the *unsafe* predicates are false unless there is information suggesting a collision.
           
           I can trace this through the steps to see that the plan works. After the first step, I have the base in position. After the second step, the robot has picked up the object, and after the third, it has placed it. At that point, the goal is met.
           
           Lastly, I need to specify the continuous values for the target pose `#o2`. I need to select a valid position on surface `v18`.  Since I don't have perfect information, I'll pick a general place on the surface where a small object will likely be stable, with the z-value set for general object placement.  I'll pick a value inside of the AABB constraints and define a pose there.
           
           The total cost includes move base (which I can't calculate due to missing info) and two action costs of 1 each (pick and place). This is a likely optimal and executable plan.
