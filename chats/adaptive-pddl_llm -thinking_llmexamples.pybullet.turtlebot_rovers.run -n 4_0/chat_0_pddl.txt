           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Formulate a Plan Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so the task is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing four images (`receivedimage`) and receiving the analysis of rocks and soil (`receivedanalysis`). Breaking it down, I see that I need to manipulate the rovers (v12 and v14), their cameras, and a lander (v9) to achieve this.
           
           Initially, I check the pre-existing conditions and see that the initial `atconf` and `free` predicates are already satisfied. However, I immediately hit a snag. The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, vital for the goal, are absent.
           
           To get the images, I would need to use `take_image` and `send_image` actions, both involving camera calibration (`calibrate`). Similarly, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are needed for the rock and soil analysis. These actions have pre-conditions like visibility and configuration states. This, in itself, is a fairly standard planning problem.
           
           Now comes the twist. The problem statement explicitly restricts the available actions to a given list. Upon reviewing this list of valid action instances, which contains only `move` and `drop_rock`, I realize the challenge is insurmountable. The actions I *need* (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are *not* included.
           
           Furthermore, it is clearly stated that any action not included in the provided list is prohibited. I am specifically instructed that I can only apply the given actions.
           
           Given these strict action constraints, I can logically conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*. No valid plan can be devised with the limited action set provided, as the necessary actions to establish the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are simply unavailable. It's a fundamental conflict between the required goal states and the allowed action set.
