(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). A placement is stable if the object stays within the surface bounds and doesn't collide with obstacles or other objects (though I don't have this collision data now).
           
           Since the object is a square, its bounding box remains 0.07 x 0.07 regardless of rotation (theta), so I will aim for even placements and also vary theta to ensure diversity.  First, I will calculate the valid range for the object's center: `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.  This gives me an available width and height of 0.53.
           
           To generate 50 unique positions, I'll create a 10x5 grid within the valid area, which allows for some variety in positioning. Then I'll create a list of five equally spaced `theta` values, to further enhance placement diversity. I am choosing a `theta` list of `[0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi]`. I will then go through each point and generate my placements using `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The `x` and `y` coordinates will be from a grid, and `theta` will cycle through the five values in my list.
           
           Now I am going to produce the results of the 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Understanding Object Placement and Rotation**
           
           Okay, let's dive into this problem. We've got a square object (ID 10) that needs to be placed on a surface (surface 0). The critical issue I've encountered is handling object rotation, specifically the `theta = pi/4` and `3pi/4` rotations, where the *effective* bounding box (AABB) of the rotated object can extend beyond the surface boundaries, leading to instability. We know from past mistakes with object ID 5. We're dealing with a square of dimensions roughly `0.0962 x 0.0962`.
           
           The key concept here is that the AABB of a rotated object (especially a square) is larger than its original size.  For `theta = pi/4`, the effective side of the square's bounding box is `s * sqrt(2)`, which means any calculations *must* account for this.
           
           **Valid Placement Ranges**
           
           I've already figured out the placement limits given by the bounding box of the surface. Surface 0's dimensions are from `4.2` to `4.8` along x and `-0.6` to `0.0` along y.  I've defined `hw` and `hh` as half-width and half-height of the object's AABB.
           
           If `theta = 0` or `pi/2`, the half-extents are simply `0.0962/2` or `0.0481`.
           If `theta = pi/4`, the half-extents are `0.0962 * sqrt(2) / 2` or `0.06795`.
           
           Knowing these values I could find the permissible center coordinates (`x_c`, `y_c`) within the bounding box of the surface, for any given angle.
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           For ID 10, the strategy is to create a distribution of 50 placements taking rotation into account, aiming to fill the available space effectively, for 4 rotations angles: `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4`.
           
           I will prioritize placements at `0` and `pi/2` because the effective AABB dimensions remain smaller than rotated. I'll still have reasonable placement amounts at `pi/4` and `3pi/4`.
           
           **Placement Details**
           
           *   **theta = 0, pi/2 (15 placements each)**:
               *   x: from `4.2481` to `4.7519`, in 5 intervals

               *   y: from `-0.53205` to `-0.06795`, in 2 intervals
           
           **The resulting placements have been generated as expected from these calculations. I have confirmed I'm using effective AABB dimensions for containment for all cases.**
