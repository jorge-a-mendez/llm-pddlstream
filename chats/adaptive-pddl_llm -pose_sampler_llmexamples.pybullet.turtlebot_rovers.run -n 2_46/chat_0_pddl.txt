User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene consists of a central square area enclosed by thin rectangular obstacles (0-4). There's a vertical bar (5) in the middle, and several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the environment (6-20). The target point is (1.85 0.53). I need to find 3 robot base positions within a radius of 2 from this target point, avoiding collisions with the fixed obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight. The x and y coordinates must be between -2.5 and 2.5.
           
           My strategy is to try positions around the target point, varying the angle and distance to ensure diversity and to maximize the chances of finding valid, unoccluded positions. I will prioritize positions that are not directly behind any known obstacle relative to the target.
           
           Positions:
           (1.85 2.5)
           (2.5 0.53)
           (0.0 0.53)
