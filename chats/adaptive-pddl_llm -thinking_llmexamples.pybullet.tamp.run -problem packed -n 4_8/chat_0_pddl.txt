           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Assessing Goal Reachability**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.  Given the axioms, this means I need to establish `on(object, v18)` for each of those objects.  Specifically, for each object, I'm looking for a pose `p` where both `supported(object, p, v18)` and `atpose(object, p)` are true.
           
           Let's break down the initial state.  Currently, all four target objects are *on* `v11` and therefore *not* on `v18`.  Crucially, I also see that, for all four objects, I *could* have them on either `v18` or `v10` at pose `#o2`.
           
           However, here's the kicker: the only action I'm *allowed* to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a huge constraint.  To achieve the goal, I *need* to pick up the objects and place them onto `v18`.  That requires `pick` and `place` actions which are not listed in the available actions.  I see from the problem statement that this means *no other actions can be used*.
           
           Without the ability to `pick` and `place`, I'm stuck.  I can't manipulate the objects at all.  Furthermore, I've confirmed that none of the goal conditions are already met in the initial state.  So, I can't achieve this goal state with only `move_base`.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, the goal is unreachable.
