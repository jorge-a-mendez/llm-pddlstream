User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central obstacle and several smaller obstacles scattered around. There are also boundary obstacles that define the robot's movement limits. I will try to find positions for the robot to view the target point {target_point} that are within the max_range of 2. I'll prioritize positions that are likely to be clear, avoiding areas close to the given obstacles.
           
           The robot's operational area is between -2.5 and 2.5 for both x and y.
           Obstacles:
           0: ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)) - This seems to represent the outer bounds rather than an internal obstacle as it covers the entire allowed area.
           5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - A thin vertical obstacle down the middle (x=0).
           
           Other obstacles are smaller rectangles. I will try to place the robot on either side of the vertical obstacle at x=0, and also consider positions along the edges of the overall permitted area, as long as they are not blocked by the specified AABBs and are within range of the target.
           
           Given the target point, I'll calculate possible positions by considering a circle of radius 2 around the target. I'll pick points on this circle or within it, trying to distribute them to increase the chance of finding a valid one. I will also make sure to avoid the vertical wall at x=0.

           (-0.5147854614257812 0.8879500000000001)
