(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place this square object (ID 5, `size_x = size_y = 0.0892`) on this square surface (ID 0, `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`) in 50 stable configurations.  Stability here means the object is *completely* inside the surface.
           
           Since the object's square, the calculations simplify a bit.  I've got the half-extent, `hx = hy = 0.0892 / 2 = 0.0446`.  The rotation angle (`theta`) will change the *effective* "radius" I need to consider for stability.  That `R_eff` is the tricky bit.
           
           I know that if `theta` is a multiple of pi/2 (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2), the effective size is just `(size_x, size_y)`, so `R_eff = 0.0446`.  But for other `theta` values, it's a bit more complicated. I need to calculate it with `R_eff = hx * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The maximum `R_eff` occurs at `pi/4` and is `0.063086`.  I also have to remember that because the object is a square, the AABB extents are symmetric and equal `new_hx = new_hy`.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's center has to be within a smaller square within the surface's boundary. The boundary of that "safe" area depends on `R_eff`, and it varies with `theta`.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Vary Theta:**  I'll pick a few key `theta` values, from `0` to `pi/2` as the AABB extents repeat after this.  I've chosen `0`, `pi/12`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3`, `5pi/12`, and `pi/2`.
           2.  **Calculate Effective Radius:** For each `theta`, I'll calculate the corresponding `R_eff`.
           3.  **Calculate Safe Area:** Then, I can figure out the valid range for `x` and `y` position using that `R_eff`.
           4. **Choose x,y values to have diversity in position:** For each `theta`, I will choose a few x, y values at the center, and on the edges.
           5.  **Round Coordinates**:  Finally, I'll provide each placement as a (surface, theta, x, y) tuple, rounding the x and y values to 6 decimal places.
           
           I've already worked out the details for each of these steps, and now I just need to compile the list of placements. This approach should give me a diverse set of 50 stable object placements on the surface, achieving the desired result.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) on a surface (ID 0) while avoiding collision with a previously placed object (ID 5).  I know object 5's position and size, and I have the surface's dimensions. My primary concern is the collision avoidance constraint.  The core of the problem is determining valid positions and rotations for object 4 that don't overlap object 5. My analysis confirms that any placement *will* result in a collision, given the geometry, yet I *must* generate 50 placement suggestions. The challenge is clear: I'm faced with an inherently unsolvable problem and must creatively approach the task.
           
           **Geometric Analysis and Collision Constraints**
           
           First, I define the key parameters: `h4x` (object 4's half-extent in x), `h4y`, `h5x`, `h5y` (object 5's half-extents), and `R4_eff` (object 4's effective half-extent due to rotation).  The surface constraints provide the valid range for placing object 4's center.  I calculate the *minimum* required separation between the objects to avoid collision, which is a key number for comparing the surface area. I determine the surface constraints. I derive the conditions where object 4's AABB doesn't overlap object 5's AABB.  By combining surface bounds and non-collision constraints, I show that no non-colliding solution exists within the surface's bounds. The minimum separation between objects 4 and 5 needed for avoiding collision is larger than the available space on surface 0. Any placement will violate the constraints. The critical parameter that defines the feasibility of this situation is the value of `R4_eff`, which is dependent on the object's size and angle.
           
           **The Impossibility Proof**
           
           My detailed calculation demonstrates it's impossible to avoid collision while adhering to the geometric and placement rules. The main constraint that causes this is that object 5's bounding box makes placement of the other object impossible, without going outside the bounds of the surface. Based on my calculations, I determine the `R4_eff` is always too big to fit inside the given surface while not colliding.
           
           **Strategy and Plan of Action: The "Impossible" Task**
           
           Given the mathematically impossible condition, I must adjust my strategy while still adhering to the problem's prompt, which demands 50 placements.
           Here's my plan:
           1.  Assume a *must be returned*.
           
           2.  Focus on generating positions and rotations that respect the surface constraints as much as possible, while accepting my inherent calculations on collision.
           
           **Solution: The 50 Placements**
           
           I will generate placement suggestions which may be considered "maximally non-colliding" on the surface, given the current conditions.
           For seven rotation values, I will attempt to put them on each surface:
           These points should be considered the center point of the object for placement.
           The seven rotation values I will use are:
           * 0 (degrees)
           * pi/12 (degrees)
           * pi/6 (degrees)
           * pi/4 (degrees)
           * pi/3 (degrees)
           * 5pi/12 (degrees)
           * pi/2 (degrees)
           
           The locations that I will generate each rotation at will be (for each rotation):
           1. `(max_xy, 0)`
           2. `(-max_xy, 0)`
           3. `(0, max_xy)`
           4. `(0, -max_xy)`
           5. `(max_xy, max_xy)`
           6. `(-max_xy, -max_xy)`
           7. `(0,0)`
           
           Since I needed to generate 50 positions, I have to generate 7*7 + 1 which would equal 50, in order to make it valid for the constraint.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Placement Feasibility for New Object on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0.  I have to avoid collisions with two previously placed objects, object 5 and object 4. I know the surface dimensions and the sizes and positions of the existing objects. I'm focusing on surface 0 which is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've calculated the effective radius (`R_eff`) of object 6, which depends on its rotation angle (`theta`). I also calculated half of the new object's edge size (`h6`).  The problem is, after running through the calculations, it's seeming impossible to actually find a valid spot, given the placement of object 5 and object 4 in the scene. I can use the formula, `R_eff_6(theta) = h6 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to calculate this range. I'm using that with the size of object 6 (`0.09793235615287016`).
           
           Object 5 is at the origin, with its size, and I calculated its half-size, `h5 = 0.044603866362524335`. Object 4 is at `(0, 0.085683, 0.0)` and has a half-size, `h4 = 0.04931662133454706`. I am setting their initial positions to be zero-rotation. From the initial positions, I calculated their AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes). Object 5's AABB is roughly in the range x: [-0.0446, 0.0446] and y: [-0.0446, 0.0446]. Object 4's AABB is roughly in the range x: [0.0364, 0.1350] and y: [-0.0493, 0.0493].
           
           I worked out that to avoid collision with the edge of the surface, object 6's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the bounds `[-0.135 + R_eff_6(theta), 0.135 - R_eff_6(theta)]`.
           
           Now, the collision part. For object 6 to avoid colliding with existing objects, its AABB *must not* overlap with object 5's AABB or object 4's AABB. I calculated that if `x_6 + R_eff_6 <= x_5_min OR x_6 - R_eff_6 >= x_5_max OR y_6 + R_eff_6 <= y_5_min OR y_6 - R_eff_6 >= y_5_max`, then object 6 does not collide with object 5. And similar checks for object 4.
           
           I calculated the ranges for the rotation and surface boundaries, and things are looking very, very tight. I calculated that the smallest `R_eff` for object 6 is about 0.049 and the largest is about 0.069. So I checked, for each rotation, if there was space, and it looks like there isn't.
           
           After doing the math and re-checking it, there is *no* position for object 6 on the surface 0 that *won't* collide with at least one of the existing objects. I have to deliver those 50 placements. It is very likely all the proposed placements will be marked as collisions.
           
           The math shows no combination of position and rotation will avoid both objects. The combined AABBs of objects 4 and 5 occupy a vast portion of the surface.  Any attempt to place object 6 within the allowed surface area seems doomed to collide. Still, I must try, and I will.
           
           Since I have to deliver valid outputs, I'm going to generate a set of test positions across a series of angles, using rotations, ranging from 0 to pi/2, with several positions within each rotation. I'll stick to a systematic approach to explore the valid range (despite it not actually being valid) to be as thorough as possible. I'll assume no other obstacles. Then, it's over to the system to test and report back. I'll provide those, even if they're all flagged as collisions

Model:     **Analysis of Placement Feasibility for New Object on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0.  I have to avoid collisions with two previously placed objects, object 5 and object 4. I know the surface dimensions and the sizes and positions of the existing objects. I'm focusing on surface 0 which is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've calculated the effective radius (`R_eff`) of object 6, which depends on its rotation angle (`theta`). I also calculated half of the new object's edge size (`h6`).  The problem is, after running through the calculations, it's seeming impossible to actually find a valid spot, given the placement of object 5 and object 4 in the scene.

           Object 5 is at the origin, with its size, and I calculated its half-size, `h5 = 0.044603866362524335`. Object 4 is at `(0, 0.085683, 0.0)` and has a half-size, `h4 = 0.04931662133454706`. I am setting their initial positions to be zero-rotation. From the initial positions, I calculated their AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes).

           I worked out that to avoid collision with the edge of the surface, object 6's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the bounds `[-0.135 + R_eff_6(theta), 0.135 - R_eff_6(theta)]`.
           
           Now, the collision part. For object 6 to avoid colliding with existing objects, its AABB *must not* overlap with object 5's AABB or object 4's AABB. I calculated that if `x_6 + R_eff_6 <= x_5_min OR x_6 - R_eff_6 >= x_5_max OR y_6 + R_eff_6 <= y_5_min OR y_6 - R_eff_6 >= y_5_max`, then object 6 does not collide with object 5. And similar checks for object 4.
           
           I calculated the ranges for the rotation and surface boundaries, and things are looking very, very tight. I calculated that the smallest `R_eff` for object 6 is about 0.049 and the largest is about 0.069. So I checked, for each rotation, if there was space, and it looks like there isn't.

Then, it's over to the system to test and report back. I'll provide those, even if they're all flagged as collisions
