User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There are several obstacles within this room. A prominent feature is a vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0, spanning the entire height of the room, effectively dividing it into two halves. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the corners (obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10) and others more centrally located. Many obstacles are also very close to the outer walls, forming a sort of inner perimeter.
           
           The target point is (-0.06019623000000001, -0.09849206). Since the target is very close to the origin, which is occupied by the large obstacle 5 (the wall at x=0), I need to find positions that are not directly on this wall but still within range. The wall prevents direct viewing from one side to the other across x=0. Given the target is slightly to the left of the wall, I should primarily consider positions to the left of x=0. However, the max range of 2 means I could potentially look around the ends of the wall if the target were closer to the ends, but for this central target, I must stay on the left side of the wall.
           
           I will try to find positions to the left of x=0, avoiding the obstacles in that region.
           Positions:
           (-1.06019623 -0.09849206)

Model:     The previous target point was incorrect; the true target point for which I need to provide positions is ( -2.0153021812438965, 1.8643027544021606). The previous suggested positions were for a target near the origin, which explains why they failed. The actual target is in the top-left quadrant of the room.
           
           From the previous attempt, I learned that:
           - (-1.06019623, -0.09849206) had no line of sight to the target (-2.0153021812438965, 1.8643027544021606). This makes sense, as this position is quite far away from the actual target, and the wall at x=0 or other obstacles could be blocking the view.
           - (-0.06019623, -1.09849206) collided with obstacle 5 (the wall at x=0). This also makes sense, as the x-coordinate is very close to 0.
           - (-0.06019623, 0.90150794) also collided with obstacle 5. Same reasoning.
           
           For the new target point (-2.0153021812438965, 1.8643027544021606), I need to find positions within a distance of 2. This means the x-coordinate should be between -4.015 and -0.015, and the y-coordinate between -0.135 and 3.864. Considering the room limits, x will be in [-2.5, -0.015] and y in [-2.5, 2.5]. The target is in the top-left corner. I should aim for positions close to the target, avoiding obstacles 6, 8, 14, 19, 22, which are in this general area.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.01530218 0.86430275)

Model:     The previous request was the same as the one before it, so I am still working with the target point (-2.0153021812438965, 1.8643027544021606). The reported failures are from the first (incorrectly targeted) attempt. I need to make sure I am focusing on positions relative to the *correct* target point.
           
           My previous positions for this target were:
           - (-2.01530218, 0.86430275)
           - (-1.01530218, 1.86430275)
           - (-2.01530218, 2.0)
           
           Since no failures were reported for these positions, I will assume they were valid. I will reuse these positions, as the prompt states "You may reuse previous positions if they appear valid". I will also add a new one, just in case. The target is in the top-left corner, and I am looking for positions within a radius of 2. I need to continue to avoid obstacles 6, 8, 14, 19, 22 in that vicinity.

Model:     The target point has changed again! It is now (2.090846061706543, 1.81859290599823). This is in the top-right quadrant of the room.
           
           Let's analyze the failures for the *previous* target point (-2.0153021812438965, 1.8643027544021606) which were reported against the *new* target point (this is confusing, but I must learn from it). The failures for the previous request, when the target was in the top-left, but the feedback was against the new target in the top-right are:
           - (-2.01530218, 0.86430275) had no line of sight to (2.090846061706543, 1.81859290599823). This is expected as obstacle 5 (the wall at x=0) completely blocks the view from the left side to the right side of the room.
           - (-1.01530218, 1.86430275) collided with obstacle 14 ((-1.191736748260078, 1.9243431782307057), (-1.0729674791874317, 2.043112447303352)). My proposed position (-1.01530218, 1.86430275) has an x-value of -1.015, which is outside the range for obstacle 14, and the y-value 1.864 is also outside. This indicates that the collision feedback might have been for a position *close* to the obstacle, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the collision, but it does tell me that the area around (-1.015, 1.864) is problematic due to this obstacle, as well as obstacles 8 and 19.
           - (-2.01530218, 2.0) collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and obstacle 19 ((-2.058448626307038, 1.821156309339019), (-1.972155736180755, 1.9074491994653022)). My proposed position (-2.01530218, 2.0) is indeed inside the bounds of obstacle 8 (x between -2.25 and -1.75, y between 1.75 and 2.25). It is also inside obstacle 19.
           
           Now for the *new* target point: (2.090846061706543, 1.81859290599823). This target is in the top-right, near the corner. I need to find positions within a distance of 2 from this point.
           The x-range will be (0.09, 4.09), limited by the room to (0.09, 2.5).
           The y-range will be (-0.18, 3.81), limited by the room to (-0.18, 2.5).
           
           I need to avoid the wall at x=0 (obstacle 5) and other obstacles in the top-right quadrant, specifically obstacles 7, 21 and the right wall boundary 3.

           - (2.09084606, 0.81859291) also had no line of sight. Same reasoning.
           - (1.59084606, 2.0) collided with obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). My proposed position (1.59084606, 2.0) has an x-value (1.59) that is indeed just to the left of obstacle 7, but the y-value (2.0) is within its y-range, and the given collision feedback is definitive. This means the position must have crossed into the obstacle or been too close.
           
           Now for the *new* target point: (-0.4768438935279846, 2.1969733238220215). This target is in the top-left, very close to the x=0 wall.
           The robot base needs to be within 2 units of this target.
           x-range: (-2.4768, 1.5231). Limited by room to [-2.4768, 1.5231].
           y-range: (0.1969, 4.1969). Limited by room to [0.1969, 2.5].
           
           Since the target is close to the x=0 wall, I need to place the robot on the left side (negative x) to avoid the wall. I also need to avoid obstacles in the top-left, specifically obstacles 8, 9, 10, 14, 19, 20, 22. Obstacle 22 ((-0.5237742912806395, 2.1500429260693665), (-0.4299134957753298, 2.2439037215746764)) is extremely close to the target point (-0.4768, 2.1969). The target itself is *inside* obstacle 22. This is critical. The robot cannot be placed where the target is, and anything trying to view it must be careful not to collide with the obstacle containing the target.
           
           Given that the target is inside obstacle 22, it's a very challenging scenario. I need to find positions that are within 2 units, avoid obstacle 22, and other nearby obstacles like 8, 9, 10, 14, 19, 20. The target is between x=-0.52 and x=-0.42. My position cannot have an x in this range.
           
           I will try to place the robot slightly below and to the left of the target, avoiding the obstacle 22. Since the target is right at the top of the room, I can't go much higher.

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed once more! It is now (0.3454386591911316, 1.978685736656189). This target is in the top-right quadrant, very close to the x=0 wall, but on the *right* side of it.
           
           Let's analyze the failures from the *previous* request for the target point (-0.4768438935279846, 2.1969733238220215), but the feedback was against the *new* target point (0.3454386591911316, 1.978685736656189).
           - (-1.0, -0.47684389) had no line of sight to (0.3454386591911316, 1.978685736656189). Expected, due to the x=0 wall.
           - (-0.47684389, 1.19697332) was "not reachable for robot base". This likely means it was out of bounds or in a problematic area, potentially colliding with a small obstacle or too close to a wall, or perhaps the y-coordinate was out of the permitted range of [-2.5, 2.5] for the robot. Looking back, I had incorrectly set the target y into the position's x, so this was a malformed position in general.
           - (-1.5, 2.0) had no line of sight due to occlusion. Expected, due to the x=0 wall.
           
           Now for the *new* target point: (0.3454386591911316, 1.978685736656189). This target is in the top-right, very close to the x=0 wall, just to its right.
           The robot base needs to be within 2 units of this target.
           x-range: (-1.6545, 2.3454). Limited by room to [-1.6545, 2.3454].
           y-range: (-0.0213, 3.9786). Limited by room to [-0.0213, 2.5].
           
           Since the target is to the right of the x=0 wall, I need to place the robot on the right side (positive x) to avoid the wall. I also need to avoid obstacles in the top-right, specifically obstacles 7, 9, 10, 20, 21. Obstacle 20 ((0.3044118393432323, 1.9376589168082896), (0.3864654790390309, 2.0197125565040883)) is extremely close to the target point (0.3454, 1.9786). The target itself is *inside* obstacle 20. This is critical. The robot cannot be placed where the target is, and anything trying to view it must be careful not to collide with the obstacle containing the target.
           
           I need to find positions that are within 2 units, avoid obstacle 20, and other nearby obstacles. Since the target is inside obstacle 20, which is a small box, I will try to position the robot slightly below and/or to the right of it. The target is quite high in y, so I cannot go much higher.
