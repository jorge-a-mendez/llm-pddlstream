           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This conjunctive goal requires several conditions to hold: the rovers' configurations and storage to remain as specified in the initial state, and the acquisition of specific images and analyses.
           
           **Key Challenges and Limitations**
           
           Initially, my thought process involved identifying the necessary actions for image and analysis acquisition. However, upon scrutinizing the allowed action instances, it became clear that the goal is likely unreachable given the given action instances.
           
           Specifically, the "move" action is restricted to no-op instances. The provided `move` actions simply preserve the initial configurations of rovers `v12` and `v14` (i.e. to move *to* the same configuration they start in), making it impossible to transition to the configurations required for imaging, analysis, and communication, `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. Also, action instances for image-taking, image-sending, rock sampling, and analysis sending are not available.
           
           **Conclusion: Unreachability of the Goal**
           
           Since the actions needed to alter the states of the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not provided, these parts of the goal cannot be true, so the entire goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
