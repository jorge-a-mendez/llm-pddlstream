           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: Stacking Objects on v20**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I've been tasked with a plan to get a bunch of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) all "on" v20.  Right now, they're all sitting on v11.  The objective is simple on the surface, move everything from v11 to v20. Seems straightforward.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the goal, the action required will be a combination of *pick* and *place* actions. I need to use the robot arms to pick up each object from v11 and put it down on v20.  The `supported` facts indicate that if the objects are at pose `#o2`, then placing the objects on `#o2` will make them "on" `v20`. So, pose `#o2` is the target.
           
           I analyzed the pre/post-conditions of the *pick* and *place* actions.  These actions have specific requirements. They involve kinematic relationships (`kin`), poses (`atpose`), grasp information, and crucially, they need the robot arm to be *handempty*. The *place* actions also require a pose where it can safely place the item.  
           
           Now, here's the kicker, and this is where it falls apart. The *only* valid action instance I am provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. The provided actions are very limited and the `move_base` action doesn't affect the location of any items. In the problem description, it says I *can't* use any action instances that *aren't* on the list. I have to play by the rules. No *pick* and *place* actions means I can't move the objects!  
           
           Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the actions given.
