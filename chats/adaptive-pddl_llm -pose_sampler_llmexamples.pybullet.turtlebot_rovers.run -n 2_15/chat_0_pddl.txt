User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene contains a large central obstacle, as well as several smaller obstacles scattered around. There are also outer walls forming a square enclosure from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y.
           
           The large central obstacle (0) is at ((-2.5, -2.5), (2.5, 2.5)), which is the entire bounding box of the scene. This means the robot itself must be placed within this bounding box, and this particular box doesn't represent an internal obstacle.
           
           The actual internal obstacles appear to be:
           - A vertical wall through the center (5): ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)). This effectively splits the environment into two halves, x < 0 and x > 0, with a narrow passage.
           - Several square obstacles around the perimeter:
               - (7): ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
               - (8): ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))
               - (9): ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))
               - (10): ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))
           - Several smaller, more scattered rectangular obstacles. Some of these are very thin, indicating they might be part of more complex shapes or just very small features.
           
           My strategy will be to place the robot in regions that are generally open and not close to any known obstacles. Since the target is at (-2.0, -1.0), I will prioritize positions in the bottom-left quadrant (x<0, y<0) to be closer to the target, as this avoids the central vertical wall and the obstacles in the top half. I will try to keep a reasonable distance from the known small obstacles in this quadrant.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 -1.0)
           (-2.0 -2.0)
           (-1.5 -0.5)
