User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle in the middle at x = 0. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the room, including two large ones in the bottom left (around -2, -2) and top right (around 2, 2). There are also several smaller obstacles near the corners and along the walls.
           
           Given the target point (1.37893116 0.1764658), I need to find 25 valid base positions within a distance of 4 from this point. I will prioritize positions that are clearly away from known obstacles and provide a good line of sight. Given the target is around (1.37, 0.17), I will explore positions around it, keeping in mind the central vertical obstacle at x=0. I will mostly focus on the right side of the x=0 line, but also consider positions on the left if they offer good line of sight.
