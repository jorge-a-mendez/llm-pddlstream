           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers (v12, v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a storage (v16), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18). The camera (v10) is onboard both rovers and supports the mode (v11). Both rovers are at their initial configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14) and have free storage (v16). There are several `above` and `imagevisible` predicates, indicating that the rovers can see and potentially sample various rocks and take images of objectives from specific configurations. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze the `new-axiom@0()`:
           
           `new-axiom@0()`:
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true initially.
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true initially.
           *   `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12 has free storage v16. This is true initially.
           *   `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14 has free storage v16. This is true initially.
           *   `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received. This needs to be achieved.
           *   `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received. This needs to be achieved.
           *   `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object of type v2 (stone) exists. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           *   `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a stone has been received. This needs to be achieved.
           *   `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object of type v6 (soil) exists. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           *   `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of soil has been received. This needs to be achieved.
           
           From the available action instances, only `move` and `drop_rock` are allowed. However, none of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. `receivedimage` requires `send_image`, which itself requires `haveimage` and `calibrated` (or a re-calibration). `receivedanalysis` requires `send_analysis`, which requires `analyzed` (from `sample_rock`).
           
           Since none of the available actions (`move`, `drop_rock`) can directly or indirectly lead to the achievement of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`, and these are essential parts of the goal, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. The only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           - `receivedimage` can only be achieved by the `send_image` action. The `send_image` action is not available.
           - `receivedanalysis` can only be achieved by the `send_analysis` action. The `send_analysis` action is not available.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the allowed actions.
