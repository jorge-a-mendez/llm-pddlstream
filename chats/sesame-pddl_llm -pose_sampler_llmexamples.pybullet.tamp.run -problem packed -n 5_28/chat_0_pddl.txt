           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.083x0.083. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's a large area where it can be stably placed. I will prioritize placing the object in the center of the surface, as well as near the edges and corners to cover a diverse set of placements. Rotations of 0 and pi/2 radians are also good candidates for square objects.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, with a single square surface centered at the origin. The new object (ID: 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.098x0.098. I need to find 50 stable placements for object 5, ensuring it does not collide with object 4, which is currently placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. Since both objects are square and centered, I will need to place object 5 at an offset from the origin. The sum of half-extents of the two objects is (0.08323090670539607/2) + (0.09823895556147932/2) = 0.04161545335 + 0.04911947778 = 0.09073493113. This means that if object 5 is also placed at 0 rotation, its center must be at least 0.09073493113 away from (0,0). I will prioritize placements that are further away from the center to avoid collision.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still a single square surface. I have two objects placed:
           - ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with extents 0.083x0.083
           - ID 5: (0, 0.0, 0.095, 0.095) with extents 0.098x0.098
           
           The new object (ID 6) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0896x0.0896.
           From the previous failures, I learned that placing object 5 too close to the edge (e.g., at 0.1, 0.1) caused it to be unstable because parts of its AABB went beyond the surface limits. The maximum allowed coordinate for object 5 was 0.095, as the object's half-extent is ~0.049, so 0.095 + 0.049 = 0.144, which is beyond 0.135. However, since the placement (0, 0.0, 0.095, 0.095) was a success, this means my initial calculation for the object's half-extent and thus maximum placement was slightly off, or there's some tolerance. Let me recalculate: surface upper_x = 0.135. Object 5 half_x = 0.09823895556147932 / 2 = 0.04911947778. So max_x for object 5 would be 0.135 - 0.04911947778 = 0.08588052222. This implies the reported success (0, 0.0, 0.095, 0.095) is slightly outside what I calculated, so I need to be careful with the bounds. I will assume the provided success is accurate and work from there. The reported AABB for the failed placement (ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.1 was ((0.06500000149011612, 0.06500000149011612), (0.13500000149011612, 0.13500000149011612)). This suggests the object's half-extent is 0.035, not 0.049. If half-extent is 0.035, then max_coord = 0.135 - 0.035 = 0.1. This means the object's actual dimensions or interpretation of "extent" might be different from my understanding. Let's use the AABB values from the failure reports to infer the effective half-extent. For object 5, the AABB ((0.065, 0.065), (0.135, 0.135)) for a center at (0.1, 0.1) implies an effective half-extent of 0.035. This would mean (0.135 - 0.065) = 0.07, and 0.07/2 = 0.035. I will use this effective half-extent for my calculations.
           
           For object 6 (ID: 6) with given extents 0.08963762056381164 x 0.08963762056381164, its effective half-extent would be 0.08963762056381164 / 2 = 0.04481881028.
           So the maximum coordinate for placing object 6 would be 0.135 - 0.04481881028 = 0.09018118972. This is a very tight fit.
           
           Object 4 is at (0,0) with half-extent ~0.0416.
           Object 5 is at (0.095, 0.095) with half-extent ~0.0491 (from original spec) or ~0.035 (from error report). I will assume the error report's effective half-extent is correct for stability checks, which is 0.035. So object 5 has AABB from (0.095-0.035, 0.095-0.035) to (0.095+0.035, 0.095+0.035), i.e., (0.06, 0.06) to (0.13, 0.13). This fits within the surface.
           
           Object 6 (new) effective half-extent: 0.08963762056381164 / 2 = 0.04481881028.
           Maximum placement coordinate for object 6: 0.135 - 0.04481881028 = 0.09018118972.
           
           Collision check with object 4 (center 0,0, half-extent 0.0416):
           - Object 6 center_x must be > (0.0416 + 0.0448) = 0.0864.
           Collision check with object 5 (center 0.095, 0.095, half-extent 0.035):
           - Object 6 center_x must be far from 0.095 by (0.035 + 0.0448) = 0.0798.
           - Object 6 center_y must be far from 0.095 by (0.035 + 0.0448) = 0.0798.
           
           Given the tight constraints, I will prioritize placements around the available space, carefully checking the bounds and collisions. The center of object 6 cannot be at (0,0) or (0.095, 0.095).
           Let's try placing it in the negative x, negative y quadrant or the positive x, negative y quadrant, being mindful of the max coordinate 0.09018.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           I have successfully placed three objects:
           - ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with original extents 0.083x0.083. From previous failures, its effective half-extent is likely 0.08323090670539607 / 2 = 0.0416.
           - ID 5: (0, 0.0, 0.095, 0.095) with original extents 0.098x0.098. From previous failures, its effective half-extent is 0.035. Its AABB is (0.06, 0.06) to (0.13, 0.13).
           - ID 6: (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) with original extents 0.0896x0.0896. Its effective half-extent is 0.08963762056381164 / 2 = 0.0448. Its AABB is (-0.09-0.0448, -0.09-0.0448) to (-0.09+0.0448, -0.09+0.0448), which is (-0.1348, -0.1348) to (-0.0452, -0.0452). This fits within the surface limits of -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           The new object (ID 7) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0929x0.0929.
           Its effective half-extent is 0.09293867997822242 / 2 = 0.04646933998911121.
           Maximum placement coordinate for object 7: 0.135 - 0.04646933998911121 = 0.08853066001.
           
           Collision checks for Object 7 (half-extent 0.0465):
           - With Object 4 (center 0,0, half-extent 0.0416):
               - Center of Object 7 must be further than (0.0416 + 0.0465) = 0.0881 from (0,0).
           - With Object 5 (center 0.095, 0.095, half-extent 0.035):
               - Center of Object 7 must be further than (0.035 + 0.0465) = 0.0815 from (0.095, 0.095).
           - With Object 6 (center -0.09, -0.09, half-extent 0.0448):
               - Center of Object 7 must be further than (0.0448 + 0.0465) = 0.0913 from (-0.09, -0.09).
           
           This means object 7 cannot be placed at (0,0) or too close to it. It also means it cannot be placed in the positive quadrant close to (0.095, 0.095), and it cannot be placed in the negative quadrant close to (-0.09, -0.09).
           The available space is becoming quite constrained. Let's try placing object 7 in the positive x, negative y quadrant or other free areas. The maximum coordinate for object 7 is 0.0885.

Model:     The scene is a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           I have successfully placed four objects:
           - ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with effective half-extent ~0.0416. Its AABB is (-0.0416, -0.0416) to (0.0416, 0.0416).
           - ID 5: (0, 0.0, 0.095, 0.095) with effective half-extent ~0.035. Its AABB is (0.06, 0.06) to (0.13, 0.13).
           - ID 6: (0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.09) with effective half-extent ~0.0448. Its AABB is (-0.1348, -0.1348) to (-0.0452, -0.0452).
           - ID 7: (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08) with effective half-extent ~0.0465. Its AABB is (0.08-0.0465, -0.08-0.0465) to (0.08+0.0465, -0.08+0.0465), which is (0.0335, -0.1265) to (0.1265, -0.0335).
           
           The new object (ID 8) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0801x0.0801.
           Its effective half-extent is 0.08011567463891545 / 2 = 0.040057837319457724.
           Maximum placement coordinate for object 8: 0.135 - 0.040057837319457724 = 0.09494216268.
           
           Collision checks for Object 8 (half-extent ~0.0401):
           - With Object 4 (center 0,0, half-extent 0.0416):
               - Center of Object 8 must be further than (0.0416 + 0.0401) = 0.0817 from (0,0).
           - With Object 5 (center 0.095, 0.095, half-extent 0.035):
               - Center of Object 8 must be further than (0.035 + 0.0401) = 0.0751 from (0.095, 0.095).
           - With Object 6 (center -0.09, -0.09, half-extent 0.0448):
               - Center of Object 8 must be further than (0.0448 + 0.0401) = 0.0849 from (-0.09, -0.09).
           - With Object 7 (center 0.08, -0.08, half-extent 0.0465):
               - Center of Object 8 must be further than (0.0465 + 0.0401) = 0.0866 from (0.08, -0.08).
           
           The available space is getting smaller. I'll target the quadrants not heavily occupied, like the negative x, positive y quadrant, or along the axes where there might still be gaps. Max coordinate is 0.0949.
