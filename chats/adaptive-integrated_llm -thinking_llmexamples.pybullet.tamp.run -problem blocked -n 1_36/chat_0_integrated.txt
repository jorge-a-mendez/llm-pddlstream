User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.695, -0.327), (-4.61, -0.243)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.653, -0.285, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.786, 0.619).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem and Determining Unreachability**
           
           My primary goal is to determine a plan to satisfy the axiom `(new-axiom@0)`. This axiom states that an object, which I'll call `?green`, of type `v17` must be placed on object `v18`. Initially, I identified that the potential objects of type `v17` are `v8` and `v12`. I checked their initial poses and determined they are supported on `v11` and `v14`, respectively, meaning `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.
           
           Considering the stackability of `v8` and `v12` with `v18`, it initially appeared I could simply move one of them onto `v18`. I had considered a possible pick and place plan, thinking of moving `v8` from `v9` to a new position on `v18`. I was even ready to calculate this pose. However, I realized the constraints on the allowed actions were more strict than initially thought.
           
           Crucially, the only permitted action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The actions like `pick` and `place`, which would be necessary to achieve the desired state, are *not* explicitly listed as allowed action instances. The problem statement explicitly states that only the instances given can be used.
           
           Given the constraints of *only* a `move_base` action and the initial configuration, I deduced that there is no way to alter the initial state in a manner that would make `on(?green, v18)` true.  Since the allowed action does not affect the pose of objects, I've concluded that the `on(?green, v18)` goal is *unreachable*. Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy the goal, given the stated constraints and initial state.
