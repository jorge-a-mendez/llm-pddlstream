           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.695, -0.327), (-4.61, -0.243)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.653, -0.285, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.786, 0.619).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at the definition, this means I need to make both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true.  The `type` condition is straightforward, since both `v8` and `v12` satisfy `type(?t, v17)`. Let's focus on `v8` for now.
           
           To get `on(v8, v18)` to be true, I need two things: `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` (which is already true in the initial state with a pose I'll call `#o2`) and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Right now, `v8` is at pose `v9`. So, the high-level plan is to move `v8` from pose `v9` to pose `#o2`. This requires a `pick` action followed by a `place` action.
           
           For the `pick` action, the arm (`v4`) will pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9` using a grasp I'll call `#o1` and a base configuration `v3`, which I can use because it is `atbconf(v3)`.  The `kin` predicate is true as well. `pick` has preconditions that need to be true: `atpose(v8, v9)` (which is true), `handempty(v4)` (true), and some negative conditions related to approach and collision which I'm assuming are satisfied. `pick` will then give the robot `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` and take away `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           
           For the `place` action, the arm will place `v8` at pose `#o2` using the same grasp `#o1` and base configuration `v3`. The preconditions are:  `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` (from the `pick` action), `atbconf(v3)` (which is always true in the initial state), and some more negative conditions for approach and collision. This would give me `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           Now, I must choose the parameters for the actions.  The crucial choice is for `#o2`, the destination pose. It needs to be collision-free and stable on surface `v18`. I see that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, indicating `v8` *can* be placed on it, which means that any `*pose*` will work for any `*pose*`, so long as the placement is in the valid range of the `v18` AABB.
           
           The AABB of `v8` is `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))`. `v18`'s AABB is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The goal is `on(v8, v18)`, which implies  `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` must also be true. The AABBs don't overlap as is, but that's fine. We simply place v8 at an appropriate location within the volume defined by the AABB. So, I need to place `v8` such that  `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)` is in the bounds of `v18`.  Let's position `v8` such that its center is in the middle of `v18`, so I'll choose `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for `#o2`. I *think* that if it is `supported` then *any* `place` action to a location within the AABB, will suffice.
           
           The `kin` relation is satisfied and I assume that the `unsafepose` and `unsafeapproach` are satisfied. So, it should be safe to pick and place. With that, my full plan is:
           
           --Plan--:
           pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)
           place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)
           
)

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user correctly pointed out that I can't use `pick` and `place` here. Those actions aren't allowed, and that's a *major* problem.  Let's walk through this again, focusing only on that pesky `move_base` action.
           
           The goal is to get `v8` onto `v18`.  Given the initial state, I know that `v8` is a valid candidate for `?green` in the goal `on(?green, v18)`. That boils down to figuring out how to achieve `on(v8, v18)`.  My logic tells me that I need `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. Thankfully, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true! So, all I *really* need to do is make `atpose(v8, #o2)` true.
           
           However, currently, I have `atpose(v8, v9)` true.  To make the switch, I would *clearly* need to use a `pick` and `place` action. I would have to pick up `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) and place it at `#o2`.
           
           The problem? The *only* action allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move just changes the base pose of the robot and doesn't affect the pose of `v8` at all.  It's effectively a useless action in this context. It uses the `basemotion` axiom with a trajectory to "move" from `v3` to `v3`. It negates the `canmove()` axiom, which is also a problem.
           
           The `move_base` action is pointless! Since I can't manipulate the object poses of `v8` and `v18` with the allowed actions, and since I *need* to change `v8`'s pose, the goal is *unachievable*. Without `pick` and `place`, I'm stuck. The robot can't reach the goal. It's a fundamental issue of having the correct actions for the problem.
