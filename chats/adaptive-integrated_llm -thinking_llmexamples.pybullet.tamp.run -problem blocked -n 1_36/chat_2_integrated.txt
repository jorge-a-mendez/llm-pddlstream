User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v11: object

           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.695, -0.327), (-4.61, -0.243)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.653, -0.285, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.786, 0.619).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having a green object (`?green`) on a specific surface (`v18`).  I've got two candidate green objects: `v8` and `v12`.  Since I'm working with `v8`, let's focus on getting that object onto `v18`.  Right now, `v8` is at position `v9`, and the initial state already tells me it's supported by `#o2` *on* `v18`.  So, I need to get `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           Here's my plan: I'm using an arm (`v4`), which is currently in a handempty state, and the base is at position `v3`. First step is to use the move base action.
           
           1.  Since the move base and the pick & place actions use `#o3`, I'll start by making `#o3` equal to `v3` to save on cost.
           2.  Next, I'll `pick` `v8` from `v9` with `v4`.
           3.  Then, I'll `place` `v8` on `#o2` using `v4`.  Remember, `#o2` is the position on the `v18` surface.
           4. Lastly, I'll return the base to it's initial configuration.
           
           Now, for those continuous parameters:
           
           *   For `#o2` I'll have to assign the location. I estimate the proper location, ensuring `v8` has a collision-free and stable pose. The location will be at the center of the surface, with a standard height from the surface.
           *   For `#o3`, I will assign the value of base configuration which is provided in the initial state. Since no movement is necessary to place `v8`, I assign the current location as the base configuration.
           
           With that, I should be able to achieve the goal.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v28) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revisiting the Plan Due to an Encountered Precondition Failure**
           
           The initial plan failed because a precondition, `atbconf(v28)`, was not met. This was unexpected because `v28` wasn't explicitly defined or used in the original plan. However, a deeper look reveals that the system likely substituted a temporary variable for the actual base configuration, `#o3`.  This `#o3` is key because it represents the configuration needed for the robot to interact with the objects. The root of the error is the missing base configuration definition, which is why `atbconf(v28)` failed to satisfy the preconditions.
           
           The plan was:
           1.  **move_base**: `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  **pick**: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  **place**: `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           Since the robot currently is at `v3`, the plan needed `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to satisfy the precondition of `atbconf(#o3)` for the pick.
           
           The first step, `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` will take us to the base configuration, then the robot can pick `v8` from pose `v9`, place it at `#o2` on `v18`. 
           
           Crucially, `#o3` must be defined. I propose that `#o3` is equal to `v3` to minimize the cost of the move, therefore, at the beginning, I will ensure `#o3` is defined with the coordinates `(2.5 0.0 0.0)`.
           
           During each action, there is a check to ensure no collision has occurred.
           
           Given these considerations, the updated plan should work and satisfy the goals `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)`. The core issue was simply defining the necessary base configuration for the robot.
