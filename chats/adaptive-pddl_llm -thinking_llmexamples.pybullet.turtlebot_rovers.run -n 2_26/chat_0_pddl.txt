           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unattainable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a pretty specific set of conditions involving image and analysis receipt, alongside some location and free store checks. The initial state is quite friendly – my rovers (v12 and v14) are in place, the stores are free, and I've got a couple of cameras.  Sounds straightforward, right?
           
           The crux of this problem lies in what's *not* allowed. I was handed a list of 'valid action instances', which seems straightforward enough. However, the instructions are crystal clear: only *those* action instances are allowed. This list contains specific instances of 'move' and 'drop_rock' actions. No problem, these actions are usually helpful when setting conditions.
           
           The hitch? The goal demands `receivedimage` (images received) and `receivedanalysis` (analysis received) conditions. These are achieved *exclusively* through the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. And, guess what? *Neither* of these action types appears in my allowed list.
           
           I've been poring over the problem, checking for any hidden assumptions or ways to wiggle around this restriction. There's just no way to get those crucial actions permitted.  I was carefully examining if the continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` were implicit values, which is typical for PDDL problems where continuous parameters are often tied to discrete configurations. Unfortunately, this does not help. Given the clear instructions, the goal is simply unattainable. It's a classic case of the problem being set up to be unsolvable given the restrictions imposed on the possible actions.
