User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene consists of a central square obstacle (0) and a surrounding boundary (1-4). There's also a vertical obstacle (5) in the middle. Obstacles 6 through 20 are smaller, scattered obstacles. My strategy is to prioritize positions further away from the obstacles, especially those near the target. I will try to generate positions around the target point at a distance, preferring open areas. I will aim for diversity by varying the angles around the target and the distance, keeping in mind the 4-unit max range. I will also make sure the positions are within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5].
