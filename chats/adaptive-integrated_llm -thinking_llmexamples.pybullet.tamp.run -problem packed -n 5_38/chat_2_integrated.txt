           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.208, -0.413, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.93, -0.369).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.033, 0.499), (0.061, 0.592)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.192, 0.288), (-0.111, 0.37)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.074, -0.452), (0.025, -0.353)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.016, -0.307), (0.069, -0.223)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.257, -0.463), (-0.158, -0.364)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.014, 0.546, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.228, 0.974).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.151, 0.329, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.996).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.024, -0.402, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.41, 0.912).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.026, -0.265, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.786, 0.618).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.** The goal is to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a surface, v20.  They all start on another surface, v11, supported by their individual poses, `atpose`. I need to figure out a plan using the robot's available actions, specifically its two arms, `v4` and `v6`, which can pick and place objects.  My primary considerations are:
           
           1.  **Motion Planning**: I need to define the motions.  The robot base is currently at `v3`, but the goal involves placing items on `v20`.  The base needs to be positioned near the target surface, and I should make sure that the base is located close to where I intend the arm to manipulate objects. It appears to make sense to get the base near the `v20` surface before pick/place operations.  This base config needs to be given to the pick/place actions and should be calculated for the optimal placement. The base is also used for the `move_base` action, that is, for moving the robot base. I need to figure out if it makes sense to precompute the base config, `v3` to a new base config denoted as `#o3`.
           2.  **Object Manipulation**: Each object needs to be picked from its initial location, moved, and placed onto `v20`. I'll need to figure out *where* on `v20` to place them. This requires me to generate 5 distinct target poses on `v20`, each safe for the corresponding object, without collisions. I need to make sure the poses are collision free.
           3.  **Action Sequence**:  Since I have a well defined goal and preconditions for actions, I need to define the sequence of `pick` and `place` actions, including the associated base and arm configurations/trajectories that would get me there.
           
           Now, to the details.
           
           *   **Move Base**:  I'll need to use `move_base` to position the robot's base.  The base starts at `v3`. I need to define a target base configuration, `#o3`, likely near the surface `v20`, for a smooth pick and place action, and I assume it would be needed so that the pick and place actions make the motion simpler to plan. If I can move the arm without changing the base config, I won't need `move_base`. But moving the base to the target location for manipulation seems necessary. A good starting target position looks like `(-0.5, 0.0, 0.0)` for the base configuration (`#o3`), which puts it centrally near the target area on `v20`.
           
           *   **Pick and Place**: I'll pick each object with `v4`, assuming it's `handempty`, and then place them on `v20`. The poses I need to compute are `#o2`. This is a crucial step. I'll need a set of 5 distinct `#o2` values (poses) for placing each of my objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18).  Given the AABB of the v20 surface, which is centered at (0,0) and the dimensions are 0.27m by 0.27m, I will need a space that is a bit less than the 0.27m in x and y because I need to leave some space. I can use the objects' dimension information for the spacing. A simple grid pattern (e.g. 0.07m spacing) would work to place all objects on the tabletop.
           
           *   **Continuous Parameters**: I'll calculate the poses for placing each object on `v20`. The placement should be collision-free.  So, I need to define 5 target poses on v20, considering their AABBs.
           
           The actions should be in sequence: `move_base`, then `pick` followed by `place` 5 times, each for each object. Each time I call `move_base`, I consume `canmove()`, which the pick/place actions restore. In general, all these must be collision-free.
           
           The poses are generated by a collision-free planner (I provide values, which are passed as inputs in this format).
           Here are the continuous values. I must specify the poses for `#o2`:
           - **For v8**: `(-0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)` (0.07m from center)
           - **For v12**: `(0.0, 0.07,
