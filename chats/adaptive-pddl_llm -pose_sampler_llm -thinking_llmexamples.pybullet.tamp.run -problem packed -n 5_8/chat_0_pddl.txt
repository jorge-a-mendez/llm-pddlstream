(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Generating Stable Object Placements**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, dimensions approximately 0.0722 x 0.0722) on a surface (Surface 0, an AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates (object's AABB center). For stability, the object must be fully within the surface and not collide with any existing objects (which there are none).
           
           I recognized the object is almost a perfect square, significantly simplifying the rotation analysis.  When rotated, an object's AABB dimensions change: width_prime = width * abs(cos(theta)) + height * abs(sin(theta)), height_prime = width * abs(sin(theta)) + height * abs(cos(theta)). Since it's nearly square,  the rotated dimensions don't change much for different `theta`. For the most restrictive bound on placement positions, I needed to check what happens at pi/4. I determined the minimum distance needed from the border is ~0.051. I should check the absolute maximum of the rotated object size to be more precise: the diagonal of a box `sqrt(w^2 + h^2)`.
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'm systematically varying  `x`, `y`, and `theta`. Since the object's square shape minimizes the impact of rotation, I decided to use a grid pattern with varying rotation angles. I've chosen a valid `x` range and a `y` range that ensures placements will always be stable for `theta`. I chose `thetas` 0 and pi/2 to have different object orientations while ensuring the bounding box is within the surface. The coordinates should be: 5 positions on `x` and 5 positions on `y`, and 2 rotations.
           
           I will iterate through all combinations of x, y, and theta, checking that these combinations satisfy the requirements to be within the valid bounds that I calculated.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a clear plan for placing object 4 safely on surface 0. My goal is to generate 50 collision-free and stable placements. I know object 6 is already placed at (-0.08, -0.08), and I need to avoid any overlap. I'm using the surface bounds of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135) as my guide.
           
           First, I calculated the safe zone for object 4. Considering its dimensions of (0.08049, 0.08050), I found its maximum half-dimension. Using that, the valid center must be within [-0.078, 0.078]. To play it safe, I'll restrict it even more to [-0.07, 0.07].
           
           Next, I determined object 6's AABB. I know its dimensions are close to a square (0.0722). Object 6's AABB extends approximately from [-0.116, -0.044] in both the X and Y directions.
           
           Now, the placement strategy. I'm going to generate positions with the center coordinates and apply different rotations:
           
           1.  **Generate Positions:** I will use the position coordinates that are safe with 4 different rotations (0, pi/2, pi/4, 3\*pi/4).
           2.  I will take a grid like `[-0.07, -0.035, 0, 0.035, 0.07]` for X and Y coordinate, giving us a grid of possible position
           3.  I have set constraints to prevent the object 4 to collide with the object 6 to not overlap
           4.  First, the safe positions are when at least either x or y is great than the value of `0`.
           5.  Second, by keeping that value in account, I will calculate the range for object 4, by accounting it's dimension in given grid, and check collision to prevent it,
           6.  By this strategy I have found a list of 51 positions, where first 50 positions can be safe for given condition.
           
           Finally, The final set will be from 15\*3 (45) + 6\*1 (6) = 51 which satisfy the required constraints.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a new, square object (ID: 5) on surface 0.  I've got a surface that's -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y.  The object's dimensions are roughly 0.094 by 0.094.  I have to avoid two existing objects: object 6 at (-0.08, -0.08) and object 4 at (0, -0.07).
           
           **Step 1:  Finding a Stable Region**
           
           First, I need to figure out where I can even *put* this object.  The object can rotate, so I need to account for that. I worked out the AABB of the object given any rotation.  I found the AABB max dimensions at a 45-degree angle. Half-extent for all rotations is ~0.0665.
           
           This means I can't put the object's center anywhere closer than 0.0665 from the edge of the surface.  This results in a stable placement region for the center of the object of roughly [-0.0685, 0.0685] in both x and y.
           
           To make things easier for myself, I'll use a grid of points within this region: [-0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06] in both x and y.
           
           **Step 2:  Avoiding Collisions**
           
           The important part is making sure I don't collide with objects already placed on the surface. Object 6 and Object 4 are the ones to avoid. I calculated the AABB of both objects, I get R6 x range [-0.1161, -0.0439] y range [-0.1161, -0.0439], object R4 x range is [-0.0402, 0.0402], y range is [-0.1102, -0.0298]
           
           Now, for each point on the grid, I'll check if the AABB of object 5, at any rotation, collides with these existing objects. I need the placement to be safe for all rotations.
           
           **Step 3: Finding Safe Placements**
           
           I am using a function to check if the AABB of my new object would intersect. Now for each point and for each rotation (0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4), I'll check if it collides. If it doesn't collide, I'll keep the placement, and I'll keep doing it until I find 50 safe placements.
           
           A couple of checks show that collision points are likely, so this should work.  I am confident that I can use the existing function to work through the placement region and verify the placement for stability.
           
           I've now checked and validated all the collision zones, calculations and code. It is now good to iterate and obtain the result.
