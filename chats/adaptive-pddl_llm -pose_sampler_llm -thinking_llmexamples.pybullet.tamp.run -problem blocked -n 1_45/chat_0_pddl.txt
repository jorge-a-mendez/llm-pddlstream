(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0.  I know the object's dimensions (about 0.095 x 0.095) and the surface's definition.  A stable placement means the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) remains *within* the surface's AABB, even after rotation. Since the object is nearly square, the impact of rotation will be minimal.
           
           **Key Considerations**
           
           *   **Rotation:** I'm going to leverage the object's shape. Given its almost square footprint, I expect very small bounding box variations as the object is rotated. Rather than calculating exact bounding box dimensions for every angle, I will pick two extreme angles: `0` and `pi/4` and use the bounding box dimensions from those for placements. `theta = 0` will use W=H=~0.095. At `theta=pi/4`, it’ll be a little larger, maybe ~0.135x0.135.
           *   **Surface Constraints:** I will use surface 0 AABB from (4.2,-0.6) to (4.8,0).
           *   **AABB vs. Placement Stability:** Stability is crucial. The object's AABB must stay within the surface's boundaries. I'll need to calculate the bounding box based on the rotation and ensure the center coordinates stay within the bounds for each rotation angle.
           
           **My Plan**
           
           I'm making a two-phase strategy:
           
           1.  **Rotation Setup:**  I'll start with the object at angle `theta=0`. Then I will increase angle to `theta=pi/4`.
           2.  **Generating Placements using an `x,y` grid for each rotation:**
               *   **theta=0 (w=0.095):** I can place the object within `4.247 <= x <= 4.752` and `-0.552 <= y <= -0.047`.  I will put 6 x 6= 36 placements in a grid for theta=0.
               *   **theta=pi/4 (W=0.135):** I can place the object within `4.267 <= x <= 4.732` and `-0.532 <= y <= -0.067`. I will put 4 x 4 = 16 placements.
           
           *   Finally, I need exactly 50 placements. I have 36+16=52, so I can just take the first 50.
           
           **Calculations and Execution**
           
           I calculated the bounding box parameters and grid dimensions.
           `theta=0, (W,H)= (0.095, 0.095) => range [4.2477, 4.7522]` , range `[-0.5522, -0.0477]` , 6x6 grid.
           `theta=pi/4, (W,H)= (0.135, 0.135) => range [4.2675, 4.7325]` , range `[-0.5325, -0.0675]` , 4x4 grid.
           
           This strategy should yield 50 stable placements.
