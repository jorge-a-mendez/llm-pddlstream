           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis and Conclusion**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking process. My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` domain. This axiom requires an object of a specific type to be "on" another object. In this case, I need an object of type `v17` to be on `v18`. Initially, I identified `v8` and `v12` as objects that have the correct type.
           
           I then explored the "on" relation. An object is "on" another if it's both supported by that object *and* at a particular pose. I examined the initial state and noticed that none of the objects are currently on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was to use the `pick` and `place` actions to move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. I formulated a plan for moving `v8`, including the necessary preconditions and effects of these actions. I considered the available actions – `pick`, `place`, `move_base`, `clean`, and `cook`. I discarded `clean` and `cook` because they don't seem applicable and cannot move the objects. I also discarded `move_base` as it only affects base configuration.
           
           I realized that `pick` and `place` are necessary and began constructing a plan. I needed `atpose(v8, #o2)` such that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. In the initial state, the support relation is given, and for `v8` to be on `v18`, I must make it have the needed `atpose`.
           
           However, here's where my logic hit a snag. The crucial piece of information is the "list of valid action instances." The given list contains only one item: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This completely changes the game. This means I'm *only* allowed to execute this one `move_base` instance. Given this, it is now impossible to move any object. I cannot move an object to `v18` with the `move_base`.
           
           Therefore, since I cannot perform `pick` and `place`, and no objects of type `v17` are initially on `v18`, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given constraints.
