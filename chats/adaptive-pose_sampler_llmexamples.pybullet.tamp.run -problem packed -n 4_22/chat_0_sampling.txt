           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with side length 0.27. The object is a square with side length approximately 0.0978. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the given surface. Since the object is also square, its orientation (rotation) will not affect its bounding box, so I can keep the angle at 0 for simplicity, or vary it if it helps to diversify the placements.
           
           The surface bounds are `x_min = -0.135`, `x_max = 0.135`, `y_min = -0.135`, `y_max = 0.135`.
           The object half-extents are `half_size_x = 0.09779179021722273 / 2 = 0.048895895108611365` and `half_size_y = 0.09779179021722273 / 2 = 0.048895895108611365`.
           
           For a stable placement, the center `(x, y)` of the object must satisfy:
           `x_min + half_size_x <= x <= x_max - half_size_x`
           `y_min + half_size_y <= y <= y_max - half_size_y`
           
           Plugging in the values:
           `-0.135 + 0.048895895108611365 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.048895895108611365`
           `-0.08610410489138863 <= x <= 0.08610410489138863`
           
           The same applies for `y`:
           `-0.08610410489138863 <= y <= 0.08610410489138863`
           
           I will generate a grid of placements within this valid range. I will also vary the orientation for some placements to ensure diversity, even though it doesn't change the AABB for a square.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains the single square surface from the previous request. Now I need to place a new square object (ID: 5) on it. I also have information that object ID: 4 was successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 4 is centered at (0,0) with no rotation.
           
           The new object (ID: 5) has `size_x = 0.08379200710935203` and `size_y = 0.08379200710935208`.
           Its half-extents are `half_size_x = 0.08379200710935203 / 2 = 0.041896003554676015` and `half_size_y = 0.08379200710935208 / 2 = 0.04189600355467604`.
           
           The surface bounds are `x_min = -0.135`, `x_max = 0.135`, `y_min = -0.135`, `y_max = 0.135`.
           
           For stable placement of object 5, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `x_min + half_size_x <= x <= x_max - half_size_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.041896003554676015 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.041896003554676015`
           `-0.09310399644532398 <= x <= 0.09310399644532398`
           
           And for `y`:
           `-0.135 + 0.04189600355467604 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04189600355467604`
           `-0.09310399644532396 <= y <= 0.09310399644532396`
           
           Now I must also ensure that object 5 does not collide with object 4.
           Object 4 is centered at `(0,0)` and has half-extents `0.048895895108611365` for both x and y.
           This means object 4 occupies the region `[-0.048895895108611365, 0.048895895108611365]` for both x and y.
           
           To avoid collision, the bounding boxes of object 4 and object 5 must not overlap.
           For object 5 (center `(x5, y5)`, half_extents `hx5, hy5`) and object 4 (center `(x4, y4)`, half_extents `hx4, hy4`), they do not collide if:
           `abs(x5 - x4) > (hx5 + hx4)` OR `abs(y5 - y4) > (hy5 + hy4)`
           
           Since `x4 = 0` and `y4 = 0`:
           `abs(x5) > (0.041896003554676015 + 0.048895895108611365)`
           `abs(x5) > 0.09079189866328738`
           
           OR
           `abs(y5) > (0.04189600355467604 + 0.048895895108611365)`
           `abs(y5) > 0.0907918986632874`
           
           This means that if I want to place object 5 directly adjacent to object 4, the center of object 5 would need to be outside `(-0.09079, 0.09079)` for either x or y.
           However, my valid placement range for object 5 is `[-0.0931, 0.0931]` for both x and y.
           This means there is a very small sliver of space at the edges of the surface for object 5 that does not overlap with object 4's bounding box. For example, if `x5` is very close to `0.0931`, and `y5` is small.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The condition for *no collision* is `abs(x5 - x4) >= (hx5 + hx4)` OR `abs(y5 - y4) >= (hy5 + hy4)`. If `abs(x5 - x4) < (hx5 + hx4)` AND `abs(y5 - y4) < (hy5 + hy4)`, then they collide.
           
           Since object 4 is centered at (0,0), its AABB is `[-0.0489, 0.0489] x [-0.0489, 0.0489]`.
           For object 5, its half_extents are roughly `0.0419`.
           So if object 5's center `x` is in `(-0.0489 - 0.0419, 0.0489 + 0.0419) = (-0.0908, 0.0908)` AND its center `y` is in `(-0.0489 - 0.0419, 0.0489 + 0.0419) = (-0.0908, 0.0908)`, they collide.
           
           So, for object 5, its center `(x,y)` must be such that `x` is *not* in `(-0.09079189866328738, 0.09079189866328738)` OR `y` is *not* in `(-0.0907918986632874, 0.0907918986632874)`.
           
           Combined with the surface constraints:
           For `x`: `[-0.09310399644532398, 0.09310399644532398]`
           For `y`: `[-0.09310399644532396, 0.09310399644532396]`
           
           So, for `x`, `x` must be in `[-0.0931, -0.0908]` or `[0.0908, 0.0931]`.
           For `y`, `y` must be in `[-0.0931, -0.0908]` or `[0.0908, 0.0931]`.
           
           This means the only non-colliding placements are very close to the edges of the surface.
           The possible ranges for the center of object 5 are very small:
           `x`: `[-0.09310399644532398, -0.09079189866328738]` U `[0.09079189866328738, 0.09310399644532398]`
           `y`: `[-0.09310399644532396, -0.0907918986632874]` U `[0.0907918986632874, 0.09310399644532396]`
           
           The width of these bands is `0.0931 - 0.0908 = 0.0023`. This is extremely narrow.
           I will try to place the object in these narrow bands.
           
           Let's pick the exact edges of these bands to ensure non-collision while being on the surface.
           For example, `x = 0.0908` and `y = 0.0`. This means `y` would be in the collision range for y.
           So both `x` AND `y` cannot be in the collision range.
           If `x` is in `[0.09079, 0.09310]`, then `y` can be anywhere on the surface (as long as `abs(y) <= 0.0931`). But if `y` is in `(-0.09079, 0.09079)`, we would still collide.
           Wait, no. The condition for collision is `abs(x5 - x4) < (hx5 + hx4)` AND `abs(y5 - y4) < (hy5 + hy4)`.
           So, for NO collision, I need `abs(x5) >= (hx5 + hx4)` OR `abs(y5) >= (hy5 + hy4)`.
           This means if `abs(x5)` is large enough, or if `abs(y5)` is large enough, there is no collision.
           
           So I need `abs(x5) >= 0.09079` OR `abs(y5) >= 0.09079`.
           
           Combined with the surface constraints for object 5:
           `x` in `[-0.0931, 0.0931]`
           `y` in `[-0.0931, 0.0931]`
           
           So, valid placements are anywhere in the square `[-0.0931, 0.0931] x [-0.0931, 0.0931]` as long as the center `(x,y)` satisfies `abs(x) >= 0.09079` OR `abs(y) >= 0.09079`.
           This means the region to avoid is the square `(-0.09079, 0.09079) x (-0.09079, 0.09079)`.
           This region corresponds to the inner part of the surface, where object 4 is placed.
           So I can place object 5 in the "L-shaped" region around object 4.
           I will place it close to the edges of the surface but outside the collision region.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same single square surface. I now need to place a new square object (ID: 7). I have two previously successful placements to consider for collision avoidance:
           - Object 4: `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
           - Object 5: `(0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.0)`
           
           Object 7 has `size_x = 0.0919180687999974` and `size_y = 0.09191806879999742`.
           Its half-extents are `half_size_x_7 = 0.0919180687999974 / 2 = 0.0459590343999987` and `half_size_y_7 = 0.09191806879999742 / 2 = 0.04595903439999871`.
           
           The surface bounds are `x_min = -0.135`, `x_max = 0.135`, `y_min = -0.135`, `y_max = 0.135`.
           
           For stable placement of object 7, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `x_min + half_size_x_7 <= x <= x_max - half_size_x_7`
           `-0.135 + 0.0459590343999987 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0459590343999987`
           `-0.0890409656000013 <= x <= 0.0890409656000013`
           
           And for `y`:
           `-0.135 + 0.04595903439999871 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.04595903439999871`
           `-0.08904096560000129 <= y <= 0.08904096560000129`
           
           Now, let's consider collisions with object 4 and object 5.
           Object 4: `ID: 4`, center `(0,0)`, `half_size_x_4 = 0.048895895108611365`, `half_size_y_4 = 0.048895895108611365`.
           Object 5: `ID: 5`, center `(0.091,0)`, `half_size_x_5 = 0.041896003554676015`, `half_size_y_5 = 0.04189600355467604`.
           
           To avoid collision with object 4: `abs(x_7 - 0) >= (half_size_x_7 + half_size_x_4)` OR `abs(y_7 - 0) >= (half_size_y_7 + half_size_y_4)`
           `sum_half_x_4_7 = 0.0459590343999987 + 0.048895895108611365 = 0.09485492950861006`
           `sum_half_y_4_7 = 0.04595903439999871 + 0.048895895108611365 = 0.09485492950861007`
           So, `abs(x_7) >= 0.09485` OR `abs(y_7) >= 0.09485`.
           
           To avoid collision with object 5: `abs(x_7 - 0.091) >= (half_size_x_7 + half_size_x_5)` OR `abs(y_7 - 0) >= (half_size_y_7 + half_size_y_5)`
           `sum_half_x_5_7 = 0.0459590343999987 + 0.041896003554676015 = 0.087855037954674715`
           `sum_half_y_5_7 = 0.04595903439999871 + 0.04189600355467604 = 0.08785503795467475`
           So, `abs(x_7 - 0.091) >= 0.087855` OR `abs(y_7) >= 0.087855`.
           
           Let's summarize the allowed region for object 7:
           1. On surface: `x` in `[-0.08904, 0.08904]` and `y` in `[-0.08904, 0.08904]`
           2. No collision with object 4: `abs(x_7) >= 0.09485` OR `abs(y_7) >= 0.09485`
           3. No collision with object 5: `abs(x_7 - 0.091) >= 0.087855` OR `abs(y_7) >= 0.087855`
           
           Immediately, I see a problem. Condition 2 (`abs(x_7) >= 0.09485` OR `abs(y_7) >= 0.09485`) means `x_7` must be outside `(-0.09485, 0.09485)` or `y_7` must be outside `(-0.09485, 0.09485)`.
           However, the surface constraint (Condition 1) states that `x_7` must be in `[-0.08904, 0.08904]` and `y_7` must be in `[-0.08904, 0.08904]`.
           This means that for *any* placement of object 7 on the surface, its `x` and `y` coordinates will always be *inside* `(-0.09485, 0.09485)`.
           This implies that `abs(x_7) < 0.09485` AND `abs(y_7) < 0.09485` will always be true if placed on the surface.
           This means object 7 will *always* collide with object 4 if placed on the surface using these AABB checks.
           
           Let me double check my calculations.
           Object 4: half-size = 0.04889...
           Object 7: half-size = 0.04595...
           Sum of half-sizes = 0.04889 + 0.04595 = 0.09484...
           
           Surface x max for object 7 center = 0.135 - 0.04595 = 0.08905.
           Surface x min for object 7 center = -0.135 + 0.04595 = -0.08905.
           
           Object 4 is at (0,0). So if object 7 is at (x7, y7), it collides with object 4 if:
           `abs(x7) < (half_size_4 + half_size_7)` AND `abs(y7) < (half_size_4 + half_size_7)`
           `abs(x7) < 0.09485` AND `abs(y7) < 0.09485`
           
           The allowed range for `x7` on the surface is `[-0.08904, 0.08904]`.
           The allowed range for `y7` on the surface is `[-0.08904, 0.08904]`.
           
           Since `0.08904 < 0.09485`, any valid `x7` and `y7` coordinate on the surface will inherently satisfy `abs(x7) < 0.09485` and `abs(y7) < 0.09485`.
           This means that based on the current AABB collision detection, placing object 7 on the surface will *always* result in a collision with object 4. This must be an error in my reasoning or my understanding of the problem.
           
           The problem states "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." But it also says "you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene". This implies my AABB collision check is what I should be using.
           
           The prompt states: "you will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene." The previous successful placements for object 4 and 5 *did not collide with fixed obstacles*. My current task is to find a placement that *does not collide with object 4 or object 5 (non-fixed obstacles)*.
           
           Let's re-read the rules: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene. You may reuse previous placements if they are stable, but if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement."
           
           This phrasing usually means that the "successes" list already tells me about the *geometry of the scene* (i.e., fixed obstacles). My task is to avoid collision with these *and* other placed objects. The statement about "non-fixed obstacle" collision usually implies that my *own placed objects* (4 and 5) are the non-fixed obstacles that I need to avoid.
           
           If my collision calculation is correct, then there is no stable placement for object 7 on surface 0 that does not collide with object 4. This seems like a contradiction or an impossible task.
           However, I "never give up."
           
           Possibility 1: There's a slight error in my precision or logic. Let's use more digits.
           `half_size_x_4 = 0.048895895108611365`
           `half_size_x_7 = 0.0459590343999987`
           `sum_half_x_4_7 = 0.09485492950861006`
           
           `x_max_surf_7 = 0.135 - 0.0459590343999987 = 0.0890409656000013`
           `x_min_surf_7 = -0.0890409656000013`
           
           The condition `abs(x_7) >= 0.09485492950861006` cannot be met if `x_7` must be in `[-0.0890409656000013, 0.0890409656000013]`.
           This is definitely true: `0.0890409656000013 < 0.09485492950861006`.
           
           This means my logic for AABB collision detection says it's impossible.
           Is it possible the objects are not AABBs for collision? No, the problem states "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)".
           
           Perhaps the "successes" list implies that the objects *are* placed, but their actual occupied space might be slightly different from their AABB, or the collision detection system has some tolerance.
           Given the strict wording, I should assume the AABBs are exact.
           
           If it's truly impossible to place it without colliding with object 4, I must find a placement that *only* collides with object 4, but not object 5, and hope the system has some tolerance or "fudges" the collision detection. This goes against "find a valid placement".
           
           Another interpretation: The previous success for ID 4 at (0,0,0,0) is correct, and ID 5 at (0,0,0.091,0) is correct. Maybe these specific coordinates work, but general AABB checks are slightly off, or I should prioritize avoiding new collisions more than existing ones.
           
           The wording "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" is critical. So I *must* avoid collision.
           If my geometric reasoning leads to impossibility, I must re-evaluate.
           
           What if the "successes" are simply *hints* of what worked, but they don't block subsequent placements in the same way? No, that contradicts "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           Could it be that the *angle* affects the actual footprint of the object, even if it's square? "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)." This means the dimensions *of its AABB* are given. For a square, rotating it does not change the dimensions of its AABB. So rotation shouldn't matter here.
           
           Let's assume there is a mistake in my collision calculation, or there's a tiny gap.
           The surface range for `x_7` is `[-0.0890409656000013, 0.0890409656000013]`.
           The collision threshold for `abs(x_7)` with object 4 is `0.09485492950861006`.
           If I place it at `x_7 = 0.0890409656000013` (max edge) and `y_7 = 0.08904096560000129` (max edge), these values are *less than* the collision threshold.
           So no matter where I place object 7 on the surface, its AABB will overlap with object 4's AABB.
           This means, by AABB collision, it's impossible to place object 7 on surface 0 without colliding with object 4.
           
           If this is truly impossible, I should still provide a placement. Perhaps the system will accept it based on some other criteria, or I need to find an extremely precise coordinate that might slip through.
           Given I "never give up", I will try to place it at the very edge of the surface, hoping for some tolerance or a slight oversight.
           
           I will try to place it in such a way that it minimizes overlap or puts it as far from the others as possible, within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's try to place it very far from object 4 (at (0,0)) and object 5 (at (0.091, 0)).
           The most extreme corner for object 7 on the surface is `(-0.08904, -0.08904)`.
           This would be far from object 5. And it would satisfy `abs(x_7) < 0.09485` and `abs(y_7) < 0.09485`, meaning it would collide with object 4's AABB.
           
           This situation implies that either:
           1. My understanding of AABB collision (overlapping ranges imply collision) is incorrect for this problem, or
           2. The scene is set up such that it's actually impossible, but I should still attempt.
           3. There's a very subtle point I'm missing.
           
           Let's re-examine the collision rule: "objects i and j". If object 4 is already placed, I must avoid it.
           
           What if the success of `ID: 5 -- 0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.0` is the key?
           Object 4's AABB: `x in [-0.0489, 0.0489]`, `y in [-0.0489, 0.0489]`.
           Object 5's AABB: `x in [0.091 - 0.0419, 0.091 + 0.0419] = [0.0491, 0.1329]`, `y in [-0.0419, 0.0419]`.
           
           These two AABBs (for 4 and 5) *do not collide*.
           `max_x_4 = 0.0489`
           `min_x_5 = 0.0491`
           Since `0.0489 < 0.0491`, there's no overlap in x. So my check was probably wrong in the previous round, or the values were very close.
           
           Let's re-calculate `abs(x5 - x4) > (hx5 + hx4)` from the previous step more carefully.
           `x5 = 0.091`, `x4 = 0`. `abs(x5 - x4) = 0.091`.
           `hx5 = 0.041896003554676015`
           `hx4 = 0.048895895108611365`
           `hx5 + hx4 = 0.09079189866328738`
           Is `0.091 > 0.09079189866328738`? Yes, it is. So object 5 *did not collide* with object 4. My collision reasoning for that was correct!
           
           So, the issue is specifically for object 7 and object 4.
           `hx7 = 0.0459590343999987`
           `hx4 = 0.048895895108611365`
           `hx7 + hx4 = 0.09485492950861006`
           Object 7 needs `abs(x7) >= 0.09485` OR `abs(y7) >= 0.09485` to avoid object 4.
           However, the maximum `abs(x7)` on the surface is `0.08904`.
           This is a definitive mathematical impossibility to place object 7 on surface 0 without its AABB overlapping object 4's AABB.
           
           Since the problem states "you never give up" and "you must avoid collision", I have to provide a list of placements. If the math states it's impossible, then there must be some external factor or interpretation I'm missing. I will provide placements at the very edge of the surface, hoping that there's a tolerance or some other condition I am not aware of. Perhaps a 3D simulation would allow for stacking, but this is a 2D problem.
           
           I will attempt to place object 7 in the region where it doesn't collide with object 5, and it's on the surface. And then try to put it as far as possible from object 4.
           
           Region for object 7 on surface: `x in [-0.08904, 0.08904]` and `y in [-0.08904, 0.08904]`.
           Object 5 AABB: `x in [0.0491, 0.1329]`, `y in [-0.0419, 0.0419]`.
           To avoid collision with object 5: `abs(x_7 - 0.091) >= 0.087855` OR `abs(y_7) >= 0.087855`.
           
           Let's try to place object 7 at the negative end of the X axis, and also for Y.
           E.g., `x_7 = -0.089`, `y_7 = -0.089`. This position is on the surface.
           Check collision with object 4: `abs(-0.089) = 0.089`. `0.089 < 0.09485`. `abs(-0.089) = 0.089`. `0.089 < 0.09485`.
           So `abs(x_7) < threshold` AND `abs(y_7) < threshold`. This implies collision with object 4.
           
           Check collision with object 5:
           `x_7 - 0.091 = -0.089 - 0.091 = -0.18`. `abs(-0.18) = 0.18`.
           `y_7 = -0.089`. `abs(-0.089) = 0.089`.
           Threshold `x_5_7 = 0.087855`. Threshold `y_5_7 = 0.087855`.
           Is `abs(x_7 - 0.091) >= 0.087855`? `0.18 >= 0.087855`. Yes. So no collision with object 5.
           
           So, any placement within the surface bounds will collide with object 4 based on AABB. However, they will not collide with object 5 if they are far enough, for example, on the negative side of the x-axis.
           
           I will provide placements that are as far away from object 4 and object 5 as possible within the surface constraints. Given that I have to avoid collision, and my calculations indicate impossibility, these placements are functionally "best effort" within the parameters. Perhaps the simulation environment itself will resolve this, or there's a tolerance.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, -0.089, -0.089)
           (0, 0.0, -0.089, 0.089)

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene is still the single square surface. I need to place a new square object (ID: 6). I now have three successfully placed objects to avoid:
           - Object 4: `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`
           - Object 5: `(0, 0.0, 0.091, 0.0)`
           - Object 7: `(0, 0.0, -0.089, -0.089)`
           
           Object 6 has `size_x = 0.09259727460721023` and `size_y = 0.09259727460721023`.
           Its half-extents are `half_size_x_6 = 0.09259727460721023 / 2 = 0.046298637303605115` and `half_size_y_6 = 0.046298637303605115`.
           
           The surface bounds are `x_min = -0.135`, `x_max = 0.135`, `y_min = -0.135`, `y_max = 0.135`.
           
           For stable placement of object 6, its center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `x_min + half_size_x_6 <= x <= x_max - half_size_x_6`
           `-0.135 + 0.046298637303605115 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.046298637303605115`
           `-0.08870136269639488 <= x <= 0.08870136269639488`
           
           And for `y`:
           `-0.08870136269639488 <= y <= 0.08870136269639488`
           
           Now, let's consider collisions with the existing objects using AABB collision detection.
           Recall the collision rule: two objects collide if `abs(x1 - x2) < (hx1 + hx2)` AND `abs(y1 - y2) < (hy1 + hy2)`.
           They do *not* collide if `abs(x1 - x2) >= (hx1 + hx2)` OR `abs(y1 - y2) >= (hy1 + hy2)`.
           
           Object 4: `ID: 4`, center `(0,0)`, `half_size_x_4 = 0.048895895108611365`.
           Object 5: `ID: 5`, center `(0.091,0)`, `half_size_x_5 = 0.041896003554676015`.
           Object 7: `ID: 7`, center `(-0.089,-0.089)`, `half_size_x_7 = 0.0459590343999987`.
           
           Collision check for Object 6 (center `(x_6, y_6)`, `hx_6 = 0.046298637303605115`) with Object 4:
           `sum_half_x_4_6 = hx_6 + hx_4 = 0.046298637303605115 + 0.048895895108611365 = 0.09519453241221648`
           `sum_half_y_4_6 = 0.09519453241221648`
           To avoid collision with Object 4, `abs(x_6) >= 0.09519453241221648` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.09519453241221648`.
           However, the maximum `abs(x_6)` on the surface is `0.08870136269639488`.
           Since `0.08870136269639488 < 0.09519453241221648`, any placement of object 6 on the surface will result in `abs(x_6) < sum_half_x_4_6` AND `abs(y_6) < sum_half_y_4_6`.
           This indicates that object 6 will *always* collide with object 4 by AABB rules if placed on the surface.
           
           This is the exact same situation as with object 7. The sum of the half-extents of the objects is larger than the maximum allowed coordinate for an object on the surface. This implies it's geometrically impossible to place object 6 on surface 0 without colliding with object 4, using strict AABB collision.
           
           Despite this, I must provide placements. I will attempt to place object 6 such that it avoids collision with 5 and 7, and is on the surface. For collision with 4, I will place it at the edge of the surface, as far as possible, similar to what I did with object 7.
           
           Let's verify collisions with 5 and 7.
           Collision check for Object 6 with Object 5:
           `center_x_5 = 0.091`, `center_y_5 = 0`
           `sum_half_x_5_6 = hx_6 + hx_5 = 0.046298637303605115 + 0.041896003554676015 = 0.08819464085828113`
           `sum_half_y_5_6 = 0.046298637303605115 + 0.04189600355467604 = 0.08819464085828115`
           To avoid collision with Object 5, `abs(x_6 - 0.091) >= 0.08819464085828113` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.08819464085828115`.
           
           Collision check for Object 6 with Object 7:
           `center_x_7 = -0.089`, `center_y_7 = -0.089`
           `sum_half_x_7_6 = hx_6 + hx_7 = 0.046298637303605115 + 0.0459590343999987 = 0.09225767170360381`
           `sum_half_y_7_6 = 0.046298637303605115 + 0.04595903439999871 = 0.09225767170360382`
           To avoid collision with Object 7, `abs(x_6 - (-0.089)) >= 0.09225767170360381` OR `abs(y_6 - (-0.089)) >= 0.09225767170360382`.
           i.e., `abs(x_6 + 0.089) >= 0.09225767170360381` OR `abs(y_6 + 0.089) >= 0.09225767170360382`.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 at `(0.088, 0.088)`, which is near the corner of the surface bounds and is away from object 4, 5 and 7's regions.
           Surface bound for `x_6`: `[-0.0887, 0.0887]`
           Surface bound for `y_6`: `[-0.0887, 0.0887]`
           
           Consider placement `(x_6, y_6) = (0.088, 0.088)`:
           1. Collision with Object 4 (at (0,0)):
           `abs(0.088) = 0.088`. Collision threshold `0.09519`.
           Since `0.088 < 0.09519` for both x and y, this placement still *collides* with object 4. (My recurring issue).
           
           2. Collision with Object 5 (at (0.091,0)):
           `x_6 - 0.091 = 0.088 - 0.091 = -0.003`. `abs(-0.003) = 0.003`. Collision threshold `0.08819`.
           `y_6 - 0 = 0.088`. `abs(0.088) = 0.088`. Collision threshold `0.08819`.
           Is `abs(x_6 - 0.091) >= 0.08819`? `0.003 >= 0.08819` is False.
           Is `abs(y_6) >= 0.08819`? `0.088 >= 0.08819` is False.
           Since both are False, this placement *collides* with object 5.
           
           This means placing at `(0.088, 0.088)` is not good.
           I need `abs(x_6 - 0.091) >= 0.08819` OR `abs(y_6) >= 0.08819`.
           If `x_6 = 0.088`, then `abs(x_6 - 0.091) = 0.003`, which is much smaller than `0.08819`. So, `y_6` *must* be `abs(y_6) >= 0.08819`.
           But the max `abs(y_6)` on surface is `0.0887`. So `y_6 = 0.0887` or `y_6 = -0.0887` might avoid object 5 if `x_6` is close to `0.091`.
           
           Let's try `(x_6, y_6) = (0, 0.088)`.
           1. Collision with Object 4 (at (0,0)):
           `abs(0) < 0.09519` and `abs(0.088) < 0.09519`. Collides with object 4. (Still the inherent issue).
           
           2. Collision with Object 5 (at (0.091,0)):
           `abs(x_6 - 0.091) = abs(0 - 0.091) = 0.091`. Collision threshold `0.08819`.
           Is `0.091 >= 0.08819`? Yes. So no collision with object 5.
           
           3. Collision with Object 7 (at (-0.089,-0.089)):
           `abs(x_6 - (-0.089)) = abs(0 + 0.089) = 0.089`. Collision threshold `0.09225`.
           Is `0.089 >= 0.09225`? No.
           `abs(y_6 - (-0.089)) = abs(0.088 + 0.089) = 0.177`. Collision threshold `0.09225`.
           Is `0.177 >= 0.09225`? Yes. So no collision with object 7.
           
           So, a placement like `(0, 0.088)` avoids collision with 5 and 7, but collides with 4 by AABB definition.
           Since I must provide a valid placement, and I'm facing a mathematical impossibility for object 4, I will choose placements that avoid 5 and 7, and are on the surface, and acknowledge the unavoidable collision with 4. I will fill out the placements with this strategy, focusing on different parts of the surface.
