User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.238, -0.405), (-0.166, -0.333)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.28, 0.368), (-0.208, 0.439)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.015, -0.518), (0.083, -0.42)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.144, 0.358), (-0.045, 0.457)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.202, -0.369, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.017).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.244, 0.403, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.01).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.034, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.342, 0.94).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.095, 0.407, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.397).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unachievable with Provided Information**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal of arranging the four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto v18 is *unreachable* given the strict constraints of the problem. Here's a breakdown of my reasoning:
           
           1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The objective is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. This requires relocating these objects from their initial positions on v11 to the top of v18.
           
           2.  **Constraints:** The critical constraint is the "list of valid action instances" I am allowed to use. This list *only* contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This means the robot can move its base from base configuration v3 to the *same* base configuration v3, and that is *all*.
           
           3.  **The Need for Pick and Place:** To achieve the goal, I need `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects. These actions require *kinematic* information (`kin` predicates) to verify that a pick or place trajectory is feasible. This information is *not* present in the provided initial state.  Moreover, I'm constrained by the rule that I can *only* use the action instances *explicitly* provided.
           
           4.  **The Conundrum:** If I adhere strictly to the rule that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," then I am limited to the one base movement action which *cannot* alter the positions of the objects. Since no `pick` or `place` instances are in the list, no objects can be moved to the goal location.
           
           5.  **Implication:**  The initial setup is logically inconsistent: I need to move objects, but I am *not* allowed to use any of the necessary actions (pick/place).  The provided instructions are clear: only the provided actions are allowed, and no pick or place actions were listed. No axioms that generate `kin` data were provided.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the problem is unsolvable.  A plan that achieves the specified goal *cannot* be generated.
