           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.238, -0.405), (-0.166, -0.333)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.28, 0.368), (-0.208, 0.439)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.015, -0.518), (0.083, -0.42)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.144, 0.358), (-0.045, 0.457)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.202, -0.369, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.017).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.244, 0.403, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.01).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.034, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.342, 0.94).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.095, 0.407, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.397).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to place all four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto object v18. I'll need to define a plan to achieve this, given the initial state and available actions. My main strategy will involve picking each object from its current location (v11) and placing it on v18.
           
           Initially, I see that all target objects are graspable and stackable on v18. They are supported by v11 at different poses.  Both arms are empty. Also, I know the robot is at a base configuration, arm positions, and kinematics for all objects are in the initial state. I have a `move_base` action, but it doesn't seem critical to the plan since the robot's base doesn't need to move.
           
           I need to focus on the key *pick* and *place* actions. I'll use arm v4 to perform these actions, grasping with grasp #o1. The robot's base configuration will remain at v3 throughout. I will also make an assumption about placing the objects: since objects are supported at 0.781 on the initial pose, then a safe z value is the same value or slightly higher, at 0.781+epsilon.
           
           I will need to consider the target surface v18, which is much smaller than v11. I plan to place the objects in a 2x2 grid on v18.
           
           Here's my plan:
           1.  **Pick** v8 from v9 and **place** at #o2 (v8 on v18).
           2.  **Pick** v12 from v13 and **place** at #o2 (v12 on v18).
           3.  **Pick** v14 from v15 and **place** at #o2 (v14 on v18).
           4.  **Pick** v16 from v17 and **place** at #o2 (v16 on v18).
           
           For placement, I need to define the continuous pose parameter `#o2` for each object's placement on v18. The available grasp parameter is `#o1`. The available base pose is `v3` for all kinematic operations.
           
           I'll divide v18 into a 2x2 grid to provide collision free placement poses. I'll use an offset of 0.05 from the center in both x and y dimensions. The Z value, z=0.77, is safe.
           
           Here's the plan with *continuous values* filled in:
           1. `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           2. `(place v4 v8 #o2_v8_on_v18 #o1 v3 #o4)` with value for #o2 as (-0.05 -0.05 0.77 0.0)
           3. `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           4. `(place v4 v12 #o2_v12_on_v18 #o1 v3 #o4)` with value for #o2 as (0.05 -0.05 0.77 0.0)
           5. `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           6. `(place v4 v14 #o2_v14_on_v18 #o1 v3 #o4)` with value for #o2 as (-0.05 0.05 0.77 0.0)
           7. `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           8. `(place v4 v16 #o2_v16_on_v18 #o1 v3 #o4)` with value for #o2 as (0.05 0.05 0.77 0.0)
           
           With this plan, each object will be picked from its current position and placed on v18 at a unique, collision-free pose. This achieves my goal. The kinematic constraints and collision avoidance seem handled through pre-computed knowledge.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Constraints and Infeasibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning task, but it looks like there's a fundamental issue here. The user correctly pointed out a critical flaw: the initial plan was using `pick` and `place` actions, which aren't in the *allowed* actions. The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That just moves the base... *nowhere*!  
           
           The goal is to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all onto `v18`.  Right now, I see that they're all *currently* on `v11`, based on the initial state. The initial state shows the objects are on `v11` because they are `atpose` on poses that are *supported* by `v11`.
           
           To get them *onto* `v18`, I need to satisfy the `on` predicate for each object relative to `v18`. That's derived from `supported` and `atpose`. So, I'd need to have, for instance, `supported(v8, ?p_new, v18)` *and* `atpose(v8, ?p_new)`.  The first predicate (supported) needs to be true, and the second one (atpose) describes the object's position, and the robot needs to change that.
           
           But here's the kicker: the only allowed action *doesn't change object positions*. `move_base v3 v3 #o0` just adjusts the robot's base... from `v3` to `v3`. It's a no-op! It touches `atbconf` and `canmove`, but it doesn't do anything to manipulate the objects themselves. I need to get each object off of `v11` and on to `v18`. I'm starting at `atpose(v8, v9)` and need `atpose(v8, ?p_new)` to be true, with the new pose on `v18`.
           
           Given these constraints – the target `on` predicate and the limitation to only the static `move_base` action – it's simply *impossible* to achieve the goal state.  I can't manipulate the objects, so I can't reposition them.  This task is unreachable with the given action set.
