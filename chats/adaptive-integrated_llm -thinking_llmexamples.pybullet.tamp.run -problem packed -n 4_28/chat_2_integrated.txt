User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.238, -0.405), (-0.166, -0.333)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.28, 0.368), (-0.208, 0.439)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.015, -0.518), (0.083, -0.42)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.144, 0.358), (-0.045, 0.457)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.202, -0.369, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.017).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.244, 0.403, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.01).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.034, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.342, 0.94).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.095, 0.407, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.918, 0.397).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **A Plan to Stack Objects on v18**
           
           Alright, here's the plan I've come up with to get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** First, I'll need to reposition the robot's base to a suitable configuration (#o3) to reach v18.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:**  For each object (v8, v12, v14, and v16), I'll perform the following:
               *   **Pick:** Use the robot's arm (v4) to pick the object from its current location on the table (v11).  So, I'll `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4` and repeat for all the objects with `pick v4 vX vY #o1 #o3 #o4`.
               *   **Place:** Place the object onto v18 at a specific, unique pose `#o2`. This is going to look like `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` and similarly for v12, v14, v16.  I'm making sure these poses are collision-free.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** I'll be careful to ensure each object's placement on v18 doesn't collide with the others or other objects in the scene. The `unsafeapproach` and `unsafepose` axioms are crucial here.
           
           4.  **Specific Poses:** For those poses on `v18`, I'm going to carefully select them. They have to be inside the AABB of v18, which has the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I'll assume they're similar in size to other objects nearby.  For each, I'll pick unique (x,y) coordinates within this area. Then, I'll use `z = 0.781`, assuming the objects will be resting at a consistent height.  Each object will have a slightly different (x,y) position, making them fit neatly. I'm going to assume the initial position means the surface of `v18` is at `0.781`, so the height of the object also has to factor into this. This is the plan because I can confirm that the height values will place the objects in a stable manner. I will need to verify each pose is safe based on the object's geometry!
           
           I have also reviewed the requirements for my plan.
           *   I can provide a continuous value for each of my object poses.
           *   The placement will be collision free.
           
           Let's do this!
