           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Problem Decomposition**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I've identified that `type(?green, v17)` is already satisfied by objects `v8` and `v12`. I need to ensure that the robot is able to place either `v8` or `v12` such that it is supporting them to `v18`. Initially I will attempt to place `v8`.
           
           **Exploration of Actions and Preconditions**
           
           To get `on(v8, v18)`, I must find a pose `?p` for which `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` is true. I know from the starting situation that object `v8` is initially supported by `v9`, however object `v8` is also known to be supported by the target object `v18` at pose `#o2`. I need to move object `v8` so that it is resting on `v18` at the appropriate pose.
           
           This task requires `pick` and `place` actions. The preconditions for `pick` are a potential stumbling block because it involves the `new-axiom@0(?o)` axiom. From reading the PDDL code I have determined that precondition is satisfied when there exists some other graspable object that is NOT object `?o`. Given that three objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable, no `pick` action will work. However, the last error reported `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()` relates to a collision, which is the previous failure cause. This is a suggestion that maybe `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` is not the problem or not being checked. I will proceed with this new assumption.
           
           **Plan Formulation and Execution**
           
           The initial plan will be to:
           1.  **Move the base**: Change the base configuration from `v3` to `#o3` (base pose) with action `move_base`.
           2.  **Pick object**: Pick object `v8` using action `pick` and arm `v4`. The starting pose `v9` should change to `o1`.
           3.  **Place object**: Place object `v8` at pose `#o2` onto the target object `v18` using `place` action.
           
           The key challenges are collision avoidance during the base motion and arm trajectory, and ensuring all preconditions are met during each action execution. This plan is rejected due to `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v8)`.
           
           **Revised Plan with an Alternative Object**
           
           Given the block in `pick` action, I'll revise my approach by attempting to manipulate a different object. The revised plan will use the object `v12` instead of `v8`. The initial plan will be to:
           
           1.  **Move the base**: Change base configuration from `v3` to `#q2` (base pose) with action `move_base`.
           2.  **Pick object**: Pick object `v12` using action `pick` and arm `v4`.
           3.  **Move the base**: Change the base configuration from `#q2` to `#q3` (base pose) with action `move_base`.
           4.  **Place object**: Place object `v12` using the `place` action.
           
           This plan aims to avoid previous issues by using different trajectories and base configurations, in addition to using a different object. The preconditions for these actions are the same as before.
           
           **Plan Evaluation and Conclusion**
           
           The preconditions and effects of all actions are consistent within the new plan and the actions listed in the prompt are supported. By moving the object `v12` to `#p1`, the goal condition `on(v12, v18)` is true, and combined with the initial facts to show `type(v12, v17)` is true, the goal axiom `new-axiom@0()` is met. The major obstacle is the blocking precondition `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` for pick action.
