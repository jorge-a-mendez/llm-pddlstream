User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.313, 0.142), (-4.214, 0.241)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.264, 0.191, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.922, -0.386).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom that means `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In this problem, `?green` can be `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` since their type is `v17`. The available surface `v18` has AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v8` is currently at `v9` which is `(4.5, 0.3, 0.8)` on `v11`. `v15` is currently at `v16` which is `(4.35, 0.3, 0.8)` on `v11`. `v12` is currently at `v13` which is `(-4.264, 0.191, 0.801)` on `v14`.
           
           All of these objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`) are `stackable` with `v18`. Therefore, the goal is to pick up `v8`, `v12` or `v15` and place it on `v18`.
           
           Let's choose `v8` for example, since its current pose `v9` is already on `v11` which is in the same general area as `v18`.
           `v8` is at `v9`, `v9` is `(4.5, 0.3, 0.8)`. `v11` AABB is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`. `v18` AABB is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           The robot's arm `v4` can pick `v8` from `v9` using grasp `#o1` from base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           After picking, `v8` needs to be placed on `v18`. There is a symbolic pose `#o2` for `v8` on `v18`.
           
           The current initial state contains:
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`
           - `handempty(v4)`
           - `atbconf(v3)`
           - `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` which means arm `v4` can perform a pick of `v8` at `v9` with `g1` from base `q3` with arm traj `t4`.
           - `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` which means arm `v4` can perform a place of `v8` at `#o2` with `g1` from base `q3` with arm traj `t4`.
           - `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`
           
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means we can't move the base to a new configuration. We must use `v3` for the base configuration. The `kin` facts already have `#o3` as the base configuration, so we must assume `#o3` is `v3`.
           The current base configuration is `v3` (`atbconf(v3)`).
           
           So, the plan would be:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` using `v4` with grasp `#o1`, base `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           2. Place `v8` at `#o2` on `v18` using `v4` with grasp `#o1`, base `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5 0.0 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action is a self-looping move base action, and it does not change the state in a way that would allow for picking or placing objects. The goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires an object of `type v17` to be `on v18`, can only be achieved by a `place` action. Since no `pick` or `place` actions are available in the list of valid action instances, the goal is not achievable.
