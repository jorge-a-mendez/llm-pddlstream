           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.313, 0.142), (-4.214, 0.241)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.264, 0.191, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.922, -0.386).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom for `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. In the provided initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. Let's assume 'green' refers to either v12 or v8. To satisfy the goal, we need to place either v12 or v8 on v18.
           
           Currently, v12 is at `v13` on `v14` and v8 is at `v9` on `v11`. Both v12 and v8 are stackable on v18.
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of objects in terms of their location or being cleaned/cooked, nor does it allow for picking or placing objects. Since the goal requires placing an object on `v18`, and there are no actions available to pick or place objects, the goal cannot be achieved. The `move_base` action only moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, which does not help with the goal.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given actions.
