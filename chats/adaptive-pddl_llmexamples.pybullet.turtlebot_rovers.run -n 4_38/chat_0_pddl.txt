           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and a lander `v9`. Both rovers have a camera `v10` onboard which supports mode `v11`. There are several rocks and objectives. The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state that includes:
           - Both rovers (`v12`, `v14`) being at their respective configurations (`v13`, `v15`). This is true initially.
           - Both rovers having a free store `v16`. This is also true initially.
           - Several objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) having received images in mode `v11`.
           - Several rocks (`?stone`, `?soil` - these are variables, but in our specific goal statement, they refer to `v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` which are of type `v2` (stone) or `v6` (soil)) having received analysis.
           
           Let's break down the actions required to achieve the goal:
           
           1.  **Receive images for objectives:** The goal requires `receivedimage` for `v17, v18, v19, v20` in mode `v11`. To achieve this, a rover needs to:
               *   Calibrate its camera for the objective.
               *   Take an image of the objective.
               *   Send the image to the lander.
               Since `v10` is a camera and `v11` is a mode, and `v10` supports `v11`, we can use `take_image` and `send_image`. Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have `v10` onboard and can see all objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) from their initial positions (`v13`, `v15`) with ray `#o4` and can communicate with the lander `v9` with ray `#o1`. Neither ray is blocked.
           
           2.  **Receive analysis for rocks:** The goal implies that `receivedanalysis` for rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil). The initial state shows `v1` (type `v2`), `v3` (type `v2`), `v4` (type `v2`), `v5` (type `v6`), `v7` (type `v6`), `v8` (type `v6`). To achieve this, a rover needs to:
               *   Sample the rock.
               *   Send the analysis to the lander.
               Both rovers `v12` and `v14` are above all rocks (`v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8`) from their current configurations using configuration `#o5`. Both rovers have a free store `v16`. They can send the analysis to the lander `v9`.
           
           Since the goal requires multiple images and analyses, and both rovers are capable, we can distribute the tasks. However, the provided actions list only `move` and `drop_rock`. This indicates that the problem solver expects a plan only using these actions, implying that the goal *cannot* be fully achieved with *only* these actions if it requires `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.
           
           Looking closely at the goal `new-axiom@0()`, it is defined by a conjunction of several `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, plus `atconf` and `free` predicates. The initial state already satisfies `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. The *only* way to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates with the given limited allowed actions is if they are *already true in the initial state*, or if the axioms themselves can be satisfied without explicit actions.
           
           However, the definition of `new-axiom@0` includes:
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           None of these `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates are present in the initial state. The problem only provides `move` and `drop_rock` as valid action instances. `drop_rock` can change `full` to `free` but not `analyzed` to `receivedanalysis`. `move` only changes the robot's configuration.
           
           Therefore, with the *given limited action instances*, it is impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the `new-axiom@0()` goal, as these require `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, which are not listed as valid action instances.
           
           Given the constraints, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be achieved with the provided limited action instances. The initial state does not contain `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, and the available actions (`move`, `drop_rock`) cannot generate these facts. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
