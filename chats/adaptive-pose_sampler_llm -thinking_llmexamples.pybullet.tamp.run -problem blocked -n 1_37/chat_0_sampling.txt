(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for this little square object (ID 5, 0.07 x 0.07) on that rectangular surface (4.2 to 4.8 in x, -0.6 to 0.0 in y). The placements are (surf_idx, theta, x, y). No problem! Let's get to it.
           
           First things first, I need to understand that "stable" means the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) stays *entirely* within the surface's boundaries, taking rotation into account.  Since the object is square, rotation basically means that I need to calculate the bounding box based on the rotation angle (theta).
           
           I'll assume that the given size (0.07 x 0.07) is the AABB *before* rotation, and then calculate its size after rotation.  The good thing is the object's a square, meaning it'll stay square even when rotated, it's effective dimensions will just increase.
           
           With that in mind, I can define the effective size of the object as:  S_eff(theta) = 0.07 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|).
           
           Now, to nail down the surface constraints, it's crucial to calculate the valid placement zones for the centers of the rotated objects.
           
           I figured that I should use two thetas to get the desired number of placements; one being  0 radians (no rotation) and the other being pi/4 radians (45 degrees).
           
           For `theta=0`:
           The valid x range is: [4.2 + 0.07/2, 4.8 - 0.07/2] or [4.235, 4.765].
           The valid y range is: [-0.6 + 0.07/2, 0.0 - 0.07/2] or [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           Then I calculate, by dividing the size of the valid zone (0.53) with size of objects (0.07). The total number of valid centers, is 8.
           To have 25 placements, I'll take 5 from each of the calculated x and y coordinates.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           the size of an rotated object will be: `0.07*sqrt(2)` = approx 0.0989.
           Valid zones will be calculated with the same principles:
           x_min_center = 4.2 + 0.07*sqrt(2)/2 = 4.24949.
           x_max_center = 4.8 - 0.07*sqrt(2)/2 = 4.75050.
           y_min_center = -0.6 + 0.07*sqrt(2)/2 = -0.5505.
           y_max_center = -0.0 - 0.07*sqrt(2)/2 = -0.0494.
           Same process will give 6 centers in x and y.
           
           By putting the two ranges together I can come up with 50 stable placements, which satisfy the stated condition and provide diversity. I'll make sure to double-check my math and use some extra precision to make those coordinates super accurate. The goal is to avoid any overlap or issues with the boundaries.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that my previous object placement (ID 5) was successful. Now, the task is to place object ID 10 onto the same surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with the already placed object 5. Object 10 is a square with dimensions approximately 0.095 units. Object 5 has dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, centered at (4.235, -0.565) and occupies the region ((4.2, -0.6), (4.27, -0.53)). The surface itself is a rectangle from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).
           
           My strategy will involve generating 50 stable placements, focusing on two rotation angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).  I need to ensure that these new placements *avoid* object 5.
           
           For 0 degrees, the object's range on the surface is determined by its size and the surface boundaries, adjusted to avoid object 5. For 45 degrees, the object's dimensions are slightly larger (due to the rotation). I need to generate placement coordinates such that they don't overlap. I decided to generate 35 placements at 0 degrees, and 15 at 45 degrees.
           
           I need to meticulously check for potential collisions at the various placement locations. I'm focusing on the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of object 10 and comparing it to the known AABB of object 5. It turns out that (4.247, -0.553) would overlap with Object 5.
           
           After systematically generating and checking the possible locations, I have decided to exclude this first collision. After applying the exclusion, I have a total of 50 stable locations, that were checked to not overlap with each other, or with the already placed object.
