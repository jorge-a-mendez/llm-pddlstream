User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5 units, centered at the origin.
           There are several obstacles within this room.
           - Obstacles 0-4 define the outer walls of the room, with some slight variations in thickness.
           - Obstacle 5 is a long, thin wall along the y-axis, effectively dividing the room into two halves. This means any target point on one side of this wall will generally require the robot to be on the same side.
           - Obstacles 6-21 are various smaller AABBs scattered throughout the room. These are a mix of larger blocks and smaller, more point-like obstacles.
           
           My strategy is to try to find positions on a circle around the target point, gradually increasing the radius, and also varying the angle around the target. I will prioritize positions that are further away from known obstacles and closer to the target, as long as they are within max_range=4. I will also try to explore both sides of the central wall (obstacle 5) if the target point is close to it.
           
           For a target point of (-0.50976527 0.22238384), the target is on the left side of the central wall (x < 0). Therefore, I will focus on positions with x < 0.
