User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v8)

           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` which are graspable and stackable. `v11` is a surface where `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently supported. `v10` and `v16` are also surfaces. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and both are empty. The robot's base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal is to place all three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) on `v16`.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the available actions, there's only one possible action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from `v3` to `v3` using a trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of the objects or the arms, and therefore cannot contribute to achieving the goal of moving objects onto `v16`. There are no pick or place actions available to move the objects. Since the objects are currently on `v11` and the goal is to have them on `v16`, and there are no actions to pick up or place objects, the goal is unreachable.
