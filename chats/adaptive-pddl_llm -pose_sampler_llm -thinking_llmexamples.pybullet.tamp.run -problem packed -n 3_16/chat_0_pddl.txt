(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable placements for this object (ID 5).  It's basically a square, dimensions are about 0.078 by 0.078. It's going on a square surface, which is centered at (0,0) and extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The crucial thing here is to make sure the object stays *inside* the surface for any rotation.  I know that for simple AABBs on flat surfaces, containment means stability, assuming gravity is down.  I have my half dimensions, which are roughly 0.039 each.  This lets me calculate the safe x and y ranges after rotating the object.  I'll need to account for rotation *theta* because the object is square-ish.
           
           I know my surface is a square so I can focus on that.  If the object is placed at (x,y) and rotated by theta, the relevant part of the surface is x between -0.135 and +0.135 and the same for y.
           
           Since the object is almost square, I'm thinking of sampling several rotations and making sure that any placement within the surface is within all the possible rotations to be certain that the object does not go out of the surface.
           
           I'm starting by calculating the maximum "effective" width and height after rotation. This is the part that will shrink the possible x and y ranges.
           
           I'll start with no rotation (theta = 0) and then try pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4 and pi and then check to see how much room I have in the surface to place the object in the x-y plane. Then I calculate the allowable x and y ranges for various rotations and take the most restrictive range to ensure all 50 generated placements are within the surface boundary.
           
           When there's no rotation (theta = 0) x and y ranges are approximately [-0.0957, 0.0957]. When theta=pi/4, the range shrinks to around [-0.0794, 0.0794]. I'll go with a range of -0.079 to 0.079 for x and y to be conservative.
           
           To get my 50 placements, I'll use a grid-like approach.  I'll choose these x and y values [-0.07, -0.035, 0, 0.035, 0.07].  I'm using 5 distinct rotations and I'll generate 10 unique x,y placements with those values at each rotation.
           
           Let's do this.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that object 5, ID 5, has been successfully placed at (0, 0, 0) on surface 0. Now, I need to place a new object, ID 4, on the same surface, but it *must not* collide with object 5.
           
           Object 4 is almost a square with dimensions `size_x = 0.07873733916551234` and `size_y = 0.0787373391655124`.
           
           Object 5 has been placed at (0,0) with theta = 0, so its AABB is centered at (0,0). Given object 4 is also roughly square I know its effective dimensions (related to half of its size) will be about 0.0393.  I know it also roughly the same for object 5.
           
           I've determined that the best way to avoid collision is to rotate object 4 by one of four rotations. This will give me a box shape. These are `0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2`.
           
           So, I will generate a list of 50 possible locations for object 4.
           The positions must be on the surface, which is bound by a maximum width of around 0.135.
           *   I've determined the AABB of object 5 and the surface bounds.
           *   Given that I know I have a good distance to avoid collision, I need to place them so their boxes do not intersect. I have worked out some values.
           
           These locations will also be in four rotation values: 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2.
           *   My strategy is to generate 12 possible placements, then test 2 positions to achieve 50.
           *   The valid (x,y) placement locations will be generated around 0.
           *   To avoid collision with object 5 at position (0,0), any position `(x, y)` has to satisfy the condition `abs(x) >= 0.07866 OR abs(y) >= 0.07866`.
           *   Positions that will be used are `[0.0, 0.05, 0.08, -0.05, -0.08]`
           
           These should ensure object 4 does not collide with object 5 on surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to place this new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, and I need 50 different stable spots. Here's the deal:
           
           1.  **Containment:** The whole object has to fit inside surface 0, which is basically a square that goes from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           2.  **No Collisions:**  I need to avoid the objects already there:
               *   Object 5: It's a tiny square at (0, 0) with a side of about 0.078.
               *   Object 4: It's another small square, but at (0, 0.08) and side of 0.078.
           
           3.  **My Object:** Object 6 is also a square, with a side length of about 0.092.
           
           **The Math**
           
           To make this work, I have to consider the maximum and minimum size of object 6 when I rotate it. With the right angle, I can have an AABB that rotates to either the largest box, which means that the corners of the rotated box extend out past the starting dimensions by about 0.06522, and with an angle where the AABB doesn't rotate, the box will be the same height and width as the original size of the object, which is about 0.046. The minimum size, when rotation is not involved, is the largest I can make the box size when I rotate it. This makes the surface containment calculation:
           
           *   **For maximum rotation (pi/4 angle) object 6:** The allowed *x* and *y* center values must be within about [-0.069, 0.069].
           *   **For no rotation:** Allowed *x* and *y* center values have to fit within about [-0.088, 0.088]
           
           **Finding Safe Zones**
           
           *   **Rotating Object 6**:
               *   **Avoiding Object 5:** I need to make sure the edge of object 6 *doesn't* overlap with Object 5. This means I want to ensure my AABB's don't overlap. Since object 5 is at 0, 0, any of the corners can be the problem.
               *   **Avoiding Object 4:** This needs to be considered as the center coordinate shifts to 0.08, 0.
           
           *   **To solve this problem and make the calculation easier, I will make the following assumptions:**
               *   **No Rotation (theta=0 or pi/2)** The object is basically at 0 degrees and will be the same size in all cases. This will be the easiest.
               *   **Region 1 (left side):** `x <= -0.0854` and `y` can be anything.
               *   **Region 2 (top):** `y >= 0.0854`, `x` can be anything.
               *   **Region 3 (bottom):** `y <= -0.0854`, `x` can be anything.
               *   **Region 4 (Right side):** `x >= 0.0854` and `y <= -0.0854` OR `y >= 0.0854`.
           
           **My Strategy**
           
           I'm going to find 50 safe locations using the *theta=0* angle. These points can be used to generate the correct locations for a square object, for the *theta=0* and *theta=pi/2* angles.
           
           1.  **Generate Placement 1 (theta=0)**  I'll start by making 25 different points with the center x and y values for theta=0 (no rotation).
               *   **Left Edge:** Use one location in a left edge to show the object's y coordinates on this edge: `x = -0.087`.
               *   **Right Edge:** Use two coordinates on a right edge where the coordinates are safe: `x = 0.087, y = 0.087`.
               *   **Bottom Edge:** Use one location on the bottom where the coordinates are safe: `y = -0.087`.
               *   **Top Edge:** Use one location on the top where the coordinates are safe: `y = 0.087`.
               *   These locations have 9 + 8 + 8 +

           **Finding Safe Zones**
