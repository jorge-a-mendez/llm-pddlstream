           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of why the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain is unreachable, focusing on the core issues I've identified.
           
           My primary task is to find a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom boils down to ensuring several `receivedimage` predicates and `receivedanalysis` predicates are true.
           
           After dissecting the axiom, I started by analyzing the initial state and relevant actions. I've broken down the goal into its core parts and traced back from the required predicates to the actions that would achieve them.
           
           I identified the key actions to be: `send_image`, `send_analysis`, `take_image`, and `sample_rock`. The central problem arises with the preconditions of `take_image` and `sample_rock`, specifically the `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicates.
           
           Here's the problem:
           
           *   The `imagevisible` predicates like `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v20)` imply that a rover must be at configuration `#o3` to see and take an image.
           *   The `comvisible` predicates, for example `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, and the `send_analysis` also require the rovers at `#o0` for communication to the lander.
           *   The `above` predicates like `above(v12, #o5, v7)` and `above(v12, #o5, v3)` require the rover to be at `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           
           However, the initial state defines that rover `v12` is at configuration `v13` (`atconf(v12, v13)`) and rover `v14` is at configuration `v15` (`atconf(v14, v15)`) respectively. The available actions only provide self-moves, which cannot change these configuration states. The moves actions are useless in this regard.
           
           Since there are no available actions to change the `atconf` state of the rovers from `v13` or `v15` to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, the crucial preconditions of the `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions cannot be satisfied. Without the rovers being at the specific configurations, image/analysis taking or sending is impossible.
           
           Crucially, the PDDL formulation requires the `atconf` predicates to *exactly* match the required configurations for image visibility, communication, and rock sampling. The continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are treated as *specific, distinct* object constants for the purpose of this plan, and there is no way to alter the existing `atconf` state. This makes the goal unreachable.
           
           Consequently, the core `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal `new-axiom@0()` are unreachable.
