User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including a cluster in the upper right, upper left, and lower right and left corners, and a few in the middle. I will try to find positions within the allowed range and a distance of 2 from the target. I will prioritize positions that are not directly behind known obstacles. I also want to make sure the positions are not too close to the obstacles, so I will try to put some distance between the robot and any obstacle.

I need to avoid placing the robot near these obstacles or where they would block the line of sight to the target. The target is now in the upper left quadrant.

           Previous attempts show that placing the robot on the wrong side of the central wall at x=0 causes issues. Also, I've had "not reachable" errors, which means I need to make sure the proposed positions are within the x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. Obstacles 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 21, and 22 are in the upper left quadrant. The current target is in the upper left quadrant, near obstacle 21 and the x=0 wall. I need to be careful not to place the robot too close to these.
