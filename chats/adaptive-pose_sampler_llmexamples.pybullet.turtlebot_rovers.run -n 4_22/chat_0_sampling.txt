User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will prioritize positions that are closer to the target point and try to vary the angle around the target. I will also try to avoid the known obstacles, especially the central wall.

I will adjust the y-coordinate to be closer to the target.

           For the target point (0.62 2.03), previous attempts in the form (0.62, y) have failed due to collisions with obstacles 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)) and 21 ((0.578, 1.987), (0.662, 2.072)), or no line of sight. This means that positions directly below the target along the x-coordinate of 0.62 are problematic. I will try to shift positions horizontally to avoid these obstacles, while maintaining proximity to the target.
           
           For the target point (-1.96 2.05), the previous attempts failed because they were trying to view the target through the central wall. I need to ensure the robot base is on the same side of the central wall (x=0) as the target.
