User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.083, -1.49), (5.018, -0.299)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.357, 0.556, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.687, 0.727).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)`, so `?green` must be `v12`. Therefore, the goal simplifies to `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The axiom `on(?o, ?r)` is defined as `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           In the initial state, we have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which means if we can achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)`, we will satisfy the goal.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13` (`atpose(v12, v13)`). We need to pick up `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2`.
           
           The available actions involving `v12` are:
           - `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           - `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           To pick `v12` from `v13`:
           - `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Provided in the initial state.
           - `atpose(v12, v13)`: Provided in the initial state.
           - `handempty(v4)`: Provided in the initial state.
           - `atbconf(#o3)`: Not provided. The initial state has `atbconf(v3)`. We need a `move_base` action to get to `#o3`.
           - `unsafeapproach(v12, v13, #o1)`: Not provided as negative. We assume it's safe if not explicitly stated.
           - `unsafeatraj(#o4)`: Not provided as negative. We assume it's safe if not explicitly stated.
           - `new-axiom@0(v12)`: This is `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, v12)` and `Atom graspable(?culprit)`. If `v12` is the only graspable object, then this would be false. But `v15` is also graspable. So `new-axiom@0(v12)` is not true if there exists another graspable object that is not `v12`. Since `v15` is graspable, `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true, meaning we cannot pick `v12`.
           Wait, the axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)` states `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)` and `Atom graspable(?culprit)`. This means that if we want to pick `?o`, there shouldn't be any other graspable object `?culprit` in the scene. This is a very restrictive axiom.
           Let's re-evaluate. `new-axiom@0(?o)` means "it is NOT okay to pick `?o`".
           The precondition `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` means "it IS okay to pick `?o`".
           So, to pick `v12`, we need `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)`.
           This means we need `NegatedAtom (NegatedAtom =(?culprit, v12) AND Atom graspable(?culprit))`.
           Which simplifies to `Atom =(?culprit, v12) OR NegatedAtom graspable(?culprit)`.
           This means either there is no other graspable object `?culprit` that is not `v12`, or if there are other graspable objects, they must be equal to `v12`. This effectively means there can only be one graspable object, which is `v12`.
           However, the initial state explicitly lists `graspable(v15)` and `graspable(v12)`.
           Therefore, `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true (because `?culprit` can be `v15`, which is not equal to `v12` and is graspable).
           Since `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true, its negation `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)` is false.
           This implies that `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` is not executable.
           
           The problem formulation states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           And the available actions are:
           `((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))`, `((move_base #o3 v3 #o0))`, `((move_base v3 #o3 #o0))`, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`
           `((pick v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))`, `((place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))`
           `((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))`, `((place v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))`
           `((pick v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))`, `((place v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))`
           `((pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4))`, `((place v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4))`
           
           Let's re-examine `new-axiom@0(?o)`. There are two axioms named `new-axiom@0`. The one relevant for `pick` is `new-axiom@0(?o)` which is `Conjunction NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) Atom graspable(?culprit)`. This indeed means "there exists a graspable object `?culprit` different from `?o`."
           So, if there is another graspable object in the scene, picking `?o` is blocked.
           In our initial state, `v12` is graspable and `v15` is graspable.
           If `?o` is `v12`, then `?culprit` can be `v15`, satisfying `NegatedAtom =(v15, v12)` and `Atom graspable(v15)`. Therefore, `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true.
           This means that `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)` (a precondition for `pick`) is false.
           This means we cannot pick `v12`.
           
           Similarly, if `?o` is `v15`, then `?culprit` can be `v12`, satisfying `NegatedAtom =(v12, v15)` and `Atom graspable(v12)`. Therefore, `new-axiom@0(v15)` is true.
           This means that `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v15)` (a precondition for `pick`) is false.
           This means we cannot pick `v15`.
           
           Given the current interpretation of `new-axiom@0(?o)`, no `pick` action is possible since there are two graspable objects in the scene (`v12` and `v15`).
           Since picking is required to change the `atpose` of an object, and the goal `on(v12, v18)` requires `atpose(v12, #o2)`, which is different from its initial `atpose(v12, v13)`, the goal cannot be achieved.
           
           Let's carefully check the definition of `new-axiom@0(?o)` again.
           `Axiom new-axiom@0(?o)`
             `Conjunction`
               `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)`
               `Atom graspable(?culprit)`
           This axiom is used in the `pick` action as `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           So, the precondition for `pick` implies that the condition `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) AND Atom graspable(?culprit)` must be false.
           This means for all `?culprit`, it must be the case that `Atom =(?culprit, ?o) OR NegatedAtom graspable(?culprit)`.
           This effectively means that if `?culprit` is graspable, then `?culprit` must be `?o`. In other words, `?o` must be the *only* graspable object in the scene for it to be pickable.
           
           Since there are two graspable objects, `v12` and `v15`, neither can be picked.
           Thus, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Wait, there are two axioms named `new-axiom@0`. One is `new-axiom@0(?o)` and the other is `new-axiom@0()`.
           The `pick` action refers to `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`. So it's the `new-axiom@0` that takes an object argument. My analysis above stands.
           
           Let's assume there is a mistake in my understanding of the problem or the provided PDDL, or perhaps `new-axiom@0` is meant to be interpreted differently. If I *were* able to pick up `v12`, the plan would be:
           1. Move to `#o3` (assuming `#o3` is required for `kin` with `v4`).
           2. Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           3. Place `v12` at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           However, based on the strict interpretation of the PDDL, this is not possible.
           
           Let me reconsider what "new-axiom@0(?o)" could mean.
           Axioms are essentially derived predicates. `new-axiom@0(?o)` becomes true if its conjunction is true.
           The `pick` action requires `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           This means that the conjunction `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) AND Atom graspable(?culprit)` must be FALSE for the specific `?o` being picked.
           This translates to: For any `?culprit`, `Atom =(?culprit, ?o)` is TRUE OR `Atom graspable(?culprit)` is FALSE.
           In simpler terms: any graspable object `?culprit` must be identical to `?o`.
           This means `?o` must be the only graspable object in the scene.
           
           Given `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)` in the initial state, neither `v12` nor `v15` can be picked according to this axiom. Therefore, the goal `on(v12, v18)` which requires moving `v12`, is unreachable.
           
           Let me ensure that the goal `new-axiom@0()` refers to the axiom `new-axiom@0()` with no arguments.
           `Axiom new-axiom@0()`
             `Conjunction`
               `Atom on(?green, v18)`
               `Atom type(?green, v17)`
           As derived earlier, this implies `on(v12, v18)`.
           So, we need to achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)` where `#o2` is supported by `v18`.
           
           Since I must return a plan if one exists, and I've concluded it's unreachable, I will re-read everything one last time. Is there any ambiguity?
           
           "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           This means I must use one of the `pick` or `place` actions given. All of them involve `v4` and `#o1` as the grasp.
           All `pick` actions have `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` as a precondition.
           
           `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` has the precondition `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)`.
           `pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4` has the precondition `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v15)`.
           
           As demonstrated, both `new-axiom@0(v12)` and `new-axiom@0(v15)` are true given `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)`.
           Therefore, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)` is false and `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v15)` is false.
           Neither pick action is executable.
           
           The only way a pick would be executable is if the initial state did not contain both `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)`. Or if the axiom `new-axiom@0` was defined differently.
           
           Given the current definitions and initial state, the goal is unreachable.
           I will explicitly state that the goal is unreachable and why.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` refers to the axiom `Axiom new-axiom@0()`, which states `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, `type(v12, v17)`, so the goal reduces to `on(v12, v18)`. The axiom `on(?o, ?r)` is defined as `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. In the initial state, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. Thus, the goal is to achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13` (`atpose(v12, v13)`). To move `v12` to `#o2`, a `pick` action followed by a `place` action is required.
           
           Let's examine the `pick` action's preconditions, specifically `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           The axiom `new-axiom@0(?o)` is defined as:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0(?o)`
             `Conjunction`
               `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)`
               `Atom graspable(?culprit)`
           This means `new-axiom@0(?o)` is true if there exists *any* graspable object `?culprit` that is *not* `?o`.
           
           For the `pick` action to be valid, `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` must be true. This means the condition `Conjunction NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) Atom graspable(?culprit)` must be false for *all* possible `?culprit` values.
           In other words, for every object `?culprit`, it must be the case that `Atom =(?culprit, ?o)` is true OR `Atom graspable(?culprit)` is false.
           This effectively means that `?o` must be the *only* graspable object in the entire scene to be picked.
           
           In the initial state, we have `graspable(v12)` and `graspable(v15)`.
           If we try to pick `v12` (i.e., `?o` is `v12`), then `?culprit` can be `v15`. Since `v15` is not `v12` (`NegatedAtom =(v15, v12)`) and `v15` is graspable (`Atom graspable(v15)`), the conjunction for `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true. Therefore, `new-axiom@0(v12)` is true, making `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)` (a precondition for `pick`) false.
           Thus, `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` cannot be executed.
           
           Similarly, if we try to pick `v15` (i.e., `?o` is `v15`), then `?culprit` can be `v12`. Since `v12` is not `v15` (`NegatedAtom =(v12, v15)`) and `v12` is graspable (`Atom graspable(v12)`), the conjunction for `new-axiom@0(v15)` is true. Therefore, `new-axiom@0(v15)` is true, making `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v15)` false.
           Thus, `pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4` cannot be executed.
           
           Since no `pick` action can be performed, it is impossible to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` to the target pose `#o2`. Consequently, the goal `on(v12, v18)` cannot be achieved.
