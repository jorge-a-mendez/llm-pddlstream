User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.047, 0.507), (0.128, 0.588)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.267, -0.539), (-0.18, -0.452)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.224, -0.495, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.601, 0.799).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.077, -0.383, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.91, -0.414).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.028, -0.432), (0.126, -0.333)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.088, 0.547, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.093).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom controllable(v4)

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. There's one robot arm `v4` that is currently empty and at configuration `v5`. The robot base is at configuration `v3`. The objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently placed on `v11`, a large surface. The goal is to stack all three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) on `v16`. `v16` is a smaller object, indicating that objects would need to be precisely placed to achieve the goal.
           
           There is a single action instance given, `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This is a trivial move action, where the robot moves from `v3` to `v3`, which essentially means it doesn't move. The cost is the distance between `v3` and `v3`, which is 0.
           
           However, the problem statement says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The given action list only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means no `pick` or `place` actions are allowed.
           
           The goal requires placing `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. This inherently requires `pick` and `place` actions. Since these actions are not provided in the list of allowed action instances, the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom on(v8, v16)`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The initial analysis was correct that the provided plan is not valid and the goal is unreachable. The problem statement explicitly says: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of `on` predicates, meaning that if an object is not initially `on` `v16`, it cannot become `on` `v16` using only the `move_base` action.
           
           Since the goal is `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, and none of these are true in the initial state, and the only allowed action cannot achieve them, the goal is unachievable with the given constraints.
