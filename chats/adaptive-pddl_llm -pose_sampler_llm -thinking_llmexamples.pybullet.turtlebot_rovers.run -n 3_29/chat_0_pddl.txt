           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **PDDL Plan Generation for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. First, I analyzed the axiom itself. It involves several predicates related to rovers, images, and analysis.  My approach is to break it down predicate by predicate and build a step-by-step plan.  Since a significant chunk of the initial state already satisfies some predicates (like `atconf` and `free`), I focus on the actions needed to fulfill `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           I'll use Rover `v12` as the primary agent for the plan. Given the initial state and available actions, I'm confident that this is the most efficient approach, and the other rover, `v14`, doesn't look necessary here.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll use `send_image`.  To send the image, I'll need `haveimage`, and to get `haveimage`, I'll use `take_image`. The precondition for `take_image` has `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and `~blocked`. I can satisfy the visibility precondition since I know the objectives are visible to the rover in its current configuration. The `blocked` predicate isn't an issue since there are no `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` facts, meaning the rays are clear. This also implies the `comvisible` precondition for `send_image` is true.
           
           I need to calibrate the camera and re-calibrate after each `take_image` because the `take_image` action consumes the `calibrated` fact. Now, because I have multiple `receivedimage` goals, I'll calibrate, take an image, repeat. This must be done three times for objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I then send the image each time.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`, I will use `send_analysis`. To achieve `analyzed`, I can `sample_rock`. The rover's store, `v16`, is initially free, allowing me to start the analysis process. After sampling a rock, I then drop the rock so the rover's store is available again to sample another.
           
           I'll focus on `v3` as the stone to be analyzed, and `v7` as the soil to be analyzed. Given the initial conditions and the available actions, this plan appears to be the most efficient solution.
           
           Given my interpretations of how the continuous variables map to the state, here's the final plan sequence, which makes sure that the rovers' internal states and their stores are correctly maintained throughout the plan.
           *   **(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10)**  (Calibrate Rover 10 to take images from v12)
           *   **(take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11)** (Take image of v17 with rover 12, mode v11)
           *   **(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10)** (Recalibrate for the next image)
           *   **(take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11)** (Take image of v18)
           *   **(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10)** (Recalibrate)
           *   **(take_image v12 v13 #o4 v19 v10 v11)** (Take image of v19)
           *   **(send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11)** (Send the first image)
           *   **(send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11)** (Send the second image)
           *   **(send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v19 v11)** (Send the third image)
           *   **(sample_rock v12 v13 v3 v16)** (Get stone sample v3 into store v16)
           *   **(send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v3)** (Send analysis)
           *   **(drop_rock v12 v16)** (Free the rover's store)
           *   **(sample_rock v12 v13 v7 v16)** (Sample soil v7)
           *   **(send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v7)** (Send analysis)

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan Assessment: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I completely missed the crucial detail: I was only allowed to use the actions provided in the list.  My previous plan, which involved things like calibration, image-taking, and analysis, is now rendered invalid. The user's right; I missed that critical constraint. "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  Doh!
           
           Let me regroup. The valid actions are extremely limited: essentially self-loops (useless) and dropping rocks. The goal is complex, but let's break it down focusing only on what's achievable with the given actions.
           
           My goal involves numerous `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I can see that this is a problem, because it's impossible to generate any "received" predicates using the actions provided.
           
           Now, the actions available:  `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`, `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`, `((drop_rock v12 v16))`, and `((drop_rock v14 v16))`.  The move actions are just self-loops, meaning they are redundant. The `drop_rock` action is the only one I could use to meaningfully change the state. I know that `drop_rock` has a precondition `full(?v, ?s)`.  However, my initial state specifies `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`,  which means both locations are free. There is no `full` predicate. I cannot satisfy the preconditions for `drop_rock`. I can't even *begin* to change anything with these actions!
           
           So, essentially, *none* of the actions in this extremely limited set are useful for satisfying any of the goal conditions. The goal predicates that rely on image or analysis reception are clearly unachievable, and I can't satisfy the preconditions for the only action that might affect the state.  Based on this extremely restricted set of actions, the goal is *unreachable*.
