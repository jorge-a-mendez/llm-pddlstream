User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.262, 0.177), (-0.18, 0.259)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.027, -0.319), (0.067, -0.225)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.083, 0.413), (0.179, 0.509)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.194, 0.312), (0.293, 0.411)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.221, 0.218, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, -0.096).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.02, -0.272, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.231, 0.973).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.131, 0.461, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.503, 0.864).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.243, 0.361, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.929, -0.371).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene consists of four objects: v14, v12, v16, and v8, all currently on the surface v11. The goal is to place all four objects on the surface v18. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant as the kin relations are only provided for v4. The robot is currently at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5. All objects are graspable.
           
           The problem requires moving all four objects from their initial positions on v11 to new positions on v18. Since there's only one arm (v4) and it can only hold one object at a time, the robot will have to pick and place each object individually.
           
           The initial state provides `kin` relations for picking each object from its initial pose (v15 for v14, v13 for v12, v17 for v16, and v9 for v8) with grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`. It also provides `kin` relations for placing each object to the pose `#o2` on various surfaces including `v18` with the same grasp, base configuration, and arm trajectory.
           
           The plan will involve a sequence of pick and place operations. For each object, the robot will:
           1. Pick the object from its initial pose.
           2. Place the object on the surface v18 at the target pose `#o2`.
           
           The `move_base` action is provided, but since the `basemotion` is from `v3` to `v3`, it implies no actual base movement is needed. This is convenient since the problem does not provide any information about the position of v18 relative to v11, only their bounding boxes. This suggests that the robot is able to reach all objects from its current base configuration v3.
           
           The challenge is to define a valid collision-free pose for each object at `#o2` on `v18`. Since v18 is a circular surface, and the objects are rectangular, they must be placed such that they fit within the bounds of v18 without overlapping each other.
           
           The AABB for v18 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). This implies a circular region of radius 0.135 centered at the origin.
           The AABB for v14 is ((0.083, 0.413), (0.179, 0.509)). This is approximately 0.096 x 0.096.
           The AABB for v12 is ((0.194, 0.312), (0.293, 0.411)). This is approximately 0.099 x 0.099.
           The AABB for v16 is ((-0.027, -0.319), (0.067, -0.225)). This is approximately 0.094 x 0.094.
           The AABB for v8 is ((-0.262, 0.177), (-0.18, 0.259)). This is approximately 0.082 x 0.082.
           
           All objects are relatively small. I need to find 4 distinct, collision-free placements for these objects on `v18`. I will choose poses such that the objects are placed in the corners of the square formed by the bounding box of v18.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided valid actions list contains only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action is a base movement from `v3` to `v3`, effectively a no-op in terms of changing the robot's base configuration.
           
           The goal is to place all objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on surface v18. To achieve this, the robot needs to perform `pick` and `place` actions. However, no `pick` or `place` actions are present in the list of valid actions. This means the robot cannot interact with any objects, and therefore, cannot achieve the goal of moving them to `v18`.
           
           Since the necessary `pick` and `place` actions are not available, the goal is unreachable.
