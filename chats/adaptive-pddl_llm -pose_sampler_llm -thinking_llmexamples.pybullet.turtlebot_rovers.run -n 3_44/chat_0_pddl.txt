           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've developed to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           First, I broke down the goal into its component parts: getting images and analyzing rocks. I realized I needed to acquire images of three specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`), and obtain analyses for one rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`.
           
           I then analyzed the actions available.  I determined that rover `v14` (with camera `v10`) was best suited for the imaging and analysis tasks because it was *at* the necessary configuration and *free* to operate.  I'd use a sequence of `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` for each of the three objectives.  I need to calibrate the camera before each image. `v10` is on `v14` so its onboard.
           
           For rock analysis, I'd first use `sample_rock` to collect a sample, then `send_analysis`, and finally `drop_rock` to free the store for the next sample. I will use the current location as the config as much as possible to avoid unnecessary moves.
           
           *   **Imaging Plan (Rover v14):**
               1.  `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10)`
               2.  `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
               3.  `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
               4.  `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v18, v10)`
               5.  `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
               6.  `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
               7.  `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v19, v10)`
               8.  `take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
               9.  `send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           
           *   **Analysis Plan (Rover v14):**
               1.  `sample_rock(v14, v15, v4, v16)` (Sample rock v4, type v2)
               2.  `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v4)`
               3.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
               4.  `sample_rock(v14, v15, v8, v16)` (Sample rock v8, type v6)
               5.  `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v8)`
           
           I carefully checked the preconditions and effects of each action to ensure the plan's feasibility and to preserve the initial state's valid conditions. I also reviewed the continuous variables and assigned meaningful interpretations based on how the predicate is used. This should result in a plan that satisfies all the conditions for the goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v4 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v4), (sample_rock v14 v15 v8 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v8)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Roadblock: Invalid Actions & an Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user pointed out my error: I totally missed the restriction on action instances. I re-read the instructions, and it's crystal clear – only a tiny list of *specific* actions are allowed: moving some labeled objects and dropping a couple of rocks. That's it. No imaging, no analyzing.
           
           The goal, though, is all about *receiving* images and analysis data (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`). I need these predicates to be true, along with some location-specific conditions. But the actions necessary to achieve *that* aren't in the list!  Calibrating, taking images, sending them, sampling rocks, sending those results...  None of those are permitted.
           
           It's a complete dead end. My allowed actions – move this object here, drop that rock there –  can't possibly lead to a state where the goal's conditions are satisfied.  I can't generate the necessary `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates with these no-op actions. The goal, as it stands, is simply unreachable given these constraints. It's an impossible task!
