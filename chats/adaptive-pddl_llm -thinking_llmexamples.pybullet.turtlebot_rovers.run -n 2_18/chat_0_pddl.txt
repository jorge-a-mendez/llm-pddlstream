           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the task is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which unpacks into several atomic conditions.  The initial state satisfies the `atconf` and `free` predicates, leaving me to focus on `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`. To achieve those, I need the `send_image`, `take_image`, and `calibrate` actions, along with those to achieve `receivedanalysis`. The initial state gives me rover and camera locations and relevant facts like `imagevisible` and `comvisible`.
           
           Crucially, I notice that the `atconf` preconditions of these actions require the rovers to be at certain configurations (`q`). The initial state specifies `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. However, the visual and communication preconditions specify configurations like `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`.  The problem is that the only possible `move` actions are self-loops, meaning the rovers cannot change their configurations.
           
           I re-examine the problem, I find no implicit relationship that would link `v13`/`v15` to the `conf` configurations. No other actions exist that affect `atconf`, and the initial state, by definition, lacks the necessary `atconf` predicates for those target configurations. It seems, by design, the rovers are locked in their initial configurations! Since *any* fact not in the initial state is false, and there are no actions to make the needed configurations true, the crucial actions `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and thereby the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates cannot be achieved. The goal, consequently, is unreachable due to the initial configuration lock and the absence of any other configuration movement actions.
