           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Base Configuration Constraint**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()`, requiring an object of type `v17` to be on `v18`, is currently unmet. I identified two potential candidates, `v8` and `v12`, that satisfy the type constraint.  I determined that the most likely solution would involve moving either of these objects to a pose supported by `v18`.
           
           However, the action `pick` is problematic.  The current base configuration is at `v3`, but the kinematic constraints dictate a base configuration of `#o3` for all pick and place actions involving arm `v4`. The initial state, and only available move base action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, maintains the robot's base at `v3`. It is impossible, within the constraints of the available actions, to transition to the required base configuration `#o3` to execute any `pick` or `place` operations using arm `v4`.  There are no `kin` predicates for arm `v6`, rendering it equally incapable of manipulation.
           
           Since I cannot manipulate any object, and the goal state is not true in the initial state, I conclude that the goal is unattainable.
