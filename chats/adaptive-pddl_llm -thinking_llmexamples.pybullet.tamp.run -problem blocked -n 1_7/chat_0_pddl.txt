           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `(new-axiom@0)`, which boils down to ensuring an object is *both* of a specific `type` and `on` a particular surface (`v18`).  My initial thought is to identify a suitable object, `?green`, and then devise a plan to move it onto `v18`.  
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see two potential candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`. Both are the correct `type`. To satisfy the `on` condition, I need to make sure the object is in a supported pose on `v18`. From the scene data, it's clear that both `v8` and `v12` are *supported* by `v18` at pose `#o2`.  Therefore, I would need to *move* one of them to pose `#o2`.
           
           However, here's where things get tricky.  The only action instance I'm given is a `move_base` action, a no-op. To change the `atpose` of either `v8` or `v12` I would need `pick` and `place` actions which are not present in the given action instances.
           
           Since I am restricted to the provided `move_base` action, which doesn't allow me to pick up and place objects, I can't modify the initial state in a way that would make either `(on v8 v18)` or `(on v12 v18)` true.  The goal, therefore, is ultimately unreachable given the constraints.  No amount of creative planning will circumvent the fundamental absence of the required actions.  The lack of `pick` and `place` actions is the critical roadblock.
