(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.08338 x 0.08338) on a square surface defined by the corners (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Since the object is square, its bounding box size won't change as I rotate it. However, the world-aligned bounding box will change with the rotation, which is critical to determine the allowable region on the surface.
           
           I'm interpreting the prompt's wording ("geometry...described in terms of the x and y dimensions...AABB") in the most common way for physics or robotics simulations. This means the object has a local coordinate frame with an AABB described by its `size_x` and `size_y` dimensions. When I rotate the object by an angle `theta`, I then have to calculate the *world-aligned* bounding box's dimensions, which will depend on `theta`.  If that fails, I can switch to the simpler interpretation where object size is always its axis aligned dimensions.
           
           The surface's dimensions are from -0.135 to 0.135.  The effective dimensions of the rotated object *can* change, which defines the safe region for the object's center. This is because the surface is smaller than the smallest rectangle that could fit the object at the tightest rotation.
           
           *   To find placements, I generated multiple rotations to ensure the solution accounts for the object's geometry.
           *   I used a range of `theta` values: `0`, `pi/16`, `pi/8`, `3pi/16`, `pi/4` and calculated the maximum effective dimension.
           *   The effective dimension is: `0.08338 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means as `theta` increases, the bounding box *widens*, reducing the area available.
           *   The tightest `effective_dim` is at `theta=pi/4`, at  `0.08338 * sqrt(2)`.
           *   I then generated x,y coordinates to get a sample of placements.
           *   Since I need 50, and 8 rotations by default generates 72 placements, I took all those until it was over 50, then I picked the *best* 50.
           
           I generated a 3x3 grid of placements for each rotation, and this strategy gave me slightly over 50.  Then, I took the best 50 samples.
           The values are stored in the format `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The first index, `surf_idx` is 0, since it is surface zero.

(Thoughts: **Refining Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           I've successfully placed object ID 5, and now I'm tasked with placing object ID 4 without collisions. Object 5's position and dimensions are well-defined, and its AABB is calculated. I'll need to avoid its bounding box. I am using the collision detection method I've outlined before.
           
           Object 4 has a square shape and its side length is measured. For different rotation angles, I calculate an effective dimension for the AABB. To generate potential placements, I will use a grid-based approach. For each rotation, I'll calculate the allowed x and y ranges. I generate a grid, ensuring the distance from the edges of the surface is sufficient to accommodate object 4's effective dimension.
           
           A key part of the process is collision checking between the object 4 AABB and the object 5 AABB. I am using `check_collision` which accurately determines if there is any overlap in the x and y ranges. The method generates valid locations to store in the array. If there are no valid placements, I can change the number of grid points for each x and y.
           
           I will iterate through the theta values, and apply the grid. I test the collision and filter out any invalid placements. I set the number of placements required to be at least 50. I anticipate this strategy is efficient and accurate for this problem.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable objects (ID: 6) onto surface 0. This surface is a defined rectangle, and the object itself is essentially a square, around 0.093 units on each side. The tricky part? I need to avoid collisions with two existing objects already on the surface: a smaller square (ID: 5) and a slightly larger square (ID: 4).
           
           First, I've got a solid grasp of the surface boundaries and the dimensions of the new object. I also know the sizes and bounding box extents of the other objects. The main challenge is finding 50 unique, stable positions that don't overlap with either of the pre-existing ones.
           
           Since I'm dealing with a square object that can rotate, the object's effective size changes depending on its rotation angle (theta). At 0 degrees, the object is simply resting on the floor. I need to calculate the *effective* width and height based on the rotation.
           
           I'm thinking about dividing the available space into a grid to check for placements efficiently. I'm going to try a range of rotations, specifically: 0, pi/12, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and 5*pi/12. For each rotation, I'll figure out the minimum and maximum possible center coordinates (x, y) that keeps the object within the surface and avoids the other shapes. Then, I'll generate a grid of candidate x and y values, and for each one, calculate the bounding box and check for collisions.
           
           A key part of this strategy is doing *precise* collision checks using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). Since the objects have a consistent rectangular shape regardless of their rotation, these checks are computationally efficient and accurate. To check for collisions, I'll see if the boxes overlap by checking all the possible conditions where there is *no* overlap. If all those conditions fail, there *is* overlap.
           
           I need to make sure I focus my search where it's most likely to succeed. The space is largely clear, but the existing objects are crowding the bottom-left area. I anticipate having more success placing objects towards the right and/or top of the surface, with some strategic placement on the bottom-right and top-left.
           
           I'm starting the grid search with a 5x5 grid (25 points) at a theta of 0. I'll evaluate the available placements by creating a new AABB that represents where an object would lie if placed at these points. This approach will allow me to check the positions carefully, so I don't accidentally place something on top of an existing object. This means I'll make sure each x, y coordinate falls in line with the non-collision conditions I've previously calculated. The process should proceed rapidly from here. Then, I'll move on to the other theta values.
