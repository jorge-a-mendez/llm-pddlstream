User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is generally a square area with boundaries at x and y from -2.5 to 2.5. There's a central vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0, which divides the space into two halves. There are several other smaller obstacles, including some near the corners (obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22) and some scattered in the middle. Obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4 are the boundary walls. Obstacle 6 is a larger rectangular block in the bottom-left quadrant.
           
           For the target point (-0.5756775670000001 -1.455204481), I need to find positions within a radius of 2. I should prioritize positions that are not directly behind the central wall (obstacle 5) if the target is on one side, and also avoid other visible obstacles.
           
           The target point is in the left half, so positions in the right half of the main wall (x > 0.05) are likely to be occluded. I will look for positions in the left half, generally in the lower quadrant. I'll also try to vary the angle of approach to the target.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.575677567 -0.455204481)
           (-2.075677567 -1.455204481)
           (-0.575677567 -2.455204481)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous request was for a target point different from what I used. I will use the new target point and the feedback to guide my choices. The feedback is for target (0.6024689078330994, 2.1883187294006348). This target is in the upper right quadrant.
           
           The previous proposed position (-0.575677567, -0.455204481) had no line of sight. This is expected as it's on the opposite side of the central wall from the target, and quite far away.
           The position (-2.075677567, -1.455204481) collided with obstacle 6, which is in the bottom left.
           The position (-0.575677567, -2.455204481) collided with obstacle 2, which is the bottom boundary wall. This suggests being too close to the boundary.
           
           Now, the target point is (0.6024689078330994, 2.1883187294006348). This is in the top-right quadrant, near the top boundary. I should look for positions generally to the right of the central wall (x > 0) and relatively close to the target. I need to avoid obstacles 7, 9, 17, 19, 21, which are in this general area.
           
           Positions:
           (0.6024689078330994 0.1883187294006348)
           (0.6024689078330994 1.0)
           (1.5 2.1883187294006348)
