User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has a large central empty space with boundaries at x and y from -2.5 to 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0, and several smaller obstacles scattered around, especially in the corners and near the central wall. My strategy will be to sample points in a circle around the target point at varying distances, prioritizing locations that appear to be in open areas and avoiding the known obstacles. I will also try to vary the angle to cover the target from different sides. Since the max range is 4, I will try distances of 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the target.
