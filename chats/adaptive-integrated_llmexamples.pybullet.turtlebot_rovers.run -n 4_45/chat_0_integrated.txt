           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means two rovers are at their respective configurations, their stores are free, and several images and analyses have been received. Looking at the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, we need:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: `v3`, `v1`, `v4` are type `v2` (stone).
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Need to analyze and send analysis for a stone.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: `v7`, `v8`, `v5` are type `v6` (soil).
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Need to analyze and send analysis for a soil.
           
           The only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           The `move` actions `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)` would result in the rovers staying in their current configurations (`v13` and `v15` respectively), which are already satisfied by the initial state. These actions don't change the state in a way that helps achieve the goal, and they don't introduce new configurations.
           The `drop_rock` actions `(drop_rock v12 v16)` and `(drop_rock v14 v16)` also don't help, as the stores are already free. These actions would require `full` as a precondition, which is not true.
           
           The problem requires receiving images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`), which are achieved by the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. However, these actions are not available in the given list of valid action instances. Also, `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock` are missing.
           
           Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved with the provided limited set of actions.
           
           The goal cannot be achieved from the initial state because the necessary actions to produce `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not in the list of valid action instances. Specifically, `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions are missing from the available actions.
