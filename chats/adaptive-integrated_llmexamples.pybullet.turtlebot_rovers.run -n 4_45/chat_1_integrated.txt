           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This means we need to take images of objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 and send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. Rover v12 and v14 both have camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v2 and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v6 and send the analysis. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           For the `receivedimage` goals:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and then send them to the lander. We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for the required objects using configurations `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and ray `#o4` and `#o1` respectively. It's efficient to do all image-related tasks with one rover. Let's use rover v12.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for `v17` using configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`, but we need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` to sample rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This means we need to take images of objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 and send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. Rover v12 and v14 both have camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v2 and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v6 and send the analysis. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           For the `receivedimage` goals:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and then send them to the lander. We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for the required objects using configurations `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and ray `#o4` and `#o1` respectively. It's efficient to do all image-related tasks with one rover. Let's use rover v12.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for `v17` using configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`, but we need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v5` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.

The AABB for `v17` is ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). We need to be within 2 units. The AABB for `v21` is ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)).

           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`. We need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v5` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           
           Let's organize the movements to minimize redundant actions.
           
           1. Rover v12 starts at v13.
           2. Move v12 to #o3 for imaging.
           3. Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           4. Move v12 to #o0 for sending images.
           5. Send images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           6. Move v12 to #o5 for sampling rocks.
           7. Sample v3, send analysis, drop rock.
           8. Sample v5, send analysis.
           
           The previous configurations were causing collisions or were not reachable. We need to find valid configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` for rover `v12`.
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12): The target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). Obstacle `v21` is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). A configuration like (1.5, 2.0) should be clear of `v21` and within 2 units of `v17`.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible for v9 from v12): The lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A configuration like (-1.0, -1.0) would be closer to `v9` than (0.5, -0.2) and likely reachable. Let's try (-1.5, -1.0).
           
           For `#o5` (above v3, v5 from v12): `v3` is at ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303)). `v5` is at ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751)). A configuration like (0.7, -0.3) for v3 and (0.4, -1.8) for v5 should be good for sampling. A single config for both should be between them, let's try (0.6, -1.0).

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This means we need to take images of objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 and send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. Rover v12 and v14 both have camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v2 and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v6 and send the analysis. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           For the `receivedimage` goals:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and then send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for the required objects using configurations `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and ray `#o4` and `#o1` respectively. It's efficient to do all image-related tasks with one rover. Let's use rover v12.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for `v17` using configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`. We need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v5` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           
           Let's organize the movements to minimize redundant actions.
           
           1. Rover v12 starts at v13.
           2. Move v12 to #o3 for imaging.
           3. Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           4. Move v12 to #o0 for sending images.
           5. Send images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           6. Move v12 to #o5 for sampling rocks.
           7. Sample v3, send analysis, drop rock.
           8. Sample v5, send analysis.
           
           The previous configurations led to collisions or reachability issues. We need to find valid configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` for rover `v12`.
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12): The target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). Obstacle `v21` is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). Rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75). To be within 2 units of v17 and avoid v21, and to be reachable from (1.0, -1.75), a config like (1.0, 1.0) might be a good intermediate point to be more reachable for v17 and avoids obstacles. Or we can choose (1.0, 0.0) for v12 and (1.9, 2.1) for camera focus. But it is better if #o3 is close to v17. So we will select an `x,y` coordinates for the robot, not camera's focus. So a config like (1.6, 2.1) was colliding with v21. Let's try (1.6, 1.7). This should be clear of `v21` and reasonably close to `v17`.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible for v9 from v12): The lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75). Obstacle `v22` is at ((-1.453, -0.888), (-1.312, -0.747)). A configuration like (-1.5, -1.0) was colliding. Let's try to move further away from v22. How about (-2.0, -1.0)? This should be within 4 units of v9 and clear of v22.
           
           For `#o5` (above v3, v5 from v12): `v3` is at ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303)). `v5` is at ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751)). Rover v12 is at (1.0, -1.75). A single config for both should be between them, let's try (0.5, -0.8). This is reachable from (1.0, -1.75).

           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`. We need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.

           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.

           8. Sample v5, send analysis.
           
           The previous configurations had issues with reachability, collisions, or occlusions. We need to find new valid configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` for rover `v12`.
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12): The target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). Obstacle `v21` is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (1.6, 1.7) was colliding with `v21`. Let's try to stay further away from the obstacle `v21` while still having visibility to `v17`. A configuration like (1.0, 1.0) is reachable from `v13`. From (1.0, 1.0), `v17` is still visible.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible for v9 from v12): The lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Previous configuration (-2.0, -1.0) was occluded. We need a clear line of sight. Let's try to find a point that is more central and has a clear path to `v9`. Given that `v9` is in the bottom-left quadrant, a point like (-0.5, -0.5) could be a good candidate if there are no obstacles. The obstacle `v22` is at ((-1.453, -0.888), (-1.312, -0.747)). A configuration for `v12` at (-1.0, -0.5) might have line of sight to `v9` and avoid `v22`.
           
           For `#o5` (above v3, v5 from v12): `v3` is at ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303)). `v5` is at ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751)). Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (0.5, -0.8) was not reachable. Let's try (0.8, -1.0). This should be reachable from v13 and above v3 and v5.

User:      Configuration #o5 = (0.8 -1.0) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -0.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.0 1.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This means we need to take images of objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 and send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. Rover v12 and v14 both have camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v2 and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v6 and send the analysis. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           For the `receivedimage` goals:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and then send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for the required objects using configurations `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and ray `#o4` and `#o1` respectively. It's efficient to do all image-related tasks with one rover. Let's use rover v12.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for `v17` using configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`. We need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v5` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           
           Let's organize the movements to minimize redundant actions.
           
           1. Rover v12 starts at v13.
           2. Move v12 to #o3 for imaging.
           3. Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           4. Move v12 to #o0 for sending images.
           5. Send images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           6. Move v12 to #o5 for sampling rocks.
           7. Sample v3, send analysis, drop rock.
           8. Sample v5, send analysis.
           
           The previous configurations encountered reachability issues. We need to find valid configurations for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` for rover `v12`, keeping in mind the current position of `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12): The target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). Obstacle `v21` is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)). Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). To be reachable and visible for v17, let's try a point closer to v13 but still providing visibility. How about (0.8, 1.0)? This is reachable, and within range of v17, and avoids v21.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible for v9 from v12): The lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Obstacle `v22` is at ((-1.453, -0.888), (-1.312, -0.747)). A configuration for `v12` at (-1.0, -0.5) was not reachable. Let's try (-0.5, -1.5). This is reachable from (1.0, -1.75) and should be within communication range of `v9` and avoid `v22`.
           
           For `#o5` (above v3, v5 from v12): `v3` is at ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303)). `v5` is at ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751)). Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (0.8, -1.0) was not reachable. Let's try to stay closer to the current rover position for reachability. For v3, a config like (0.7, -0.5) might work. For v5, (0.4, -1.8). These are quite far apart. Maybe we should use `v14` for sampling rocks if it can reach better. But for the sake of simplicity and current structure, let's stick to v12.
           Let's try to pick a configuration `#o5` that is reachable from `v13` and can reach both `v3` and `v5`. (0.7, -1.5) is reachable from `v13` and is between v3 and v5.

           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.

           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v2 and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.

           Let's break down the plan:
           
           For the `receivedimage` goals:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and then send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for the required objects using configurations `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and ray `#o4` and `#o1` respectively. It's efficient to do all image-related tasks with one rover. Let's use rover v12.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for `v17` using configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`. We need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v5` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           
           Let's organize the movements to minimize redundant actions.
           
           1. Rover v12 starts at v13.
           2. Move v12 to #o3 for imaging.
           3. Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           4. Move v12 to #o0 for sending images.
           5. Send images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           6. Move v12 to #o5 for sampling rocks.
           7. Sample v3, send analysis, drop rock.
           8. Sample v5, send analysis.
           
           The previous configurations all failed due to reachability. This suggests that the continuous parameters generated for motion are not suitable for the selected (x,y) coordinates. The robot can only perform limited movements.
           Given the initial state `atconf(v12, v13)` where `v13` is (1.0, -1.75, 3.142), we should try to use configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that are closer to `v13`.
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12): The target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). From v13 (1.0, -1.75), to reach (0.8, 1.0) seems difficult due to the large y-distance.
           Let's analyze the problem again. The motion predicates explicitly state valid transitions. For `v12`, we have `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`, etc. This implies that the specific configurations `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` are actually reachable *from* `v13` (and vice-versa), even if the coordinates are far. The issue is likely in the coordinates provided for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates. These are the configurations for the *rover*.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the coordinates based on the targets and rover's current position (1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible): Target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). We need to be within 2 units. From (1.0, -1.75), a simple rotation might be enough if the target is in sight. Given that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is explicitly in the initial state, the system *should* be able to find a collision-free and occlusion-free configuration for `#o3`. Let's pick a default configuration (x,y) for `#o3` that corresponds to a rotation from `v13` towards `v17`. Since `v17` is in the upper right quadrant relative to `v13`, let's just pick something simple that the motion planner can resolve, for example, a point slightly to the right and up, such as (1.5, 0.0).
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible): Lander `v9` is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). This is in the bottom-left quadrant. Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). We need to be within 4 units. Previous attempts were too far or occluded. Let's try (-1.0, -1.5). This seems like a reasonable compromise. The obstacle `v22` is at ((-1.453, -0.888), (-1.312, -0.747)). So (-1.0, -1.5) would be clear of v22.
           
           For `#o5` (above): Target `v3` is at ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303)). Target `v5` is at ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751)). Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). To be "above" both, we need to be near them. Since `v5` is closer in y to `v12`, let's pick a config that is near `v5`. How about (0.4, -1.8)? This would place the rover very close to v5.
           
           Let's try these configurations, assuming the motion actions themselves are valid.

User:      Configuration #o5 = (0.4 -1.8) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.5 0.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to be met, including:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true in the initial state.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This means we need to take images of objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 and send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. Rover v12 and v14 both have camera v10 that supports mode v11.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v2 and send the analysis. Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This implies we need to analyze a rock of type v6 and send the analysis. Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           
           For the `receivedimage` goals:
           We need to calibrate the camera and take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and then send them to the lander v9, using mode v11. We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for the required objects using configurations `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, and ray `#o4` and `#o1` respectively. It's efficient to do all image-related tasks with one rover. Let's use rover v12.
           - Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for `v17` using configuration `#o3` and ray `#o4`.
           - Take an image of `v17` with `v12` using camera `v10` and mode `v11`.
           - Send the image of `v17` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           Repeat this for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`. Since `calibrate` uncalibrates the camera after `take_image`, we need to calibrate for each `take_image` action. The initial `atconf` for `v12` is `v13`. We need to move `v12` to `#o3` to `calibrate` and `take_image`, and then to `#o0` to `send_image`. The `motion` predicates show that `v12` can move between `v13`, `#o3` and `#o0`. Let's assume the `atconf` after `move` to `#o3` or `#o0` persists for subsequent actions at that same config.
           
           For the `receivedanalysis` goals:
           We need to analyze one rock of type v2 (e.g., v3) and one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5). We can use either rover v12 or v14. Both rovers have `above` predicates for rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8 using configuration `#o5`. We can use rover `v12` for this as well.
           - Move `v12` to `#o5` for sampling rocks.
           - Sample rock `v3` (type v2) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v3)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v3` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`. (Note: `send_analysis` also requires `comvisible` and `atconf`).
           - Drop rock `v3` from store `v16` of `v12` to free up space.
           - Sample rock `v5` (type v6) with `v12` into store `v16`. This makes `v12` have `analyzed(v12, v5)` and `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send the analysis of `v5` from `v12` to `v9` using configuration `#o0` and ray `#o1`.
           
           Let's organize the movements to minimize redundant actions.
           
           1. Rover v12 starts at v13.
           2. Move v12 to #o3 for imaging.
           3. Calibrate and take images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           4. Move v12 to #o0 for sending images.
           5. Send images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           6. Move v12 to #o5 for sampling rocks.
           7. Sample v3, send analysis, drop rock.
           8. Sample v5, send analysis.
           
           The repeated 'not reachable' errors suggest that the values I am choosing for the continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 are not valid from the start location v13 (1.0, -1.75). It's crucial to pick coordinates that are *reachable* from (1.0, -1.75) given the rover's movement capabilities. The rover can move between v13 and #o0, #o3, #o5. This implies these configurations are inherently reachable if the underlying continuous planner can find a path. The issue is likely the specific (x,y) coordinates I'm assigning to these general configurations, which are then checked against collisions/occlusions.
           
           Let's try to pick configurations *very close* to the current location v13 (1.0, -1.75), and let the motion planner resolve the paths.
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12): Target `v17` is at ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). Let's place #o3 very near v13, for instance (1.0, -1.0). This should be reachable. From this point, v17 is 3.1 units away (sqrt((1.88-1)^2 + (2.19 - (-1))^2)). This is still within the 2 unit limit of `imagevisible` if the camera extends. We need to be careful with coordinate interpretation. The coordinates for the rover are for its base. Let's try to keep the robot base close to targets. The initial state doesn't give a specific location for v13.
           Let's try:
           `#o3` (for image): Near target v17 ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243)). Let's try (1.8, 2.0). It's close to target, and assuming the robot can move there.
           `#o0` (for com): Near lander v9 ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Let's try (-2.0, -2.0).
           `#o5` (for above): Between v3 ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303)) and v5 ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751)). Let's try (0.5, -1.0).
           
           Since repeated attempts to find "reachable" configurations have failed when I'm guessing specific (x,y) values for '#oN' parameters, it strongly suggests that either the search space for reachable configurations is very constrained or my manual guesses are consistently outside valid bounds for the internal planner. The problem states that if `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND `#<name>` is used for `imagevisible` or `comvisible`, then *I* must provide the continuous value. It also states that if `motion(v, q1, t, q2)` is in the initial state, then `q1` can move to `q2`. In our case, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` etc. exist. This implies that the specific configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` ARE *intended* to be reachable from `v13`.
           
           The only possible path to success is to provide the values that would be found by the "separate algorithm" mentioned in the problem description. I will try to select a point for #o3 that is close to the initial position and *also* close to one of the objectives. This logic is clearly failing.
           
           What if the initial location v13 itself provides visibility?
           `imagevisible(v12, v13, #ray_from_v13_to_v17, v17)` is not in the initial state. So we must move.
           Let's try to re-evaluate the configurations, keeping in mind the initial robot position `v13` (1.0, -1.75). The goal `new-axiom@0()` doesn't explicitly mention `v13` or `v15` for the rover current configuration. It asks for `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. These are already true.
           
           The problem specifically asks for a plan that *achieves the goal*. If the specific (x,y) coordinates for `#oN` are continuously failing, perhaps the problem is indicating that the system's internal motion planner for these *symbolic* continuous variables is very specific about valid ranges, and my manual guesses are always wrong.
           
           Given that the problem description *provides* valid action instances including `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o0)`, etc., this implicitly tells us that these paths *exist* and are reachable. The issue is with the actual coordinates *I* need to provide for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for the visibility/above conditions.
           
           Let's assume the problem expects "reasonable" values that the motion planner can then confirm.
           I will try to pick configurations such that:
           1. They are distinct for each (rover, target) pair where a new configuration is needed. (Already doing this).
           2. They are within range for `imagevisible` (2 units) and `comvisible` (4 units).
           3. They are not in collision with explicitly mentioned AABBs.
           4. They are relatively close to the targets.
           5. They are reasonably central so as to be "reachable" by the robot base from its initial location (1.0, -1.75).
           
           `v17` is at (1.88, 2.19) (center). `v21` is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)).
           If `#o3` is (1.5, 1.5), it avoids `v21` (x < 1.75, y < 1.75). It is also within 2 units of `v17` (sqrt((1.88-1.5)^2 + (2.19-1.5)^2) = sqrt(0.38^2 + 0.69^2) = sqrt(0.1444 + 0.4761) = sqrt(0.6205) = 0.78 units).
           This looks like a valid image config.
           
           `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0) (center). `v22` is at ((-1.453, -0.888), (-1.312, -0.747)).
           If `#o0` is (-1.0, -1.0), it avoids `v22` (x > -1.312, y > -0.888). It is also within 4 units of `v9` (sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 1.0) = sqrt(1.81) = 1.34 units).
           This looks like a valid com config.
           
           `v3` is at (0.72, -0.35) (center). `v5` is at (0.45, -1.82) (center).
           If `#o5` is (0.6, -1.0), it should be above both.
           `v3`: (0.72, -0.35) vs rover (0.6, -1.0). Rover is below and slightly left.
           `v5`: (0.45, -1.82) vs rover (0.6, -1.0). Rover is above and right.
           This config is between the two rocks.
           
           Let's retry with these configurations.

User:      Configuration #o5 = (0.6 -1.0) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (1.5 1.5) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     It appears there's a fundamental misunderstanding or a severe constraint on the robot's movement or the validity of the continuous parameter configurations. The problem states that `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` implies a reachable path. However, every configuration I provide for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` is continuously flagged as "not reachable for robot base" or "in collision/occluded."
           
           Since the problem explicitly gives `motion` predicates for the symbolic continuous parameters (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`) to and from `v13` (the current `atconf` of `v12`), the system *should* be able to find a path for the robot base. The "reachability" constraint seems to be on the specific (x,y) values I assign, even though the symbolic action implies reachability. This suggests that the robot's base movement might be extremely limited, or that the continuous values for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` need to be exceptionally precise, or perhaps the 'reachable' predicate is defined in a way that my estimations are constantly failing.
           
           Given that I have repeatedly tried to find collision-free and occlusion-free points within range and close to the targets, and they are consistently rejected as 'not reachable', it implies that the robot's base cannot simply move to these arbitrary (x,y) coordinates in open space from `v13`. The current configuration `v13` is (1.0, -1.75). The available motion predicates `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)` imply that the symbolic configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are reachable from `v13`.
           
           The only logical conclusion for constant "not reachable" errors, despite my attempts to find collision-free and in-range configurations, is that the problem expects these continuous values to be *very* close to the initial rover position, or that there's some implicit geometry/kinematics for the rover that makes most positions unreachable. If I assume the robot can only rotate in place or make very small translations while still satisfying the visibility/above conditions, this might explain the errors.
           
           However, the problem also states: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object". This implies *I* must pick the values, and the problem will check them.
           
           Let's rethink how "reachable" works. If the rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), a configuration like (1.0, -1.70) is very close and likely reachable with a small movement, and (1.0, -1.75) is also valid if it were to rotate in place. If no point satisfies the combined constraints, then the problem is unsolvable. But this is the final attempt.
           
           I will try to keep the chosen configurations extremely close to the starting point `v13` (1.0, -1.75), essentially assuming the rover barely moves its base, and only rotates its camera/arm. This seems like a last resort. If this fails, then there's an inherent contradiction in the problem setup for the continuous values or the task is truly unreachable under these stringent conditions.
           
           New approach for continuous parameters, assuming very limited movement from (1.0, -1.75):
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible for v17, v18, v19, v20 from v12):
           `v17` is at (1.88, 2.19). `v21` is at ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)).
           If the rover base stays at (1.0, -1.75), it's far from `v17` (distance > 2 units). The `imagevisible` predicate implies the *rover's* configuration, not just the camera. This means the robot's base must move. The collision with `v21` at (1.5, 1.5) indicates that (1.5, 1.5) is either too close to an obstacle or simply not reachable from (1.0, -1.75) with valid intermediate path.
           
           This is a very hard problem if the "reachable" constraint is so strict that simple estimations within a 2D plane fail constantly. Since I cannot interactively test the reachability, I am forced to guess values. I will try to select points that are directly in line with the target from the initial position, but slightly offset to avoid collisions, still keeping them 'reachable' for the continuous path planner.
           
           Let's assume the continuous planner has a very complex way of determining reachability. I will try to use `v14` for some parts as well, as it is also a rover. `v14` is at `v15` which is (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `receivedimage` tasks:
           Let's use `v12` to handle `v17` and `v19` (closer to v12 initial position in x), and `v14` to handle `v18` and `v20` (closer to v14 initial position in x).
           
           For `v12` and `#o3`: `v17` (1.88, 2.19), `v19` (0.62, 1.98). Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75).
           For `v17`: (1.5, 1.5) was rejected. Let's try (1.2, 1.0). This is somewhat central, avoiding `v21`.
           For `v19`: Let's use `v12` at (0.6, 1.5).
           
           For `v14` and `#o3`: `v18` (-0.52, 2.13), `v20` (-2.06, 1.92). Rover `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           For `v18`: Let's use `v14` at (-0.7, 1.5).
           For `v20`: Let's use `v14` at (-1.8, 1.5).
           
           For `send_image` tasks:
           Need `comvisible` to `v9` (center at (-1.9, -2.0)).
           For `v12` and `#o0`: Current position for v12 is for example (1.2, 1.0). `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0). A config like (0.0, 0.0) might be reachable from both (1.2, 1.0) and (-1.0, -1.0) for v14.
           This split makes the problem much more complex to coordinate and also requires more movements. Let's revert to using one rover and focus on finding *one* set of working continuous parameters.
           
           Let's assume the problem statement implies there *are* reachable and valid (x,y) configurations for each #object, and my choice of (x,y) for these is the issue. I'll go back to simpler (x,y) pairs, trying to be as close to the initial (1.0, -1.75) as possible while still being 'near' the targets, and hoping one of these will pass the internal checks.
           
           If the rover cannot move far, the problem might be unsolvable with the given predicates. But I must find a plan.
           
           Let's check the bounding boxes again.
           v13: (1.0, -1.75, theta)
           v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           v17: ((1.833, 2.145), (1.931, 2.243))
           v18: ((-0.56, 2.096), (-0.486, 2.17))
           v19: ((0.579, 1.937), (0.673, 2.031))
           v20: ((-2.111, 1.878), (-2.015, 1.974))
           v3: ((0.669, -0.408), (0.774, -0.303))
           v5: ((0.381, -1.889), (0.519, -1.751))
           Obstacles:
           v21: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))
           v22: ((-1.453, -0.888), (-1.312, -0.747))
           
           From (1.0, -1.75):
           To image v17 (1.88, 2.19): Very far, approx. 4 units. Must move. A config around (1.0, 0.0) could be a better intermediate point.
           To image v18 (-0.52, 2.13): Far.
           To image v19 (0.62, 1.98): Far.
           To image v20 (-2.06, 1.92): Very far.
           
           To communicate to v9 (-1.9, -2.0): From (1.0, -1.75) is approx 3 units. A config at (0.0, -1.0) would be closer to v9 (around 2 units), and should avoid v22.
           
           To be above v3 (0.72, -0.35): From (1.0, -1.75) is approx 1.5 units. A config at (0.7, -0.5) might work if reachable.
           To be above v5 (0.45, -1.82): From (1.0, -1.75) is approx 0.6 units. A config at (0.45, -1.8) is very close and likely reachable.
           
           It seems the primary issue is the image objectives being far from the rover's initial position. I will try to find a *single* position for `#o3` that can see all objectives, and that position needs to be reachable.
           
           Let's assume there is a 'central' position which `v12` can reach from `v13`, and from which it can view all objectives and communicate. This position needs to be free of obstacles. Let's try (0.0, 0.0).
           From (0.0, 0.0):
           v17 (1.88, 2.19): dist ~ 2.9 (too far for image)
           v18 (-0.52, 2.13): dist ~ 2.2 (too far for image)
           v19 (0.62, 1.98): dist ~ 2.0 (ok for image)
           v20 (-2.06, 1.92): dist ~ 2.8 (too far for image)
           v9 (-1.9, -2.0): dist ~ 2.7 (ok for com)
           
           So (0.0, 0.0) is not good for all imaging.
           
           Let's choose `v14` for imaging/comms as it starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           From (-1.0, -1.75):
           `v17` (1.88, 2.19): dist ~ 4.9 (too far)
           `v18` (-0.52, 2.13): dist ~ 3.9 (ok for image)
           `v19` (0.62, 1.98): dist ~ 3.8 (ok for image)
           `v20` (-2.06, 1.92): dist ~ 3.7 (ok for image)
           `v9` (-1.9, -2.0): dist ~ 1.2 (ok for com)
           
           This suggests `v14` might be better for the image/comm tasks for some of the objectives.
           Let's try to achieve the goal with `v14` for imaging `v18`, `v19`, `v20`, and `v12` for `v17`. This increases complexity. Let's stick with one rover.
           
           I will attempt a final plan with configurations chosen to be *exactly* the midpoint coordinates of the bounding boxes of the targets, as this is the most "ideal" spot. If these fail on reachability, then the problem is unsolvable by manually providing these values, as there seems to be an inherent contradiction in the "reachable" condition with any reasonable set of coordinates.
           
           Final attempt with the "ideal" target positions as the rover configurations.
           `#o3` to image `v17`: Center of v17 is (1.88, 2.19). This is the rover's configuration.
           `#o0` to com `v9`: Center of v9 is (-1.9, -2.0).
           `#o5` to sample `v3` and `v5`: Let's choose the center of `v3` for `#o5` which is (0.72, -0.35).

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     I apologize for the repeated failures in finding suitable continuous configurations. The problem specifies that I *must* provide these values, and the consistent "not reachable" or "in collision/occluded" responses for even logically sound estimates (e.g., center of target, or slightly offset to avoid known obstacles) indicates a significant difficulty in satisfying the hidden continuous constraints. It's likely that the internal continuous motion planner is either extremely sensitive or has very limited movement capabilities that are not apparent from the 2D AABB information.
           
           Given the current state of information, where providing any `(x,y)` coordinate for the rover's base location results in a failure of reachability, collision, or occlusion, and without any way to query the internal continuous planner or obtain a valid sample, it is impossible for me to determine correct continuous values that satisfy all conditions. The set of valid (x,y) coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) appears to be empty or extremely small given the constraints.
           
           Therefore, I must conclude that, based on my ability to determine suitable continuous values, the goal is not achievable from the initial state *under the current interpretation of the continuous parameters and the robot's capabilities*. The "not reachable for robot base" error specifically indicates that the robot cannot physically get to that (x,y) position from its starting (1.0, -1.75) within the simulated environment. If the robot cannot even move to a position to view the objectives or sample rocks, the task cannot be completed.
           
           I cannot provide a plan because I am unable to generate a set of continuous configurations that satisfy the given constraints (collision-free, occlusion-free, reachable) as checked by the system.
