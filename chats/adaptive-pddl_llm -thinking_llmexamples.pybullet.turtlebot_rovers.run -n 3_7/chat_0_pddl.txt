           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unattainable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, I've analyzed the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the available actions. It's clear the goal requires several conditions, primarily focusing on receiving images and analyses of samples. Specifically, I need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` and `receivedanalysis` for both a stone and soil.
           
           The problem, as I see it, lies in the *extremely* limited set of actions allowed. I can only use `move` and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, or related actions are permitted.
           
           My initial thought was to use the typical image-taking and sample analysis sequence, but that's impossible given the action restrictions. `send_image` is necessary to achieve the `receivedimage` goals, and `send_analysis` is needed for `receivedanalysis`. Neither of these actions are available in my permissible action list.
           
           Thus, because the actions needed to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal are unavailable, it is impossible to construct a plan that achieves it. There is no combination of `move` and `drop_rock` that can generate the necessary preconditions to satisfy the goal. This is a fundamental constraint of the problem's definition.
