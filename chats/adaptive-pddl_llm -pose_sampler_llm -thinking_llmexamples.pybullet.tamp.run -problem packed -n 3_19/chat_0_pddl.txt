(Thoughts: **Placing a Square Object: A Plan for 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to create 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) with dimensions approximately 0.07 x 0.07 on a square surface (surface 0, bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135)). I need to find the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x, y coordinates for each placement.
           
           Since the object is square, rotations by 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 result in the same bounding box. To ensure the object remains within the surface, I need to consider the bounding box size after rotation.
           
           The dimensions of the rotated bounding box are determined by:
           *   width = side * ( |cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)| )
           *   height = side * ( |sin(theta)| + |cos(theta)| )
           
           Given the surface's dimensions, I calculated the permissible range for x and y, and I know the worst-case scenario occurs when theta = π/4 (or multiples of that angle) which makes the rotated object the largest.
           
           To generate diverse placements and maintain stability, I'll leverage:
           
           *   **Surface:** Fixed at surface 0 for all placements.
           *   **Rotation Angles:** I'll use just two angles: 0 and π/4.
           *   **x and y Coordinates:**  I'll define a set of 5 evenly spaced x-coordinates and 5 evenly spaced y-coordinates within the surface, centered around 0. These will always be valid because the maximum bounding box will always fit with these parameters. This creates 25 combinations of (x,y) for each angle, for a total of 50 combinations.
           
           This approach will ensure that all 50 placements are stable (object's bounding box will always be contained inside surface 0) and cover a range of positions and orientations. This also will provide coverage over the bounding space.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing object ID 5, ensuring it avoids a collision with object ID 4. I'll need to consider the constraints of the placement surface (surface 0) and object 4's bounding box.
           
           First, I analyzed the bounding box (AABB) of object 4, which is approximately the region `[-0.115, -0.045] x [-0.115, -0.045]`. Next, I looked at the extents of object 5, which are 0.0877 units. This object is square and I'm placing it on surface 0, which has an extent of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I calculated the worst-case AABB for object 5 with respect to rotation. For object 5, the maximum AABB side length is approximately 0.124. This informs my strategy to consider two rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians). I'm planning to place 50 objects in total, so I need to make 25 placements at each angle.
           
           For the 0-degree rotation, the surface limits are easy to reason. I calculated that the object's center must be in `[-0.09, 0.09] x [-0.09, 0.09]`, which represents the center range. I refined this logic to determine the safe range that doesn't cause collision with object 4, such that `[-0.00113, 0.09114] x [-0.00113, 0.09114]`. I can place my objects at points with x and y coordinates that start at (0, 0), and move by 0.02, using 5 values in both x and y.
           
           For the 45-degree rotation, the constraints with respect to object 4 are different, due to the worst-case expansion of the bounding box. The center must be within `[0.017, 0.073] x [0.017, 0.073]`. To generate 25 placements with this rotation, I can start at (0.02, 0.02), and move by 0.01, using 5 values in both x and y.
           
           By following this grid strategy and considering the object rotation, I can confirm that the new object does not collide with the previously placed object, and is entirely within the bounds of surface 0.

           Okay, here's my plan for placing object ID 5, ensuring it avoids a collision with object ID 4. I'll need to consider the constraints of the placement surface (surface 0) and object 4's bounding box.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Object Placement for ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I've got a request to find 50 stable placements for object 6 (a square) on surface 0.  I *must* avoid collisions with the two obstacles already in place: object 4 and object 5. My first thought is to get a handle on the geometry and any constraints that will immediately limit my placement options.
           
           I've got the dimensions for object 6, a square with a size `s6`. The surface, surface 0, is a square centered at the origin, with a half-width of `0.135`. The first thing I'll do is figure out the *potential* extent of object 6 across the surface. Then I can figure out the regions where it *can* go. I need to account for rotation; I *know* the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) will change depending on the rotation.
           
           For a square, the maximum extent occurs at a 45-degree angle. That is `s6 * sqrt(2)`. The max half width, when calculating AABB, is ~0.063. So to make sure the square is *fully* within the surface, I need to constrain its center coordinates `(cx6, cy6)` to a smaller square: `[-0.07145, 0.07145]`. Good so far.
           
           Now the collision aspect: I've got to define the AABB of the two fixed obstacles. Object 4, at coordinates (-0.08, -0.08), is a square with side `s4 = 0.07`. So its half-extents will be `s4/2`. Object 5, is at the center (0,0) and a larger `s5 = 0.0877`.  It's AABB half extents will be `s5/2`.
           
           Okay, next.  I'll need to figure out the collision-free regions, accounting for those rotations. I'll consider two cases: 0 degrees and 45 degrees.
           
           If I set the angle to 0, I can directly calculate the half-extents. It'll be `s6/2`. Surface boundaries will then be `[-0.090069, 0.090069]`.
           
           Then collision check for Object 4: I need to calculate the ranges in which the center of object 6 can't fall into, to ensure non-overlap. The range is `(-0.159942, -0.000058)` (x and y). And for object 5, `(-0.08879, 0.08879)` for x and y. If I try to do 0 deg rotation, I need to make sure to avoid those ranges.
           
           If I take the initial bounds `[-0.090069, 0.090069]` for *x and y*, and remove collision zones, I'm left with a tiny range: `[0.08879, 0.090069]`. And the same range for y. This means I'm confined to that small square in the top-right corner if the orientation stays at 0. That's difficult to fill 50 points.
           
           Let's check the rotated case. Rotate it by 45 degrees (`pi/4` radians). The half-extent is now `s6 * sqrt(2) / 2 = ~ 0.0635`. Then the new bounds are `[-0.07145, 0.07145]`. But collision with Object 5 will still be an issue.
           
           And now I realize the crucial problem: since object 5 is at the origin, and since rotating Object 6 requires it to have a *larger* bounding box, there's *no space* for object 6 at 45 degrees if it's on the surface. Collision will always happen.
           
           So, I can only use 0 rotation (and by extension 90, 180, and 270 degrees) to place the object without overlap, since the width and height of the box stay the same.
           
           And it means I am restricted by Object 5's size. Given the previous points, if the angle is always the cardinal one, Object 6 must stay within `0.08879, 0.09007` for both `cx6` and `cy6`. A very small square.
           
           I have to try and solve this. If I can
