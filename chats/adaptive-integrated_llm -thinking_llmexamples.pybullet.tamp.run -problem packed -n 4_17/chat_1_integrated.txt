User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.142, 0.171), (0.241, 0.27)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.002, -0.387), (0.092, -0.294)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.285, -0.192), (-0.188, -0.095)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.129, 0.392), (-0.031, 0.49)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.192, 0.221, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.401, 0.916).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.045, -0.341, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.847, 0.532).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.143, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.473, 0.881).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.08, 0.441, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.32, 0.947).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to manipulate the environment to ensure objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 are situated upon object v18. I understand this translates directly into achieving the 'on' predicate, which necessitates two conditions: these objects must be 'supported' by v18, and they must be positioned at specific poses.
           
           To accomplish this, I'll identify suitable poses for each object on v18, ensuring 'supported' holds true. Then, I will devise a plan of action involving the robot's capabilities to move each object to its designated pose.  Initially, all these objects reside atop v11.
           
           Let's break down the current state:
           
           *   **Objects and their targets:**
               *   v8: Currently at pose v9 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v8,v18)`.
               *   v12: Currently at pose v13 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v12,v18)`.
               *   v14: Currently at pose v15 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v14,v18)`.
               *   v16: Currently at pose v17 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v16,v18)`.
           
               For each object, I'll need to define a target pose where 'supported' is true in relation to v18.
           
               Based on the available actions, only pick and place actions are available, so I have to create a plan with those actions.
           
           The Robot has two arms: v4 and v6. Both are currently handempty.
           
           The current state gives me these predicates for the arm configurations, poses, and the base: `atbconf(v3)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `atpose(v14, v15)`, `atpose(v16, v17)`, `handempty(v4)`, `handempty(v6)`, `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `supported(v12, v13, v11)`, `supported(v14, v15, v11)`, `supported(v16, v17, v11)`.
           
           The existing actions I can use: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, `cook`. `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. The only `move_base` action available keeps the robot base in place (from v3 to v3).
           The available actions are `pick` and `place` so I will use those to satisfy the goal.
           
           The target placement area (v18) has dimensions suitable for four roughly 0.1x0.1m objects.
           To solve the problem, I will iterate over the objects and perform `pick` and `place` actions in sequence to move each object to the target pose on v18:
           
           *   **Move v8:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v8, #p_v8_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           *   **Move v12:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v12, #p_v12_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           *   **Move v14:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v14, #p_v14_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           *   **Move v16:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v16, #p_v16_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           I have decided to use the same `#o2` pose to all objects on the table, but the prompt says to use different #values, so I have renamed them. I have designed the pose to be x=0.

Model:     **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to manipulate the environment to ensure objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 are situated upon object v18. I understand this translates directly into achieving the 'on' predicate, which necessitates two conditions: these objects must be 'supported' by v18, and they must be positioned at specific poses.

           Let's break down the current state:
           
           *   **Objects and their targets:**
               *   v8: Currently at pose v9 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v8,v18)`.
               *   v12: Currently at pose v13 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v12,v18)`.
               *   v14: Currently at pose v15 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v14,v18)`.
               *   v16: Currently at pose v17 supported by v11. Aiming for `on(v16,v18)`.
           
               For each object, I'll need to define a target pose where 'supported' is true in relation to v18.
           
               Based on the available actions, only pick and place actions are available, so I have to create a plan with those actions.
           
           The Robot has two arms: v4 and v6. Both are currently handempty.
           
           The current state gives me these predicates for the arm configurations, poses, and the base: `atbconf(v3)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `atpose(v14, v15)`, `atpose(v16, v17)`, `handempty(v4)`, `handempty(v6)`, `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `supported(v12, v13, v11)`, `supported(v14, v15, v11)`, `supported(v16, v17, v11)`.
           
           The existing actions I can use: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, `cook`. `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. The only `move_base` action available keeps the robot base in place (from v3 to v3).
           The available actions are `pick` and `place` so I will use those to satisfy the goal.
           
           The target placement area (v18) has dimensions suitable for four roughly 0.1x0.1m objects.
           To solve the problem, I will iterate over the objects and perform `pick` and `place` actions in sequence to move each object to the target pose on v18:
           
           *   **Move v8:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v8, #p_v8_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           *   **Move v12:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v12, #p_v12_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           *   **Move v14:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v14, #p_v14_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           *   **Move v16:**
               *   Pick: `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)`
               *   Place: `place(v4, v16, #p_v16_on_v18, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           I have decided to use the same `#o2` pose to all objects on the table, but the prompt says to use different #values, so I have renamed them. I have designed the pose to be x=0.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been called out on a significant error: my previous plan included actions that aren't actually allowed. I'm limited to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. That's a huge constraint.  Let's re-evaluate this.
           
           My initial state has a bunch of `atpose` and `supported` facts, along with `stackable` and potential poses for the objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) that need to be stacked on v18. I need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  My definition of `on` tells me I need both `supported` and `atpose` for each object to be true.
           
           Currently, those objects are *supported* by v11, not v18.  The goal necessitates changing their poses to a state where they are supported by v18.
           
           The problem? My *only* action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't *do* anything useful. It essentially moves the base to the same location and sets `canmove` to false, without touching the poses of any objects. I can't pick things up, I can't place them down.
           
           Thus, with only this single, useless action, there is no way to change the `atpose` of v8, v12, v14, or v16. They will remain where they are, on v11, and the `on` predicates simply cannot be satisfied.  The goal is unreachable, given the incredibly restricted action set. I'm completely stymied.
