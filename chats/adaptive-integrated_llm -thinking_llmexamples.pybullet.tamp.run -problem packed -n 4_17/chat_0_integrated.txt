User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.142, 0.171), (0.241, 0.27)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.002, -0.387), (0.092, -0.294)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.285, -0.192), (-0.188, -0.095)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.129, 0.392), (-0.031, 0.49)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.192, 0.221, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.401, 0.916).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.045, -0.341, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.847, 0.532).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.143, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.473, 0.881).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.08, 0.441, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.32, 0.947).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've got the objective: get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`. Standard object manipulation problem, I see.  My immediate thought is, "Gotta use `place` actions," because the goal condition, `on(object, v18)`, directly implies placing each object on `v18`.  `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose`, so I need to find new poses for each object that are supported by `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see the objects are currently on `v11` and have distinct poses.  I'd lay out a simple plan: `pick` each object, move it to a suitable pose supported by `v18`, and then `place` it.  Something like, for `v8`:  `pick v8 from v9`, `place v8 on #p_v8_v18`.  Repeat for the other objects.  Simple enough.
           
           Here's where it gets interesting.  The crucial part is the constraint: *Only* the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted.  That's... extremely limiting.  No `pick`, no `place`, no changing the poses of any objects.
           
           I re-read the prompt, just to be sure. Yep, the instruction is clear: I'm *only* allowed to use that `move_base` action instance.  That means the robot's base configuration doesn't change – which is probably not the issue here.
           
           Since only that one `move_base` action is available, I'm stuck. It's a fundamental issue. The robot can't directly manipulate objects. I cannot change the `atpose` predicate of the objects. The current predicates regarding the `atpose` can not be changed given that actions `pick` and `place` are unavailable.
           
           Therefore, the target condition - the goal - is unachievable, given these restrictions. It's a case of an unsolvable planning problem because of an incomplete action set.  I can't even get started because the necessary tools ( `pick` and `place` actions) are not provided.
