           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal - A Discrepancy in Available Actions**
           
           My analysis reveals a fundamental problem in achieving the `new-axiom@0()` goal: the provided set of "valid action instances" is insufficient.  I began by meticulously dissecting the goal, identifying the necessary predicates to be achieved: receiving images of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) with mode `v11`, and receiving analyses of a stone and soil sample. I then constructed a detailed plan involving the actions `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, along with supporting actions like `drop_rock` to manage store availability. I had to assume that `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` were compatible with locations in the `atconf` initial states and could therefore be used in the plan. This was necessary because there were no "move" actions to change the rovers location to another configuration, but this assumption might be wrong.
           
           However, the crucial constraint is the list of permitted actions. My detailed plan requires actions *not* present in that list. The available actions only include "move" operations that don't actually change position and `drop_rock`. No `take_image` or `send_analysis` actions exist to achieve the core goal. Since the instructions state that any action *not* in the list is prohibited, the goal, as defined, is logically unreachable with the given resources. The fundamental operations required for observation and analysis are missing.  Therefore, I must conclude that the task, as presented, cannot be accomplished.
