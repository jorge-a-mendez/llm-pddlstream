User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.191, -0.458), (0.281, -0.368)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.179, -0.313), (0.277, -0.215)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.176, 0.301), (0.269, 0.394)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.236, -0.413, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.171, 0.985).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.111, 0.469), (0.19, 0.548)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.228, -0.264, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.946, -0.323).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.223, 0.348, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.846, 0.532).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.15, 0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, -0.071).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) currently located on a surface v11. The goal is to move all of these objects onto surface v18. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are initially empty. The robot is at a base configuration v3. The only available action instance is a `move_base` action that moves the robot from v3 to v3 via a base trajectory #o0, indicating the robot does not need to move its base for this task. The problem requires placing all four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on surface v18. Since there are no pick or place actions in the `available action instances` list, and thus the robot cannot pick up or place any objects, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `kin` predicates, `pickcost()`, `placecost()`, `distance()`, `test-cfree-pose-pose-negative`, `test-cfree-approach-pose-negative`, `test-cfree-traj-pose-negative`, and the object types `sink` and `stove` are not used in the available actions, thus do not contribute to solving this problem.
           
           The problem requires a continuous value for `#o2` for each object when placed on surface `v18`. Since pick and place actions are not available, I can't generate a plan. If pick and place actions were available, I would choose collision-free poses for each object on `v18`. Since surface `v18` is described with an AABB, I would place the objects within these bounds.
