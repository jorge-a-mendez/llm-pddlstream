           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to fulfill the specified goal, `new-axiom@0()`. This demands a detailed analysis of the goal's structure and the available actions within the provided PDDL framework.  It appears, initially, that the primary challenge is to satisfy several predicates.  A deeper dive into the provided problem is needed.
           **Goal Decomposition and State Analysis**
           
           The crux of `new-axiom@0()` hinges on achieving the following:
           
           -   `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           -   `receivedanalysis(rock_type)` for all rocks.
           
           To satisfy these requirements, the following actions are needed :
           
           -   `send_image` for the imaging tasks
           -   `send_analysis`, or `sample_rock` for the analysis task.
           
           Crucially, the initial state is evaluated and the initial `true` and `false` states are considered.
           
           **Action Feasibility and Constraint Evaluation**
           
           An exhaustive review of all potential actions is needed, including preconditions.
           
           The challenge arises from the *limited* action set permitted in this scenario. The available actions encompass only movements (`move`) and rock disposal (`drop_rock`). The `send_image`, `send_analysis`, and `sample_rock` actions - essential for meeting the goal - are conspicuously *absent* from the permitted actions. Therefore, I conclude that it is impossible to generate a plan.
           
           **Conclusion: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Given the restrictions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*. The specified plan requires the utilization of `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, actions not listed within the allowed set.
