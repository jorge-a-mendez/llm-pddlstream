           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan:**
           
           I need to find three suitable robot base positions for a given target point, ensuring they're within a 2-unit radius of the target, and avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles while maintaining a clear line of sight to the target. The robot's orientation will automatically be adjusted to face the target. The base's x and y coordinates are restricted to the range [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           My initial approach involves parsing the provided AABB obstacle data to represent the scene. The critical challenge is the target's position, which is exceptionally close to the central vertical wall (obstacle 5). A key strategy will be to place the robot base on the "same side" as the target concerning this wall, assuming that the wall does not *completely* block line of sight.
           
           I'll generate candidate positions around the target, filter out points that collide with obstacles or are occluded by them, and attempt to pick diverse positions. A more robust algorithm would require formal line segment-AABB intersection checks, but for a first attempt, I can get a good estimate based on approximate rules.
           
           The main challenge will be maintaining line of sight to a point that's effectively *inside* the central wall - this presents an unusual situation. Since the target is within the x-range of obstacle 5, the most natural interpretation is that line of sight to the target is *assumed* to be valid, otherwise, the problem would be unresolvable. To achieve this, the robot needs to be positioned on the "other side" of this wall, which I'll denote as a point `P(px, py)` where `px < -0.05`.
           
           After much deliberation regarding various obstacle positions, line of sight conditions, and constraints, I carefully picked candidate points that appear to fulfill the criteria.

           Okay, based on the previous feedback, it's clear I misjudged something related to target points and obstacle interactions. The initial target point I was working with was different from the *current* target point, which led to incorrect assumptions about the line of sight. It's crucial I *always* use the target point provided in the *current* request to avoid this mistake.

(Thoughts: **Targeting Success: Navigating the Obstacle Course**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I've got a new target point, `T = (2.084, 2.049)`, and I've got to find three valid positions. I'm building on the feedback from previous attempts, carefully analyzing why those positions failed. It seems the system's collision detection is more granular than my initial checks. I'm pretty sure I need to build in a safety margin - a 'robot radius', if you will - to avoid collisions with any of the obstacles.
           
           First, I identified the critical issue: the previous error messages gave me coordinates that collided *within* the obstacle, not in the adjacent spaces. I need to be more precise. It looks like the system measures collisions in an "expanded" version of the obstacles. So, to avoid the central rectangle (Obstacle 7), and the smaller rectangle nested within it (Obstacle 21) that also houses the target, I'm going to steer clear and use a robot radius of 0.05 units.
           
           My strategy? Generate locations that:
           
           1.  **Stay close to the Target**: Within 2 units, of course.
           2.  **Avoid Obstacles with 'Clearance'**: Avoids being in a collision.
           3.  **Ensure a Clear View**: Ensures a straight shot to the target (by not crossing any other obstacles, except those hosting the target.)
           
           Here are the positions that meet these criteria:
           
           *   **P1: (1.6, 2.049)** - This position is to the left of the rectangle that hosts the target, safely out of collision zone.
           *   **P2: (2.084, 1.6)** - This position lies below the rectangle.
           *   **P3: (2.084, 2.35)** - This is positioned above.
           
           I think these positions should work - they've been designed to avoid those pesky collisions and make the view nice and clear!

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Navigating a Complex Scene with Imperfect Feedback**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new target point: `(-0.358, 2.163)` which, of course, is nestled snugly inside Obstacle 20.  The main challenge is that I'm still trying to decipher this "collides with" feedback. Is it a strict point-in-AABB check, a line-of-sight thing, or something else entirely?  Based on past failures, I'm leaning toward a very strict line-of-sight interpretation where *any* obstacle intersecting the line from robot to target is a no-go, *except* for the obstacle containing the target itself (fingers crossed that's allowed!). This, of course, creates a super-restrictive environment.
           
           The previous failures are muddying the waters, suggesting that if a target is in an obstacle, and the line goes through that obstacle (even if it's the target's obstacle), there is a 'collision'. But it makes this problem unsolveable.  My current plan is:
           
           *   **Robot Base Collision:**  Ensure the robot's base (as a point) is not within any fixed obstacle AABB.
           *   **Line of Sight:**  The line from the robot's base to the target must not intersect any fixed obstacle's AABB *except* for the one containing the target (O20 in this case).
           
           So I've analyzed the obstacles and determined:
           1.  Target: (-0.358, 2.163) in Obstacle 20.
           2.  Obstacle 10 also surrounds this point.
           
           And here are three candidate positions to get this robot looking at the target:
           - P1: (-1.5, 2.3)
           - P2: (-0.2, 1.7)
           - P3: (-0.6, 1.5)
           
           These positions are outside all *clearly* visible obstacles and are relatively clear, so the LOS path to target has the highest chance of passing and are within the bounds of `max_range = 2`.
           
           I'm making a leap of faith here, assuming the "collides with" and "no line of sight" failures from past prompts are for another, unrelated problem.  If this fails, the problem may be unsolvable, given the constraints.  Let's see what the system says this time.
