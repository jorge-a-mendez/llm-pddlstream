           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q12', '#t42'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g5', '#q12', '#t32'))

           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p11', '#g4', '#q17', '#t43'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v12', 'p10', 'v8', 'p9')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal is to place all three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on the surface v16.
           Currently, v8 is at v9 (on v11), v12 is at v13 (on v11), and v14 is at v15 (on v11).
           The robot is at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5.
           We need to pick each object, move the base, and place the object on a pose supported by v16.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing v12 at p10 collided with v8 at p9. This means p9 and p10 are too close for these objects or the objects themselves are too large. We need to choose different poses for v8, v12, and v14 on v16 that do not collide with each other. Since v16 is a dummy surface (no AABB provided), and p3, p4, p6, p7, p9, p10, #o2 are supported by v16 and also by v10 (a dummy surface). p5, p8, p11 are supported by v16 and v10. Let's use #o2 for all placements on v16, and provide unique specific poses for each object to avoid collision.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 on #o2 (a unique pose for v8 on v16).
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 on #o2 (a unique pose for v12 on v16, different from v8's pose).
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 on #o2 (a unique pose for v14 on v16, different from v8 and v12's poses).

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The previous attempt had unstable poses for v12 and v14 on v16. The AABB for v16 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Let's re-evaluate the object AABBs for v8, v12, v14.
           v8: ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           v12: ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           v14: ((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))
           
           For v8 and v12, their AABBs are small, so they can be placed easily within v16.
           For v14, its y-dimension is larger (0.084). The previous attempt provided the pose for v14 at (-0.1, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0) which resulted in its AABB being ((-0.135, -0.035), (-0.065, 0.035)) when centered at (0.0, 0.0, 0.782). The issue is not just the center but also its internal structure. Let's assume the provided AABB is relative to the object's origin.
           
           Let's adjust the poses for v8, v12, and v14 to ensure stability on v16. We'll place them at different x-coordinates within the bounds of v16 to avoid collision and ensure stability.
           The AABB for v16 is x in [-0.135, 0.135] and y in [-0.135, 0.135].
           For v8 (AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))): Let's place it near the center, e.g., (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). Its effective AABB on the surface will be ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)), which is within v16.
           For v12 (AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))): Let's place it slightly to the positive x, e.g., (0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). Its effective AABB on the surface will be ((0.035, -0.035), (0.105, 0.035)), which is within v16.
           For v14 (AABB = ((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))): This object is long in the negative y direction. If we place it with (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0), its extent in y will be approximately from -0.458 to -0.374, which is outside the y-range of v16. We need to orient it or place it such that its entire footprint is within v16. A 90-degree rotation might help.
           Let's try rotating v14 by 90 degrees (theta = pi/2 or -pi/2).
           If theta = pi/2, the AABB effectively becomes ((-0.458, -0.054), (-0.374, 0.03)). We still have a problem with the large extent.
           Let's re-read the AABB. It is for the object, not its current pose. So for object v14, ((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374)). This implies it's centered at roughly (-0.012, -0.416). So at pose (x, y, z, theta) = (-0.1, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0), the object's relative AABB for v14 is ((-0.054-0.1, -0.458), (0.03-0.1, -0.374)), which is ((-0.154, -0.458), (-0.07, -0.374)). This is clearly outside the surface v16.
           
           The AABB `((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))` represents the *object's* dimensions relative to its own origin. When placed at a pose `(x, y, z, theta)`, we need to transform this AABB. However, a simpler interpretation is that the AABB provided is a tight fit around the object, and we need to make sure the object's full extent (which is roughly `max(x_dim, y_dim)` if rotated, or `x_dim` and `y_dim` if not) fits within the surface.
           For v14, the object has an approximate width of (0.03 - (-0.054)) = 0.084 and a length of (-0.374 - (-0.458)) = 0.084. These dimensions are suitable for placement on v16 without rotation.
           Let's pick new coordinates carefully.
           v16 AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           
           v8 (AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)) - total width/length 0.07):
           Let's place v8 at (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). This gives an AABB of ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)), which is within v16.
           
           v12 (AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)) - total width/length 0.07):
           Let's place v12 at (0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). Its AABB relative to the world would be ((0.07-0.035, 0.0-0.035), (0.07+0.035, 0.0+0.035)) = ((0.035, -0.035), (0.105, 0.035)). This fits within v16.
           
           v14 (AABB = ((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374)) - total width 0.084, length 0.084):
           Let's place v14 at (-0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). Its AABB relative to the world would be ((-0.07-0.054, 0.0-0.458), (-0.07+0.03, 0.0-0.374)) = ((-0.124, -0.458), (-0.04, -0.374)). This is still problematic because of the y-coordinates. The AABB `((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))` likely means that *the bounding box of the object itself* has minimum x/y and maximum x/y coordinates at those values when the object's origin is at (0,0,0) and rotation is 0.
           
           Let's assume the provided AABB for each object is *relative to its pose*. So, if we place v14 at (x,y,z,theta), the AABB in world coordinates would be translated by (x,y) and rotated by theta.
           For v14:
           Relative x_min = -0.054, x_max = 0.03. So x_center_obj = (-0.054 + 0.03) / 2 = -0.012
           Relative y_min = -0.458, y_max = -0.374. So y_center_obj = (-0.458 + -0.374) / 2 = -0.416
           The overall bounding box is 0.084 in x and 0.084 in y.
           
           Let's retry the placement for v14 considering its actual size:
           v14 has a size of 0.084 in x and 0.084 in y.
           To place it at (-0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0), the world coordinates of its bounding box corners would be approximately:
           x_min = -0.07 + (-0.054) = -0.124
           x_max = -0.07 + (0.03) = -0.04
           y_min = 0.0 + (-0.458) = -0.458
           y_max = 0.0 + (-0.374) = -0.374
           This still gives an AABB that is not within `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` for v16 in the y dimension.
           
           The problem formulation states: "if your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose such that, given the geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement for the object on a surface for which `supported(obj, #<name> surf)` is in the initial state."
           The AABB given for `v14` is `((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))`. This seems to indicate that the object is not centered at (0,0), and has a significant negative y offset relative to its own origin.
           If we want to center the effective footprint of `v14` at, for example, `(0.0, 0.0)` on `v16`, we need to choose `x` and `y` for its pose such that the center of its AABB aligns with `(0.0, 0.0)`.
           The center of v14's AABB is `x_c = (-0.054 + 0.03)/2 = -0.012`, `y_c = (-0.458 - 0.374)/2 = -0.416`.
           So, if we want the actual center of the object's footprint to be at `(x_target, y_target)` in world coordinates, the pose for `v14` should be `(x_target - x_c, y_target - y_c, z, theta)`.
           Let's target `(0.0, 0.0)` for v8, `(0.07, 0.0)` for v12, and `(-0.07, 0.0)` for v14.
           
           For v8 (center (0,0) in obj AABB): pose (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0) -> AABB ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)). Fits in v16.
           For v12 (center (0,0) in obj AABB): pose (0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0) -> AABB ((0.035, -0.035), (0.105, 0.035)). Fits in v16.
           
           For v14 (center (-0.012, -0.416) in obj AABB, size (0.084, 0.084)):
           To place its center at (-0.07, 0.0), the pose should be:
           x_pose = -0.07 - (-0.012) = -0.058
           y_pose = 0.0 - (-0.416) = 0.416
           Then the world AABB will be centered at (-0.07, 0.0).
           The extent is 0.084/2 = 0.042. So, x_range = [-0.07-0.042, -0.07+0.042] = [-0.112, -0.028].
           y_range = [0.0-0.042, 0.0+0.042] = [-0.042, 0.042].
           This will fit within v16's `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Updated Plan:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 on #o2 at (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0) on v16.
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 on #o2 at (0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0) on v16.
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 on #o2 at (-0.058, 0.416, 0.782, 0.0) on v16.

User:      Pose #o2 = (-0.058 0.416 0.782 0.0) for object v14 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.09299999833106995, 0.3810000085830688), upper=(-0.022999998331069943, 0.4510000085830689))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The issue persists with the stability of `v14` on `v16`. It seems my interpretation of how to compute the placement for `v14` using its relative AABB was still incorrect for the validation system. The `y` coordinate for `v14`'s pose, `0.416`, directly caused an instability because it's too high for the `v16` surface, whose y-range is `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Let's simplify. When placing an object at a `(x, y, z, theta)` pose, its AABB relative to the object's local frame gets translated by `(x, y)` and rotated by `theta`. The problem description states the AABB: `((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))` for `v14`. This AABB means the object itself extends from `-0.054` to `0.03` along its local x-axis and from `-0.458` to `-0.374` along its local y-axis.
           
           If `theta = 0`, the object's world AABB when its pose is `(x, y, z, 0.0)` will be `((x - 0.054, y - 0.458), (x + 0.03, y - 0.374))`.
           The AABB of the surface `v16` is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           For `v14` to be stable, both `x` and `y` intervals of its world AABB must be contained within `v16`'s intervals.
           
           Let `x_p, y_p` be the pose coordinates.
           We need `x_p - 0.054 >= -0.135` and `x_p + 0.03 <= 0.135`.
           This gives `x_p >= -0.081` and `x_p <= 0.105`. So `x_p` can be in `[-0.081, 0.105]`.
           We also need `y_p - 0.458 >= -0.135` and `y_p - 0.374 <= 0.135`.
           This gives `y_p >= 0.323` and `y_p <= 0.509`.
           This implies that `y_p` for `v14` must be in `[0.323, 0.509]` to be stable when `theta=0`. However, this `y_p` range is outside the y-range of `v16` itself `[-0.135, 0.135]`. This means `v14` cannot be placed on `v16` with `theta=0`.
           
           This strongly suggests that `v14` *must* be rotated. Let's try `theta = pi/2` (90 degrees).
           If `theta = pi/2`, the local x-axis maps to world y-axis, and local y-axis maps to world -x-axis.
           The object's local AABB `(xl_min, yl_min), (xl_max, yl_max)` becomes `(yl_min, -xl_max), (yl_max, -xl_min)` after rotation (if x_world = -y_local, y_world = x_local, this is how the corners transform).
           So for `v14`, `((-0.458, -0.03), (-0.374, 0.054))` when rotated by pi/2.
           Let's verify.
           New `x_min_obj_local = -0.458`, `x_max_obj_local = -0.374`. (span 0.084)
           New `y_min_obj_local = -0.03`, `y_max_obj_local = 0.054`. (span 0.084)
           
           Now, applying this rotated AABB to the stability conditions for a pose `(x_p, y_p, z, pi/2)`:
           `x_p + x_min_obj_local >= -0.135` => `x_p - 0.458 >= -0.135` => `x_p >= 0.323`. This is problematic, `x_p` is too large.
           `x_p + x_max_obj_local <= 0.135` => `x_p - 0.374 <= 0.135` => `x_p <= 0.509`.
           
           It appears that `v14` cannot be placed on `v16` at all if my AABB interpretation is correct. The object has an intrinsic offset in its local coordinates that makes it extend far into the negative y-direction. If a pose `(x_p, y_p, z, theta)` defines where the *center of the bounding box* is, then the problem is solvable. But given the previous error messages, it seems the AABB is an absolute description of the object.
           
           Let's consider that the object's `AABB` is defined relative to the object's *origin*, and the pose `(x, y, z, theta)` specifies the world coordinates of that origin.
           If `v14`'s AABB is `((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))`, and its origin is at (0,0,0) in its local frame.
           When `theta = 0`, if its origin is placed at `(x_p, y_p)`, then its total footprint in world coordinates is `[x_p-0.054, x_p+0.03]` and `[y_p-0.458, y_p-0.374]`.
           For this to fit within `v16`'s `x` range `[-0.135, 0.135]`:
           `x_p-0.054 >= -0.135` => `x_p >= -0.081`
           `x_p+0.03 <= 0.135` => `x_p <= 0.105`
           So, `x_p` must be in `[-0.081, 0.105]`. This is feasible.
           
           For this to fit within `v16`'s `y` range `[-0.135, 0.135]`:
           `y_p-0.458 >= -0.135` => `y_p >= 0.323`
           `y_p-0.374 <= 0.135` => `y_p <= 0.509`
           This means `y_p` must be in `[0.323, 0.509]`. But if `y_p` is in this range, then the object's footprint will have `y` coordinates like `[0.323-0.458, 0.509-0.374]` which is `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           This is exactly how it should work! My previous calculation was correct in setting the y_p value.
           Let's pick `y_p = 0.323`. And `x_p = 0.0`.
           Pose for `v14`: `(0.0, 0.323, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           Then its world AABB is `((-0.054, 0.323-0.458), (0.03, 0.323-0.374))` which is `((-0.054, -0.135), (0.03, -0.051))`.
           This bounding box is `x` from `-0.054` to `0.03`, and `y` from `-0.135` to `-0.051`. This range is contained within `v16`'s AABB: `x` in `[-0.135, 0.135]` and `y` in `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           So, `(0.0, 0.323, 0.782, 0.0)` for `v14` should be stable.
           
           Let's recheck poses for v8 and v12.
           v8 (AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))):
           Place at (0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). World AABB: ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035)). This fits.
           
           v12 (AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))):
           Place at (0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). World AABB: ((0.07-0.035, 0.0-0.035), (0.07+0.035, 0.0+0.035)) = ((0.035, -0.035), (0.105, 0.035)). This fits.
           
           Now we have three stable poses. We need to ensure they don't collide with each other.
           v8: `x in [-0.035, 0.035]`, `y in [-0.035, 0.035]`
           v12: `x in [0.035, 0.105]`, `y in [-0.035, 0.035]`
           v14: `x in [-0.054, 0.03]`, `y in [-0.135, -0.051]` (when `y_p = 0.323`)
           
           These AABBs are distinct and do not overlap.

           (#o2 v14 v16): (0.0 0.323 0.782 0.0)

User:      Pose #o2 = (0.0 0.323 0.782 0.0) for object v14 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.035, 0.28800001382827756), upper=(0.035, 0.3580000138282776))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The validation system still indicates that my interpretation of the AABB for `v14` and its placement is incorrect for stability. The AABB `((-0.035, 0.28800001382827756), (0.035, 0.3580000138282776))` that the system derived from my pose `(0.0, 0.323, 0.782, 0.0)` for `v14` does not correspond to the original AABB for `v14` `((-0.054, -0.458), (0.03, -0.374))`. It seems like the system is using a simplified AABB for `v14` (perhaps `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))`, similar to `v8` and `v12`), or there's a misinterpretation of how `pose` affects the given AABB for `v14`.
           
           Let's assume, for the sake of finding a valid plan, that the validator is treating all objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` as having the *same effective AABB dimensions* as `v8` and `v12` (i.e., `width = 0.07`, `height = 0.07`). If this is the case, then my previous stable placements for `v8` and `v12` are fine, and `v14` can also be placed similarly.
           
           If `v14` also has an effective AABB `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))` relative to its pose:
           We need to find a pose `(x, y, z, theta)` such that `x ± 0.035` is within `[-0.135, 0.135]` and `y ± 0.035` is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           Let's place `v14` at `(-0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)`.
           World AABB: `((-0.07 - 0.035, 0.0 - 0.035), (-0.07 + 0.035, 0.0 + 0.035))`
           = `((-0.105, -0.035), (-0.035, 0.035))`.
           This fits within `v16`'s AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           And let's make sure the three objects are not colliding:
           v8: `(0.0, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` -> AABB `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))`
           v12: `(0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` -> AABB `((0.035, -0.035), (0.105, 0.035))`
           v14: `(-0.07, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0)` -> AABB `((-0.105, -0.035), (-0.035, 0.035))`
           
           These three proposed bounding boxes are distinct and do not overlap.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plans failed due to unsatisfied preconditions, specifically `atbconf(v35)`. The `pick` and `place` actions require `atbconf(?q)`, and in the available actions, `?q` is consistently `#o3`. The previous plans used `#o3` but it looks like it was not achieved.
           Looking at the initial state and available actions:
           `Atom atbconf(v3)`
           `Atom bconf(#o3)`
           `Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`
           `Atom basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)`
           `Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`
           `Atom basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`
           
           The only way to achieve `atbconf(#o3)` is to use `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`. This must be the first action. Then, all `pick` and `place` actions that use `#o3` as their base configuration can be executed.
           
           Revised Plan:
           1. Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` using base config `#o3`.
           3. Place `v8` on `#o2` (new pose for `v8` on `v16`) using base config `#o3`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` using base config `#o3`.
           5. Place `v12` on `#o2` (new pose for `v12` on `v16`) using base config `#o3`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` using base config `#o3`.
           7. Place `v14` on `#o2` (new pose for `v14` on `v16`) using base config `#o3`.
           
           The poses for v8, v12, v14 are kept as derived from the last successful stability check (assuming the effective AABB of v14 is the same as v8 and v12 for the validator).
