           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain.  I start by dissecting the axiom itself. It's a conjunction of several conditions, most of which are trivially true in the initial state (`atconf`, `free`). The real challenge lies in satisfying `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need to use actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `send_image`. But, I quickly realized that these actions are *not* permitted in the allowed actions. The only actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. This immediately raises a red flag.
           
           Similarly, achieving `receivedanalysis` involves actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`, which are also not permitted. I need to sample and then send data about a soil or rock.
           
           The `move` actions are essentially no-ops, since they involve moving a rover to the same configuration, like moving from one point to the same point. The `drop_rock` actions have an unmet precondition: the rover's storage must be `full`, but the initial state indicates that the stores are `free`. I check the preconditions and find that none of them are met by the initial state.
           
           Since I can't satisfy the requirements for `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` with the permitted actions, this goal seems unattainable. In short, the available actions are insufficient to achieve the desired state.  The current state is: `atconf` and `free` are true, but `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are false.
           
           I conclude that the plan is *not* achievable given the provided actions. The `move` operations don't progress the goal, while the `drop_rock` operations are not available.
