           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.** The task is to find 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 6, side length roughly 0.098) on a square surface (surface 0) with bounds [-0.135, 0.135] in both x and y.  Since the object is square, the effective bounding box changes with rotation, but I can precalculate the minimum safe distance needed from the edges.
           
           I figured out the critical constraint: the maximum effective half-width/height of the *rotated* square is the half-diagonal (roughly 0.07).  So, I set up a grid of (x,y) coordinates within this tightest bounding box to guarantee stability for *any* object rotation, effectively centering the object. I chose x and y in the range [-0.06, 0.06].
           
           Next, I determined I only needed two rotations: 0 and pi/4, because the bounding box for a square repeats every pi/2 rotation.  By combining these, I'll have 50 unique placements: five x values, five y values, and two angles.  Each (x, y) pair will have angle zero and angle pi/4.
           
           This gives me the final result: 50 placements of the object on surface 0, all stable, because they're within the required bounds.  I'll generate the output now.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got object 6 placed successfully at (0, 0, -0.06, -0.06). Now, I need to figure out where to put object 5, which is a square with a side length of approximately 0.089. The main problem is avoiding collisions with object 6. Here's my thought process:
           
           First, I need to figure out how much space object 5 will occupy. I know the side length, so I can easily calculate the half-side, which is about 0.044. When this object is placed, it can be at angles 0 or pi/4. I'll need to figure out the maximum extent (bounding box) of object 5, and in order to be safe, I have to assume its maximum half-extent is 0.063. Also, I know the surface is `(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           Next, I'll identify the region within the surface where I can safely place object 5. This means staying within the boundaries of surface 0 and ensuring it doesn't collide with object 6. I know object 6 has been placed at (-0.06, -0.06) and I need to calculate its AABB using its dimensions.
           
           I'm aiming to find 50 possible locations for object 5. The basic approach is to check many candidate positions and angles to find 50 valid placements. I will generate candidate positions and rotations (0 and pi/4). For each candidate, I will calculate its full AABB, using the maximum extent possible (0.063).
           
           I know object 6's AABB using the dimensions (using a size of about 0.098) is about `[-0.109, -0.011] x [-0.109, -0.011]`. I'll define an AABB `h_eff_5` for each position `(x_5, y_5)` with orientation `theta_5`. I check for a collision for object 5 when `x_5 - h_eff_5 < o6_x_max AND x_5 + h_eff_5 > o6_x_min AND y_5 - h_eff_5 < o6_y_max AND y_5 + h_eff_5 > o6_y_min`.
           
           I will be precise to guarantee no collisions. I will check whether the AABB for object 5 fully falls within the surface and is free of the AABB for object 6. I'll construct a loop over the center coordinates `[-0.12, -0.1, -0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12]` in the x and y directions. I'll use the two angles and the two h_eff values and check the bounds. I'll have 338 candidates total. I expect this to be enough to find 50 valid solutions. If the containment check and the collision checks pass, I will add it to the final result.

(Thoughts: **My Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I need to figure out 50 stable spots for this new square object (ID 4) on Surface 0. There are two other squares already there (IDs 6 and 5), and I've got to avoid any collisions.
           
           First things first, I've got all the object dimensions and positions laid out:
           
           *   **Surface 0:** It's a square region from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           *   **Object 6:**  It's at (-0.06, -0.06) with a side length of about 0.098. I know its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) using theta=0 and its half-extents are `0.0488`.
           *   **Object 5:**  This one's at (-0.08, 0.08) with a side length of about 0.089, and similar AABB calculations. Its extents are given by `h_eff5_0 = 0.0444`.
           
           The new object (ID 4) is square with side `0.094`. I'll need to create its `h_eff4 = s4/2` and `h_eff4_pi4` and then center object 4's AABB for a given placement.
           
           I'm thinking of checking rotations 0, pi/4. I'll need to make sure the AABB of the new object stays within the surface area *and* doesn't overlap with either existing object.
           
           Surface Containment is the first constraint I have to check. I can use the new object's AABB half-extents, or `h_eff4`, and the known center. Given that, the maximum value for `(x_c, y_c)` for containment is `x_c, y_c` in `[-0.135 + h_eff4, 0.135 - h_eff4]`.
           
           To find the safe range for the center of the new object, I need to check the AABBs of objects 6 and 5 against the surface.
           
           I'm starting with a grid of x and y coordinates and then checking a few angles. The ranges have to change based on object orientation.
           
           I can make `[-0.12, 0.12]` a suitable starting range because the max half extent is about `h_eff4_pi4 = 0.0665`. It should filter out locations which fail surface containment.
           
           I can create and populate my placements using the surface, then confirm for collisions against `obj6` then `obj5`.
           
           Then I'll just check if my generated points are inside the surface, and if they collide with either of the other objects. If it's safe, I add it to the list.
           
           Okay, let's start generating the candidate placements and see what we get! I'll iterate on my grid to look for free space. I will prioritize the top-right, right, and bottom-right sections.

(Thoughts: **Revised Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've been reviewing the previous object placements, and it's clear my initial "safe region" calculations for object ID 4 were a bit off.  Some placements were failing because the bounding boxes extended beyond the surface boundaries.  It seems my grid point selection or `h_eff` calculations were the culprit.  
           
           I need to nail this for object ID 7.  First, let's re-calculate that maximum `h_eff` for object 7.  The object size is about 0.08236. For theta=0, `h_eff` is just half the side, about 0.041. For theta=pi/4, we need half the diagonal which is about 0.058. Using a safe region `x_c` and `y_c` of `+/-0.076` will work, considering surface is within `+/-0.135`.
           
           For object 7, with a side length of approximately 0.082, the maximum half-extent (`h_eff`) is roughly 0.058, especially with `theta = pi/4`.  Given the surface boundaries of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), the safe region for the object's center `(x_c, y_c)` is approximately between -0.076 and 0.076.
           
           Looking at the existing placements, here are the AABB details:
           *   **Object 6:**  Placed at (-0.06, -0.06). Bounding Box: `[-0.108, -0.011] x [-0.108, -0.011]`
           *   **Object 5:**  Placed at (-0.08, 0.08).  Bounding Box: `[-0.124, -0.035] x [0.035, 0.124]`
           *   **Object 4:**  Placed at (0.08, 0.08).  Bounding Box: `[0.032, 0.127] x [0.032, 0.127]`
           
           To find 50 stable placements for object 7, I'll use a finer grid for `(x_c, y_c)`, going from -0.07 to 0.07 in 0.01 steps. I'll test each grid point at `theta=0` and `theta=pi/4`. A total of 225 grid positions with 2 thetas each, giving 450 placements to evaluate, more than enough for 50 valid solutions. I need to make sure the AABB is within the surface boundaries and doesn't collide with the existing objects' bounding boxes.  
           
           I will calculate the AABB for each potential placement, then verify that it's within the surface and doesn't overlap with objects 4, 5, and 6. I'll need to check the containment within the surface boundaries. I'll also ensure there's no collision with the current AABBs. I'll pay attention to the bottom-right and right-middle quadrants of the placement surface.
           
           Now, my approach is to first limit `x_c` from `-0.07` up to `0.07` and then limit `y_c` from `-0.07` down to `-0.07`. Then for collision detection, I'll need to check the non-overlap of X and Y ranges of the objects.  After that, I will carefully iterate through these combinations to identify 50 valid object placements.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Placing Object 8**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: find 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing objects (6, 5, 4, 7).  I've got to take into account the "safe bounds" issue I observed with previous placements of object 4, which suggests I need to be more conservative, especially near the edges. I need to recompute those AABBs.
           
           First, I've got to ensure the object is fully *within* the surface, and that I'm avoiding any overlap with the existing objects, according to those strict instructions.
           
           I'll start with the surface limits of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Then I will do collision checks. I'll need a function for that. I think `check_collision` is the way. This, combined with what I know about the limits of object placements, should be enough.
           
           My strategy will be as follows:
           
           1. **Calculate AABBs:** I'll meticulously calculate the AABBs for all existing objects (using the provided extents and placements) and for the new object. I will need to consider effective half-extent (`h_eff`) for different rotation angles. The most restrictive is going to be `pi/4`.
           2. **Surface Containment:** To be safe, I know the center must be in `[-0.06584, 0.06584] x [-0.06584, 0.06584]` (due to the pi/4 rotation, even though this step is not needed).
           3. **Collision Checks:** I'll set up a collision-detection function using the AABB coordinates. If there is a collision, skip that point.
           4. **Placement Iteration:** I'll iterate through a grid of possible center points (`x_c`, `y_c`) within the restricted surface area. For each point, I'll calculate AABBs for both `theta=0` and `theta=pi/4`.  If the object is contained within the surface and doesn't collide with existing objects, I've got a placement.
           5. **Prioritization:** I am going to sort my range to give preference to bottom-right placement as it seems to be safer.
           
           I'm confident in my code now. It considers the strict constraints, the failure data, and should give me those 50 stable placements. I've re-written my approach with extra care so that it accounts for the edge case and the conflict between object collision and safe placements. Hopefully, that will work.
