(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           I need to figure out 50 stable positions for object ID 5 on surface 0.  The object is basically square (0.09677 x 0.09677), and the surface is a square of size 0.27.
           
           To ensure stability, I have to make sure the object stays completely inside the surface. This means finding valid (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values.  `surf_idx` will always be 0.  `theta` controls rotation, and since the object is almost square, I can get away with just 0 or pi/2 (or any multiple of pi/2), which simplify the calculations as well.  For this strategy, for most of the placements, `theta` will equal `0`.
           
           First, I need to figure out the allowed area where I can center the object.  With no rotation, the object's half-width and half-height are about 0.0484.  To fit completely inside the surface (which has bounds of -0.135 to 0.135 for both x and y), the object's center `x` can range from -0.0866 to 0.0866, and the center `y` can range from -0.0866 to 0.0866.
           
           Now, I'll generate the placement points. I'm going to create a 7x7 grid for x and y placement, and `theta` will be `0` for the grid, that gives me 49 placements. To get the fiftieth placement, I'll put the object at (0, 0) and use pi/2 as `theta`. Given the dimensions, all positions should be valid.  Let's do it!

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a task: place a new object, object ID 4, on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into object ID 5, which is already sitting pretty. Object 4 is almost square, and I've got a surface that's also a square, with object 5 snuggled into the bottom-left corner.  The trick is to find 50 spots where object 4 can be placed, and the positions shouldn't overlap.
           
           First, I looked at the dimensions of object 4:  It's size is almost square, and I know where object 5 is.  I calculated the space object 4 could move in on the surface. Now the key question is how to avoid collision with object 5. Because the dimensions of object 4 are very close, I chose to work with theta = 0, and then I calculated the position of object 4 in such orientation that it doesn't overlap with the bounding box of object 5.
           
           I quickly did the calculations to find the x and y threshold that ensures no collision.  I created a grid of potential x and y placements, for theta = 0, and then filter out which positions would lead to a collision.  It turns out, 56 positions satisfy this, which is more than the 50 I needed.  I'll just grab the first 50.  I could have introduced some additional placements at pi/2 for diversity, because rotations are a good practice.

(Thoughts: **Thoughts on Generating Safe Placements for Object 6**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a new, almost-square object (ID 6) on a specific surface (Surface 0).  The key challenge is avoiding collisions with two already-placed objects: a larger one (ID 5) in the bottom-left, and a smaller one (ID 4) nestled along the left edge.
           
           First, I need to understand the playing field. Surface 0 is a rectangle with dimensions `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I have the precise location and AABB of both existing objects, and I know object 6's dimensions.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate placements for object 6, keeping its primary axis at `theta = 0.0`. I'll try with other thetas also. I'll need to check the surface boundaries for this configuration so that the new object remains inside them, and then use the AABB of the objects to do an overlap check to make sure the generated placements don't result in collisions. I'll need to use these AABBs with my given objects.
           
           To ensure safety, I'll calculate collision-free regions.  For Object 5, any placement of object 6 must be *to the right* or *above* the existing object to avoid contact.  For Object 4, I need to consider all sides - object 6 must not overlap with it along the X- or Y-axis.
           
           I'll build a grid of potential placements, evenly spaced across the surface. I'll calculate AABBs of both to check for overlap. If collision does not occur, then it is a viable placement. I'll vary grid density to increase the number of placements. If necessary, I'll try rotations to find sufficient valid placements.  I'm confident I can find at least 50 non-colliding positions for object 6.
