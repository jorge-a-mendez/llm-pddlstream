User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Final Robot Base Position Planning**
           
           Okay, here's what I've determined for the three robot base positions. The goal is to get three diverse and safe locations near the target (-1.0, -1.0), within a maximum distance of 2, and avoiding the given obstacles.  The environment boundaries are -2.5 to 2.5 in x and y. Since the target is also at -1.0, -1.0 the valid robot area will cover around the target and be within the -2.5, 2.5 bounds. I will assume the robot will automatically orient itself toward the target.
           
           I've carefully considered the major obstacle layout: a central vertical wall at x=0, and a few key rectangular obstacles in the corners and quadrants. I also analyzed smaller obstacles. The biggest concern is that the robot has to have a clear line of sight to the target. Considering the position of the target at (-1.0, -1.0), and the central divider (obstacle 5) at x = 0, I've decided it's safest and most efficient to position the robot on the same side of the divider as the target. Therefore I'm only picking locations where the x-coordinate is less than 0.
           
           Based on these analyses, I've selected the following three base positions:
           
           1.  **(-2.5, -1.0)**: This position is to the left of the target and 1.5 units away. It gives us a view to the left. The line of sight is clear.
           2.  **(-1.0, -2.5)**: This position is below the target and 1.5 units away. A clear line of sight.
           3.  **(-1.0, 1.0)**:  This is directly above the target and exactly 2 units away. It's a key position. A clear line of sight, with obstacles far enough away.
           
           These positions satisfy all the criteria: they are within range, inside the environment, and free from obstacles along the direct path to the target. Their placement will provide enough diversity for a robotic operator to pick from.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Revised Approach for Target Point Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I messed up big time on the previous attempt. Turns out the *target* point I'm dealing with now `(-1.949, 2.085)` is totally different from the one I was using before. The feedback I got then is irrelevant! I have to start fresh.
           
           The new target is at `Tx = -1.949, Ty = 2.085`. I need to find a suitable robot base position within a maximum distance of 2 from the target and inside the boundaries of the room (`x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]`).
           
           Initial thoughts are: The previous feedback was useful to avoid placing the robot base exactly on room boundaries because those borders are actually *inside* the walls that form the room. I will instead keep the base base inside the margins (x in (-2.45, 2.45) and y in (-2.45, 2.45)).
           
           I figured out the region for the robot's base: it's basically the top-left quadrant of the room, near the top-left corner. But, with the additional radius of 2 restriction from the target, it can be extended up to `x = 0.05` on the x axis and up to `y = 4.085` on the y axis. However, I have to be careful with the central wall (`x in [-0.05, 0.05]`), and it's best to stay to the left of it (x < -0.05).
           
           The *real* problem now: the target point is *inside* two fixed obstacles: obstacle 8 and obstacle 22. This is a mess! The obstacles might be "walls" for the robot base, but *could also* block the *line-of-sight* (LOS) to the target. It's supposed to be "collides" and "LOS". If LOS *truly* means a clear path with no obstacles in the way, then the problem as it's defined is impossible to solve: it will always be blocked!
           
           Since I *have* to provide an answer, I'm going to assume there's some nuance. I'll act as if LOS is *possible* despite the target being inside an obstacle. I'll focus on picking positions *around* the obstacles that surround the target point to make sure the base doesn't collide with the walls. If I get feedback saying that it's "not reachable", I'll have to re-evaluate.
           
           I calculated the precise coordinates:
           Valid x range for robot base: `x in [-2.45, -0.05)`.
           Valid y range for robot base: `y in [0.085, 2.45]`.
           
           Here are three positions I will test:
           1.  `(-2.35, 2.085)`: The base is to the left of the target, *but* the line-of-sight from the base to the target passes right through obstacle 8! This is risky.
           2.  `(-2.35, 1.6)`: The base is below the target and to the left of the obstacle. The line segment will still pass close, but around it.
           3. `(-1.9495840072631836, 1.6)` (Using the target's exact X to be directly below it)
           
           All the calculated distances are smaller than the max range:
           Point 1:  dist = 0.4800644096053741
           Point 2:  dist = 0.6290754807901019
           Point 3:  dist = 0.4851833820343018
           
           I am hoping for the best, assuming the line segment's proximity to (and partially through) the obstacle 8 won't cause the solution to fail. It's time to submit these solutions and see!
