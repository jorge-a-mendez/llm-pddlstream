(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide a comprehensive set of 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, size 0.07 x 0.07) on a surface defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0). I'm approaching this by systematically varying the object's position (x, y coordinates of its center) and orientation (rotation angle, theta).
           
           Since the object is square, I know that rotations of 0 and π/2 result in the same axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). The valid area for placement varies depending on theta as the object rotates, with its dimensions determining the valid region.
           
           For a diverse distribution, I've decided to leverage three key rotation angles: 0, π/8, and π/4.  These give a manageable complexity as it has a diverse amount of AABB side lengths: I'll use 20 placements at theta=0, 15 at theta=π/8, and 15 at theta=π/4.
           
           I have calculated and optimized the AABB extents given these rotations and defined a series of coordinate distributions that satisfy these requirements.  I will be using the linspace function with exact values to calculate x and y, and then rounding it to six decimal places, ensuring that the object is fully contained within the surface at each placement. Using rotation angles with differing extents provides a better spread of x and y values for the bounding boxes.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I need to place 50 instances of object ID 10, which is a small square (0.097 x 0.097), onto surface 0.  This is the same surface I've been working with, extending from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). I've got to be mindful of object ID 5, which has been successfully placed here before.  Importantly, I need to ensure no collisions occur between the new object and the existing one.
           
           I've already figured out the bounding box sizes for object 10 at various rotations: at 0 radians, it's roughly 0.048 wide/high; at pi/8 radians it's about 0.063 wide/high, and at pi/4 it's 0.069.  I know that object 5's placements are clustered on the left side of the surface, with x coordinates of around 4.235 and 4.41. Their current placements have centers with a half-width of 0.035.
           
           My strategy?  To ensure zero collisions, I'll place object 10's center to the *right* of object 5. This way, I can ensure no overlap in the x-dimension. This dramatically simplifies collision detection. This means using a starting `x` of at least 4.5.
           
           I'll divide the surface into three sections, each corresponding to a different rotation of object 10:
           
           1.  **Rotation = 0 radians:**  I'll generate a 4x5 grid of centers in the valid x and y regions. The x-coordinate will start at 4.495148. The y range will be from -0.551519 to -0.048481.
           2.  **Rotation = pi/8 radians:** I'll use a 3x5 grid.  The x-coordinate will start at 4.510052. The valid y-range is between -0.536615 and -0.063385.
           3.  **Rotation = pi/4 radians:** A 3x5 grid for this rotation.  The x coordinate is set to be at least 4.51524. The y-range is between -0.531427 and -0.068573.
           
           I've carefully calculated the grid points and the valid x and y ranges to make sure these placements remain entirely clear of the positions of object 5. This ensures 50 distinct, collision-free placements.
