           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a pretty specific goal defined by some conjunction of predicates. My job is to figure out the plan. I've broken down the goal into its core components: achieving `receivedimage` for two objectives and `receivedanalysis` for some rock and some soil samples.  Easy enough, right?  Just image and analyze, and send the data.
           
           **Delving into the Domain**
           
           I've carefully inspected the initial state and the available actions.  The rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are each at their "home" configurations (`v13` and `v15` respectively), with cameras onboard.  The problem immediately pops out:  there's a continuous parameter represented by a hashtag (`#`). This is important because it represents poses, trajectories, etc., which are usually *unbound* when the planning begins. In particular, both rovers *can* image `v17` and `v18` via `#o4`, and they *can* communicate with the lander.  The issue is where, when, and how.
           
           **The Hurdles - Configuration and Movement**
           
           Here's the rub: The `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions *all* need the rovers to be at specific configurations that are different from their starting ones.  The problem is, the only `move` actions available are no-ops!  Both are already in their initial position.  This means the rovers are essentially stuck. They can't reposition themselves to carry out the critical preconditions for imaging, calibrating, analyzing, and sending data.  It is impossible to image (`v17`, `v18`) because both rovers are not at the same configuration (`#o3`). They are at different configurations.
           
           **The Implication - Plan Unattainable**
           
           The "available action instances" clause is the nail in the coffin.  The only actions I can use are `move` (which does nothing) and `drop_rock` (which cannot be done because the stores are initially free). So, I'm stuck, which means the plan is unreachable.
           
           **Final Verdict**
           
           Given the provided restrictions on valid action instances and the lack of mobility, the overall goal is simply impossible to attain. I cannot image or analyze, so achieving `new-axiom@0()` is impossible.
