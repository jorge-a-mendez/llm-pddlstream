           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's the plan for finding those three robot base positions near the target point (1.0, -1.0).**
           
           My goal is to place the robots in strategic spots within 2 units of the target, avoiding collisions with any fixed obstacles and keeping them within the world boundaries. My starting point will be to understand the scene geometry, focusing on the obstacles and potential line-of-sight obstructions.
           
           **Understanding the Lay of the Land:**
           
           First, I've got to map out the environment. There's a rectangular boundary (AABBs 1-4) at  (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There is also a major obstacle, a central vertical wall at `x=0` (AABB 5), and a few smaller rectangular obstacles (AABBs 15, 16, 17) scattered around. Since the target is right of the `x=0` wall, my generated positions also need to be to the right of this wall to establish clear line-of-sight.
           
           **My Approach:**
           
           My strategy is to generate positions around the target at varying angles and distances. I'll focus on positions on a circle or arc that are within the allowed radius of 2 units. I'll need to make sure the base positions are clear of any obstacles.
           
           **Let's Calculate!**
           
           *   **Region of Interest:** First, I'll define my search space: a circle of radius 2 centered at the target (1.0, -1.0). The X-coordinates range from -1.0 to 2.5, and the Y-coordinates span -2.5 to 1.0.
           
           *   **Obstacle Awareness:** I've identified the key obstacles that could pose a problem: the central wall at `x=0`, and three smaller obstacles: AABB 15, AABB 16, and AABB 17. Because the target is to the right of the central wall, any base position has to also be right of it, for line of sight.
           
           *   **Candidate Locations:**
               1.  `(0.1, -1.0)`: This position is just left of the target, but safely on the correct side of the center wall.
               2.  `(1.0, 0.0)`: This is positioned directly above the target.
               3.  `(1.0, -2.0)`: And this one is directly below the target.
           
           I've checked each of these against the obstacles and world boundaries, and they all fit the criteria. Distance from the target is less than 2, and no collisions will occur.
           
           These three positions will give us a good set of viewpoints. I am confident they work, since these points meet all criteria!

(Thoughts: **My Rationale for Position Generation**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback, and it's time to refine my approach. I've been focusing on finding positions for the robot to get line of sight on the *current* target: `(-0.7009419798851013, 1.9365720748901367)`.  I realized my previous attempts were way off because I was using a *different* target.  Huge oversight!  I've got to stay on top of that.
           
           I'm zeroing in on this target because it's in the upper-left, and I know that the central wall (`((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`) is a big deal.  I need to make sure the base of the robot is on the *same* side of the central wall as the target or the view is obstructed.  Also, all my positions have to be within 2 units of the target and fit within the world limits, which are `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: the target point is *inside* obstacle 22 `((-0.7498, 1.8876), (-0.6520, 1.9854))`. That's a real puzzle. Normally, line-of-sight means seeing the target without anything blocking, but when the target is *within* an obstacle, it complicates things. So, I will assume that the path from the robot base to the target must *not* intersect any other obstacle to have LOS. However, it looks like that will always be impossible. This might be a test or a quirk of the evaluation. I'm going to follow the instructions and focus on finding the best non-colliding locations that are within the range, which will be the best I can do.
           
           Let's break down the process. I'm trying to place the robot in three positions to the left of the central wall because `T_curr.x` is negative.
           
           **Position 1: `(-0.7009, 0.4365)`** - I put this one directly "below" the target, about 1.5 units away. It's a straight shot, as long as it doesn't collide with the fixed obstacles, it's a perfect point. I verified it doesn't collide.
           
           **Position 2: `(-2.4, 1.0)`** - Initially, I was going for `(-2.2009, 1.9365)`, but that collided with a small obstacle.  So, I adjusted and went farther left and slightly down to get around it. It's far enough that it avoids any collisions. I want to test the full set of coordinates to avoid all collisions.
           
           **Position 3: `(-0.2, 0.5)`** - This one is closer to the target but on the opposite side of it. It's slightly right and down, trying to provide another alternative direction. This seems solid in my collision check.
           
           All these positions are within the 2-unit range, outside obstacle 22 (the target obstacle), on the correct side of the central wall, and don't collide with any other fixed obstacles. I will provide these and document all these assumptions in the final response.

(Thoughts: **Revised Strategy and Proposed Positions**
           
           Okay, after carefully re-evaluating the feedback and scene, I realize the key issue is the *new* target point: `(-2.1666648387908936, 1.9564313888549805)`. This is a crucial detail!  The target is now inside an obstacle, specifically obstacle 19, which is itself contained within obstacle 8.  My goal now is to find valid positions *around* this occluding obstacle, keeping in mind that "line-of-sight" might mean finding a path to the target around or through the enclosing obstacle (or assuming the robot has a small enough footprint to get near the edge).
           
           Considering the world limits and existing obstacles (especially the central wall and left wall):
           
           *   I need to stay left of the central wall (x < -0.05).
           *   I also need to be right of the left wall (x > -2.4).
           *   The max distance to the target is 2.
           
           I've selected three positions that meet these criteria, are likely clear of other obstacles, and are on different sides of obstacle 8 (and 19). They are:
           
           1.  **(-2.1, 0.4)**: This position is directly below the target point, and clear of the central and left walls.
           2.  **(-2.3, 1.9)**: This is to the left of the target and of obstacle 8/19.
           3.  **(-0.6, 1.0)**: This position is diagonally to the right and below, and also clear of walls and the occluding obstacles.
           
           I believe this set provides diverse starting points for further analysis.
