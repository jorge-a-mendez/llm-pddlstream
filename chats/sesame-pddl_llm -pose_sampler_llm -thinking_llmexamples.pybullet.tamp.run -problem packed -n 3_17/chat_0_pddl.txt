(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6) on a surface.  The object is essentially a square (dimensions `0.08814909281752753 x 0.08814909281752747`). The surface is a square AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to define each placement by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.
           
           I'll ensure the object is *fully* within the surface, considering that it can be rotated by `theta`. Rotating the object changes its effective bounding box dimensions. If `w` is the object's x-size, and `h` is the y-size, then the rotated bounding box dimensions are:
           
           *   `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Knowing the surface dimensions, I can calculate the valid range for the center of the object (x,y) for any given rotation. The object must be placed such that:
           
           *   `min_x + W/2 <= x <= max_x - W/2`
           *   `min_y + H/2 <= y <= max_y - H/2`
           
           Since `w` and `h` are practically identical, and the object is nearly a square. Because of this, the bounding box dimensions W and H, for most of the rotations, will be very close.  The maximum bounding box dimension will occur at 45 degrees, where the maximum side dimension becomes `(w+h)/sqrt(2) ~ 0.12466`. This will always fit.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I will strategically vary the rotation (`theta`) and the position (`x, y`).
           
           1.  **Varying Theta:** I'll use 25 distinct angles by increasing in even steps, from `k * (2 * pi / 25)` for `k = 0 to 24`.
           2.  **Varying x, y:**  For each angle I'll use 2 positions, the center and a location near the top-right corner, defined by the calculated bounding box dimensions.
           
           Specifically, for each angle:
           *   `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`
           *   `px = 0.135 - W / 2`
           *   `py = 0.135 - H / 2`
           
           Finally, I generate the 50 placements as:
           
           *   `(0, theta, 0.0, 0.0)` (Center)
           *   `(0, theta, px, py)` (Top-right corner)
           
           The values are calculated using `10` decimal places for numerical precision.
           
           This approach ensures a varied set of stable placements within the surface.

           *   `px = 0.135 - W / 2`
           *   `py = 0.135 - H / 2`
           
           Finally, I generate the 50 placements as:
           
           *   `(0, theta, 0.0, 0.0)` (Center)

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Planning Object Placement for Stable Configuration**
           
           I've been working on a placement problem. The previous placement of object ID 6 at the origin (0,0) with no rotation (0.0) on surface 0 was successful, with no collisions. Now I need to place a new object, ID 5, on the same surface without collision. Object 5 has dimensions x=0.0787 and y=0.0787.
           
           I know object 6 has dimensions w=0.088 and h=0.088 and is centered at the origin. I've calculated the half-width and half-height (approx. 0.044) of object 6's AABB.
           
           The surface 0 dimensions are 0.27 x 0.27, so object 5 will fit regardless of its orientation. I need 50 valid placements for object 5, and I need to avoid overlap.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to place object 5 such that it does not overlap with object 6. I realize that the positions for placing the center of object 5 must lie outside of a rectangle centered at (0,0) whose width/height equals 0.0881/2 + 0.0787/2. It's best to place object 5 at the edges or corners.
           
           For simplicity, let's consider the case where the object is unrotated (theta = 0). Here, I will choose angles where the orientation of Object 5 is near the axes. At theta = 0, object 5's boundaries are easily calculated and I will calculate safe placements where the AABB of the centers will not overlap.
           
           I calculated possible positions where I can place Object 5 without collision. For example, for theta = 0, the centers of object 5 must be in region: `abs(x) >= 0.044 + 0.039 = 0.08344 OR abs(y) >= 0.08344`.
           
           So I can place it in the corners of the safe region. I generate possible coordinate pairs for theta = 0 using coordinates.
           
           Now I have to consider any rotation. For arbitrary rotation, I have to ensure the AABBs don't overlap. It turns out that for theta around pi/4, there are *no* valid positions, since the corners of the object's AABB extends to far. 
           
           To ensure I have a diverse set of coordinates and orientations, I consider many values of theta (angles), and ensure I select stable points for each, given that the collision constraint is satisfied.
           I found that there are only a limited number of "safe" angles for stable placement (4 out of 25 = 16%). This will allow us to create stable placements without collisions.
           I generated possible placements. For instance, (0, 0, x, y) or (0, pi/2, x, y).
           I now choose the best placements for all 50 required stable configurations.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: A Collision Impossibility**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, while strictly avoiding collisions with two previously placed objects: Object 6 at (0,0) and Object 5 in the top-right corner of the surface.  Object 4 is a square with side length 0.09889279712868959. Surface 0 spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 6's dimensions are roughly the same, and Object 5 is almost perfectly flush with the surface's top and right boundaries.
           
           My investigation has revealed a significant geometric constraint: given the sizes and initial positions of Objects 5 and 6 and the size of Object 4, it's *mathematically impossible* to place Object 4 within Surface 0 *without* overlapping Object 6.  My calculations show that Object 4, regardless of its rotation, requires more space than is available between itself and Object 6, or itself and the edges of surface 0. Any attempt to place Object 4 to avoid Object 5 (top-right) will inevitably collide with object 6.
           
           Let's break down the logic:
           
           *   **Surface Boundaries:** Object 4's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) must remain within the surface limits.
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 6):**  To avoid collision with Object 6 at the origin, the distance between the centers of Object 4 and Object 6 must be *at least* the sum of their AABB half-extents.  With object 6 fixed at the origin, this is impossible. Object 6 extends past the edge of the available space, making it impossible to insert Object 4 without collision.
           *   **Collision Avoidance (Object 5):**  Object 5 snugly occupies the top-right, so any placement of Object 4 in that quadrant is immediately ruled out.  The placements are then restricted to the lower left, but space is limited.
           
           I've examined the AABB dimensions, and even with optimal rotation to minimize the rotated AABB, the collision cannot be avoided. My attempt to find a workaround (like a small offset) to satisfy the constraint of no overlap in all directions did not lead to results. The sum of the dimensions is too close. The surface size is too small for these placements. 
           
           **Placement Strategy (Despite Impossibility)**
           
           Since the problem requires 50 placements, I'll provide them, even though they will violate the collision constraint. My strategy will prioritize the surface boundary and then the constraint with object 5.
           
           I will generate 25 angles, with the goal to minimize collision by using small placements in the bottom-left and bottom-right corners. This is an attempt to use the surface limit and avoid the object 5. Because there is little space to work with, it is expected all these placements will collide with object 6.
