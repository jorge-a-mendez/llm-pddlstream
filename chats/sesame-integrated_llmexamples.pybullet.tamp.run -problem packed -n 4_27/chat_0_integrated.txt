           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains four graspable objects: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are initially located at poses v9, v13, v15, and v17 respectively, supported by object v11. The goal is to place all four objects on object v18. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are currently handempty. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There are several continuous parameters that need to be determined for the poses (#o2 for all objects), the grasp (#o1 for all objects), the base configuration (#o3) and the arm trajectory (#o4).
           
           The problem asks to place all four objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 on object v18. Initially, all four objects are on v11. We need to pick each object and place it on v18. Since there's only one arm (v4) for which `kin` relations are provided, we will use arm v4 for all pick and place operations. All pick and place actions require the robot to be at a specific base configuration, #o3. Since the current base configuration is v3, we need to consider moving the base. However, the actions provided already include the `basemotion` from v3 to #o3 (and vice versa) and #o3 to #o3 (no motion). This indicates that the base configuration #o3 should be close to v3, or at least reachable without further base motions. Given that the `kin` relations for picking and placing specify #o3, it's likely that #o3 is either the current base config v3, or a computed base config that is also reachable via a trivial move_base action. Since the `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is an option, it is likely that #o3 is equal to v3. We can assume that #o3 refers to a base configuration that the robot can reach without incurring any cost, or that is already at v3. The provided `pick` and `place` actions all use #o3 for the base configuration. The problem states that if the continuous value for a surface is not provided, then it is a dummy surface. v18 is not a dummy surface and is the target. The poses where the objects are placed on v18 are all referred to as #o2. We need to assign distinct collision-free poses for each object on v18.
           
           First, the robot needs to pick v8 from v9 (on v11). Then it needs to place v8 on v18 at #o2. This process will be repeated for v12, v14, and v16.
           
           For the placements of v8, v12, v14, and v16 on v18 at #o2, we need to specify distinct collision-free poses on v18. The AABB of v18 is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). The AABBs of the objects are:
           v8: ((-0.253, 0.247), (-0.16, 0.34)) - This is a very small object that is largely offset in the y-direction, let's treat the given AABB as defining its extent relative to a central point. For the sake of placing it, let's assume the origin of the AABB is at the center of the object. So the object has a width of 0.093 and a height of 0.093.
           v12: ((-0.287, -0.375), (-0.21, -0.298)) - Width 0.077, height 0.077.
           v14: ((0.132, 0.194), (0.224, 0.287)) - Width 0.092, height 0.093.
           v16: ((0.117, -0.518), (0.213, -0.422)) - Width 0.096, height 0.096.
           
           Let's use the origin of v18 as a reference (0,0). Since v18 is centered at (0,0) and has dimensions 0.27x0.27, we can place the four objects in a grid-like fashion or simply in a row/column on v18, ensuring they are stable and don't collide with each other. We will use a z-coordinate slightly above the surface of v18 (e.g., 0.781 + 0.05). Let's assume the `kin` actions use the initial z of the object, which is 0.781. So we will place them at 0.781 + object_height/2 + surface_height. For simplicity, let's assume a generic object height of 0.05. A good estimate for the placement z coordinate is `0.781`.
           
           Since all original poses (v9, v13, v15, v17) have a z coordinate of 0.781, we'll try to keep the z coordinate consistent for the new poses on v18. The objects will be placed on v18, so the z value of the pose needs to reflect being supported by v18.
           The AABB of v18 is from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y.
           The AABB of v11 is from -0.3 to 0.6 in x and y. The initial poses are on v11.
           The current robot base position (v3) is at (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0). This position is quite far from the initial object locations and v18. However, all actions specify #o3 as the base configuration for kin. If #o3 is different from v3, we'd need a move_base to #o3. If #o3 is v3, then no move_base is strictly necessary at the beginning. The existence of `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` suggests that the initial state already allows for the robot to operate from v3. Let's assume #o3 is a base configuration that allows the robot arm v4 to reach all pick and place locations.
           
           Let's assign the poses for the four objects on v18 (at #o2).
           Object v8 (AABB of around 0.09x0.09): Place at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           Object v12 (AABB of around 0.08x0.08): Place at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           Object v14 (AABB of around 0.09x0.09): Place at (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           Object v16 (AABB of around 0.09x0.09): Place at (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           These poses are within the bounds of v18 ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)) and should be collision-free with respect to each other.
           
           The order of picking and placing does not matter, as long as each object is picked and placed. I will iterate through the objects, pick them from their initial poses, and place them on #o2 (on v18).
           
           The current base configuration is v3. The `kin` actions all refer to `#o3`. Since `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` is an available action, it indicates that either #o3 is the same as v3, or we can move from v3 to v3 without any change, which implies we are already at #o3 if #o3 is v3. Assuming #o3 = v3, we don't need to move the base.
           
           The plan involves:
           1. Pick v8 from v9.
           2. Place v8 on #o2 (on v18).
           3. Pick v12 from v13.
           4. Place v12 on #o2 (on v18).
           5. Pick v14 from v15.
           6. Place v14 on #o2 (on v18).
           7. Pick v16 from v17.
           8. Place v16 on #o2 (on v18).
           
           This plan assumes a single shared #o1 for all grasps and #o4 for all arm trajectories, and a single #o3 for the base configuration. The plan will use a unique specific pose for each object on v18 represented by #o2.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v39) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan failed because `atbconf(v39)` was not satisfied. This indicates that the computed base configuration for the `kin` predicates (which was `#o3` in my plan) was not `v3`, and I did not explicitly include a `move_base` action to change the base configuration to it. Looking at the initial state and available actions, we have `atbconf(v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` as an option for moving to `#o3`. Then, all `kin` relations (for picking and placing) use `#o3` for the base configuration. So, I need to add a `move_base` action from `v3` to `#o3` at the beginning of the plan. Then, after all objects are placed, if the robot needs to return to `v3` (though not explicitly required by the goal), I could add a `move_base` from `#o3` to `v3`. For this problem, we just need to ensure the preconditions are met for picking and placing.
           
           The plan should be:
           1. Move the base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2. Pick v8 from v9.
           3. Place v8 on #o2 (on v18).
           4. Pick v12 from v13.
           5. Place v12 on #o2 (on v18).
           6. Pick v14 from v15.
           7. Place v14 on #o2 (on v18).
           8. Pick v16 from v17.
           9. Place v16 on #o2 (on v18).
           
           The objects v8, v12, v14, v16 are small and can be placed without collision within v18 (AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))). The chosen poses for #o2 are distinct for each object and inside the bounds of v18. The z-coordinate is kept at 0.781.
