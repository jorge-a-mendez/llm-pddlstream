           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 10**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable positions for object ID 10, a square with side length 0.091024958140345, on the surface defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A "stable" placement means the object is entirely within the surface boundaries. I know that the object is square and its effective size depends on its rotation.  The surface in question is square with the same effective side.
           
           First, I need to calculate the allowable region for placing the center of the object for any given rotation. The effective dimensions change based on the angle. For any AABB with w=h and a given `theta`: `W = w * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` and `H = w * (abs(sin(theta)) + abs(cos(theta)))`  so `W = H` irrespective of rotation.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I found the effective side length `L_eff` is the same as the original side length. The effective side length will be maximized when `theta = pi/4`, where I calculate the effective side length as approximately 0.1286.
           
           To determine stable positions, I calculated the allowed ranges for the center coordinates (x, y) based on the object's effective side length (`L_eff`) and the surface's dimensions.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective side length is L, and I calculated the minimum and maximum x and y bounds to generate a 6x6 grid. Since the surface is square, and the object is square with `theta=0`, I calculated a grid of (6*6)=36 placements, spaced evenly.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, I used the effective side `L * sqrt(2)`. Then, I calculated bounds for placing the object on that rotation, and generated a 4x4=16 grid.
           
           Because I needed 50 placements, I'll take all 36 placements from `theta = 0` and 14 from `theta = pi/4`.  This should provide a good spread of stable placements, covering rotations of 0 and pi/4. There are no other objects to consider in this scenario, so I do not need to check collisions.
