           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object (`?green`) that is both of type `v17` and located "on" `v18`.  "On" means the object is supported by `v18` and positioned at a specific pose.
           
           I've identified potential candidates for `?green` as `v12` and `v8`, based on their `type` properties.  However, neither is initially "on" `v18`.  `v12` is on `v14` and `v8` is on `v11`.
           
           The initial plan involved manipulating the scene using `pick` and `place` actions to position one of these objects. I had detailed the preconditions and effects of such actions. However, a critical constraint was revealed: the *only* permissible action is `move_base`. This is a significant impediment.
           
           The `move_base` action solely changes the robot's base configuration. It doesn't modify object positions or types. As a result, it is incapable of affecting any predicates, and thus *cannot* help achieve the necessary change in the state of any object.
           
           Because the goal is not true in the initial state, and with the only available action instance being incapable of satisfying the goal, I must conclude the goal is **unreachable**.
