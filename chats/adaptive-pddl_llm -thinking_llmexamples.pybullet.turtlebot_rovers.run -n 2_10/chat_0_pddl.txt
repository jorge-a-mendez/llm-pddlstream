           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this planning problem. My primary objective is to find a sequence of actions to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires several conditions to hold true: I need to have received images from two sources, and have received analysis for both a rock and soil. The initial state satisfies a few preconditions immediately, like being at the correct configuration and the storage bays being free.
           
           The core challenge lies in satisfying the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll need to use the actions `take_image` and `send_image`.  Similarly, for `receivedanalysis`, I need to use `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. I know that `take_image` has a precondition of `calibrated(?c, ?v)`, which might require `calibrate` action. Also,  `sample_rock` needs the store to be free and to be above the rock.
           
           Now, here's where things get tricky. I have a limited set of allowed actions: `move` and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, no `send_analysis`.  The available moves don't seem to be changing the configuration to any useful extent. With the initial state having free storage, the `drop_rock` action would be impossible, as the precondition requires the store to be full.
           
           Given these constraints, I can only conclude that I am unable to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. As such, satisfying the goal is unattainable with the provided list of allowed actions. It seems there's a problem here, as I require actions not included to succeed at this goal. Therefore, I can't generate a valid plan for this goal.
