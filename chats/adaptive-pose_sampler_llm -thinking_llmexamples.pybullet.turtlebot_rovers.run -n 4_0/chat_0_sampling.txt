User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 25 optimal base positions for the robot, all from *my* expert perspective, of course!  I'm dealing with a specific target point: (2.193, -0.656). The key is to get the robot within 4 units of this target, while staying within the working area of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. Easy enough! Oh, and the robot's orientation? No worries, I'll handle that automatically - it's always pointed straight at the target.
           
           I've got a whole bunch of fixed obstacles to deal with. First, I have to *see* the target - no collisions, no obstructions! No problem, I'm good at this.
           
           I'll be smart about generating candidate positions. The core strategy is to place points around the target and then check for collisions and line-of-sight. I’ll start by creating positions around the target at varying distances (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, etc., up to 4.0) and angles. I'll shoot for a diverse spread of points - a combination of points close and far, and from various angles.
           
           Now, checking for collisions and line-of-sight is where things get interesting. I'll need to make sure the robot base *doesn't* land inside any of those fixed obstacles. Easy peasy for point-in-AABB checks! And I also have to deal with the line-of-sight stuff. I'll do this by performing segment-AABB intersection calculations, especially with the central wall (`x=0`), which will require the most attention. I'll look for points with an X > 0.05.
           
           So, in short, I will:
           
           1.  **Understand the target:** (2.193, -0.656)
           2.  **Define the search area:** Circle of radius 4 around the target, cropped by the box x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]
           3.  **Generate Candidate Points:** Generate points in a diverse way using varying distances and angles to target.
           4.  **Check Collisions/LOS:** Use the point in AABB and segment-AABB checks to filter candidates.
           
           And I get 25 locations! If I get a second request for the *same* target, I will learn from the feedback and adjust my process accordingly. But that's for another day!
