           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Unsolvable Goal due to Action Constraints**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that leads to `new-axiom@0()`. This goal hinges on achieving certain image and analysis receipt conditions.  Initially, the plan looks straightforward: I need to take pictures of various objectives and transmit them, along with rock and soil sample analyses.  However, this task presents a significant obstacle.
           
           Upon careful examination, it is apparent that I am restricted by a set of incredibly limiting `move` actions. These actions only permit the rovers (v12 and v14) to stay in their initial configurations (v13 and v15, respectively).  This critical constraint creates a fundamental problem: All the imaging and communication capabilities require the rovers to occupy specific configurations marked by the '#' symbols (like #o3 or #o0). However, the `move` actions, as they currently stand, render the necessary configuration changes impossible.  The move actions as specified are invalid as q1 equals q2, so any action that requires a move is impossible.
           
           If the move actions were valid, the rovers still would not be able to change configurations. Consequently, all actions dependent on these '#' configurations become unattainable. Consequently, no images or analyses can be taken or sent, preventing all the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, from being met.
           
           Therefore, given the restrictions, achieving `new-axiom@0()` is impossible.  There simply isn't a viable action sequence, and the goal is fundamentally unreachable.
