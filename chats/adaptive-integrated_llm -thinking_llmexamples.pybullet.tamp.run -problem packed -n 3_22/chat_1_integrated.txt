User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.124, 0.327, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.953, -0.303).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.254, -0.085, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.116).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.143, -0.305), (0.242, -0.206)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.173, 0.278), (-0.076, 0.375)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.296, -0.127), (-0.212, -0.043)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.192, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.917).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 on surface v16.**
           
           First, I need to analyze the current state of things.  I see that all three objects are graspable and stackable on v16, which is good. They also have a common symbolic pose, `#o2`, which can be used for placing them. The trick is I'll need to generate three *distinct* poses derived from `#o2` so that each object has its own unique placement on v16.
           
           Given the initial state, the plan will be broken down into the following steps:
           
           1.  Pick v14 from its current location, v15, using arm v4.
           2.  Place v14 at `#o2` *on v16* using arm v4.
           3.  Pick v12 from its current location, v13, using arm v4.
           4.  Place v12 at `#o2` *on v16* using arm v4.
           5.  Pick v8 from its current location, v9, using arm v4.
           6.  Place v8 at `#o2` *on v16* using arm v4.
           
           To make sure that everything's clear, the final plan is:
           
           **Plan:**
           
           1.  **(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)**
           2.  **(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**
           3.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)**
           4.  **(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**
           5.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)**
           6.  **(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)**
           
           The continuous values will be as follow:
           v16 has AABB (-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)
           v14 at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           v12 at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           v8 at (0.0, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With those specific placements on v16, each object is supported by it, fulfilling the goal.  I'm assuming that the preconditions such as safe approach, poses, and trajectories hold true. Also, that no other static or dynamic objects will be in the way.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Failure and Goal Unreachability**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user was right; my previous plan included `pick` and `place` actions that weren't in the allowed action set. The system only provides `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` as a valid action instance. Noted.
           
           The goal is to have `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all supported by `v16` in a specific pose, a classic stacking problem. Initially, we have these three objects at specified poses on `v11`, with the agent's hands empty and in configuration `v3`.
           
           My initial thought was to use `pick` and `place` to reposition the objects to reach the goal. However, with only `move_base` available, I'm stuck. `move_base` simply moves the base, but it can't alter the `atpose` predicates of objects. I need `pick` and `place` to manipulate the objects and achieve that goal.
           
           Given the constraints – the goal requires changing object poses and only `move_base` is valid – the goal is unachievable with the current action set. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable with the provided actions. We'd need `pick` and `place` actions to make any progress.
