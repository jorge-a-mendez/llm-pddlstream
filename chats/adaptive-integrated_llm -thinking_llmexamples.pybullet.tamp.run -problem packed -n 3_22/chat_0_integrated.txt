User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.124, 0.327, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.953, -0.303).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.173, 0.278), (-0.076, 0.375)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.254, -0.085, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, 0.116).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.296, -0.127), (-0.212, -0.043)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.143, -0.305), (0.242, -0.206)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.192, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.917).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom canmove()

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I'm given a goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. In other words, I need to place objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto object `v16`. Currently, these objects are resting on `v11` at various poses, supported by that surface. My initial thought is that I need to somehow move these objects from `v11` to `v16`. This seems straightforward, but I'm reminded of a crucial constraint: I'm only allowed to use the actions provided in a specific list.
           
           Now, the available action instances are incredibly limited: a single `move_base` action that... doesn't move the base at all! I have `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` and nothing else. This is a problem, a *big* problem. To achieve the goal, I need to manipulate objects. Specifically, I need to *pick* them up and *place* them on the target surface, `v16`. However, I don't see any `pick` or `place` actions in the list.
           
           The problem description explicitly states, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." That's the key. No `pick` or `place`? No way to move objects from `v11` to `v16`. My first impression is confirmed.
           
           Let me think again. Is there *any* way to make `on(object, surface)` true without explicitly using `pick` and `place` actions?  The axiom for `on` requires that an object be supported by, and at a specific pose on, the surface.  Since the initial state sets the objects `v8, v12, v14` at poses supported by the table `v11`, the only possible path to move the objects to v16 is to change the object's `atpose` and `supported` predicates. I looked carefully, and the provided state lists a valid pose for `v8` at `v16`, `#o2`. This makes `supported(v8, #o2, v16)` true. The problem: I can't change the object's pose from `v9` to `#o2` without, again,  `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           Therefore, because I am restricted to the provided, limited action list, and `pick` and `place` are not in that list, I can confidently conclude that the goal is *unachievable* with the given set of actions. I need to explain *why* the goal can't be reached, due to the constraint on actions.
