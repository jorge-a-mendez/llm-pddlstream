           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the state defined by `new-axiom@0()`.  This requires satisfying several conjunctions involving image reception (`receivedimage`),  the analysis of rock samples (`receivedanalysis`), and the configuration of rovers.  I've broken down the definition to identify the key predicates:  `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`.  Crucially, I note that the conditions `atconf` and `free` are already met in the initial state.  My focus needs to be on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To receive images, a rover needs to be in a position to communicate with the lander.  To get `receivedanalysis` it needs to sample and send analysis of specific rocks.
           
           **Action Plan - Using Rover v14**
           
           I will use rover `v14` for all actions, since it is initially at configuration `v15` which satisfies `atconf(v14, v15)`. To satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates I will:
           
           1.  **Move to Observation Configuration:** Move `v14` from its initial position `v15` to configuration `#o3` (using the action `move`).
           2.  **Calibrate and Take Images:**  For each objective `v17, v18, v19, v20`  (four in total), calibrate the camera `v10` on rover `v14`  (using the action `calibrate`), and then take an image (using the action `take_image`).
           3.  **Move to Communication Configuration:** Move `v14` from configuration `#o3` to configuration `#o0` (using the action `move`).
           4.  **Send Images:**  For each objective  `v17, v18, v19, v20` send the images of the objectives via ray `#o1` to the lander `v9` (using the action `send_image`).
           5. **Move to Sample Configuration:** Move `v14` from configuration `#o0` to configuration `#o5` (using the action `move`).
           6.  **Sample and Analyze Rock:** Sample rock `v1` (type v2, stone), store it, and send the analysis to the lander (using the actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`).
           7.  **Freeing the Store:** Rover v14 samples rock v1, and becomes full. Then it drops this rock via action drop_rock.
           8.  **Sample and Analyze Another Rock:** Sample rock `v5` (type v6, soil), store it, and send the analysis to the lander (using the actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`).
           9. **Return to Initial Position** To satisfy `atconf(v14, v15)` at the end move `v14` back to its initial configuration `v15`.
           
           **Addressing Continuous Parameters**
           
           Crucially, I need to address the continuous parameters associated with `imagevisible` (configurations and rays) and `comvisible`. Specifically, I must provide values for the continuous configurations `#o0` and `#o3`.
           
           *   **#o3 (Observation Configuration):**  This configuration is linked to `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, <objective>)` where `v17, v18, v19, v20` are target objects. After analyzing object location I will set  `#o3` to `(-1.5, 0.0)`.
           *   **#o0 (Communication Configuration):**  This configuration is linked to `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. After analyzing object location I will set `#o0` to `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           **Final Plan with all continuous parameters:**

)

Model:     **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the state defined by `new-axiom@0()`.  This requires satisfying several conjunctions involving image reception (`receivedimage`),  the analysis of rock samples (`receivedanalysis`), and the configuration of rovers.  I've broken down the definition to identify the key predicates:  `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis`.  Crucially, I note that the conditions `atconf` and `free` are already met in the initial state.  My focus needs to be on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To receive images, a rover needs to be in a position to communicate with the lander.  To get `receivedanalysis` it needs to sample and send analysis of specific rocks.
           
           **Action Plan - Using Rover v14**
           
           I will use rover `v14` for all actions, since it is initially at configuration `v15` which satisfies `atconf(v14, v15)`. To satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates I will:
           
           1.  **Move to Observation Configuration:** Move `v14` from its initial position `v15` to configuration `#o3` (using the action `move`).
           2.  **Calibrate and Take Images:**  For each objective `v17, v18, v19, v20`  (four in total), calibrate the camera `v10` on rover `v14`  (using the action `calibrate`), and then take an image (using the action `take_image`).
           3.  **Move to Communication Configuration:** Move `v14` from configuration `#o3` to configuration `#o0` (using the action `move`).
           4.  **Send Images:**  For each objective  `v17, v18, v19, v20` send the images of the objectives via ray `#o1` to the lander `v9` (using the action `send_image`).
           5. **Move to Sample Configuration:** Move `v14` from configuration `#o0` to configuration `#o5` (using the action `move`).
           6.  **Sample and Analyze Rock:** Sample rock `v1` (type v2, stone), store it, and send the analysis to the lander (using the actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`).
           7.  **Freeing the Store:** Rover v14 samples rock v1, and becomes full. Then it drops this rock via action drop_rock.
           8.  **Sample and Analyze Another Rock:** Sample rock `v5` (type v6, soil), store it, and send the analysis to the lander (using the actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`).
           9. **Return to Initial Position** To satisfy `atconf(v14, v15)` at the end move `v14` back to its initial configuration `v15`.
           
           **Addressing Continuous Parameters**
           
           Crucially, I need to address the continuous parameters associated with `imagevisible` (configurations and rays) and `comvisible`. Specifically, I must provide values for the continuous configurations `#o0` and `#o3`.
           
           *   **#o3 (Observation Configuration):**  This configuration is linked to `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, <objective>)` where `v17, v18, v19, v20` are target objects. After analyzing object location I will set  `#o3` to `(-1.5, 0.0)`.
           *   **#o0 (Communication Configuration):**  This configuration is linked to `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. After analyzing object location I will set `#o0` to `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           
           **Final Plan with all continuous parameters:**
           1.  (move v14 v15 #o2 (-1.5 0.0))
           2.  (calibrate v14 (-1.5 0.0) #o4 v17 v10)
           3.  (take_image v14 (-1.5 0.0) #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           4.  (calibrate v14 (-1.5 0.0) #o4 v18 v10)
           5.  (take_image v14 (-1.5 0.0) #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           6.  (calibrate v14 (-1.5 0.0) #o4 v1

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.5 -1.8) for rover v14 at target v9 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v9: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Configuration for Communication**
           
           The initial plan failed because my previous configuration for the rover (`v14`) to communicate with the lander (`v9`) resulted in a collision. This is expected since the lander is also an obstacle. The `comvisible` constraint implies line-of-sight and range requirements, but crucially, the rover's configuration must be collision-free.  "Collision with the target" means the rover itself is overlapping the lander.
           
           I need a new collision-free configuration for the rover (`v14`) at object (`#o0`) to communicate with the lander (`v9`).
           
           Let's re-evaluate the lander's AABB. It is located at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`. The previous configuration `#o0` was `(-1.5, -1.8)`. This point clearly *is* inside the lander's AABB, indicating the collision.
           
           The rover `v14` begins at `v15` which is `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  The lander `v9` is approximately at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.  I need a point close enough to `v9` (within a distance of 4 units for `comvisible`), but *outside* its AABB.
           
           I will attempt to place the rover directly above the lander's position, but at a y-coordinate value above the lander's, or vice versa, to ensure there is no collision. The lander's x-range is roughly `[-2.4, -1.4]` and its y-range is `[-2.35, -1.65]`.
           
           Let's consider a point like `(-1.9, -1.5)`. The point's x-coordinate, `-1.9`, is within the lander's x-range. Its y-coordinate, `-1.5`, is *not* within the lander's y-range. This places the rover on the y-axis, well outside the lander's AABB, so there should be no collision.
           
           Now, let's consider the other part of the plan: communication to `v17` via object `#o3`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, while `v17` is at `((-2.161, 1.82), (-2.075, 1.905))`. My chosen `#o3` was `(-1.5, 0.0)`. Since there are no obstacles between `(-1.5, 0.0)` and the target, I believe there are no conflicts.  The distance between the proposed configuration and the objective `v17` is approximately `1.89`, well within the `imagevisible` range of 2.  Thus it's a valid choice.
           
           The overall plan structure remains unchanged as it's logically sound, only the value for `#o0` needs adjusting.
           
           I have performed a thorough collision check with all existing obstacles:
           
           *   **v12:** No collision
           *   **v8:** No collision
           *   **v4:** No collision
           *   **v17:** No collision (is target)
           *   **v3:** No collision
           *   **v1:** No collision
           *   **v18:** No collision
           *   **v19:** No collision
           *   **v5:** No collision
           *   **v7:** No collision
           *   **v20:** No collision
           
           So, `(-1.9, -1.5)` for `#o0` appears to be collision-free.
           The distance from `(-1.9, -1.5)` to the lander `v9` at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)` is just 0.5 units, which easily satisfies the `comvisible` range of 4.
           The proposed new plan now looks completely solid.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Critical Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that the configuration I proposed, `#o3 = (-1.5, 0.0)`, is "not reachable" for `v14` to image `v17`. This immediately sets off alarm bells because it implies the rover's movement range is severely restricted.  The distance between `v14`'s starting point `v15` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and the suggested point is about 1.82 units. If that's too far, then reaching configurations within the required 2-unit distance for *any* of the imaging targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) is impossible, given their positions. These targets are all significantly further away from `v14` or even `v12` at its location.
           
           The problem requires a single `#o3` configuration to satisfy all the `imagevisible` predicates. This makes it a challenge. If all of those images have to be taken from one place, and that place is not reachable within a range of 2 units (the maximum), then it's a huge problem.
           
           I've also got another problem:  the statement "The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible`".  I've checked the distances, and from the current positions of the rovers, it's impossible to reach a configuration within the required range. Even if *I tried* to place `#o3` around `(0.0, 1.9)`, central to the targets, that would mean movement is significantly farther out than the `1.82`. If that distance is too large, the images are impossible.
           
           Then there's the sampling. `v12` has a better shot for this, and it seems *possible* to move and sample the rocks (`v3` and `v4`, also possibly `v5`) because the distances are smaller. It seems the best plan is for it to sample those rocks, but then the goal is STILL not met because the images are not visible.
           
           In my analysis, given the hard distance limit of 2 units for imaging, and the initial feedback that even shorter distances are not reachable, *I'm forced to conclude that the goal is currently unachievable from the initial conditions.*
