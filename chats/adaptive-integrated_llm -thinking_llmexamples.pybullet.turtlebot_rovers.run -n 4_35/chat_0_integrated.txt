           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at what that actually *means* is key. It's a complex conjunction of atoms: I need to have the rovers at certain locations, certain storage spaces free, and a series of images and analyses *received*.
           
           The initial state already satisfies the location and free-storage conditions, which is good. However, all the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are *not* true initially. I need to get those to be true.
           
           I have a limited set of actions I'm allowed to use: `move` and `drop_rock`.  The `move` instances provided are trivial, effectively doing nothing, and the `drop_rock` instances require the rovers to *have* rocks, which they don't *appear* to.
           
           Here's the problem: I need to *take images* and *analyze samples* (represented by `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, respectively). But my allowed actions *don't include* the actions needed to achieve those prerequisites.  I can't `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. The problem explicitly states that only the listed actions are allowed.
           
           Furthermore, the axiom `new-axiom@0()` *is the goal*. This is not a description of how to achieve something, it *is* the thing that needs to be true. Since the conditions for  `new-axiom@0()` are not met in the initial state and are unachievable using only the allowed actions, the goal is unachievable.
           
           It's a classic case of an incomplete action set for the given goal. Given the constraints, there's no path to satisfying the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`, no matter how I think about it.  It's just not possible given the available actions.
