           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined translates to getting an object of a certain type `on` a specific object.  Specifically, an object of type `v17` needs to be `on` `v18`.  I've identified two possible candidates for this object: `v8` and `v12`.
           
           My initial strategy is to try and get either `v8` or `v12` `on` `v18`.  I know that "on" is derived from being supported and being at the correct pose (`atpose`).  Looking at the initial state, I see that both `v8` and `v12` *are* supported by `v18`.  The problem is, they are *not* currently at the correct poses.
           
           To get them to the correct pose (`#o2`), I need to use `pick` and `place` actions. I checked the preconditions for `pick`, which includes being `atpose` the correct object, having a free hand, and being in the appropriate configuration. Everything seems to be in order for `v8`, or `v12` to be moved *except* that I do not have a list of available `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           Instead, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies I can only move the base robot, which doesn't help me manipulate objects to get them to the correct poses. This `move_base` action has the following effects:  it modifies `atbconf` (base configuration), and it negates the `canmove()` predicate. This means that after I use it once, I won't be able to use it again, which doesn't seem to help much.
           
           Given that I can't pick up and place objects and my only action negates the `canmove()` predicate which is needed for the action to be called again, I must conclude that this specific goal is unreachable with the limited action set provided. There's no way to change the `atpose` of `v8` or `v12` to satisfy the goal.
