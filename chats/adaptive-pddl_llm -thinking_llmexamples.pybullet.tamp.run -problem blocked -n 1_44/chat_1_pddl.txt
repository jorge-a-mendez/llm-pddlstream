           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Action Applicability**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal defined by `new-axiom@0`. This axiom decomposes into two subgoals: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. The objects that can satisfy `type(?green, v17)` are `v8` and `v12`. Thus, the goal translates to either achieving `(on v8 v18)` and `(type v8 v17)` or `(on v12 v18)` and `(type v12 v17)`. Luckily, the initial state confirms `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`, meaning we just need to achieve either `(on v8 v18)` or `(on v12 v18)`.
           
           To satisfy `on(?o, ?r)`, I must find a pose `#p` for the object such that `supported(?o, #p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, #p)` hold.  Analyzing the initial state, I see `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, indicating `v18` is a possible support object.  Therefore, I'm aiming for `(atpose v8 #o2)` or `(atpose v12 #o2)`.
           
           Considering the initial state, I observe `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. The poses `v9` and `v13` are not the desired `#o2`. This implies I would need to *pick* either v8 or v12, and then *place* them at pose `#o2`. I need to execute `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` followed by `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           **Constraint Analysis and Goal Unreachability**
           
           However, the problem statement crucially restricts my action space. I am only allowed to use action instances from a *provided list*. In this case, the provided list only includes `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  Since the  `pick` and `place` actions that I initially considered are unavailable, I am constrained to using only `move_base`.
           
           Analyzing the `move_base` action, it modifies the `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates, and the `total-cost`, but does *not* affect the `atpose` predicate. Because the `on` predicate requires an `atpose` condition, the `move_base` action is insufficient to achieve `(on v8 v18)` or `(on v12 v18)`.
           
           The goal requires the `on` predicate to be true for the objects which satisfy the other predicate. Since the only available action does not affect this, and `on` is initially false, the `(new-axiom@0)` goal is *unreachable*.
           
           *   **Final Decision:** The goal is unreachable given the action constraints.
