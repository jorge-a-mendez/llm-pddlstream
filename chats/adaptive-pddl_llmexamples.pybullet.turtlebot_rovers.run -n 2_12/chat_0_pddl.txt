           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers (v12 and v14), a lander (v9), a camera (v10), a storage (v16), a mode (v11), two objectives (v17 and v18), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8). The rocks are classified by type (v2 for v1, v3, v4; v6 for v5, v7, v8). Both rovers are at their initial configurations (v13 for v12 and v15 for v14) and have free storage (v16). Both rovers also have the camera (v10) onboard which supports mode (v11). There are various continuous parameters represented by `#o` prefixes, indicating configurations, rays, and motion parameters.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to a conjunction of several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state against the goal.
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is true for v1, v3, v4.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is true for v5, v7, v8.
           
           The parts of the goal that are *not* initially true are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., receivedanalysis(v1), receivedanalysis(v3), or receivedanalysis(v4))
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., receivedanalysis(v5), receivedanalysis(v7), or receivedanalysis(v8))
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, the rovers need to:
           1. `calibrate` the camera for the objective.
           2. `take_image` of the objective.
           3. `send_image` to the lander.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, the rovers need to:
           1. `sample_rock` of type stone and soil.
           2. `send_analysis` to the lander.
           
           The available actions are very limited: `move` and `drop_rock`.
           The `move` actions are self-loops, `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`, meaning they don't change the rover's configuration.
           The `drop_rock` actions `(drop_rock v12 v16)` and `(drop_rock v14 v16)` would change the state from `full(rover, v16)` to `free(rover, v16)`, but currently, both `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true. If these were used, they wouldn't change the state. If they were full, using `drop_rock` would make them free.
           
           Crucially, none of the actions `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` are in the list of valid action instances. Without these actions, it is impossible to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The initial state already satisfies all the conditions except for the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. The provided list of available action instances (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, `drop_rock v14 v16`) does not include any actions that can set `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` to true. Specifically, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are missing from the allowed actions. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
