(Thoughts: **Initial Placement Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) with extents of (0.0862, 0.0862) on a square surface (Surface 0) that spans from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given that the object is square, its bounding box (AABB) dimensions will change based on the rotation angle (theta). For axis-aligned rotations (0, pi/2), the effective dimensions are (s/2, s/2), where s = 0.0862.  At a 45-degree rotation (pi/4), the dimensions expand to s*sqrt(2)/2.
           
           To ensure stability, the rotated object's bounding box must be entirely within the surface's bounding box. I've calculated that the maximum half-extent (half_dim_eff) occurs at pi/4 with a value of s*sqrt(2)/2 which is approximately 0.06097.  The minimum occurs at 0 (and pi/2, pi, 3pi/2) with half_dim_eff of s/2 which is approximately 0.0431.
           
           My placement strategy involves varying both the rotation angle and the x, y positions. I'll use 5 rotation angles: 0, pi/4, and three evenly spaced values. For each of these angles, I'll calculate the valid x and y ranges. Because it's a square I will set those ranges as +/- half dim eff, which means using the max half extent (at 45deg, with value 0.06097) in all the calculations.
           
           I'll then subdivide these ranges, calculating 5 x,y positions at each angle (meaning a 5x5 grid in 2D space for the extreme angles). Specifically, I'll place points at -limit, -limit/2, 0, limit/2, limit.
           
           This leads to 25 placements at 0 rotation, and 25 at pi/4. This will give me a good distribution of stable placements based on the extreme cases for the bounding box.

(Thoughts: **Final Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got the placement of object 4 locked down, which means I know exactly where it is in this scene. Now, the goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 6, a square, on a specific surface, avoiding any collisions with object 4. I've got the dimensions of object 6, and I know the surface boundaries.
           
           My plan involves creating a series of 5x5 grids for different rotation angles. The key is to generate these placement grids on the surface, while actively excluding coordinates that would cause object 6 to collide with the already placed object 4. I'm going to start with a grid and iterate through the x and y coordinates that would give valid placements on the surface, while carefully checking for and excluding those that overlap object 4's bounding box.
           
           Let's start with a rotation of 0 radians. I figured out the bounding box size for this orientation. Then, I define safe regions for x and y, which will be dependent on the object's dimensions. I will iterate through the x and y range and build the 5x5 grid from there. I determined that object 6 must be "to the right" or "above" object 4 (relative to object 4's lower left corner) to avoid collisions, meaning valid x and y coordinates must meet these criteria. I then test the values, rejecting those that collide with object 4, thus getting me safe placement coordinates.
           
           Then I repeat this process for pi/6 radians rotation (30 degrees). Once again, I compute the dimensions, build an (x,y) grid and make collision checks on a per coordinate level.
           
           I repeat the above steps for pi/4 radians rotation (45 degrees), and generate a new set of possible (x,y) coordinates for object 6's placement.
           
           I iterate through the valid x and y range and filter out any collisions with object 4. Then, I can filter the available coordinates to give me the placements for this rotation angle.
           
           So, for object 6 placement, I am left with a total of 53 possible valid (x,y) placements, and for object 4 no placements are added.
           The total number of placement is greater than the required 50.
           So, I will select 21 for theta = 0, 16 for theta = pi/6 and 13 for theta = pi/4 to get 50 final, valid and diverse placements.

(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 6).
           
           First, I define the playing field, Surface 0, which is a square region. I need to figure out where I can place the new object without it falling off the surface.  This means calculating how far I can move the center of object 7 from the edges of surface 0.
           
           Now, let's talk about those obstinate objects, object 4 and 6. I've already determined their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes), which simplifies collision detection. For object 4, it's positioned in the bottom-left, while object 6 is to the left but a little higher. Their AABBs are rectangles that cover their entire shape.
           
           The crux of the matter is the new object, Object 7. Since it's a square, I can apply some trigonometry to calculate the effective bounding box based on the rotation angle (theta). The half-extent of this bounding box changes based on rotation: at 0 or pi/2 it's half the square's side length, and at pi/4, it increases.
           
           Next, I'll need to calculate the bounding boxes for different angles, like 0, pi/6, pi/4, and pi/2, to use a grid search to find stable positions for the square object. The centers will need to satisfy surface boundaries and be collision-free.
           
           I'll check all the candidate placements on a grid, for each angle I defined, to ensure no collisions occur. The collision check is straightforward: does object 7's bounding box overlap with any of the fixed AABBs?
           
           Then I will iterate through grid points, checking for collisions and adding valid points. I'm taking the first 50 valid placements.

I've got to avoid collisions with some already placed objects (ID 4, 6, and 7), all of which are squares too.  Importantly, I understand I need to consider these existing objects as *fixed* obstacles in the scene, which is different from the prompt instructions.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints**
           
           Surface 0 is defined by the coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and the new object (ID 5) has a side length of  `0.09796519626490935`. I've been given some placement info for the existing objects, including their extents (side length) and placement coordinates.
           
           Object 4 has a side length of `0.08623154552139534`, and is centered at `(-0.09188422723930233, -0.09188422723930233)`.

           **Key Insight: Preventing Collisions and Building AABBs**
           
           The main challenge is to figure out where to place object 5. To start, I need to calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each existing object based on their center and half the extent of the side length, ensuring a proper separation. The AABBs of objects 6 and 7 overlap, and this could be because they were fixed obstacles from a prior prompt. However, my main concern is making sure object 5 does not collide with 4, 6, and 7.
           
           **My Approach: Grid-Based Search with Collision Detection**
           
           Here's my plan of attack:
           
           1.  **Define Placement Area:**  I'll start with the valid region on surface 0 where I can place object 5.  This means calculating how far the object's center can move inwards from the edges of the surface.
           2.  **Generate Candidate Points:** I'll set up a grid of potential `(x, y)` center points within these valid ranges. I'm choosing a grid to evenly sample the surface.
           3.  **Rotation (Angle):** I'm going to start by trying three angles `0, pi/6, pi/4` to rotate the square to provide more variation in placement.
           4.  **AABB and Collision Checking:** For each potential center point and rotation angle, I'll calculate object 5's AABB. Then, I'll check if this AABB collides with the AABBs of objects 4, 6, and 7. I'll need to write a simple function to detect overlapping AABBs on the `x` and `y` intervals.
           5.  **Placement Validation and Filtering:**  If object 5's AABB *doesn't* collide with the AABBs of the other objects, I'll count it as a valid placement.
           6.  **Iterations and Refinement:** If I don't find 50 valid placements with the initial angles and grid, I'll broaden the angles that I will rotate at. I can also try a denser grid if needed.
           
           **Calculations and Observations**
           
           I will start by determining the bounds on where my object can be placed. I determined that the area of the surface already occupied is roughly around the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           Then I will construct and use the helper AABB.
           Given a coordinate grid and by checking the AABB for a potential collision, the code automatically creates a set of viable placement points for this object.

           6.  **Iterations and Refinement:** If I don't find 50 valid placements with the initial angles and grid, I'll broaden the angles that I will rotate at. I can also try a denser grid if needed.
           
           **Calculations and Observations**
           
           I will start by determining the bounds on where my object can be placed. I determined that the area of the surface already occupied is roughly around the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           Then I will construct and use the helper AABB.
           Given a coordinate grid and by checking the AABB for a potential collision, the code automatically creates a set of viable placement points for this object.
