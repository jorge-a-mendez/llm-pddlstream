           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievement with Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* another object.  My initial thought is to identify a suitable object and then plan how to place it appropriately. This means finding an object `?green` where `type(?green, v17)` and `on(?green, v18)` are true.
           
           I analyze the objects and the initial state. I see that `v8` and `v12` are the candidates for `?green` because of their types. Now, for `on(?green, v18)` I need `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.
           
           Initially, it seems straightforward: I'd need a `pick` and a `place` action. I'd pick either `v8` or `v12`, move it to the correct pose (`#o2`), and then place it *on* `v18`. I'd need to consider the preconditions for these actions (arm configuration, grasp, base configuration, trajectory).
           
           However, I immediately hit a major roadblock. The instructions list only one valid action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely constrains the problem. I'm *not* allowed to use the `pick` and `place` actions!
           
           This constraint drastically changes my strategy. I now have to check if the goal state is already satisfied in the initial state, or if the single allowed action instance can somehow make it true.
           
           I meticulously review the initial state again. Both `v8` and `v12` satisfy the type constraint, but unfortunately, neither are initially *on* `v18`. Since `move_base` does *nothing* with respect to objects, I'm left with an *unachievable* goal. I need to have an object in the right place, but I can't *move* any objects. `move_base` changes base configuration, and that's it. So, I must conclude the problem is unsolvable with the given constraints.
