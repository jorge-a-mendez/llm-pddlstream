           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Placements Strategy for a Stable Object on a Surface**
           
           As a seasoned expert, I've approached the problem of generating 50 stable placements for a 0.07 x 0.07 object on a specified surface. My primary concern is ensuring the object's stability, which dictates that its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must remain fully within the surface's boundaries after any rotation. I know that the object will have an initial set of AABB dimensions of `size_x` and `size_y`, and these are both 0.07.
           
           The surface in question is defined by the AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  To achieve diversity, I'll strategically vary the rotation angle (`theta`) and the object's position (`x`, `y`) within the surface. The AABB's dimensions will change depending on the rotation, but as the object has a square AABB `(0.07, 0.07)`, the effective AABB's half-width and half-height are equal to `0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Knowing the dimensions of the rotated object, I will generate `x` and `y` coordinates for the object's center ensuring that they will fall within the surface boundaries. The bounds are adjusted by the rotated half-dimensions. For this strategy, I chose a set of five rotation angles:  0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. For each angle, the x and y coordinates are determined from a 2 x 5 grid of possible positions. Doing so, I achieve the necessary 50 stable placements on the surface: 5 rotation values * 2 x locations * 5 y locations = 50 placements.
