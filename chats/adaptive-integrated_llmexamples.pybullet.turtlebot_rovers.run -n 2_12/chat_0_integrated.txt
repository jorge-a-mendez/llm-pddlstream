User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two objectives, v17 and v18, a lander v9, a camera v10, and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and stores (v16). The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by analyzing rocks and sending images. Specifically, the goal requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. The types of rocks are given: v4, v3, v1 are type v2 (stone), and v7, v5, v8 are type v6 (soil).
           
           Both rovers (v12 and v14) are currently at their base configurations (v13 and v15 respectively). The rovers have onboard cameras (v10) that support mode v11. The rovers also have stores (v16) that are currently free.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to:
           1. Calibrate a camera.
           2. Take images of v17 and v18.
           3. Send images of v17 and v18.
           4. Sample rocks of type v2 (stone) and v6 (soil).
           5. Send analysis of the sampled rocks.
           
           Let's examine the available action instances: `move`, `drop_rock`. We are not explicitly given instances for `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. However, the problem statement clarifies that any action instance not in the given list is not allowed. This implies that the goal is likely achievable *without* using these actions or by using the continuous parameters that make these actions possible.
           The initial state already provides several predicates related to `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` for both rovers at specific continuous configurations (e.g., `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`). This means we can directly use `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `calibrate`, and `send_analysis` actions as long as their preconditions are met using these pre-defined configurations and rays. The prompt states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This conflicts with the fact that without `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `calibrate` actions, the goal cannot be achieved. I will assume the provided list is *illustrative* of the available continuous parameters (like #o0, #o1, etc.) and not an exhaustive list of *all* possible action instances, since if it was, the goal would be impossible. The prompt states: "It's essential to stick to the format of these basic actions." which supports the idea that I should use the actions themselves. I will proceed with using the core actions and inferring that action instances for them are available if preconditions are met.
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
               - Rover v12 can image v17 at `#o3` with ray `#o4` (imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)).
               - Rover v12 can image v18 at `#o3` with ray `#o4` (imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)).
               - Rover v14 can image v17 at `#o3` with ray `#o4` (imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)).
               - Rover v14 can image v18 at `#o3` with ray `#o4` (imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)).
               - Both rovers have camera v10 onboard, which supports mode v11.
               - Both rovers are at their base configurations (v13 and v15), and the imagevisible predicates are with configuration `#o3`. So, we would need to move the rover to `#o3` or calibrate at the current config and take an image, then move to `#o3` to take another image or send.
               - We are given `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`, so we should be able to move to those configurations or calibrate at them.
               - To send images, we need `comvisible` to lander v9. Both rovers have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Also `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`.
           
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
               - We need to find a rock of type v2 (stone) and sample it, then send its analysis.
               - Rocks of type v2 are v4, v3, v1.
               - Rocks of type v6 (soil) are v7, v5, v8.
               - Both rovers can be above several rocks at config `#o5`:
                   - v12 is above v7 (soil), v5 (soil), v4 (stone), v3 (stone), v8 (soil), v1 (stone).
                   - v14 is above v4 (stone), v3 (stone), v7 (soil), v5 (soil), v8 (soil), v1 (stone).
               - Both rovers have free store v16.
               - To send analysis, we need `comvisible` to lander v9 (same as for sending images).
           
           Let's plan for rover v12:
           1. Calibrate camera v10 for objective v17 at configuration `#o3`.
           2. Take image of v17 in mode v11 at configuration `#o3`.
           3. Calibrate camera v10 for objective v18 at configuration `#o3`. (The camera is uncalibrated after taking an image).
           4. Take image of v18 in mode v11 at configuration `#o3`.
           5. Move to configuration `#o0` to send images.
           6. Send image of v17 in mode v11.
           7. Send image of v18 in mode v11.
           8. Move to configuration `#o5` to sample rocks.
           9. Sample a stone rock (e.g., v4).
           10. Sample a soil rock (e.g., v7). (v12 has free store v16, can sample two rocks. If not, we'd need to drop one). Given that the goal is `receivedanalysis(?r)` not `analyzed(?v, ?r)` and `full(?v, ?s)` is specific to a store, we can sample multiple rocks for analysis if there are multiple free stores, or if the rover can sample and then send before sampling another, or if the `analyzed` predicate is not coupled to the `full` predicate. In this domain, `analyzed(?v, ?r)` is set as an effect of `sample_rock` and `full(?v, ?s)` is set. So, for one store, only one rock can be sampled at a time without dropping. The goal requires *an* analysis of a stone and *an* analysis of a soil rock. So we only need to sample one of each type. We only have one store, v16 for v12. So we need to sample, send, drop, then sample again.
           11. Move to configuration `#o0` to send analysis.
           12. Send analysis of v4 (stone).
           13. Drop rock v4 from store v16.
           14. Move to configuration `#o5`.
           15. Sample rock v7 (soil).
           16. Move to configuration `#o0`.
           17. Send analysis of v7 (soil).
           
           This plan seems feasible. Let's list the actions. Note that the initial state already includes `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v12, #o5)`, meaning these are pre-defined configurations. The rover v12 is at v13, so to use these configurations we must move there.
           
           Given the initial state, rover v12 is at `atconf(v12, v13)`.
           To calibrate and take image at `#o3`:
           (move v12 v13 #o2 #o3) - #o2 needs to be a trajectory from v13 to #o3.
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           
           To send images from `#o0`:
           (move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0) - #o2 needs to be a trajectory from #o3 to #o0.
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           
           To sample rocks from `#o5`:
           (move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5) - #o2 needs to be a trajectory from #o0 to #o5.
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v4 v16) (v4 is a stone)
           (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v4)
           (drop_rock v12 v16)
           (move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16) (v7 is soil)
           (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)
           
           This plan assumes that the rover can move between `v13`, `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. The `motion` predicate only allows `(motion v12 v13 #o2 v13)`, which means the rover can only move from v13 to v13 with trajectory #o2. This is a critical constraint. If the rover can only move to itself, then it cannot move to `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`.
           This means any `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions must happen at the current configuration of the rover (`v13` for v12 and `v15` for v14).
           
           Let's re-evaluate the initial state and available actions in light of the `motion` predicate.
           The only motion predicates explicitly provided are:
           `Atom motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`
           `Atom motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`
           This means the rovers can only move to their current positions. This makes the goal unachievable as the configurations required for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) are different from the current `atconf` positions (`v13` and `v15`).
           
           However, the problem statement also says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate."
           
           This implies that while the `motion` predicate instances are limited, the actual continuous configurations can be used *if* they are reachable. The fact that `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v12, #o5)` are in the initial state suggests these are potential configurations that the rover could use. The `motion` instances provided in the `action instances` list might be a subset, and the intention might be that if the continuous parameter for motion is provided, then the move can happen. Since the problem explicitly states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," and `move` actions to configurations other than the current ones are not in the list, then the rover cannot move to `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`.
           
           If the rover cannot move, then the conditions like `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` cannot be used since `atconf(v12, v13)` and not `atconf(v12, #o3)`. Similarly for all other actions relying on `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`. This would make the goal unreachable.
           
           However, consider the wording: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The `move` actions that *are* given are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These effectively mean "stay in place". If these are the *only* allowed `move` actions, then the rovers cannot change their configuration.
           
           Let me carefully re-read the problem statement for clarification on this point. "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate." This section implies that *if* I use #<name> as a target configuration for a move, I need to provide its value. This would not be necessary if moves to new configurations were not allowed.
           
           This is a common ambiguity in these types of problems. Given the intent of these problems (solving tasks requiring complex robotic actions), it's highly probable that the `motion` predicates with `#o2` as a trajectory are placeholders, and the rovers *can* move to configurations that support the visibility/reachability predicates. The list of "valid action instances" seems to refer to `move` with fixed configurations. However, the use of `#o2` as a *trajectory* in the provided `motion` predicates and the continuous parameter discussion suggests that `move` is flexible. I will assume the `move` action can be used to move to new `#o` configurations, and that I'd need to provide the `#o2` (trajectory) value if it were an actual trajectory. But since `#o2` already appears in `motion` predicates with fixed configurations, I will assume it's just a general trajectory parameter.
           
           If the rover *can* move:
           The most efficient way to achieve the goal would be for one rover to handle all image and analysis tasks. Rover v12 seems to have all the necessary `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates with the defined continuous configurations.
           
           Plan for Rover v12:
           1. Move to `#o3` (for imaging).
           2. Calibrate camera v10 for v17.
           3. Take image of v17.
           4. Calibrate camera v10 for v18.
           5. Take image of v18.
           6. Move to `#o0` (for communication).
           7. Send image of v17.
           8. Send image of v18.
           9. Move to `#o5` (for sampling).
           10. Sample rock v4 (stone).
           11. Move to `#o0` (for communication).
           12. Send analysis of v4.
           13. Drop rock v4.
           14. Move to `#o5` (for sampling again).
           15. Sample rock v7 (soil).
           16. Move to `#o0` (for communication).
           17. Send analysis of v7.
           
           This plan uses the following new configurations for `move` actions: `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`. I will need to define these.
           The original `motion` predicates were `(motion v14 v15 #o2 v15)` and `(motion v12 v13 #o2 v13)`. This implies that `#o2` is a trajectory *type* or a named continuous trajectory that can be used for any move.
           
           Let's consider the AABBs for collisions:
           v7: ((-1.556, -0.437), (-1.44, -0.321)) - soil
           v14: ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)) - rover 2
           v12: ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)) - rover 1
           v8: ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136)) - soil
           v17: ((0.512, 2.027), (0.594, 2.108)) - objective 1
           v5: ((0.939, 0.918), (1.074, 1.053)) - soil
           v15: (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0) - rover 2 config
           v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - lander
           v3: ((-1.806, 0.636), (-1.713, 0.729)) - stone
           v4: ((-1.892, -1.412), (-1.803, -1.323)) - stone
           v13: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142) - rover 1 config
           v18: ((-1.927, 1.853), (-1.829, 1.952)) - objective 2
           v1: ((-1.24, -1.097), (-1.164, -1.021)) - stone
           
           Rover v12 current position `v13`: (1.0, -1.75).
           To image v17: `v17` is at (0.553, 2.067). Distance roughly sqrt((1-0.553)^2 + (-1.75-2.067)^2) = sqrt(0.447^2 + (-3.817)^2) = sqrt(0.199 + 14.569) = sqrt(14.768) approx 3.84. This is within range 4 for imagevisible. Max distance is 2 for `imagevisible`. This will not work if the rover has to be within 2 units. The problem statement says `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)` is true. If `imagerange` is true, then it is within range.
           
           To image v18: `v18` is at (-1.878, 1.902). Distance roughly sqrt((1-(-1.878))^2 + (-1.75-1.902)^2) = sqrt(2.878^2 + (-3.652)^2) = sqrt(8.283 + 13.337) = sqrt(21.62) approx 4.65. This is definitely out of the 2 unit range for `imagevisible`.
           This means `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` is problematic *if* `#o3` is required to be near v13. However, `#o3` is a continuous parameter, and it's given that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` is true. This implies that #o3 must be a configuration suitable for imaging v18.
           
           This confirms that I must define the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           For `#o3` (imaging): Need to find a config for v12 that can see v17 and v18.
           v17: (0.553, 2.067)
           v18: (-1.878, 1.902)
           This is difficult, as v17 and v18 are far apart. It might be better to use v12 for v17 and v14 for v18. Or maybe one rover can move to two different `#o3` configurations. But the problem states "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           Here, `#o3` is used for `v17` and `v18` with `v12`. So, I need to define `#o3_for_v17` and `#o3_for_v18` if they are different, or one `#o3` that works for both. Given `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, it seems like `#o3` is a single configuration. This implies `#o3` should be a point from which both v17 and v18 are visible within 2 units. This is impossible as they are very far apart.
           
           Let's assume the problem allows `imagevisible` to be true even if the simple distance check is greater than 2, as long as `imagerange` is true, and it is a known good config from the planner.
           Let's define a single `#o3` that works for v12 for both v17 and v18. This is a strong assumption. The goal is `receivedimage`, not `haveimage`.
           
           Let's consider rover v14 as well:
           v14 is at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75).
           imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17): v17 (0.553, 2.067). Distance from v15: sqrt((-1-0.553)^2 + (-1.75-2.067)^2) = sqrt((-1.553)^2 + (-3.817)^2) = sqrt(2.412 + 14.569) = sqrt(16.981) approx 4.12. (Out of 2 range).
           imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18): v18 (-1.878, 1.902). Distance from v15: sqrt((-1-(-1.878))^2 + (-1.75-1.902)^2) = sqrt(0.878^2 + (-3.652)^2) = sqrt(0.771 + 13.337) = sqrt(14.108) approx 3.75. (Out of 2 range).
           
           It seems the `imagerange` and `imagevisible` predicates are pre-calculated to be true for the given `#o3`, regardless of the simple Euclidean distance based on my calculations. I will proceed under this assumption.
           
           For `#o0` (communication with v9):
           Lander v9 AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). A central point for v9 is around (-1.9, -2.0).
           Rover v12 current v13: (1.0, -1.75). Distance approx sqrt((1 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(2.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) approx 2.91. This is within 4 units range for `comvisible`.
           Rover v14 current v15: (-1.0, -1.75). Distance approx sqrt((-1 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) approx 0.93. This is within 4 units. So v14 is much closer to v9.
           
           For `#o5` (sampling rocks):
           Rocks v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8.
           v1: ((-1.24, -1.097), (-1.164, -1.021))
           v3: ((-1.806, 0.636), (-1.713, 0.729))
           v4: ((-1.892, -1.412), (-1.803, -1.323))
           v5: ((0.939, 0.918), (1.074, 1.053))
           v7: ((-1.556, -0.437), (-1.44, -0.321))
           v8: ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136))
           Rover v12 current v13: (1.0, -1.75).
           Rover v14 current v15: (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           Given the `above` predicates, v12 and v14 can sample at `#o5`.
           Since v14 is closer to the lander v9 for communication, let's try to assign v14 for communication and v12 for other tasks, or for one rover to handle all.
           Let's just use rover v12 for simplicity and assume the movement between the different configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` is possible, despite the restricted `motion` predicates. If it's truly impossible to move, then the goal is unreachable. I must choose the interpretation that makes the goal reachable given the structure of the problem (e.g., providing configurations to define).
           
           Let's assume the `move` action takes a trajectory. So `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` implies #o2 is the specific trajectory to move from v13 to v13. But if I use `(move v12 v13 #traj1 #o3)`, then #traj1 is a new trajectory. This is the only way to make the problem solvable.
           
           Plan using v12 for all tasks, and defining configurations:
           `#o3_v12_v17`: configuration for v12 to image v17.
           `#o3_v12_v18`: configuration for v12 to image v18.
           `#o0_v12_v9_send`: configuration for v12 to communicate with v9.
           `#o5_v12_sample`: configuration for v12 to sample rocks.
           
           Since `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` both use `#o3`, this means that `#o3` must be a single configuration from which both v17 and v18 are visible. This is geometrically challenging if the 2-unit range is strict. Assuming `imagerange` takes care of the distance, I only need to find a collision-free and line-of-sight configuration.
           Let's find one point that allows line-of-sight to v17 and v18.
           v17 is around (0.55, 2.06). v18 is around (-1.87, 1.90). These points are quite far from each other.
           A central point for them would be around (-0.66, 1.98). Let's try to place `#o3` there.
           However, v12 is at (1.0, -1.75). Moving to (-0.66, 1.98) is a significant move.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, v9 is around (-1.9, -2.0).
           `#o0` for v12 should be near v9. A point like (-1.5, -1.8) could work for v12.
           For `above(v12, #o5, v4)` etc., `#o5` for v12 should be above the rocks. A point like (0.0, -0.5) to be roughly central to the rocks v1,v3,v4,v5,v7,v8 from v12's perspective might work.
           
           Since the provided action instances are ONLY moves to self, I must reconsider. If the given list of action instances is exhaustive and strict, then the goal is unachievable as no movement to relevant configurations is possible. The only allowed move actions are:
           `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`
           `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`
           
           This implies that the rovers are fixed at `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           Let's check if the goal can be achieved from `v13` (for v12) or `v15` (for v14) directly.
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           
           Are any `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, or `above` predicates true for `v13` or `v15`?
           No. All `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates use `#o3` and `#o0` respectively, not `v13` or `v15`. All `above` predicates use `#o5`, not `v13` or `v15`.
           
           Therefore, if the list of allowed action instances is *strictly* adhered to (i.e., the rovers cannot move from their initial configurations), then the goal is unreachable. This is the most conservative interpretation of the rules provided.
           
           Given the phrase "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan," and the fact that `move` actions to configurations other than the current ones (like `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`) are NOT in the given list of valid action instances, the rovers cannot move to these necessary configurations. Therefore, the preconditions for `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` that rely on these configurations (`atconf(?v, ?q)` where `?q` is `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`) can never be satisfied.
           
           Thus, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a specific configuration (v13 and v15, respectively). There are several objectives (v17, v18), a lander (v9), and various rocks of type stone (v2) and soil (v6). The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           To achieve these goal predicates, the rovers need to:
           1. Calibrate a camera.
           2. Take images of v17 and v18 using a camera (v10) that supports mode v11.
           3. Send the taken images to the lander (v9).
           4. Sample a stone rock and a soil rock.
           5. Send the analysis of the sampled rocks to the lander (v9).
           
           The initial state provides several predicates like `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, and `above(v12, #o5, v4)`. These predicates suggest that there are specific continuous configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) from which the rover could perform these actions.
           
           However, a critical constraint is stated: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The provided list of allowed action instances is extremely restrictive:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This means rover v12 can only "move" from configuration v13 to v13 (i.e., stay in place).
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similarly, rover v14 can only "move" from configuration v15 to v15.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           All other necessary actions (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are not explicitly listed as allowed instances, but the prompt implies we should use them if preconditions are met. The crucial problem lies with the `move` actions.
           
           For `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, a precondition is `atconf(?v, ?q)`. The `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates use configurations like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. For instance, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` requires `atconf(v12, #o3)` to be true to take an image. However, the initial state only specifies `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. Since the rovers cannot move to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` (because `move` actions to these configurations are not in the allowed action instance list), the `atconf(?v, ?q)` precondition can never be satisfied for the necessary configurations.
           
           Therefore, none of the actions required to achieve the goal (taking/sending images, sampling/sending analysis of rocks) can be executed. The goal is unreachable under the strict interpretation of the provided rules.
