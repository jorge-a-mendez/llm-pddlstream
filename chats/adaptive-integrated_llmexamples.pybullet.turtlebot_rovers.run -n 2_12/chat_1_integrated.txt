User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 with mode v11 and then send it to lander v9.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 with mode v11 and then send it to lander v9.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: We need to analyze a rock of type `v2` (stone) and send the analysis. `v1`, `v3`, and `v4` are rocks of type `v2`.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: We need to analyze a rock of type `v6` (soil) and send the analysis. `v5`, `v7`, and `v8` are rocks of type `v6`.
           
           We have two rovers: `v12` and `v14`. Both have camera `v10` which supports mode `v11` and storage `v16`. Both are at their initial configurations, `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           - Rover `v12` can use `conf #o3` and `ray #o4` to `imagevisible` `v17`.
           - Rover `v14` can also use `conf #o3` and `ray #o4` to `imagevisible` `v17`.
           Let's use `v12` for `v17`.
           - `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           - `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           - Rover `v12` can then send the image using `comvisible` with `conf #o0` and `ray #o1` to `v9`.
           - `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - Rover `v12` can use `conf #o3` and `ray #o4` to `imagevisible` `v18`.
           - Rover `v14` can also use `conf #o3` and `ray #o4` to `imagevisible` `v18`.
           Let's use `v14` for `v18`.
           - `calibrate(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           - `take_image(v14, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           - Rover `v14` can then send the image using `comvisible` with `conf #o0` and `ray #o1` to `v9`.
           - `send_image(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)`:
           We need to `sample_rock` a stone (type `v2`) and `send_analysis`. Let's pick `v1`. Both rovers are `above` `v1` at `conf #o5`. Let's use `v12`.
           - `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           - Then send the analysis using `comvisible` with `conf #o0` and `ray #o1` to `v9`.
           - `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           We need to `sample_rock` a soil (type `v6`) and `send_analysis`. Let's pick `v7`. Both rovers are `above` `v7` at `conf #o5`. Let's use `v14`.
           - `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)`
           - Then send the analysis using `comvisible` with `conf #o0` and `ray #o1` to `v9`.
           - `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           
           Since we need `calibrated(c, v)` before `take_image` and `take_image` negates `calibrated(c, v)`, we need to calibrate before taking each image. Also, `haveimage` and `analyzed` are not negated after `send_image` and `send_analysis` respectively. The `free(v, s)` is negated when sampling, so we only need to sample once per store per rover. Both rovers have `free(v,s)` initially so this is fine.
           
           Let's check the configurations needed for the plan:
           - `v12` needs to be at `#o3` for `calibrate` and `take_image` of `v17`.
           - `v12` needs to be at `#o0` for `send_image` of `v17`.
           - `v12` needs to be at `#o5` for `sample_rock` of `v1`.
           - `v12` needs to be at `#o0` for `send_analysis` of `v1`.
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o3` for `calibrate` and `take_image` of `v18`.
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o0` for `send_image` of `v18`.
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o5` for `sample_rock` of `v7`.
           - `v14` needs to be at `#o0` for `send_analysis` of `v7`.
           
           We need to make sure rovers move to the required configurations for each action.
           Rover `v12` starts at `v13`.
           - To calibrate/take image for `v17`: move `v12` from `v13` to `#o3`.
           - To send image for `v17`: move `v12` from `#o3` to `#o0`.
           - To sample rock `v1`: move `v12` from `#o0` to `#o5`.
           - To send analysis for `v1`: move `v12` from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           
           Rover `v14` starts at `v15`.
           - To calibrate/take image for `v18`: move `v14` from `v15` to `#o3`.
           - To send image for `v18`: move `v14` from `#o3` to `#o0`.
           - To sample rock `v7`: move `v14` from `#o0` to `#o5`.
           - To send analysis for `v7`: move `v14` from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           
           Given the available `motion` actions, we can construct the plan.
           The continuous parameters are `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o2`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5`.
           - `#o0` is a configuration for `comvisible`. We need to define `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)`.
           - `#o1` is a ray for `comvisible`.
           - `#o2` is a trajectory for `motion`.
           - `#o3` is a configuration for `imagevisible`. We need to define `conf(v12, #o3)` and `conf(v14, #o3)`.
           - `#o4` is a ray for `imagevisible`.
           - `#o5` is a configuration for `above`. We need to define `conf(v12, #o5)` and `conf(v14, #o5)`.
           
           Let's assume the continuous values will be provided for all necessary `#o` objects.
           
           Rover `v12` needs to observe `v17` and sample `v1`.
           Rover `v14` needs to observe `v18` and sample `v7`.
           
           Plan:
           1. `v12` moves to `#o3` for `v17` and calibrates.
           2. `v12` takes image of `v17`.
           3. `v12` moves to `#o0` to send image of `v17`.
           4. `v12` sends image of `v17`.
           5. `v12` moves to `#o5` to sample `v1`.
           6. `v12` samples `v1`.
           7. `v12` moves to `#o0` to send analysis of `v1`.
           8. `v12` sends analysis of `v1`.
           
           9. `v14` moves to `#o3` for `v18` and calibrates.
           10. `v14` takes image of `v18`.
           11. `v14` moves to `#o0` to send image of `v18`.
           12. `v14` sends image of `v18`.
           13. `v14` moves to `#o5` to sample `v7`.
           14. `v14` samples `v7`.
           15. `v14` moves to `#o0` to send analysis of `v7`.
           16. `v14` sends analysis of `v7`.
           
           All conditions of the goal will be met after these steps.
           
           For `#o0` (comvisible), the target is `v9` (lander) at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           For `v12` (current pos (1.0, -1.75)), `#o0` should be within 4 units distance to `v9` and clear line of sight. A possible point could be (-1.7, -2.0)
           For `v14` (current pos (-1.0, -1.75)), `#o0` should be within 4 units distance to `v9` and clear line of sight. A possible point could be (-1.7, -2.0)
           
           For `#o3` (imagevisible), the targets are `v17` (objective) at ((0.512, 2.027), (0.594, 2.108)) and `v18` (objective) at ((-1.927, 1.853), (-1.829, 1.952)).
           For `v12` (current pos (1.0, -1.75)), `#o3` to `v17` should be within 2 units distance and clear line of sight. A possible point could be (0.55, 0.5).
           For `v14` (current pos (-1.0, -1.75)), `#o3` to `v18` should be within 2 units distance and clear line of sight. A possible point could be (-1.85, 0.5).
           
           For `#o5` (above), the targets are `v1` (rock) at ((-1.24, -1.097), (-1.164, -1.021)) for `v12` and `v7` (rock) at ((-1.556, -0.437), (-1.44, -0.321)) for `v14`.
           For `v12` to be above `v1`, a possible point could be (-1.2, -1.0).
           For `v14` to be above `v7`, a possible point could be (-1.5, -0.4).

Model:     The previous plan had issues with collisions and reachability for the continuous configurations. Let's re-evaluate the configurations based on the provided obstacles and robot base reachability.
           
           The goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, which requires:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           2. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           3. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (e.g., `v1`)
           4. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (e.g., `v7`)
           
           Let's try to find new, valid configurations.
           
           Obstacles:
           - `v7`: ((-1.556, -0.437), (-1.44, -0.321)) - soil rock
           - `v14`: ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)) - rover
           - `v12`: ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)) - rover
           - `v8`: ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136)) - rock
           - `v17`: ((0.512, 2.027), (0.594, 2.108)) - objective
           - `v5`: ((0.939, 0.918), (1.074, 1.053)) - soil rock
           - `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - lander
           - `v3`: ((-1.806, 0.636), (-1.713, 0.729)) - stone rock
           - `v4`: ((-1.892, -1.412), (-1.803, -1.323)) - stone rock
           - `v18`: ((-1.927, 1.853), (-1.829, 1.952)) - objective
           - `v1`: ((-1.24, -1.097), (-1.164, -1.021)) - stone rock
           - `v19`: ((0.625, 0.591), (0.752, 0.717)) - obstacle
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75))**
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` (target `v17`: (0.512, 2.027) to (0.594, 2.108)):
           - The previous `#o3` (0.55, 0.5) collided with `v19`.
           - Need a point `(x, y)` such that:
               - Distance to `v17` <= 2.0
               - Clear of `v19` and other obstacles.
               - Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               - Let's try to be a bit further from `v19`. The obstacle `v19` is around (0.6-0.7, 0.5-0.7).
               - `v17` is around (0.5, 2.0). A point like (0.55, 1.0) or (0.2, 1.5) could work.
               - Let's try `#o3` for `v12` -> `v17`: (0.55, 1.5). This is relatively close to `v17` and seems far from `v19`. It's also likely reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `send_image(v17, v11)` and `send_analysis(v1, v9)` (target `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):
           - The previous `#o0` (-1.7, -2.0) collided with `v9` itself. This means we picked a point *inside* the lander. We need to be *outside* the lander and have a clear line of sight.
           - `v9` is mostly in the bottom-left quadrant.
           - `v12` is in the bottom-right.
           - Need a point `(x, y)` such that:
               - Distance to `v9` <= 4.0
               - Clear of `v9` and other obstacles.
               - Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               - A point like (-0.5, -2.0) would be further away from the lander's center but still within range. It needs to be sufficiently far to not collide, but close enough for line-of-sight. Let's try (0.0, -2.0). This point is close to `v12`'s initial position and seems far from `v9` and other obstacles. Let's try (0.0, -2.0).
           
           For `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)` (target `v1`: ((-1.24, -1.097), (-1.164, -1.021))):
           - The previous `#o5` (-1.2, -1.0) was not reachable. This likely means it was too far from the current robot position, or blocked by a large obstacle.
           - Need a point `(x, y)` such that:
               - `v12` is `above` `v1`. This usually means being very close to the rock, directly above it.
               - Reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and from `v12`'s `imagevisible` and `comvisible` configurations.
               - `v1` is at (-1.2, -1.0). `v12` starts at (1.0, -1.75). Moving directly there from `v13` (1.0,-1.75) might be too far without intermediate steps, but the "above" configuration implies a specific spot very near the rock. Perhaps there are other rocks `v12` can sample that are closer to it or other configurations from which it is "above".
               - Let's check other stone rocks for `v12`: `v3` is at ((-1.806, 0.636), (-1.713, 0.729)) and `v4` at ((-1.892, -1.412), (-1.803, -1.323)). `v4` is closer than `v1`. The initial state also has `above(v12, #o5, v4)`. Let's use `v4` for `v12`.
               - `v4` is at ((-1.892, -1.412), (-1.803, -1.323)). A configuration around (-1.85, -1.35) should work for `above`. This is also closer to `v12` than `v1` was from the other configurations. Let's define `#o5` for `v12` to be (-1.85, -1.35).
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75))**
           
           For `receivedimage(v18, v11)` (target `v18`: ((-1.927, 1.853), (-1.829, 1.952))):
           - Need a point `(x, y)` such that:
               - Distance to `v18` <= 2.0
               - Clear of obstacles.
               - Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               - `v18` is around (-1.8, 1.9). Let's try `#o3` for `v14` -> `v18`: (-1.85, 1.0). This looks reasonable and reachable.
           
           For `send_image(v18, v11)` and `send_analysis(v7, v9)` (target `v9`: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))):
           - The previous `#o0` (-1.7, -2.0) collided with `v9`. Again, we need to be outside `v9`.
           - `v14` is in the bottom-left quadrant.
           - Let's try a point that is still within comms range but not overlapping `v9`. How about (-2.0, -1.0)? This is within 4 units of `v9` and outside its bounding box.
           - Let's try `#o0` for `v14` -> `v9`: (-2.0, -1.0).
           
           For `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v7, v16)` (target `v7`: ((-1.556, -0.437), (-1.44, -0.321))):
           - The previous `#o5` (-1.5, -0.4) was not reachable.
           - Need a point `(x, y)` such that:
               - `v14` is `above` `v7`. `v7` is at (-1.5, -0.4).
               - Reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) and other configurations.
               - Let's try a point slightly different, maybe (-1.5, -0.5). This is still close to `v7` but perhaps a slightly different position allows for reachability.
               - What about other soil rocks for `v14`? `v5` is at ((0.939, 0.918), (1.074, 1.053)) and `v8` at ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136)). `v8` is closer to `v14`'s initial position. The initial state also has `above(v14, #o5, v8)`. Let's use `v8` for `v14`.
               - `v8` is at ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136)). A configuration around (-0.8, 0.0) should work for `above`. Let's define `#o5` for `v14` to be (-0.8, 0.0).

           v20: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o5 = (-1.85 -1.35) for rover v12 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-1.85 1.0) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-2.0 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-0.8 0.0) for rover v14 at target v8 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     It seems there are significant challenges with reachability and collisions for the continuous configurations. The problem states that "Any object that starts with a '#' represents a *continuous parameter* (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose) that has not yet been computed." However, all the configurations with '#' were provided in the initial state in the `conf` and `above`, `imagevisible`, `comvisible` predicates, meaning their continuous values *should* exist. The task description also says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies I need to define the values for these pre-existing `#o` configurations.
           
           The repeated "not reachable for robot base" suggests that the rovers have a limited movement range or that the suggested coordinates are simply too far from their starting points or other intermediate points. The collisions indicate my manual estimations are failing.
           
           Let's re-examine the reachability constraints. Rovers `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v14` starts at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). The movements allowed are between any configurations that have `motion` predicates defined between them. The initial state defines many `motion` predicates between `v13`, `v15`, `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for both rovers. This implies that movement *between these specific `#o` configurations and base configurations* should be possible, provided the `#o` configurations themselves are valid. The problem is that the continuous *values* I am providing for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are being rejected.
           
           Perhaps I should leverage the fact that many `above`, `imagevisible`, `comvisible` predicates with `#o` configurations are already in the initial state, rather than trying to define completely new ones or positions. The given predicates already link the rover to an `#o` configuration and then to a target, implying the configuration is geometrically sound for that purpose (collision-free, line-of-sight, etc.). The problem is in the reachability and finding coordinates that work *for all* predicates.
           
           The prompt states: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This means that the given `#o` parameters *do not* have values yet, and I have to assign them.
           
           Let's list all `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates involving `#o` configurations:
           - `above(v12, #o5, v7)`
           - `conf(v12, #o5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `comrange(v12, #o0, v9)`
           - `conf(v12, #o0)`
           - `ray(#o1)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v3)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)`
           - `conf(v12, #o3)`
           - `ray(#o4)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v7)`
           - `conf(v14, #o5)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagerange(v14, #o3, v17)`
           - `conf(v14, #o3)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v5)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v4)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v3)`
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `comrange(v14, #o0, v9)`
           - `conf(v14, #o0)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v8)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v8)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)`
           - `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `imagerange(v14, #o3, v18)`
           - `above(v12, #o5, v1)`
           - `above(v14, #o5, v1)`
           
           The problem is that a single `#o5` for `v12` must work for `v7, v5, v4, v3, v8, v1`. This is impossible in general. The same applies for `v14` and `#o5`. This indicates that these `#o` objects should be interpreted as generic *types* of configurations rather than single fixed points. However, the problem statement says `#<name>` refers to a "continuous parameter (e.g., a trajectory, or a pose)".
           
           Let's interpret `conf(rover, #oX)` in the initial state as declaring that `#oX` is a *named pose* parameter that I need to define a single value for each instance of (rover, #oX). And then for each (rover, target) pair, I need to provide a value. This interpretation is consistent with "provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This means I *cannot* reuse `#o0` or `#o3` or `#o5` for different (rover, target) pairs, even if the predicate name is the same. Instead, I should assume there are different unique configurations for each (rover, target) pair, even if they share the same `#o` name. The problem provides `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as if they are reusable. This is a contradiction in the problem statement.
           
           Let's stick to the interpretation that I need to provide distinct values for each (rover, target) pair *if they are used in the plan*. So, if `v12` is to image `v17`, I need a `v12_config_for_v17`. If `v12` is to image `v18`, I need a `v12_config_for_v18`. If this is the case, the list of available actions is confusing, as it only uses `#o3` (e.g., `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)` and `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`), implying `#o3` is a single configuration for `v12` for both `v17` and `v18`. This is problematic.
           
           Given the phrasing "If your plan uses some object #<name>... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that...". This means if I use `v12` with `#o3` to image `v17`, I provide one value. If I use `v12` with `#o3` to image `v18`, I also provide one value for that *same* `#o3` (which is impossible unless both are visible from the same point). The only way this works is if the `#o` configurations are just placeholders that get filled with a new unique value each time they are mentioned with a new target, but the prompt says to provide a value for each *configuration name*.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 are *unique* poses for each (rover, target) combination they are applied to. This means that if `v12` needs a config for `v17` (`#o3_v12_v17`), and `v14` needs a config for `v18` (`#o3_v14_v18`), these can be different.
           
           Let's redefine the continuous parameters to clarify:
           - `v12` for `v17` image: `#img_v12_v17` (was #o3)
           - `v12` for `v9` comms: `#com_v12_v9` (was #o0)
           - `v12` for `v4` above: `#abv_v12_v4` (was #o5)
           
           - `v14` for `v18` image: `#img_v14_v18` (was #o3)
           - `v14` for `v9` comms: `#com_v14_v9` (was #o0)
           - `v14` for `v8` above: `#abv_v14_v8` (was #o5)
           
           However, I am forced to use the `#o` names given in the valid action instances. This implies `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *single* points for a given rover. This is the root of the problem. If `#o3` for `v12` must work for *both* `v17` and `v18`, that's a very specific, likely unreachable point. But the problem states `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` in the initial state, *not* that `#o3` itself is a single configuration. This might mean that `#o3` in `conf(v12, #o3)` is a *generic* configuration type, and I need to select a *specific* point for each use. The prompt also says "if your plan uses some object #<name> ... for a (rover, target) pair, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This supports my interpretation of creating new config names for each pair.
           
           Let's assume I can use *new* `#o` names that derive from `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` if they are for different (rover, target) pairs. I will use the *provided* action names and just specify the values for the unique (rover, target) config.
           
           Obstacles: `v19` at (0.62, 0.59) to (0.75, 0.71), `v20` at (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5). `v20` is a very thin vertical wall at x=0. This significantly restricts movement across the y-axis for `v12` and `v14`.
           
           **Rover `v12` (starts at `v13`: (1.0, -1.75))**
           - `v17` objective: ((0.512, 2.027), (0.594, 2.108))
           - `v4` rock (stone): ((-1.892, -1.412), (-1.803, -1.323))
           - `v9` lander: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           1.  **Image `v17`**: For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`.
               - `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75). `v17` is at (0.55, 2.05).
               - `v19` is at (0.6-0.7, 0.5-0.7). `v20` is at x=0.
               - We need a config within 2 units of `v17`, collision-free, and reachable.
               - Let's try `(0.55, 1.0)`. Distance to `v17` is `sqrt((0.55-0.55)^2 + (2.05-1.0)^2) = 1.05`, good. Collision with `v19`? No, (0.55,1.0) is not within (0.6,0.5)-(0.7,0.7). Collision with `v20`? No, x=0.55 is not at x=0. Reachable from (1.0,-1.75)? Yes, seems plausible.
               - Let's use `img_v12_v17_conf` for this.
           
           2.  **Comms with `v9`**: For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
               - `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0).
               - Previous (0.0, -2.0) collided with `v20` at x=0. We need to be on one side of `v20`.
               - `v12` is on the positive x-side of `v20`. `v9` is on the negative x-side. This means `v12` cannot directly communicate with `v9` if `v20` blocks the ray.
               - This is a critical problem: if `v20` is a wall, `v12` cannot see `v9`. `v20` is `AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This is a thin wall. `v12` is at x=1.0, `v9` is at x=-1.9. Line of sight between them will cross `x=0`.
               - If `v20` truly blocks vision, `v12` cannot send to `v9`. This implies `v14` *must* send all data.
               - Let's assume `v20` *does* block comms.
           
           **Rover `v14` (starts at `v15`: (-1.0, -1.75))**
           - `v18` objective: ((-1.927, 1.853), (-1.829, 1.952))
           - `v8` rock (soil): ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136))
           - `v9` lander: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           1.  **Image `v18`**: For `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
               - `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `v18` is at (-1.87, 1.9).
               - `v20` is at x=0, not an issue. `v19` is at (0.6-0.7, 0.5-0.7), not an issue.
               - Need a config within 2 units of `v18`, collision-free, reachable.
               - Let's try `(-1.87, 1.0)`. Distance to `v18` is `sqrt(( -1.87 - (-1.87))^2 + (1.9-1.0)^2) = 0.9`, good. Reachable from (-1.0, -1.75)? Yes.
               - Let's use `img_v14_v18_conf` for this.
           
           2.  **Comms with `v9`**: For `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
               - `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0).
               - Previous (-2.0, -1.0) for `v14` was "not reachable". This is strange, as (-1.0, -1.75) to (-2.0, -1.0) is a small move.
               - The previous collision for `v12` was with `v9` itself.
               - We need to be outside `v9` but within 4 units. Let's try `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This is near `v9` and seems reachable. Distance from `v14` to `v9` center approx `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.5))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.41) = 0.64`, very close. This should work and be outside.
               - Let's use `com_v14_v9_conf` for this.
           
           3.  **Above `v8`**: For `above(v14, #o5, v8)`.
               - `v8` rock: ((-0.859, 0.018), (-0.741, 0.136)). Center approx (-0.8, 0.07).
               - Previous (-0.8, 0.0) was "not reachable".
               - Maybe `v14` cannot move to positive y values from its starting point? Or the "above" point requires very specific small adjustments.
               - Let's try `(-0.8, 0.05)`.
               - Let's use `abv_v14_v8_conf` for this.
           
           **Re-evaluating the strategy due to `v20` blocking `v12` from `v9`:**
           If `v12` cannot send images/analysis to `v9` due to `v20`, then `v14` must do all `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions.
           This means:
           - `v12` takes image of `v17`.
           - `v12` samples rock `v4`.
           - `v14` takes image of `v18`.
           - `v14` samples rock `v8`.
           - `v14` sends all collected data (image `v17`, image `v18`, analysis `v4`, analysis `v8`).
           
           This requires `haveimage` and `analyzed` facts to be transferable between rovers, which is not supported by the PDDL domain. `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)` is tied to `?v`. `analyzed(?v, ?r)` is tied to `?v`. Therefore, `v12` must be able to send its data, and `v14` must be able to send its data.
           
           So, the interpretation that `v20` blocks `v12` from `v9` must be wrong or `blocked(?y)` needs to be evaluated.
           The axiom for `blocked(?y)`:
           `Conjunction`
             `Atom ray(?y)`
             `Atom conf(?v, ?q)`
             `Atom ~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`
             `Atom atconf(?v, ?q)`
           So `blocked` means that the ray from `v` at `q` to its target is *not* collision-free. If `v20` is an obstacle on the ray between `v12` and `v9`, then the ray `ray(#o1)` from `v12` at `#o0` to `v9` would be blocked. This is what happened. So `v12` cannot communicate with `v9`.
           
           This implies a severe limitation: `v12` cannot send anything to `v9`.
           Given that `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are part of the goal, and `v12` is the only one that can image `v17` easily (given `v17`'s location) and sample `v4` easily, this means that *if* `v12` cannot communicate with `v9`, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's carefully check the `comvisible` predicates in the initial state.
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           These predicates *exist* in the initial state, meaning that for the *generic* `#o0` configuration, there *is* a ray `#o1` from `v12` to `v9` and from `v14` to `v9`. The problem is when I assign a *specific coordinate* to `#o0` for `v12`, it becomes blocked by `v20`. This means there might not be a valid `#o0` for `v12` to communicate with `v9`.
           
           If there is no unblocked `comvisible` configuration for `v12` to `v9`, then `v12` cannot `send_image` or `send_analysis`.
           Therefore, `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` cannot be achieved if `v12` is the rover that produced them.
           
           Let's check if `v14` can achieve everything:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` is in the initial state. So `v14` can image `v17`.
               - `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75). `v17` is at (0.55, 2.05).
               - `v20` is at x=0. `v14` is at x=-1.0, `v17` is at x=0.55. Line of sight from `v14` to `v17` *will* cross `x=0` and thus `v20`. This means `v14` also cannot image `v17`.
           
           This is a much bigger problem than just individual configurations. The obstacles `v19` and `v20` seem to partition the environment such that neither rover can fully achieve all image/analysis sending tasks.
           
           Let's confirm the goal's requirements: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           - `v17` is at (0.55, 2.05). `v18` is at (-1.87, 1.9).
           - `v20` is a wall at `x=0`. `v12` (x=1.0) is on one side, `v14` (x=-1.0) is on the other.
           - Imaging `v17`: `v12` has a clear shot from its side. `v14` cannot see `v17` due to `v20`.
           - Imaging `v18`: `v14` has a clear shot from its side. `v12` cannot see `v18` due to `v20`.
           - Comms to `v9`: `v9` is at (-1.9, -2.0), on `v14`'s side of `v20`.
               - `v14` can communicate with `v9` (after finding a valid config for `#o0`).
               - `v12` cannot communicate with `v9` due to `v20`.
           
           Conclusion from this analysis:
           - `v12` can image `v17`.
           - `v14` can image `v18`.
           - `v12` *cannot* send its image of `v17` to `v9`.
           - `v14` *can* send its image of `v18` to `v9`.
           - `v12` can sample `v4` (stone).
           - `v14` can sample `v8` (soil).
           - `v12` *cannot* send its analysis of `v4` to `v9`.
           - `v14` *can* send its analysis of `v8` to `v9`.
           
           This means `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` cannot be achieved. The goal is unreachable.
           
           Final check of problem statement: "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*."
           The `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` in the `blocked` axiom implies a collision check. If `v20` lies on the ray, then `blocked(?y)` will be true. If `blocked(?y)` is true, the `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `send_analysis` actions that use `?y` are impossible.
           
           Given the presence of `v20` as a wall at `x=0`, and `v12` being at `x > 0` and `v9` at `x < 0`, any communication from `v12` to `v9` must cross `x=0`, thus crossing `v20`. So `v12` cannot communicate.
           Similarly, `v14` (at `x < 0`) cannot image `v17` (at `x > 0`) because the ray must cross `x=0` and `v20`.
           
           Thus, `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` cannot be achieved, and the goal is unreachable.
           
           The only way this could be wrong is if `v20` being at `z=0` to `z=0.1` means it's a very short wall that the rover can "see over" or if the rover's camera/comms are at a height that clears `v20`. But PDDL doesn't model height for visibility. It only checks `blocked(?y)` based on the ray.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
