(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placements: A Detailed Plan**
           
           Okay, I've got the task laid out. I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a square with dimensions 0.0894 x 0.0894, on a square surface centered at (0,0) with sides ranging from -0.135 to 0.135. Stability means the object must be entirely within the surface bounds, no collisions with existing obstacles (there aren't any yet), and no overlap with previously placed objects (none exist yet).
           
           I know this object is basically a square. The key is that the rotation, theta, alters its effective bounding box. While the AABB dimensions usually implies `theta = 0` or `pi/2`, the prompt specifically wants a *rotation angle.* This tells me to consider rotations, and to account for how those rotations change the object's axis-aligned bounding box.
           
           Let's break this down. For a square with side length 'S', after rotation `theta`, the new rotated dimensions of the bounding box will be `rotated_w = rotated_h = S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The center of the object will always be the object origin, therefore I'll center my rotations in the same origin.
           
           Since I have a square object and square surface, I know the biggest constraint will be at 45 degrees where the rotated bounding box is largest. At `theta=0`, the allowed range for the center of the object is wider than at `theta=pi/4`.
           
           My strategy is to generate positions for a few specific angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, and so on), and then find a good variety of (x,y) positions for each.
           
           I see that the placement region will shrink with rotations, so I will analyze at `theta=0` and `theta = pi/4`.
           For `theta=0`: x and y range is `[-0.0903, 0.0903]`
           For `theta=pi/4`: x and y range is `[-0.0718, 0.0718]`
           
           I will build a grid of positions within these allowed ranges, sampling positions at [-0.08,-0.04, 0, 0.04, 0.08] for `theta=0`, and [-0.06,-0.03, 0, 0.03, 0.06] for `theta=pi/4`, This will give me exactly 50 placements. I'll maintain consistent precision throughout.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding 50 stable locations for this new object (ID 4) on a surface, ensuring it doesn't collide with a previously placed object (ID 5).  I've got the object's dimensions (a near-square) and the surface boundaries, plus the placement of ID 5, including its size and position.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints: I've got a surface that's limited in size and object ID 5 already on it. I need to avoid it.
           
           Object 4 has two possible orientations, 0 and pi/4. I will need to consider the effective size of the object for each. Object 5 is a rectangle centered at (-0.08, -0.08). The effective bounding box, or AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), of the object 5 is [-0.1247, -0.0353] x [-0.1247, -0.0353].
           
           So, I need to build a collision detection function to make sure that the AABBs of any potential locations do not collide with the AABB of object 5.
           I can generate candidate placements and check. I am going to try to generate 50 unique placements: 26 placements for 0 and 24 placements for pi/4.
           
           I am going to check the placements.
           I have a list of candidate placements. For the rotation 0.0, the placement list consists of the values of [-0.08, -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08] for the x and y coordinates.
           I will filter the list and select the points that are not colliding.
           
           I will follow the similar steps for rotation pi/4, calculating the AABB, checking for overlap against the existing object, and compiling valid positions.
           
           I am now ready to present the 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 5 and 4. Both objects 5 and 4 are square in shape, with dimensions and positions well-defined. I'm focusing on two rotation angles: 0 radians and pi/4 radians.
           
           For a 0-radian rotation, the effective AABB dimensions are easily calculated. I've determined that the placement needs to be carefully selected because there are potential clashes due to both objects. After extensive testing, I've decided to create a grid of potential placements, varying `x` and `y` while setting the rotation `theta=0`.
           Specifically, I'll restrict `x` to the values `0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09`.
           And the `y` values `[-0.09, -0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09]` to yield 40 positions.
           
           For pi/4, I've calculated the effective AABB and the minimum viable x for no collision `0.0289`. Because of this, for `theta=pi/4`, I'll use `x = [0.03, 0.05]` and `y = [-0.07, -0.05, -0.03, -0.01, 0.01]` to yield 10 values.
           
           With this method, I will get 40 + 10 = 50 placements. I will generate AABBs for each, and carefully check the collision using an `AABB_collision` algorithm. I will ensure that the placements are valid and will provide 50 stable object placements on surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 7, size S7) on surface 0, ensuring these placements don't collide with three existing objects (IDs 5, 4, and 6) already on the surface. Surface 0 is a square area centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27.
           
           To achieve this, I'm first calculating the available placement space by identifying the regions occupied by the existing objects. I have their approximate bounding boxes (AABBs) for various placements, assuming zero rotation.
           
           Next, for the new object, I'm considering placements at two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees (pi/4 radians). For each angle, I calculate the effective bounding box dimensions. At 45 degrees, the square effectively becomes larger diagonally.
           
           I'm systematically searching for valid placements using a grid-based approach. I'm generating candidate (x, y) coordinates within the surface bounds and checking for collisions with the existing objects for each of the two rotation angles. The goal is to maximize coverage of free space. To do so, I'm defining a function that checks for collisions between object bounding boxes.
           
           I'm considering a grid with steps of 0.02 for the x and y coordinates. Given the nature of the existing object placement on the surface, the available space is primarily in the top-right and some central sections. Thus, I'll prioritize testing the top-right part of the surface.
           
           I'm iteratively generating placements and collecting valid candidates to get a list of 50 non-colliding locations.
