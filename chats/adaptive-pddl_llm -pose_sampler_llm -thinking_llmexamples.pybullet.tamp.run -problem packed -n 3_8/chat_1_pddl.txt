               Atom on(v12, v16)

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Task: A Detailed Plan (or Lack Thereof)**
           
           Alright, here's the situation. I've got a problem where the goal is to stack three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on a specific surface (v16). Currently, these objects are supported by v11, supported by their initial poses. I see that there are available `kin` information, and that #o2 would be a suitable place for these objects to be supported by v16. I can see the axioms and predicates to achieve `on`, and they state that `atpose` and `supported` predicates are needed to achieve this.
           
           The initial state tells me that objects are graspable, stackable, and the robot has an arm and is at a base conf. The robot's arm, v4, can be used to perform all the interactions because there are `kin` facts relating to picking v8, v12, and v14 from their initial poses and placing them at #o2. The base conf is at v3. However, I have been instructed to only use the *specific* action instances provided.
           
           Here is the crux: The instruction says that only actions in the list can be used, and this list only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move base does *nothing* and there are no instances of `pick` or `place`. The goal requires picking and placing all three objects from their initial support surface (v11) to the destination surface (v16). I understand that this is possible with the given facts and knowledge of `kin` facts, but I am *forbidden* from using the essential `pick` and `place` actions because they are *not* provided as "valid action instances."
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v16)`, I must first move the object v8 from pose v9 to pose #o2, where `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`.  The only way to move the object's pose is via `pick` and `place`, which are forbidden. The same argument applies to v12 and v14.
           
           Therefore, because I can only use `move_base` and not the essential `pick` and `place` actions, the goal is *unreachable*. It's a constraint, an important limitation on what I am *allowed* to do. It's a trap! The plan, under these constraints, is simply non-existent.
