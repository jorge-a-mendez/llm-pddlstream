(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable configurations *(surf_idx, theta, x, y)* for object ID 6, a square with dimensions approximately 0.0937 x 0.0937, on surface 0, a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Stability, in this context, means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), after rotation, must remain entirely within the surface.
           
           Understanding the Geometry: The object is a square, implying its dimensions are equal. The surface is also a square, creating symmetrical placement opportunities. This simplifies the calculations.  My focus is on ensuring the rotated object, *specifically its AABB*, remains fully within the surface bounds.
           
           Addressing Rotation:  The challenge lies in managing the rotated AABB. Since the statement refers to the dimensions of the "axis-aligned bounding box," I will assume the provided dimensions (size_x, size_y) represent the *object's dimensions* and not its AABB after rotation (which is more common in practice).  When the object is rotated by `theta`, the AABB's dimensions will change.  Specifically, the AABB's width will be  `w_bb = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` (where *s* is the side of the object) and height will be the same. The maximum AABB width occurs at `theta = pi/4` and the minimum width occurs at `theta = 0`.
           
           Placement Logic: The placement strategy involves generating several rotation angles and then positioning the object such that the AABB does not exceed surface bounds.
           
           1.  **Theta Selection**: I'll iterate through `theta` values in the range `[0, pi)`. I will use 10 values evenly spaced.
           2.  **AABB Calculation**: For each `theta`, I'll calculate the *rotated* object's AABB dimensions.
           3.  **Position Calculation**: Knowing the AABB size for the rotation, I'll determine the valid *x* and *y* ranges for the object's center to ensure the AABB stays within the surface.
           4.  **Placement Generation**: For each `theta`, I'll generate a few distinct `(x, y)` placements within the allowed region.  I'll use the center of the surface, bottom left corner, top right corner, top left corner and bottom right corner.
           
           Final Result: This ensures I obtain 50 unique stable placements, covering diverse rotations and positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem.** I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with another square already placed there (ID 6).
           
           Here's the situation: Object 4 has a side length of `s4 = 0.08656`, and Surface 0 is a rectangle defined by coordinates `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 6 is centered at (0,0) with a side length of `s6 = 0.09373`.
           
           My primary concern is preventing collisions. I'm focusing on the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of both objects, because using AABBs for collision detection is pretty efficient. For object 6, the AABB is trivial as it's not rotated: it's just a square centered at (0,0) with side length `s6`. Object 4's AABB will depend on its rotation angle (theta).
           
           I need to satisfy these conditions:
           
           1. **Containment:**  Object 4 must stay completely within Surface 0.  This restricts the possible (x, y) coordinates of its center based on its rotated dimensions.
           
           2. **No Collision:** The AABB of Object 4, at any theta and (x, y) I select, mustn't overlap Object 6's AABB.  This means Object 4's AABB cannot extend into the area taken up by Object 6's AABB, as I calculated it using the AABB.
           
           **Let's outline the process I'll use to find the placements:**
           
           1.  **Define theta range:** I'll explore several values of `theta` to get a variety of orientations.
           
           2.  **Calculate bounding boxes:**  For each theta, I'll calculate `side_bb4` (side of Object 4's bounding box).
           
           3.  **Determine allowed regions:**  For the containment criteria, this involves calculating surface-allowed x/y regions.
           
           4.  **Collision check:** Based on the placement constraints, I'll then calculate all the valid placements that meet the No Collision constraint.
           
           **Now, about the math.**
           
           *   The containment condition will give me x/y placement constraints given `side_bb4` and surface limits. The no-collision condition requires I have to place object 4 at a certain place not covered by object 6, which leads to `0,0` not being a possible point.
           
           *   To avoid collisions, object 4's AABB cannot overlap object 6's AABB.  I'll use the non-overlap conditions I know for two AABBs to calculate placement regions free of collisions. This means object 4's center must be far enough away from the center of object 6.
           
           *   A quick check reveals something interesting. It turns out that for the given side dimensions, Object 4 will only fit around Object 6 in specific orientations -- primarily when Object 4 is placed along the x or y axis. This means the angles where it is possible for these objects to be packed together is very limited, and only exists around rotations of 0 and 90 degrees.
           
           *   The angle constraint reveals that for rotations with 45 degrees, object 4 will be simply unable to be placed around object 6.
           
           **Finally, the Solution**
           1. Given these tight constraints, I'll restrict my placements to angles of `0` and `pi/2`.
           
           2. The solution is thus comprised of a set of 50 different `(x, y)` locations for these rotations that maximize the coverage of object 4 within surface 0 that do not collide with object 6.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, while ensuring it doesn't collide with two pre-existing objects: object 6 and object 4. I'm operating on a 0.27-unit by 0.27-unit surface (surface 0, ranging from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Object 6, positioned at (0, 0), has dimensions of `0.093734` and I have calculated its AABB. Object 4, placed at approximately (-0.0917, -0.0917), measures `0.086557` and occupies the bottom-left corner from approximately (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.048, -0.048).
           
           The new object (ID 5) has a size of `0.074471`. To avoid collisions and fit on the surface, its orientation (theta) is important. I’ve defined half the side length of object 5’s AABB, `half_side_bb5`, which varies with theta.
           
           **Collision Check Process:**
           
           I need to ensure no collisions occur. I will check for 3 types of potential collisions.
           1. The bounding box of the new object to be within surface bounds.
           2. The bounding boxes of Object 5 and Object 6 to not overlap.
           3. The bounding boxes of Object 5 and Object 4 to not overlap.
           
           I am first considering a fixed rotation, setting `theta = 0`. For this setup, I calculated surface bounds for object 5 based on AABB size and position constraints.
           
           I’ve determined that for *theta* 0, the safe placement areas are constrained.
           I will check surface boundaries, then exclude collisions with object 6 and then exclude collisions with object 4, effectively calculating which locations are safe to place object 5.
           
           **The Valid Placement Zone**
           
           After analyzing the collision scenarios, I've narrowed down the valid placement area for object 5 when theta = 0 to a small square region in the top-right corner, defined by: `x_range = [0.084102, 0.097764]` and `y_range = [0.084102, 0.097764]`.
           
           For other angles, *e.g.* *theta* = *pi*/4 I have calculated that no valid positions exist.
           
           **Final Placement Plan**
           
           Given the small, valid placement zone, and the need for 50 placements, I'll place the object at angle theta = 0, and theta = pi/2.
           I will use a 5x5 grid in the Valid Region to generate the requested 25 locations for both angles.
