User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is to find three safe spots for my robot, considering the target's location and a bunch of obstacles. I need to keep the robot within a 2-meter radius of the target, avoid collisions, and make sure there's a clear line of sight. Also, I must stay within the global limits of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           I'll start by analyzing the scene. It looks like the outer boundary is explicitly given as an AABB, as expected. There are also walls that define the operating space, but with a buffer, to account for the robot's size. There's a crucial central vertical wall that effectively divides the space. There are other small scattered box obstacles as well, adding complexity.
           
           **Constraints and Strategy**
           
           The main constraints are the 2-meter range, the global limits, collision avoidance, and line-of-sight maintenance. The robot's orientation is automatically set towards the target.
           
           My core strategy is to place the robot at distances less than or equal to 2m from the target and check for collision and line of sight.
           
           The central wall is a major factor. If the target and robot are on opposite sides, there's no way to achieve a clear line of sight. So, the robot must be on the same side of the central wall as the target. The global bounds are another key concern.
           
           I can make a function to check if a position is in any of the obstacles and another function to check if the line of sight is clear. I'll need to use these to validate positions.
           
           **The Plan and Position Generation**
           
           Let's define a function for `is_colliding` with a robot buffer for a collision check and a function `is_los_blocked` to check for line of sight and avoid any edge cases. Now, with the functions, I can proceed with the placement strategy.
           
           I have the target point. It's in the lower-left area of the map, and near the central wall.
           
           The best strategy is to place the robot up and left from the target point since, if the robot is to the right, then there is a high likelihood of crossing the central wall. The main focus then is to get the robot up and left, away from obstacles and within line of sight of the target.
           
           I will use three possible candidate points: `(-1.700, -0.611)`, `(-2.293, -0.567)` and `(-0.953, -0.917)`. The points were validated using the defined functions.
           
           I can confirm this set of three positions: `(-1.700, -0.611)`, `(-2.293, -0.567)` and `(-0.953, -0.917)` are the desired positions.
