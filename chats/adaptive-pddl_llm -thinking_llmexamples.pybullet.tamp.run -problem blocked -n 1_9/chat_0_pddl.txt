           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`.  My initial instinct is to break this down. Expanding the axiom reveals I need to make an object (let's call it `?green`) satisfy two conditions: be `on v18` and have the `type v17`.  
           
           The next logical step is to scan the initial state and available objects for potential candidates for this `?green`. I see `v12` and `v8` fit the bill because they're both of type `v17`. Now, I need to figure out how to make either of them "on v18."
           
           "On v18" translates to being `atpose` a position where it is `supported`. Given `supported` facts in initial state for these variables.
           
           **Initial Plan Formulation and Action Selection**
           
           To achieve "on v18," I need to manipulate the object's pose. I reason that I must move the object from its initial pose to a pose where `supported(vX, ..., v18)` can make `on v18` be true.
           
           The actions I'd typically consider for this are `pick` and `place`. However, the problem provides a crucial constraint: I'm only allowed to use action instances listed explicitly.
           
           **Problem with available action**
           
           The only action instance given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't seem to manipulate object poses or allow for direct picking/placing. It appears to change the robot's base configuration.
           
           **Unreachability Analysis**
           
           I'm now forced to critically assess whether the goal is even *achievable* given *only*  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. My analysis points to "no." Since this action doesn't change `atpose` or `supported` predicates, it cannot get any object "on v18." Since `type` is fixed, and the initial state makes nothing immediately "on v18", I can't fulfill `new-axiom@0()`
           
           Thus, with only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` available, the goal is unachievable, making the problem unsolveable.
