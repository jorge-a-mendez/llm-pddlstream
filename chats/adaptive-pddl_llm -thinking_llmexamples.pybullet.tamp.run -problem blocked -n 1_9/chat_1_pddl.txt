           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the goal is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object that's both the right *type* and *on* `v18`.  I see two candidate objects in the initial state that could satisfy the `type` condition: `v8` and `v12`. Let's evaluate the predicates.
           
           To be *on* `v18`, an object must be *supported* by `v18` and at a particular *pose*. The initial state gives us `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This indicates that both objects *could* be on `v18` if they were at pose `#o2`.
           
           **Plan Generation: Focus on Object Manipulation**
           
           Since both `v8` and `v12` meet the 'type' requirement and could be moved to pose `#o2` and placed on top of `v18`, I'll work out a plan to pick up one of these objects and place it at `#o2`.
           
           I'll start with `v8`. The initial state gives us `atpose(v8, v9)`. So I need to move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           **Step-by-Step Plan with Action Preconditions**
           
           1.  **Action: `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`**
           
               *   *Preconditions Check:*  The preconditions involve checking *kinematics*, arm configuration and state.  It is true according to the initial state. The relevant `kin` facts are, which use `#o3`, however, given the problem and the hint, I will be assuming that `#o3` can be effectively instantiated by `v3` because it's a "continuous parameter." It implies compatibility, and also the only move base is `v3` to `v3`.
           2.  **Action: `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`**
           
               *   *Preconditions Check:*  Preconditions for a successful place include the `kin` facts I have, `atgrasp`, `atbconf` (base configuration).  Given my assumption on the continuous parameters, and that `v3` is valid, all are true.
           
           **Cost Considerations**
           
           The most direct plan (pick, place) is chosen as the path to the least amount of cost. Any other step would be unnecessary.
           
           **Final Goal State Analysis**
           
           After the `pick` and `place` actions: `atpose(v8, #o2)`. Since, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is also in the initial state,  `on(v8, v18)` is true. `type(v8, v17)` is also true. The axiom is therefore satisfied! If the solution can't find an appropriate pose or support, it would be an unsolvable state.
           
           **Final Plan**
           
           The final plan is therefore:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've re-evaluated the problem with the only valid action at my disposal: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The task is clear: to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type, `?green`, be on `v18`. From the axioms, this requires both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           I've meticulously re-examined the initial state. I've found two candidates that fit the `type` constraint: `v8` and `v12`. Now, I have to ensure they also satisfy the `on` condition. Recall that `on(?o, ?r)` means `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           After carefully checking, neither `v8` nor `v12` is *currently* `on(v18)`. Although they are both supported by `v18`, their *current* poses are not those that satisfy the `on` predicate. I'd need to employ `pick` and `place` actions to move one of them to the correct position.
           
           However, the problem limits me to *only* the single `move_base` action. This action's preconditions are all true in the initial state. The effects are merely to maintain the robot's current pose and disable its ability to move further until another action is performed. Crucially, the move_base action does *not* alter any object's pose or support relationships and does not involve any grasping.
           
           Therefore, since the only available action is incapable of modifying the state to achieve `on(?green, v18)`, and neither object initially satisfies that condition, the goal is, unfortunately, unreachable with the provided constraints. The plan is not feasible.
