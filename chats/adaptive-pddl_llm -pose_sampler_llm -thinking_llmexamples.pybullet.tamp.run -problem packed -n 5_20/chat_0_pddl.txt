(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.07433150970748814 x 0.07433150970748814) on a surface (surface 0, AABB: [-0.135, -0.135] to [0.135, 0.135]). No prior information or obstacles are provided.
           
           First, I define "stable" as: the object remains within the surface, avoids collisions with fixed or previously placed objects. Since this is the first request, I'm working with a clean slate.
           
           The key is the object's square shape. Regardless of rotation (theta), its effective AABB side length is always equal to its width/height. However, the problem specifies a range of angles, which implies rotation should be varied. For containment, the AABB extents after rotation (if rotated), must not be greater than the surface dimensions.
           
           My approach: generate a grid of x,y coordinates within the safe range on the surface, then test a set of rotations. With the object rotated, its bounding box size changes. I considered that varying the rotation needs a *smaller* safe range to ensure no part of a rotated object would fall outside the allowed surface boundaries.
           
           I carefully computed the safe range using half the side length of the bounding box. After rotating by 45 degrees, the object's effective side-length of its bounding box increases. Thus, the available safe placement locations *decreases*.
           
           The safe rectangle for object centers to be *fully contained* within a given rectangular surface requires adjusting for this object rotation, so I've recomputed a smaller range, to guarantee containment with any rotation between zero and pi/4, where the bounding box side length is largest.
           
           I created a 5x5 grid for x and y, and will then use two angles for theta, zero and pi/4 (45 degrees).

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object (ID 4)**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan. I've successfully placed object ID 6, and now I need to figure out where to put object ID 4. This is a square with side length 0.07868367053122408, and it needs to fit on the same surface as before: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  My goal is to find 50 stable placements for it while making sure it *doesn't* collide with object ID 6.
           
           First, I need to understand this new object, ID 4.  If I rotate it, the maximum extent of its bounding box (AABB) increases.  I calculated the half-width of this rotated bounding box, which is 0.05563502542675498. That, along with the surface boundaries, lets me know the safe range for the center of object 4: `[-0.07936497457324502, 0.07936497457324502]` for both x and y.
           
           Now for the tricky part:  avoiding object ID 6.  I already know where object 6 is: at `(0, 0.0, -0.0824406293152362, -0.0824406293152362)`. I know its AABB, centered around (-0.0824, -0.0824) and determined that it has half width 0.03716575485374407. I calculated the collision zone that object 6 occupies.
           
           To detect collisions, I'll be using the AABB for each object. For object 4, the AABB size depends on whether it's rotated or not. If not rotated, its half-width is 0.03934183526561204. If rotated (pi/4), I use the rotated half-width (0.05563502542675498) again. The condition for *no* collision is that the AABBs *don't* overlap (I have the condition).
           
           To find these 50 stable placements, I'll use a grid-based approach.  I'll generate a grid of potential center points within the safe surface bounds. For each potential center and each rotation angle (0 and pi/4), I check if there would be a collision with the existing object (ID 6). If there *isn't* a collision, I add that placement to the list. I repeat until I find 50 valid, non-colliding placements. The coordinates are calculated and added to the array of valid positions. I will be making sure the total placements are 50.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Placement Possibilities for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on a surface, avoiding collisions with two existing, *fixed* obstacles (IDs 6 and 4). I have all the surface and obstacle geometry, including the square's side length, and AABB information for collision detection. The surface is rectangular and has the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 5 is a square with side length s5 = `0.09781969722786066`.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate placements (center coordinates and rotation) and then rigorously check for collisions using AABB overlap. Since the object is square, I have to consider the impact of rotation (`theta`). With a rotation of 0.0 or pi/2, the AABB is smaller than the 45-degree rotation (`pi/4`), which would have a side length of (`s5 * sqrt(2)`).
           
           I’ve meticulously calculated the safe zone for the center coordinates, which is `[-0.06583111141268781, 0.06583111141268781]` for both x and y. This calculation guarantees that Object 5 remains entirely within the surface bounds for *any* rotation.
           
           However, the trouble begins with the obstacles. The AABBs of obstacles 6 and 4 are:
           
           `AABB6 = [-0.11960638416898027, -0.04527487446149213, -0.11960638416898027, -0.04527487446149213]`
           `AABB4 = [-0.06579682678902704, 0.012886843741197034, -0.03934183526561204, 0.03934183526561204]`
           
           I’m meticulously applying a collision check function I wrote, which rigorously examines AABB overlaps in both the x and y axes. I determined that the safe region for the center for Object 5, even with the expanded range for rotation `X_safe(0)` still had collisions. The main culprit being the y-extent range of Object 4. It's too high up to fit any center within the bounds with zero rotation, and if rotated to 45 deg, it is too wide in the x-extent.
           
           My calculations have led me to the *troubling* conclusion: based on the given geometry and my collision checks, there are *no* valid, non-colliding placements for Object 5 at all. The obstacles are positioned in such a way that no center point in the safe range avoids an overlap.
           
           However, the problem statement explicitly requires me to provide 50 stable placements. I'm hitting a logical contradiction. I am forced to proceed and provide placements within surface bounds, but with a warning that these *will* collide according to my analysis. The prompt says if I get feedback about the same object, it means collision or issues with a previous placement.
           
           I'll proceed by creating a grid of 50 possible locations for Object 5 using the center range calculated for all rotations `[-0.06583111141268781, 0.06583111141268781]`.  I'll then alternate the rotation between 0.0 and pi/4. But I am concerned about what will happen next.
