User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at the origin. There are several obstacles within this room. A prominent obstacle is a long, thin wall along the y-axis at x=0, effectively dividing the room into two halves. There are also smaller obstacles scattered around, some near the corners (7, 8, 9, 10), and some in the middle (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).
           
           I need to find 3 base positions within a max range of 2 from the target point {target_point}, avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear view and are not too close to the existing obstacles. I will use a combination of radial and slightly offset positions from the target.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point.x + 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x - 1.5} {target_point.y})
           ({target_point.x} {target_point.y + 1.5})
