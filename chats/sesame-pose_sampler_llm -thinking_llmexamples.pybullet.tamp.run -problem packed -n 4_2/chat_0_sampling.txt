(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I've been tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 7, dimensions roughly 0.083 x 0.083 meters) on a square surface (Surface 0, dimensions 0.27 x 0.27 meters centered at the origin). My primary concern is ensuring the object remains entirely within the surface, regardless of its rotation.  I'll define a placement as `(surface_index, rotation_angle, x_center, y_center)`. Since I have no information on collisions with other objects or fixed obstacles, those aren't factors in this specific plan.
           
           Given the square object, its bounding box (AABB) will maintain the same dimensions upon rotation *if* the rotation is a multiple of pi/2. Otherwise, for any rotation `theta`, the effective bounding box dimensions become slightly larger. To guarantee containment, I must consider the maximum bounding box size, which occurs at a 45-degree rotation.  This gives me a more restrictive placement area.
           
           I’ve calculated this "safe" region.  For containment, the object’s center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the inner square region centered at (0, 0) with edges at +/- 0.0761155. So my x and y values for the centers will be restricted to this range.
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I'll use a 7x7 grid within this valid region, giving me 49 placements. For the 49 placements, I will assign an angle to the placements, creating a diverse set.  I will use these angles to ensure a diverse set of angles in placements: `0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi, 5*pi/4, 3*pi/2, 7*pi/4, pi/6, pi/3, 2*pi/3, 5*pi/6`. Finally, I'll add a 50th placement at the center (0, 0) with a slightly different random angle (pi/8) to guarantee the 50 placements. All `surf_idx` values will be 0 as the single surface is used.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions and Staying Within Bounds**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement for Object 7, and now it's time to figure out where to put Object 4 on the surface. Object 7 is positioned at `(0, 0.0, -0.076, -0.076)` and I know its dimensions. The surface I'm working with is a rectangle.  My goal is to find 50 valid placements for Object 4 that don't collide with Object 7 and remain fully within the surface's boundaries.
           
           First, I've calculated the maximum effective half-dimension of Object 4 when it's rotated by 45 degrees, which I'll need to define the valid range for the center of the object.  This gives me a safe zone for Object 4's center. It's crucial for the object's center to be within the rectangle. I'm using the surface's dimensions to determine where Object 4 can be located and I'm treating the placement as though the object is rotated at 45 degrees to determine the valid range for its center.
           
           To ensure no collision, I'll calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) for Object 7, which I know from its known position and size. This creates an area where Object 4 *cannot* be placed.
           Then, I will generate a grid of potential locations for Object 4 on the surface, considering different rotations. I'm using a 7x7 grid to generate 49 (x, y) coordinates and applying 8 rotations to each of the coordinates. The idea is that this grid and rotation combination will generate enough unique placements, to find 50. I will generate positions centered in a valid area.
           
           For each candidate placement, I'll calculate Object 4's AABB for the given rotation. Then, I check for overlaps between Object 4's AABB and Object 7's AABB.  A collision is detected if their bounding boxes overlap at all, and that placement gets discarded. In addition, I check that the entire object is contained within the surface boundaries.
           
           I'm keeping it simple for the collision check to calculate the exact AABB for each orientation, and I'll keep the process efficient by pre-calculating some of the geometric factors.
           This systematic, grid-based approach ensures I explore a good range of placements while efficiently eliminating those that collide with Object 7 or fall outside the surface.  This should give me a suitable set of 50 non-colliding and valid placements. The goal is to maximize the surface area, and so the non-colliding locations are key to that. The grid and rotations will give a suitable distribution of options, that are also well-separated to be considered "unique" placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 5) on surface 0, while ensuring no collisions with existing objects (IDs 7 and 4). To achieve this, I'm working with the following:
           
           **Scene Context:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** Defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           **Existing Obstacles:**
           
           *   **Object 7 (ID 7):** A square with extents `(0.08325947634185965, 0.0832594763418596)` positioned at `(-0.0761155175, -0.0761155175)` with a rotation of `0.0` radians, and the AABB `((-0.11774525567, -0.11774525567), (-0.03448577933, -0.03448577933))`.
           *   **Object 4 (ID 4):** Another square, this time with extents `(0.09809070815529185, 0.09809070815529186)`, located at `(-0.06563698, -0.00547076466666666)` with a rotation of `0.0` radians, and the AABB `((-0.11468233407764593, -0.05451611874431259), (-0.01659162592235407, 0.04357458941097927))`.
           
           **New Object:**
           
           *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** A square with extents `(0.0901589832843111, 0.09015898328431107)`, which I need to place.
           
           **The Approach:**
           
           I'll iterate through a grid of possible (x, y) coordinates and rotations for object 5. For each candidate position and rotation, I need to:
           
           1.  **Calculate the AABB:** Account for the rotation, as this will change the dimensions. For a square object, the maximum effective AABB half-dimension is `0.06375` (calculated using `s_half_5 * sqrt(2)`).
           2.  **Check Surface Containment:** The object must be fully within surface 0. Using the maximum AABB dimensions from above will provide a safe bound on center locations.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I will use the established AABB collision logic to check for overlaps with both object 7 and object 4. The formula is: `(Ax_max > Bx_min and Ax_min < Bx_max)` AND `(Ay_max > By_min and Ay_min < By_max)`.
           4.  If all checks pass, the position and rotation are deemed valid, and I'll save them as placements.
           
           To ensure surface containment, I calculated bounds for the object center. Given that the largest possible effective AABB dimension is 0.06375, I will only consider object center locations in `[-0.07125, 0.07125]` for both x and y.
           
           I will create a grid of 7x7=49 points covering x and y values within the bounds [-0.07125, 0.07125]. I will test these 49 positions in conjunction with 8 different angles, or rotations. Then apply the collision detection and containment checks to each, until 50 successful placements are found.
           
           I also pre-calculate values to speed up checks where possible. For example, I have already calculated the `effective_half_dim` for a given square object side length and `theta`.
           
           I'll check some placements to verify my approach is working.

(Thoughts: **Thoughts on Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, my task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, ensuring no collisions with already placed objects. My strategy involves meticulous planning and execution.
           
           First, I need to analyze the scene geometry. I'm provided with the dimensions and AABBs of existing objects (ID 7, 4, and 5 with several placements) to create a list of occupied AABBs. My core logic requires calculating the AABB for each candidate placement of object 6, which entails computing the half-width after accounting for the rotation angle (`theta`). I'll use the formula `half_dim = half_size * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           My constraint is the surface 0 boundary, so I'll compute the valid center range `(x, y)` for the new object's placement using the maximum effective half-dimension (`max_effective_half_dim_6`). That gives me x, y within [-0.0842, 0.0842] for the center.
           
           Now, I'll generate the placement candidates. First, I'll create a 7x7 grid in the valid (x, y) space. Then, I will iterate through a diverse set of rotation angles: `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2, 5*pi/8, 3*pi/4, 7*pi/8, pi` and then also the rotations + pi. For each candidate (x, y, theta), I calculate the AABB of object 6 using the formulas I established. I ensure it's within the surface bounds, and if so, check for any collisions with the existing occupied AABBs. If no collisions are found, I mark the (x, y, theta) candidate as a valid placement and add it to the list. I also added code for a finer search of additional theta values as a failsafe if I get less than 50 placements. I'll make sure to verify the validity of these placements with the code I wrote.

Model:     **Thoughts on Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, my task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, ensuring no collisions with already placed objects. My strategy involves meticulous planning and execution.
           
           First, I need to analyze the scene geometry. I'm provided with the dimensions and AABBs of existing objects (ID 7, 4, and 5 with several placements) to create a list of occupied AABBs. My core logic requires calculating the AABB for each candidate placement of object 6, which entails computing the half-width after accounting for the rotation angle (`theta`). I'll use the formula `half_dim = half_size * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           My constraint is the surface 0 boundary, so I'll compute the valid center range `(x, y)` for the new object's placement using the maximum effective half-dimension (`max_effective_half_dim_6`). That gives me x, y within [-0.0842, 0.0842] for the center.
           
           Now, I'll generate the placement candidates. First, I'll create a 7x7 grid in the valid (x, y) space. Then, I will iterate through a diverse set of rotation angles: `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2, 5*pi/8, 3*pi/4, 7*pi/8, pi` and then also the rotations + pi. For each candidate (x, y, theta), I calculate the AABB of object 6 using the formulas I established. I ensure it's within the surface bounds, and if so, check for any collisions with the existing occupied AABBs. If no collisions are found, I mark the (x, y, theta) candidate as a valid placement and add it to the list. I also added code for a finer search of additional theta values as a failsafe if I get less than 50 placements. I'll make sure to verify the validity of these placements with the code I wrote. I should be able to efficiently generate these placements and return the first 50 stable ones.
