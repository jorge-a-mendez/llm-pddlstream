           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to ensuring an object, let's call it `?green`, is both "on" a specific object, `v18`, and has a certain "type," `v17`. The initial state gives me two candidates for `?green`: `v8` and `v12`, both with the correct type.
           
           Now, to make `?green` "on" `v18`, I need to satisfy the conditions for the "on" axiom: something must be "supported" on `v18` and be "at a pose" related to `v18`. Looking at the initial state, I can see that `v8` is currently on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.  Both `v8` and `v12` *could* be on `v18` because the state includes predicates like `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. However, neither is *currently* positioned correctly on `v18`.
           
           My thinking leads me to the realization that I need to move either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. To do that, I'd typically use "pick" and "place" actions. I have kinematic relationships defined, `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, and I am assuming that `bconf #o3` is `v3` because there's only a single action that can possibly change the state: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Here's the rub: I've carefully scrutinized the prompt. I am only allowed to use action *instances* that are provided and listed. Critically, the only action instance I have at my disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't *do* anything to impact the "on" or "atpose" relationships. It's effectively a no-op! So, given the constraints, I must conclude that the goal is *unachievable*.  I cannot manipulate the objects because the required actions (`pick` and `place`) are not permitted, as they aren't available action instances.
