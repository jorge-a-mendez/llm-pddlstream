           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing images and analyses. The core challenge lies in the configurations and movement constraints of the rovers.
           
           I've examined the problem structure and the available actions closely.  It seems the rovers are stuck at their home configurations (`v13` and `v15` for `v12` and `v14` respectively). The `move` actions available explicitly restrict their movements: they can only stay put.
           
           **Key Issue: Configuration Discrepancy**
           
           The real sticking point is this: the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, crucial for image-taking and communication, necessitate the rovers to be at different configurations like `#o3` and `#o0`. However, the rovers are pinned down. They *must* be in their home configuration, `v13` or `v15` according to the *only* `move` actions they can perform.
           
           **The Implications and Analysis**
           
           This creates an insurmountable gap.  The preconditions of actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are never met because the rovers cannot reach the required configurations. For instance:
           
           *   To take an image, a rover needs to be at `#o3`.
           *   To send an image, a rover needs to be at `#o0`.
           *   To sample a rock, a rover needs to be at `#o5`.
           
           But the rovers are restricted to `v13` or `v15`.  The logic is broken - we're in a situation where `atconf(rover, v13)` or `atconf(rover, v15)` is the *only* state possible, and it conflicts with every other predicate in our goal.
           
           **Conclusion: Unsolvable**
           
           The initial state facts and actions are fundamentally incompatible with achieving the goal. This means the plan can't work and the solution is unachievable given the constraints.
