User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.279, -0.382), (-0.182, -0.285)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.118, -0.461), (-0.033, -0.375)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.21, 0.489), (-0.128, 0.571)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.062, 0.352), (0.022, 0.436)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.02, 0.394, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.114).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.23, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.283, 0.959).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.075, -0.418, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.612, 0.791).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.169, 0.53, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.638, 0.77).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised:** I need to move four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, from their current locations to the object `v18`.  `v18` is the target surface, and the goal is to have each object *on* it. The key is the `on` predicate: an object is `on` something if it's both *supported* and *at the correct pose*.
           
           I'll use the `pick` and `place` actions, utilizing arm `v4` (the active arm), and the base at `v3` (which, based on the `move_base` action, will remain stationary).  I will be using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`, base `v3`, and trajectory `#o4` as is defined in the `kin` facts for pick and place. The initial state provides the kin information, indicating pick and place actions are possible.
           
           For each object, the plan is:
           1.  **Pick** it up from its initial pose.
           2.  **Place** it onto `v18` at a specific new pose.
           
           The poses where the objects are placed are denoted as `#o2`, and the problem requires *distinct* values for each object, even though they share the same symbol. These target poses are located on the surface `v18`.  `v18`'s AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I chose the following coordinates within the bounds of `v18` so the placements don't collide with the existing pose:
           
           1.  `(#o2 v8 v18): (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           2.  `(#o2 v12 v18): (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           3.  `(#o2 v14 v18): (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           4.  `(#o2 v16 v18): (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           
           The sequence of actions will be:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           7.  `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           8.  `place(v4, v16, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           I have confirmed that the preconditions are met, including the available `kin` actions, and that the base doesn't need to move since no `move_base` actions are needed.  The `canmove()` predicate changes are handled by the pick and place actions so no move_base actions are required.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got this plan in front of me, and right off the bat, I see a problem. The user's provided goal is to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all *on* `v18`. From my expert perspective, I know that this 'on' predicate implies *support*.  We need both a `supported` and an `atpose` fact to hold for each object and `v18`. 
           
           The initial state shows that these objects are currently supported by `v11` and have particular *atpose* values, such as `v8` at `v9`. I see the necessary facts exist to achieve the *on* goals if the `atpose` for each can be set to the proper place, like `#o2` for `v8`.
           
           The real kicker here, and the reason I'm shaking my head, is the *only* action allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action essentially does *nothing* relevant to the problem. It doesn't allow any object manipulation or change the relationship between objects. It's focused on the base configuration itself.
           
           Considering the axioms and the current state, and knowing that *move_base* is useless, I have to conclude that reaching the goal is impossible. I can't reposition these objects with the tools I'm given.
