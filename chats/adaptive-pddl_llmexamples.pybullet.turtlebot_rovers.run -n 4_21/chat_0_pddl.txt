           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera (v10) and a storage (v16). There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20). A lander (v9) is present for communication. The rovers are currently at configurations v13 and v15, respectively, and both have free storage. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires that both rovers are at their current configurations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15), both rovers have free storage (v12 at v16, v14 at v16), several images are received (v17, v18, v19, v20 for mode v11), and specific rocks/soil are analyzed (one of type v2 and one of type v6).
           
           Looking at the available actions:
           - `move` actions for both rovers keep them at their current positions. Since the goal requires them to be at their current positions, these are essentially no-op in terms of position change but can be used if other preconditions are met.
           - `drop_rock` actions are available for both rovers for store v16. However, the initial state already shows `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`, so dropping rocks isn't immediately necessary for the 'free' part of the axiom, and there are no `full` predicates that would enable these actions.
           
           The key parts of the goal `new-axiom@0()` that are not directly met by the initial state are:
           1. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This requires taking images of these objectives and sending them.
           2. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` where `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` where `type(?soil, v6)`: This requires sampling rocks of these types and sending their analysis.
           
           Let's check if we can achieve these:
           - **Image reception**: To receive an image, we need to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
               - `take_image` requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and `~blocked`.
               - `send_image` requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and `~blocked`.
               - The initial state shows `imagevisible` for all required objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) for both rovers (v12, v14) with camera v10, ray #o4, and config #o3. It also shows `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)`, `supports(v10, v11)`. `atconf` is true for both rovers. `ray(#o4)` is true, but `blocked(#o4)` is not explicitly false nor can it be inferred as false from the given information or the available actions. There are no `calibrate` actions available in the provided list. This means we cannot achieve `calibrated(v10, v12)` or `calibrated(v10, v14)`. Without being able to calibrate, we cannot take any images. Therefore, the `receivedimage` goals are unachievable.
           
           - **Analysis reception**: To receive analysis, we need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
               - `sample_rock` requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, and `free`.
               - `send_analysis` requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, and `~blocked`.
               - We have rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4) and type v6 (v5, v7, v8).
               - For example, for rock v4 (type v2), `above(v14, #o5, v4)` is true, `store(v16)` is true, `atconf(v14, v15)` is true, and `free(v14, v16)` is true. So, `sample_rock` could be possible if it were in the available actions.
               - Similarly, for rock v5 (type v6), `above(v14, #o5, v5)` is true, and other conditions are met.
               - `send_analysis` requires `comvisible`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, `~blocked`. `comvisible` is true for both rovers with lander v9, ray #o1, config #o0. `ray(#o1)` is true, but `blocked(#o1)` is not explicitly false nor can it be inferred as false. Again, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions are not in the list of available actions. Therefore, the `receivedanalysis` goals are unachievable.
           
           Since neither taking/sending images nor sampling/sending analysis are possible with the given set of allowed actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` cannot be achieved.
           
           The goal cannot be achieved because the necessary actions `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are not included in the list of available action instances. Without these actions, the rover cannot take images, send them, or analyze rocks and send the analysis, which are all required by the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
