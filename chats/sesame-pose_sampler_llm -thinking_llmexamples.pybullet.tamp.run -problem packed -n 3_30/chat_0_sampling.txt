(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples for an object of dimensions `size_x` and `size_y` on a surface with bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Stability requires that the object's fully contained within the surface after rotation `theta`.
           
           First, I calculate the half-extents of the rotated object's AABB (`Hx`, `Hy`) using the standard formula. The object is nearly square, so `Hx` and `Hy` are almost the same. This determines the bounds of the object's center `(x, y)` on the surface for a particular `theta`.
           
           I'm generating a diverse set of placements. I consider 8 different angles, evenly spaced from 0 to 7pi/8 to achieve varying rotations for the nearly-square object on the surface. For each angle, I consider different object positions: the center, four corners, and the midpoints of the valid placement area on the surface.
           
           This process gives 72 possible placements. I select the first 50 to return as a solution. No further considerations are necessary at this time, as there are no existing objects to avoid collisions with.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Finding 50 Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, here's my plan to figure this out. I'm tasked with placing object ID 5 in 50 different stable positions on a surface, avoiding collisions with a pre-existing object, ID 4. I've got the object sizes, the surface dimensions, and the placement of object 4: it's at (0,0) and doesn't rotate.
           
           First, I define the key parameters. Object 4's dimensions are used to establish its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), which is a rectangle surrounding the object. I also define the object 5 AABB.  The surface's dimensions are also recorded.
           
           To avoid collisions, I need to prevent the AABB of object 5 from overlapping object 4's AABB for any placement. I know that if the center-to-center distance between two objects exceeds the sum of their half-widths, there is no collision. Based on this AABB interpretation I have the conditions for valid placement.
           
           Let's break down the logic:
           
           1.  **Defining the Forbidden Zone:** I start by calculating the dimensions of the "forbidden zone" around object 4. This is the region where any part of object 5 would collide. Essentially, I'm defining a rectangle centered at the origin that object 5's center *must* stay outside.
           2.  **Valid Placement Space:** Given the surface bounds and the forbidden region, I'll calculate valid placement ranges.  Object 5 can be placed only in the regions completely outside the central forbidden region.
           3.  **Rotation (Theta):** I'll be using different rotations for object 5 from 0 to 7pi/8 in increments of pi/8. For each angle, I need to recalculate the bounding box and the forbidden region.
           4.  **Point Generation:** Given the valid ranges I will pick 2 points from each axis (left of forbidden region and right of forbidden region). This will result in 4 placements for that region. From that region I'll combine the selected points to get 50 total.
           
           I need to make sure to consider that at 45 degrees the object's extent is larger than the surface. This would result in many invalid positions. With the strategy outlined the algorithm will pick valid positions and avoid collisions.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on a Constrained Surface**
           
           I need to place 50 stable instances of a new object (ID 6) onto a specified surface (Surface 0), ensuring they don't collide with two existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5).  The surface is a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin, and my approach needs to work with the square-ish shape of both my new and existing objects.
           
           I'm starting with a square of side `0.08536500686540652`, so half-extents will be roughly 0.0426825. Object 4 (a near square of side `0.09403144308882155`) is centered at the origin. Object 5 (a near square of side `0.07991924104195058`) is already snugly placed in the lower-left corner of the surface. I will use AABBs to simplify collision detection.
           
           To start, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the center point of the new object on the surface, making sure it doesn't leave the surface bounds. I know the rotation will affect the surface occupancy region.  Since the object is square and surface is square, angles `0` and `pi/2` should be fine. I'll test these. I will use `theta = 0` for all 50.
           
           I need to calculate the bounding boxes for the existing objects and determine the zones the new object's center must avoid to prevent collisions. This means constructing forbidden regions based on both existing objects' placements relative to surface bounds and taking into account the rotation of the new object.
           
           After thorough analysis, I devised a robust approach where points in a grid are tested to be valid centers. The code I devised will effectively generate points that are in the bounds of the surface but not in the bounds of the existing objects, or any of their AABB collisions. I can generate 100 points and filter 50 of them.
