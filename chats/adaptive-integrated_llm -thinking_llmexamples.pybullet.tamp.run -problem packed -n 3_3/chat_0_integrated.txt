           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.249, -0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.033, 0.999).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, -0.356), (-0.212, -0.282)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, -0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, -0.272).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.332), (0.073, -0.236)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.031, 0.494, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.034).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.007, 0.457), (0.068, 0.531)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto a specific surface (v16).  I've got the starting positions for all three objects. They're all supported by the same thing (v11), and I have a robot with two arms, both empty and in a base configuration (v3).  The key is the `on` predicate, which means I need to find a way to make sure `supported(object, pose, v16)` and `atpose(object, pose)` are true for all three objects.
           
           Initially, I see three potential poses related to v16:  the problem uses the symbol `#o2`  for all of them in the initial state.  That gives me an idea about a potential spot on v16 for the objects, but this problem requires *distinct* values when dealing with multiple objects simultaneously at the same pose. I'll need to remember to generate *distinct* values and I'll keep them named like `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v14` to represent different poses on the surface `v16`.
           
           The given actions are `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. The catch is that there's only one instance of `move_base` - `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This looks like "stay put," since it moves the base from configuration v3 back to configuration v3 (which represents the starting configuration of the robot), but it also means that all the actions must be reachable from the same initial base position `v3`. I can't move to another base configuration.
           
           My plan is going to be pretty straightforward, pick each object and place it on v16, and then move on to the next.  I'll start with v8, then v12, then v14.
           
           For each object, the process will be:
           
           1.  **Pick:**  Use a `pick` action to grasp the object from its starting position (v9 for v8, v13 for v12, v15 for v14).
           2.  **Place:** Use a `place` action to put the object onto v16 at its new pose:  for v8 this will be `#o2_v8`, v12 will be `#o2_v12`, v14 will be `#o2_v14`.
           
           The preconditions for `pick` and `place` require a kinematic solution (`kin`) and a trajectory for the arm movements (`atraj`).  Since these aren't explicitly given, I'll need to generate these myself. I'll also need to ensure collision-free movement (collision-free grasp and trajectories, along with placing objects in a *collision-free, stable location on a surface*). The domain contains the predicate `grasp(object, #o1)` and so the problem statement provides a grasp.
           
           Also, I have to ensure that after each operation, the plan state satisfies all preconditions of the successive step and the goal state is ultimately achieved. The only given base motion action has the form `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           1.  **Pick v8:**
               *   Find a kinematic solution, something like: `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v8_kin_arm)`.
               *   Find a collision-free arm trajectory: `#t_pick_v8_traj_arm`.
           2.  **Place v8:**
               *   Find a kinematic solution: `kin(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #t_place_v8_kin_arm)`.
               *   Find a collision-free trajectory:  `#t_place_v8_traj_arm`.
           3.  **Pick v12:** (Using arm v4, it should still be empty)
               *   Find a kinematic solution: `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v12_kin_arm)`.
               *   Find a collision-free trajectory:  `#t_pick_v12_traj_arm`.
           4.  **Place v12:**
               *   Find a kinematic solution: `kin(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #t_place_v12_kin_arm)`.
               *

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v8_kin_arm #t_pick_v8_traj_arm) , (place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 v3 #t_place_v8_kin_arm #t_place_v8_traj_arm) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v12_kin_arm #t_pick_v12_traj_arm) , (place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 v3 #t_place_v12_kin_arm #t_place_v12_traj_arm) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t_pick_v14_kin_arm #t_pick_v14_traj_arm) , (place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 v3 #t_place_v14_kin_arm #t_place_v14_traj_arm)`.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a task to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Seems straightforward enough: I need to get those objects onto `v16`. I start by looking at the initial state and, as I expected, all the objects are currently *not* on `v16`. They're at `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `atpose(v14, v15)`.  And since `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` are supported by `v11`, not `v16`, the `on` predicate is definitely *not* true initially.
           
           Now, my initial instinct is to use `pick` and `place` actions – standard stuff. But then I check the valid action instances, and I'm hit with a brick wall.  The *only* valid action instance I have is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is just a no-op; I can't even get anything to `v16` with the given actions.  The robot's base can only "move" from `v3` to `v3`, which is essentially just doing nothing.  There's no manipulation here, no ability to move or place objects.
           
           Given this limitation, there's no way to reach the goal. I can't pick up the objects, I can't put them down, I can't do *anything* except perform a useless movement of my base. It's an unreachable state with the actions provided. This task is impossible.
