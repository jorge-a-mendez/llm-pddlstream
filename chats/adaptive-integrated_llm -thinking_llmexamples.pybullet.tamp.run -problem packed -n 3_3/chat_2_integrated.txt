User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, -0.356), (-0.212, -0.282)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.332), (0.073, -0.236)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.031, 0.494, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.034).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.249, -0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.033, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, -0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, -0.272).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.007, 0.457), (0.068, 0.531)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan:**
           
           Okay, so I need to move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16.  I'm given their initial and goal states, along with some helpful axioms.  The key axiom is that being "on" something means it's supported and at a specific pose.  Since I know *where* I want them (on v16), I need to figure out *how* to get them there.
           
           It seems like the best approach is to pick each object from its current location, move it, and then place it on v16.  I already have initial positions that meet the supporting constraints (v8 is supported by v11, etc.), and my goal positions also require this relationship. The main hurdle here is figuring out *where* on v16 to put them. The problem description mentions that the poses require a collision-free pose, and I need to come up with one of these.
           
           I'm limited to using arm v4 of the robot (v4 is handempty and has an initial arm configuration v5). The base is currently at bconf v3, and the available actions only use this arm. I need to get the base into a position from which I can use this arm.
           
           Looking at the available actions (kin, move_base, etc.), I can see that all the pick/place actions require the robot to be at a specific base configuration (#o3).  So, I'll need a "move_base" action *first* to get the robot into the right position.
           
           **Here's the plan I've come up with:**
           
           1.  **Move the base:**  Move the base from v3 to base configuration #o3.
           2.  **Pick v8:** Use kin to pick up v8 from its initial location v9.
           3.  **Place v8:** Place v8 onto v16 at position #o2.
           4.  **Pick v12:** Use kin to pick up v12 from its initial location v13.
           5.  **Place v12:** Place v12 onto v16 at position #o2.
           6.  **Pick v14:** Use kin to pick up v14 from its initial location v15.
           7.  **Place v14:** Place v14 onto v16 at position #o2.
           
           Since there's no base position requirement in the goal, I don't necessarily need to move the base back to v3.
           
           Now, the trick is determining the continuous parameters, especially the target pose #o2 for the objects on v16. I've analyzed the initial poses and the bounds of v16. The given initial pose of each object (v8, v12, v14) also seems to have the table height in z, so they're all at ~0.781. The height must be 0.781. I need to give different (#o2) coordinates for each object to avoid overlap while remaining inside of v16. I did an analysis of the object dimensions in the AABB values ((-0.135,-0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). I need a point that all three robots can reach, that is close to the given object coordinates: I have chosen (0.1,0.0,0.0). I also assigned different target values for x and y of the #o2 parameter: I found the dimensions of each object. I determined the pose of the object so that the objects won't be in contact:
           
           Here are the values I'll use:
           
           *   **#o3 (base configuration): (0.1, 0.0, 0.0)**
           *   **#o2 (v8 on v16): (0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)**
           *   **#o2 (v12 on v16): (-0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)**
           *   **#o2 (v14 on v16): (0.0, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)**
           
           Finally, I checked the preconditions and effects of the actions to be sure they are all valid and can execute. I checked the actions and determined the cost of move base will likely be zero.
