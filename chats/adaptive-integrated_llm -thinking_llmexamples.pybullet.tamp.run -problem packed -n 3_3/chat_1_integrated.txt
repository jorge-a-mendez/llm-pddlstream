User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, -0.356), (-0.212, -0.282)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.332), (0.073, -0.236)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.031, 0.494, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, -0.034).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.249, -0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.033, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, -0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.962, -0.272).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.007, 0.457), (0.068, 0.531)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to efficiently move three objects, v8, v12, and v14, from their current supporting surfaces (v11) onto the designated surface v16.  This will be achieved through a sequence of picking and placing actions using the robot's arm, v4. The initial state provides the necessary information: the objects' starting poses (v9, v13, v15), their support (v11), the robot's arm configuration (v5), and the target surface v16. I am assuming the objects are graspable and no unsafe conditions such as collision or arm trajectory are stated as active (unsafe).
           
           The core of the strategy is to leverage the "pick" and "place" actions. For each object, the plan entails: (1) picking the object from its initial pose (e.g., v8 from v9), and (2) placing the object at the target pose, which will be the position labeled #o2 on the surface v16.  This process will be repeated sequentially for all three objects.
           
           To achieve 'on(v8, v16)' 'on(v12, v16)' and 'on(v14, v16)', I need to adhere to certain preconditions.  The `pick` action requires kinesthetic constraints to be met. The placement location needs to be valid and the robot arm handempty. The goal is to set the condition 'atpose' of each object at the location (#o2) of the surface v16.
           
           For the placement on v16, a critical issue arises. The problem statement dictates that if multiple objects are placed on the same pose *symbolically named*, the *real coordinates* of the pose on v16 must be unique for each. I will have the same symbolic name #o2 and then distinct locations for each object.
           
           To prevent collisions on v16. the pose locations for the objects must be planned.  Given the AABB of v16 (( -0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), and the AABBs of the objects, I've designed the placement coordinates of each object such that they are not colliding on v16. For v16, z=0.781. The x coordinates for placement is chosen.
           
           The final plan will be:
           
           1.  Pick v8 (at v9)
           2.  Place v8 at #o2 (for v8)
           3.  Pick v12 (at v13)
           4.  Place v12 at #o2 (for v12)
           5.  Pick v14 (at v15)
           6.  Place v14 at #o2 (for v14)
           
           Cost:  6 (for the 6 actions).

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, the user correctly identified a fundamental flaw in the previous attempt. It's clear that the actions provided aren't going to cut it. I need to take another look at the problem.
           
           The problem statement gives me the goal, which is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on top of `v16`. Simple enough. My initial state tells me they're currently resting on `v11`. Classic block-stacking problem, right?
           
           But here's the kicker: the *only* action allowed is `move_base`. Specifically, `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This effectively means I can *only* move the base, and to the *same* configuration.  That's a bit limiting, to say the least! I'd expect to see `pick` and `place` actions at a minimum, maybe even some `grasp` or `release` operators. Without these, or something equivalent, I can't manipulate the blocks themselves.  I'm stuck with a robot that can only, well, not *move* its base.
           
           So, here's the bottom line: given the current constraints, the goal *cannot* be achieved. The available action set is insufficient to manipulate the objects and arrange them as desired. I need to clearly communicate this and the reasoning behind it.
