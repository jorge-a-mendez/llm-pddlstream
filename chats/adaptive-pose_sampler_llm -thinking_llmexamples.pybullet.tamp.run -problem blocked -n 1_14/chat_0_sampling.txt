           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to generate 50 stable placements for a small square object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a given rectangular surface (surface 0, defined by points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)).  A "stable" placement means the object must be entirely within the surface's boundaries, and, importantly for now, it must avoid collisions with any existing obstacles or previously placed objects. *Important note*: I'm assuming that there are no collision objects to consider in this case, making things much simpler. 
           
           **Understanding Object and Surface Properties**
           
           The object's square shape makes things easier, as its maximum AABB extent changes with rotation angles only in a predictable way due to it being square.  I've got the surface dimensions: it's a 0.6 x 0.6 rectangle. The object is also small, which gives me considerable freedom in placing it. I need to take into consideration that I can't put my objects in a grid that is right against the edge. It must have some space and I'll need to figure this spacing based on the largest the object may be, based on the `theta` rotation angle.
           
           **Calculating Valid Placement Regions**
           
           To find valid placement regions, I have to account for the object's rotation angle (`theta`). First, I need to know the bounds of the object to know how far away from the edge I can place an object. So I have to use extent_rotated to calculate the maximum extent in order to avoid the object exceeding the edges of the board.
           
           The key calculation is `extent_rotated = 0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` (where 0.035 is half the object's size).  I then calculate `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max` for a valid range of `(x, y)` placements, with respect to the `theta`.
           
           **Placement Strategy and Coordinate Generation**
           
           The plan is to leverage a grid approach with diverse rotation angles: I'll use a `3x3` grid of `(x, y)` for a core set of 5 rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2).  That generates 45 unique placements. I need 5 more, so I'll put a single object at a central location with 5 additional rotation angles between the previous set (pi/16, 3pi/16, 5pi/16, 7pi/16, 9pi/16). 
           
           **Code Implementation & Calculations**
           
           I've outlined a process to compute these ranges for each rotation, and then to generate the specific x and y coordinates. The extent is calculated for all angles, then used to determine the valid placement region. Then the grid is calculated or the central value based on if there are no more placements for the angle.
           
           **Generation Completed**
           The placement list is created and ready for further collision checking (which I'll address once existing obstacles and placed objects are given).

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object ID 10**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square-like object (ID 10) on a surface, while ensuring it doesn't collide with a previously placed object (ID 5). I'm given the surface's dimensions, object 10's dimensions (approximately 0.095 x 0.095), and the precise location of object 5.
           
           First, I meticulously calculate the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object 5, which is its rectangular footprint, to define the forbidden space. I also determine the surface's usable area. Since object 10 can be rotated, I calculate its "effective half-extents" – how much space it occupies when rotated at various angles (theta) from 0 to pi/2.
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll generate possible placements on a grid, explicitly checking for overlaps. I will iterate through several angles (0 to pi/2).  For each angle, I calculate its effective half extent and I set up a grid of placements on the surface, making sure to consider the object's rotation. To be sure to find 50 placements, I will generate more than the necessary number of placements per angle, and will check each position on the grid to ensure there are no collisions.
           
           I will use precise collision checks by comparing the AABB of object 10 at each generated position with object 5's AABB. I'll flag and skip any candidate placements that result in an overlap.
           
           If I don't hit 50 valid placements quickly enough, I have a fallback: try placing at the surface center and try minor offsets if there is a collision.
           
           I anticipate this approach will be efficient and effective in finding the required non-colliding placements for object 10.
