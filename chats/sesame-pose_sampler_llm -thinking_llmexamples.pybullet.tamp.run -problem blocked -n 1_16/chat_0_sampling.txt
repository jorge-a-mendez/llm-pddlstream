(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement is considered stable if the object's rotated bounding box is fully contained within the surface's bounds.  Because the object is a square, the effective bounding box changes with rotation, but I can quantify that change.  I know that the half-width/height of the bounding box of a square of side *s* rotated by *theta* is:  *h_eff(theta) = s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))*.
           
           Given the object's size (0.07),  `h_eff = 0.035 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value varies with *theta*, ranging from 0.035 at multiples of π/2, up to a maximum of approximately 0.0495 at multiples of π/4.  For stability, the object's center (x, y) must therefore satisfy the containment condition `surf_lower + h_eff(theta) <= center <= surf_upper - h_eff(theta)` for both x and y dimensions.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I varied *theta* across 5 values: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, and π.  I then calculated the valid ranges for *x* and *y* for each angle, based on the corresponding *h_eff(theta)*.  Within these ranges, I created a 5x2 grid of (x, y) coordinates, resulting in 10 placements per angle for a total of 50 stable placements on surface 0.  The generated placements are (0, theta, x, y) in the format (surface_index, angle_radians, x_coordinate, y_coordinate). The coordinates have been rounded to six decimal places for clarity in the output.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request: Place object ID 10 on surface 0, avoiding collision with the previously placed object ID 5. I need to generate 50 stable placements. I'll need to work through my process, and this should be the final set of placements I provide.
           
           First, I analyze object 10. It's almost a square (0.0818 x 0.0818), so I'll treat it as such. This means its effective half-dimension, *h_eff*, depends on its rotation (theta). For a square, *h_eff* is calculated with `(s/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where 's' is the side length.  *s/2* is 0.0409.
           
           Now, let's look at the surface and the placement of object 5. The surface is defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). Object 5 was placed in two rows across this surface, and they're all at `theta = 0.0`. The 's' value for object 5 is 0.07, and therefore the *h_eff* is 0.035. Using these facts, I can identify the region of the surface where object 5's placements are located. Object 5 AABBs are from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.27, -0.53) and (4.2, -0.07) to (4.27, 0.0) (and so on, repeating horizontally). Object 5 essentially occupies a space, in two separate rows, in the y-axis, and stretches from 4.2 to 4.8 in the x-axis.
           
           So, the key here is avoiding collisions with those existing placements of Object 5. I need to place Object 10 between these two rows to avoid collision. This means calculating the valid ranges.
           
           Object 10's AABB:  We can calculate that the valid range in the surface is x_c (the center of the object) from `4.2 + h_eff <= x_c <= 4.8 - h_eff`. And the valid y_c: For avoiding the y-range of Object 5 placements, the center of Object 10 needs to be between the two rows of object 5. So I calculate the y_c as  `-0.53 + h_eff <= y_c <= -0.07 - h_eff`. If y_c is inside these bands, it will not collide with the AABB of an Object 5.
           
           For theta = 0, y_min = -0.489 and y_max = -0.110. For theta = pi/4, y_min = -0.472 and y_max = -0.1278. Note: I'm making sure that h_eff is not too high.
           
           Now, with this understanding, I can generate the placement coordinates: (x_c, y_c) at different angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi).  I'll generate coordinates to place 50 objects in this way. I will use 10 coordinates per angle, which gives the answer:
           
           I'm confident I have a valid set of placements for object 10 that meets the requirements!
