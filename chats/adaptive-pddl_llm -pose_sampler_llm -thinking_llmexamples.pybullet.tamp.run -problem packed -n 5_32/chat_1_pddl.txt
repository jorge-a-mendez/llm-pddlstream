(Thoughts: **The Impossible Task of the PR2-TAMP Domain**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is clear: get those five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto v20. It's a classic stacking problem, right?  Initially, they're all nestled on v11, which feels a bit like a starting point for a simple Pick and Place scenario. I'm thinking, "No problem! Use Pick, then Place, repeat for all objects," and then I'll call it a day, but this is clearly not the case. I need to get the arms to manipulate the items, and then put them where they need to go, but I can't quite see a clear way of doing that. 
           
           Let's dive deeper and get started. First off, I need to understand what's possible. I see I've got two arms, both empty, and the robot base is at its initial configuration, v3.  The objects are at their respective poses, supported on v11, and the goal is a well-defined state of "on(object, v20)". A simple axiom supported(object, pose, receptacle) + atpose(object, pose) -> on(object, receptacle). That is, the object needs to be both supported and at the specified pose on the receptacle. The target pose for each object on v20 is #o2, since that's where the initial support relationships for v20 are already defined.
           
           Now for the kicker: the only action instance I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Yep, you read that right. The most useless action. This action instance is literally moving the base from configuration v3 back to v3, as if it's supposed to do something but actually doesn't. Its effect seems to be changing canmove() to false. It doesn't allow me to move to a configuration that would let me pick up, and then place an object to satisfy the given `on()` conditions. I can't even get the robot to move from v3, much less to pick or place items. I can see the potential for a paradox here.
           
           The effects of `move_base` are critical: it negates `canmove()`. That's the nail in the coffin. The preconditions for the "workhorse" actions like `pick` and `place` don't directly mention `canmove()`, and it's an effect. This is the problem here. I don't have instances to use for pick or place actions, because I can only `move_base`. But I can't move the base because `canmove()` is negated! I have no plan!
           
           Essentially, I'm stuck, and the plan is non-existent. Without any way to actually pick up or place objects, the task is provably impossible.  I need at least *some* "pick" and "place" actions to be feasible to move these objects. But the problem *explicitly* prevents the use of any instances other than the utterly irrelevant `move_base`.
           
           It's a frustrating situation because the problem is artificially constrained to be unsolvable.  The structure of the problem is clear, but the permitted actions are insufficient.  If you have a set of preconditions for an action, and then don't provide a way to satisfy them, then it's not logically feasible to solve the problem, and that is what I am seeing.
