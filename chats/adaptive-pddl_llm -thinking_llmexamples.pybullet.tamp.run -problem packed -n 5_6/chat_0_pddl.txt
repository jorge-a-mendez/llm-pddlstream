           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. The goal is straightforward: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all *on* object `v20`. The *on* predicate is defined by *supported* and *atpose* predicates, which makes sense. I quickly break down the initial state. Each target object is currently *on* `v11`, each at its own pose. The key insight is that for an object to be *on* `v20`, it needs to be *supported* by `v20` *and* be at a specific pose, `#o2`, according to the problem setup.
           
           The plan seems simple: I need to *pick* each object from `v11` and *place* it on `v20` at pose `#o2`. I check the available actions, expecting to see `pick` and `place` instances. However, the only action I'm given is `move_base`. This base movement from location `v3` to itself, using trajectory `#o0`. Okay, this is a clear constraint; I can only move the robot's base.
           
           The problem description explicitly states I can only use action instances in the given list. Since `pick` and `place` are missing, and these are required to change the `on` state of the objects, I'm stuck. My reasoning confirms: no available actions can change the `atpose` or `supported` predicates, therefore I cannot satisfy the goal. The goal is unreachable.
