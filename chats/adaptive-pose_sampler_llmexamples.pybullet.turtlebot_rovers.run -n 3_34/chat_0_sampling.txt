User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including some near the corners and a few in the central region. I will prioritize positions that are clearly within the open spaces and maintain a good line of sight to the target. I will also try to vary the positions to provide diverse options.
