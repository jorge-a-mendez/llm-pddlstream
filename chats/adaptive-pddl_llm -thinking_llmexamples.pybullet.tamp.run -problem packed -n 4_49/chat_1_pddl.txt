           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking: The task seems straightforward on the surface – get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all "on" `v18`.  The "on" predicate is defined, so I understand the required preconditions: each object needs to be "supported" by `v18` and at a specific "atpose". I broke down the goal into individual requirements for each object.
           
           I meticulously went through the initial state, noting the current poses and supporting relations for each object.  Crucially, all the objects *are* supported by `v18` when they are at the desired pose `#o2`. This is a really important detail. To satisfy the goal, all the objects just need to get moved to `#o2`.
           
           Then I looked at the robot configuration and available actions. We have two robot arms `v4` and `v6`, both hand-empty initially. The key is in the *allowed action instances*.  I have to work within the confines of what's provided, as an expert this is a simple concept.
           
           The list of *allowed* actions is critical.  Here's where it all falls apart.  The only allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This means the robot's base can move *from* its current location `v3` *to* the exact same location `v3` – a no-op! It's like having a robot stuck in place. No `pick` or `place` instances are in the allowed list, which seems really odd.
           
           I double and triple checked. There's no way to use the provided actions to modify the `atpose` of any object.  The goal, remember, requires `atpose(v8, #o2)`, etc.  The only way to achieve this is via `pick` and `place` actions, which are, critically, *not* in the allowed actions. I even reviewed the available actions:  `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Only `pick` and `place` can modify an object's location.
           
           The problem explicitly states that any action *not* in the list of allowed actions cannot be used.  This is a constraint, a fundamental piece of information, you always need to verify if the goal can be achieved based on available actions.  Thus, the goal is *unreachable* with the given constraints. I need to explain *why* it's unreachable, not try to generate an impossible plan.
