User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Analysis for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three suitable base positions for the robot, all within a maximum distance of 2 from a target point.  The robot has limitations: its x and y coordinates have to be within the range of [-2.45, 2.45], which is the playable area. Its orientation is set automatically to face the target.
           
           First, I need to understand the scene geometry. The provided data gives me the locations of several fixed obstacles, defined as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).  I'll go through them and note the important parts.  There's a complete outer boundary, which defines the environment, and then a set of interior obstacles, including a central vertical wall at x=0, and some other rectangular and square obstacles, which are of smaller size. This central wall is the most important obstacle, as it divides the space into x < 0 and x > 0. I should avoid base positions being blocked by this wall when placing the robot bases. There are also smaller obstacles, and I'll keep them in mind.
           
           The strategy here is to first determine where the target is located.  Then I will generate candidate robot base positions around the target within a max range of 2.  Then I'll filter out the positions that are outside the robot's allowed (x,y) range. After that, I'll filter out any positions that collide with the fixed obstacles, using AABB collision checks. Lastly, I'll select three positions that are diverse.
           
           To determine if a robot base position collides with an obstacle, I will use a simple point-in-AABB collision check. That is, if the robot base coordinate is contained in any obstacle AABB. The problem statement mentions nothing about the robot's size, so a point collision check will be the simplification I make here.
           
           The target point has been specified as (1.6, 0.4). With this, I can begin my calculations. Since the target point is on the right side of the central wall, I will focus on finding base locations with x > 0 (to the right of the wall).
           
           Let's begin by proposing some positions, with the goal of selecting 3 diverse positions.
           Candidate 1: Located to the left of the target, with (0.6, 0.4). This will be near the center wall, but the x-coordinate must be greater than 0 to be clear of the wall.
           Candidate 2: Below the target, with (1.6, -0.6)
           Candidate 3: To the right of the target, with (2.3, 0.4)
           
           Now, I'm going to start checking these points. For the first position, (0.6, 0.4) and the central wall, x = 0.6 is good as it does not collide with the wall obstacle. I also check it with other obstacles and boundaries, and confirm that there's no collision, using a point-in-AABB collision check.
           For the second position, (1.6, -0.6) I check if its within the boundaries, which it is, and then against the obstacle list. No collision.
           For the third position, (2.3, 0.4) I check if its within the boundaries, which it is, and then against the obstacle list. No collision. All 3 positions appear good.
           
           However, I need to think about line of sight here. I will look at each point and determine if they're blocked from the target point. This usually requires a full line-of-sight check with line-segment-AABB intersection. For now, I'll use simple common-sense heuristics and rely on the fact that I will receive feedback from the system about any LOS problems.
           
           For Candidate 1:
           The line from (0.6,0.4) to (1.6,0.4) is a horizontal line at y=0.4. The central wall extends from y=-2.5 to y=2.5, at x=0, it does not intersect, so this position is okay with LOS to the target. For the same position, (0.6, 0.4), I check the small obstacle AABBs. I'll make sure there's no collision in this line.
           
           For the other candidate positions, (1.6, -0.6) to (1.6, 0.4) is a vertical line at x=1.6. It is clear. The same logic follows for the third position.
           
           These three positions are diverse, and within the range, so I will select these.
