(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID: 5), which is a 7cm by 7cm square, on a surface defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object must be entirely within the surface's boundaries, even when rotated.
           
           Initially, I thought because it was a square, the rotation wouldn't matter. But after a deeper look, a square when rotated has an AABB that depends on the angle.  The key is to calculate the effective bounding box dimensions after rotation.
           
           I started by calculating the valid placement range for the center of the square. For a square, the effective dimensions change with the rotation `theta`: `abs(size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y * sin(theta))`. This is equal to 0.07*(abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) for both dimensions, where 0.07 is the original size.  For `theta=0`, and `pi/2` it is `0.07`.  For the other key angles, it's `0.07*sqrt(2)` and that defines the maximum AABB size.
           
           Therefore, for `theta=0`, the valid x-range is from 4.235 to 4.765, and the y-range is from -0.565 to -0.035.
           
           I decided to create 50 placements. To do this, I sampled from a grid. Since the object AABB varies based on rotation, it's important to sample across a few different rotations. I did 25 with `theta=0` (0.07 x 0.07 AABB) and 25 with `theta=pi/4` (0.099 x 0.099 AABB). This ensures I get diverse placements and don't assume a constant AABB size.
           
           For the `theta = 0` placements, I gridded x and y within its computed ranges and likewise for `theta = pi/4`.  This should provide a good spread of stable placements, covering the surface and a range of rotations to show how the effective bounding box works.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my strategy. The goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 10) on a given surface (ID 0).  The surface is a rectangle and, crucially, contains several already-placed square objects (ID 5).  I need to avoid any collisions with these existing objects.  I've got the object dimensions and surface details, and I can deduce the AABB of both objects for each orientation. Let's get to it.
           
           First, I analyze the surface. It's bounded by `(4.2, -0.6)` and `(4.8, 0.0)`, meaning a width of 0.6 and a height of 0.6. The square object ID 10 has a side of `0.09606`. I need to generate placements for both `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees).
           
           The main challenge is avoiding collisions. The object ID 5 has successful placements and I need to avoid it. Object ID 5 size is `0.07`, and they are already placed on the same surface. It turns out that there are existing objects at y-centers around `-0.565` and `-0.4325`.  To avoid collisions, I need to keep the new object far enough away from the existing ones.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective size is just `0.09606`. The available x-range is a bit smaller. The same logic follows for `theta = pi/4` when the effective dimensions are larger `(0.13586)`. Then there are the no-go zones I need to keep in mind, i.e. x and y coordinates that would overlap with existing object coordinates, with a tolerance due to bounding box sizes.  I have calculated this above, and it also requires calculating the overlapping intervals for multiple placements of object 5.
           
           So, I start by calculating the effective dimensions for each rotation.  Then I determine the usable x and y ranges on the surface for each orientation, considering the object's AABB.  Next, I meticulously calculate the "no-go" zones in the y-dimension by taking into account the AABBs and half-sizes of both the new and old objects in y and the placement range for old objects.  This results in safe y-regions for both `theta=0` and `theta=pi/4`. The results were:
           For `theta = 0`, object ID 10 can be placed at y coordinate, between `[-0.34947, -0.04803]` for `x` range `[4.24803, 4.75197]`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, object ID 10 can be placed at y coordinate, between `[-0.32957, -0.06793]` for `x` range `[4.26793, 4.73207]`.
           With those safe ranges calculated, the strategy is to establish a 5x5 grid (25 placements) for the two rotations and merge the two grids to obtain 50 points. This gives me a total of 50 placements within the given range with no collisions. This should do the trick.
