           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.09864245558046747, 0.09864245558046814)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My current focus is on generating 50 stable placements for an object with ID 10 on a given surface.** The object's dimensions are almost square, with `size_x` and `size_y` being nearly identical. The surface is defined by its bounds.
           
           I understand that a placement is stable if the object is:
           1. Fully contained within the surface's boundaries.
           2. Not colliding with existing objects. (Not applicable yet)
           3. Not colliding with fixed obstacles. (Will receive feedback if this happens)
           
           Since there are no other placed objects yet, I only need to ensure the object remains within the surface's boundaries. The main calculation involves determining the *effective* dimensions of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) *after* rotation. The object can be rotated around it's center. To find the bounding box size, I use a `theta` rotation (0 to 2*pi). The AABB gets bigger as the rotation changes.
           
           The dimensions are half-sizes, `rhw` and `rhh`. I need to calculate these. I then determine the center coordinates `(x, y)` of the object to fit it. With `surf_x_min`, `surf_x_max`, `surf_y_min`, `surf_y_max` in mind, I select the most diverse set of positions that are valid.  
           
           I have selected 10 angles for rotation, varying the starting angle by `pi/8`.  This guarantees many variations in the placements. Then, for each angle, I calculate five positions within the valid range:
           1.  The center of the valid region.
           2.  Bottom-left corner of the valid region.
           3.  Top-right corner of the valid region.
           4.  A point 1/4 the way along the X and Y (in the bottom-left quadrant).
           5.  A point 3/4 of the way along the X and Y (in the top-right quadrant).
           By using different angles and varied positions per angle, I generate a good set of the 50 placements.
