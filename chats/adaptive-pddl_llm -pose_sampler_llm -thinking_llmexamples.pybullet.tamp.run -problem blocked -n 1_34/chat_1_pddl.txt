           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable with Given Constraints**
           
           My task is to create a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object of type `v17` is `on` object `v18`. I first examined the initial state and identified two objects, `v12` and `v8`, both of type `v17`. To satisfy the `on` predicate, I need to manipulate their poses such that they are supported by `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I found that `v12` is supported by `v14` and `v8` is supported by `v11`, neither of which is `v18`. To place either of these objects on `v18`, I would need to *pick* and *place* actions. However, the problem statement explicitly restricts me to only the pre-computed action instances. The *only* action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           This `move_base` action, as it's defined, essentially does nothing useful. It simply resets some internal flags related to base configuration and movement, and its effect on the state is negligible. Crucially, it has *no* effect on the `atpose` or `supported` predicates, and therefore, it cannot establish the `on` relationship required by the goal.
           
           I meticulously re-examined the problem statement, paying close attention to the constraint that "any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This is the key. The absence of `pick` and `place` action instances makes the goal unreachable. Even though the initial state contains objects that *could* satisfy the goal with appropriate actions, I am not *allowed* to use those actions.
           
           Therefore, given only the available `move_base` action and the initial state, the plan *cannot* achieve the goal. The goal, to establish that an object of type `v17` is `on` object `v18`, cannot be achieved with the restricted set of actions. The problem is fundamentally unsolvable with the provided action instance.
