           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy a Goal Axiom**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type (`v17`) be positioned "on" another object (`v18`).  I've analyzed the initial state and see that there are two objects, `v12` and `v8`, both of type `v17`.  Both could potentially satisfy the requirement. Since no extra information exists, for this plan, I am going to move object `v12`. I need to move it to `v18`. Currently, `v12` is "on" `v14` at pose `v13`. I observe possible poses for `v12` supported by `v18`.  These poses are labeled `#o2`.
           
           The required plan involves picking `v12` from its current pose, moving the robot base (if necessary), and then placing `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           First, I need to check the preconditions for moving the robot base (if needed) and `pick` and `place` actions.  It is worth noting that for `pick` and `place` actions, the robot must be atbconf(`#o3`) which is needed for the grasping motion. The robot arm needs to be empty (`handempty`). `kin` (kinematics) relations must exist that are consistent with the robot arm, object, and respective poses and grasp. I have verified that these preconditions are met or will be met by subsequent actions.
           
           The base motion action `move_base` is needed to correctly configure the robot arm for both pick and place. I will move the base to the configuration `#o3`.
           
           Then, I can use the `pick` action to grasp `v12` from `v13`.  I verify all the prerequisites for this action, including `kin` relation, `atpose` condition, and the empty arm.
           
           Finally, I `place` `v12` at pose `#o2`. The preconditions such as `kin`, and `atgrasp` are met. By the axiom associated with `supported` and `atpose`, if the object is `on` v18 and is of type `v17`, the new goal will be satisfied.
           
           After performing these actions, I'll have successfully made `v12` be "on" `v18`, meeting the goal of the `new-axiom@0()` axiom.  The key is to use the `pick` and `place` actions correctly, and to check all the necessary preconditions. I also made sure that the plan is consistent with the `kin` and `basemotion` continuous parameters provided in the state.
