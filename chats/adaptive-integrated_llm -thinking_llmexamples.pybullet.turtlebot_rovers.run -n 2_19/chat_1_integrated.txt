           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with crafting a plan to satisfy the conditions of this new axiom. Let's break this down systematically. I know that the axiom hinges on getting images and analyses of specific "rocks."  Since I'm dealing with rovers, the term "rocks" is general. We have to analyze them by their `type`. The initial state's got a head start; the rovers are already in their starting configurations. It’s what we need to *do* that’s the real work here.
           
           The core of the problem boils down to these sub-goals:
           
           1.  Capture images of `v17` and `v18` in mode `v11`.  
           2.  Get the analysis results of one rock each of `type v2` (stone) and `type v6` (soil).
           
           Now, to get those images, I have to *use* the action `send_image`.  To execute `send_image` you need to `take_image`, and to do *that*, I have to be in the right `atconf` location, make sure there is no object blocking my path and use my camera (v10) with the right parameters. So I need to move a rover to configuration #o3 and calibrate the camera. Since I am at `(1.0, -1.75)` currently, I will have to move to the camera configuration #o3 = (0.0, 0.5) to `imagevisible` the targets. To execute `send_image`, I need a communication channel, so I'll move to the communication configuration #o0 = (0.0, -2.0) to send the picture of the rocks.
           I can then use my camera to `take_image` by calibrating it before I take the images. I will then send them using the lander. The same concept is applied to `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the rocks requires `send_analysis`. To make that happen, I will use `sample_rock`. To perform `sample_rock`, the rover has to be "above" the rock. And of course, the rover's got to be at the right `atconf`. The rocks are at (`v4`, `v5`). I can easily use a rover with a `free` store to collect and send samples. Since the store needs to be free for two samples, I have to `drop_rock` after each sample. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` so I'll be in the correct configuration to accomplish the analysis sub-goals. I will then move my rover to the correct configuration #o5 = (1.4, 0.8) to make sure my rover is above both `v4` and `v5` to satisfy the preconditions.
           
           So, here's my plan to put it all together: I'll use rover `v12`. I need to first calibrate and capture both the images, then move to the communication config, then perform the analysis using the store. After the two analyses, I should have satisfied all of the preconditions and post-conditions.
           
           Here is the structured plan with specific configurations:
           
           1.  Move the rover `v12` to (0.0, 0.5) for imaging configuration.
           2.  Calibrate for the first target.
           3.  Take an image of the first target.
           4.  Calibrate for the second target.
           5.  Take an image of the second target.
           6.  Move to the communication configuration (0.0, -2.0).
           7.  Send the image of the first target.
           8.  Send the image of the second target.
           9.  Move the rover to the sampling configuration (1.4, 0.8).
           10. Sample rock `v4` and add to rover store.
           11. Move to the communication configuration.
           12. Send the first analysis.
           13. Drop the first rock.
           14. Move the rover to the sampling configuration (1.4, 0.8).
           15. Sample rock `v5` and add to rover store.
           16. Move to the communication configuration.
           17. Send the second analysis.
           18. Drop the second rock.
           19. Move back to the initial configuration (1.0, -1.75).
           
           I've made sure to consider all the preconditions and post-conditions for the actions.  I've chosen configurations that make sense given the positions of the objects and the rover's capabilities. With this plan, I should be able to

           Analyzing the rocks requires `send_analysis`. To make that happen, I will use `sample_rock`. To perform `sample_rock`, the rover has to be "above" the rock. And of course, the rover's got to be at the right `atconf`. The rocks are at (`v4`, `v5`). I can easily use a rover with a `free` store to collect and send samples. Since the store needs to be free for two samples, I have to `drop_rock` after each sample. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)` so I'll be in the correct configuration to accomplish the analysis sub-goals. I will then move my rover to the correct configuration #o5 = (1.4, 0.8) to make sure my rover is above both `v4` and `v5` to satisfy the preconditions.
           
           So, here's my plan to put it all together: I'll use rover `v12`. I need to first calibrate and capture both the images, then move to the communication config, then perform the analysis using the store. After the two analyses, I should have satisfied all of the preconditions and post-conditions.
           
           Here is the structured plan with specific configurations:
           
           1.  Move the rover `v12` to (0.0, 0.5) for imaging configuration.
           2.  Calibrate for the first target.
           3.  Take an image of the first target.
           4.  Calibrate for the second target.
           5.  Take an image of the second target.
           6.  Move to the communication configuration (0.0, -2.0).
           7.  Send the image of the first target.
           8.  Send the image of the second target.
           9.  Move the rover to the sampling configuration (1.4, 0.8).
           10. Sample rock `v4` and add to rover store.
           11. Move to the communication configuration.
           12. Send the first analysis.
           13. Drop the first rock.
           14. Move the rover to the sampling configuration (1.4, 0.8).
           15. Sample rock `v5` and add to rover store.
           16. Move to the communication configuration.
           17. Send the second analysis.
           18. Drop the second rock.
           19. Move back to the initial configuration (1.0, -1.75).
           
           I've made sure to consider all the preconditions and post-conditions for the actions.  I've chosen configurations that make sense given the positions of the objects and the rover's capabilities. With this plan, I should be able to

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan: One Rover, Full Success**
           
           Alright, after a thorough review, I've come to a solid plan. The key here is to leverage the movement capabilities and restrictions. It seems the best approach involves focusing *entirely* on using rover `v14` for all tasks, including image acquisition, sampling, and communication. `v12` is effectively sidelined due to the `v19` obstacle.
           
           The fundamental issue is that `v19` acts as a solid vertical wall. Any configuration or ray directly on `x=0` will inevitably collide or be blocked. Therefore, I've carefully selected configurations for all actions to ensure they *avoid* that blocking point. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates drove me to this solution, as the constraints on visibility and communication were critical. `motion(v14)` allows this plan to go through.
           
           Here's the finalized approach:
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:**
               *   `v14` moves to a configuration `#o3_v14_v18` at `(-0.8, 0.0)` for the image of `v18`. This allows the negative `x` rays to stay on the negative side of the x axis. This provides line-of-sight to the `v18` image at `(-0.6, 1.92)`.
               *   `v14` moves to a configuration `#o3_v14_v17` at `(0.8, 0.0)` for the image of `v17`. This allows the positive `x` rays to stay on the positive side of the x axis. This provides line-of-sight to the `v17` image at `(0.65, 1.91)`.
           
           2.  **Sampling & Analysis:**
               *   `v14` travels to the configuration `#o5_v14_v4` at `(1.4, 0.8)` for the stone sample.
               *   `v14` travels to the configuration `#o5_v14_v5` at `(1.4, 0.8)` for the soil sample.
               *   Given the initial conditions, v14 must handle all rocks.
           
           3.  **Communication:**
               *   `v14` moves to configuration `#o0_v14_v9` at `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
               *   `v14` sends images `v17` and `v18` to the lander. `v14` then drops all rocks.
           
           The plan *directly* addresses the `v19` collision issue. By choosing configurations and targets on opposite sides, all visibility and transmission constraints can be met while avoiding any line-of-sight obstructions.

           v20: AABB(lower=(-0.7229607666622261, -0.2814012135158637, 0.00100000500679015), upper=(-0.6214399968494316, -0.17988044370306935, 0.40100000500679017))
           ```
           
           Configuration #o3 = (0.8 0.0) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan's configurations failed for a few reasons:
           1.  **Collision for #o3 (v14 at v18):** `(-0.8 0.0)` collided with `v20`. This means we need to find a different `x` and `y` for `v14` in the negative x-region to view `v18`. `v18` is at `((-0.654, 1.875), (-0.56, 1.969))`. We need to be further away or to the side.
           2.  **Unreachable for #o3 (v14 at v17):** `(0.8 0.0)` was deemed unreachable for `v14`. This is likely due to the rover's kinematics or obstacles preventing movement from the starting point (`v15` at `-1.0, -1.75`) to `(0.8, 0.0)` while respecting the `v19` obstacle as well.
           3.  **Unreachable for #o0 (v14 at v9):** `(-1.0 -2.0)` was deemed unreachable for `v14`. This is surprising as `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, which is very close. It might be due to a path planning issue or another unseen small obstacle in the immediate vicinity of `v15`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations, keeping the obstacle `v19` at `x=0` in mind, and the new collision `v20`.
           `v19`: `AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))` (blocks `x=0`).
           `v20`: `AABB(lower=(-0.72, -0.28), upper=(-0.62, -0.18))` (obstacle in negative x-region).
           
           **Object locations:**
           *   `v18` (objective, negative x): `((-0.654, 1.875), (-0.56, 1.969))`
           *   `v17` (objective, positive x): `((0.611, 1.873), (0.687, 1.949))`
           *   `v9` (lander, negative x): `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`
           *   `v4` (rock type v2, positive x): `((1.086, 1.091), (1.188, 1.192))`
           *   `v5` (rock type v6, positive x): `((1.691, 0.543), (1.81, 0.661))`
           *   `v12` start (`v13`): `(1.0, -1.75)` (positive x)
           *   `v14` start (`v15`): `(-1.0, -1.75)` (negative x)
           
           The plan must still use both sides of `v19`. Rover `v14` is positioned well for operations in the negative x-region, and `v12` for the positive x-region. However, the problem states `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`. But since `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`, only a rover in the negative X region can establish `comvisible` without the ray crossing `v19`. So, `v14` must handle communication.
           
           This implies `v14` must be able to reach configurations in the positive X region, or `v12` must be able to pass samples/images to `v14`. There's no action for passing items between rovers, so `v14` *must* be able to move between the positive and negative x-regions. The 'not reachable' error for `v14` to `(0.8, 0.0)` indicates a significant path planning constraint.
           
           Let's assume `v14` *can* reach the positive x-region, but the previous `(0.8, 0.0)` was just a bad choice. We need to be careful with the chosen coordinates.
           
           **Re-evaluating Configurations for `v14`:**
           
           *   **Image `v18` (negative x):** `v18` is at `x` approx `-0.6`. `v20` blocks `x` from `-0.72` to `-0.62`. So `v14` cannot be directly in front of `v18` at `x=-0.6`. A configuration like `(-1.0, 1.0)` might work, as it's outside `v20` and far enough to see `v18`.
           *   **Image `v17` (positive x):** `v17` is at `x` approx `0.6`. `v14` needs to travel from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to the positive x-region, cross `v19` (presumably an opening exists, even if `x=0` is blocked for line of sight), and reach a pose like `(1.0, 1.0)`.
           *   **Sample `v4` & `v5` (positive x):** `v4` is at `(1.1, 1.1)`, `v5` is at `(1.7, 0.6)`. A config like `(1.4, 0.8)` should still work, assuming `v14` can reach it.
           *   **Communicate `v9` (negative x):** `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `(-1.5, -2.0)` would be closer to `v9` and avoid `v20`. The previous `-1.0, -2.0` might have been too close to the obstacle `v19` for path planning to work given its boundary condition.
           
           Let's try to refine the path. Maybe the "not reachable" implies the path planning library could not find a path, but the action *is* valid. Given the problem statement, we should assume the `motion` predicates describe valid traversals.
           
           The action list includes `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o3)`, meaning a move from an arbitrary config `#o3` back to `#o3` is allowed (which can be interpreted as staying in place after a complex motion, or just a placeholder).
           Importantly, we have `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v14, #o3, #o2, v15)`, `motion(v14, #o3, #o2, #o0)`, `motion(v14, #o0, #o2, #o3)`, `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`, etc. These indicate `v14` can indeed move between its start (`v15`), any `#o3` config, and any `#o0` config. The "not reachable" error for *specific values* of `#o3` or `#o0` indicates the *specific continuous value* was bad, not that `v14` cannot reach the general areas.
           
           **Revised Plan with adjusted coordinates:**
           
           We'll use `v14` for everything.
           1.  **Move to communicate (negative x):** `v14` from `v15` to a new `#o0_neg` (e.g., `(-1.5, -2.0)` for `v9`).
           2.  **Move to image `v18` (negative x):** `v14` to a new `#o3_neg` (e.g., `(-1.0, 1.5)` for `v18`). Calibrate and take image.
           3.  **Move to image `v17` (positive x):** `v14` to a new `#o3_pos` (e.g., `(1.0, 1.5)` for `v17`). Calibrate and take image.
           4.  **Move to sample `v4` (positive x):** `v14` to `#o5_pos_r4` (e.g., `(1.4, 0.8)` for `v4`). Sample.
           5.  **Move to communicate (negative x):** `v14` to `#o0_neg`. Send analyses and images.
           6.  **Drop rock:** Free store.
           7.  **Move to sample `v5` (positive x):** `v14` to `#o5_pos_r5` (e.g., `(1.4, 0.8)` for `v5`). Sample.
           8.  **Move to communicate (negative x):** `v14` to `#o0_neg`. Send analyses.
           9.  **Drop rock:** Free store.
           10. **Return to `v15` (negative x):** `v14` to `v15`.
           
           This plan needs three distinct continuous configurations for `v14`:
           - `#o3_neg` for `imagevisible(v14, ..., v18)` (in negative x region)
           - `#o3_pos` for `imagevisible(v14, ..., v17)` (in positive x region)
           - `#o5_pos` for `above(v14, ..., rock)` (in positive x region, can be shared for multiple rocks)
           - `#o0_neg` for `comvisible(v14, ..., v9)` (in negative x region)
           
           Let's rename the continuous parameters to be more specific to their use: `#o3_img_v18`, `#o3_img_v17`, `#o5_sample`, `#o0_comm`.
           
           **Configuration Coordinates:**
           *   `#o3_img_v18`: `v18` is `(-0.6, 1.9)`. Let's try `(-1.0, 1.5)`. This avoids `v20` (which is around `x=-0.7` `y=-0.2`) and allows line of sight to `v18` without crossing `x=0`.
           *   `#o3_img_v17`: `v17` is `(0.6, 1.9)`. Let's try `(1.0, 1.5)`. This is in the positive x-region, far from `x=0`.
           *   `#o5_sample`: `v4` is `(1.1, 1.1)`, `v5` is `(1.7, 0.6)`. Let's try `(1.4, 0.8)`. This is in the positive x-region, far from `x=0`.
           *   `#o0_comm`: `v9` is `(-1.9, -2.0)`. `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Let's try `(-1.5, -2.0)`. This is very close to `v9` and `v14`'s start, and avoids `v20`.
           
           We also need to ensure that the `motion` predicates exist to connect these configurations. The problem lists general `motion(v14, #config1, #o2, #config2)` for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`, and `v15`. So, any sequence of these is assumed to be a valid path as long as the continuous values chosen are reachable.

           v9: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Plan's Failure**
           
           I've been examining the failed plan and the reasons for its shortcomings are becoming clear. The initial issues stemmed from reachability problems for the imaging configurations and a collision during a communication attempt. Let's break down the problems:
           
           1.  **Impossibility of Crossing the Divide:**  The attempts for `v14` to reach image-taking configurations at `(1.0, 1.5)` and `(-1.0, 1.5)` were flagged as "not reachable." This raises a major concern. The presence of obstacle `v19` (the wall at `x=0`) makes me question if `v14` is truly able to cross the central barrier or not.
           2.  **Land Rover Collision:** The attempted communication configuration, position `(-1.5, -2.0)` for rover `v14`, collided with the lander `v9`. This indicates I must be more precise in avoiding the lander when considering communication points.
           3.  **Spatial Awareness:** It's imperative that I carefully consider obstacles like `v19`, `v20`, and `v9` along with objectives `v17` and `v18`. These have to be within reach. 
           
           **Revised Strategy**
           
           It is quite likely that `v14` cannot go into the positive side since, otherwise, the planner would generate valid moves for the motion plan. I should assume it cannot cross `v19`. Therefore:
           
           *   `v12` must handle image `v17` and sample rocks `v4` and `v5` because they are located in the positive x-region.
           *   `v14` must handle image `v18` and communication with lander `v9`.
           
           But, if `v12` cannot send information to `v9` due to `v19` and the lander can only receive from `v14`, there is no way for the plan to succeed.
           **Conclusion**
           
           With `v14` effectively restricted to the negative x-region and `v12` to the positive x-region, it's impossible to achieve the goal due to the inability to send the images and the analyses to the lander. The reachability limitations of `v14` appear to be the critical constraint preventing goal achievement. The data collected by `v12` is forever stranded. The problem becomes unachievable.
