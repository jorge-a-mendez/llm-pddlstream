           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan, based on those initial conditions and my expert analysis. We're aiming to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. Remember, the challenge is that these rovers are stuck in place – no movement allowed!  This makes things a bit more interesting, right?
           
           First, I need to take care of those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, which require images of specific targets and analysis of rock samples.  Here's the detailed sequence:
           
           **Part 1: Targeting Images and Communication (v12 is active)**
           
           1.  **Calibration:** Use the camera `v10` on rover `v12` to calibrate for imaging target `v17` *and also* target `v18`. We'll need to define the exact configuration of `v12` for `v17` and for `v18`.  Since we're restricted to `v13`, the configuration is `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)` for both.  We have image visibility and imagerange as initial facts, but will check this.
           2.  **Image v17:** Take an image of `v17` with the calibrated camera. Remember, rover `v12` is at its fixed position, `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. Ray to `v17` from `v13`.
           3.  **Communication:** Send the image of `v17` to the lander, `v9`, using the camera at `v13`. We need to calculate the exact direction.
           4.  **Re-calibration:** After the image, the camera is uncalibrated. I need to re-calibrate.
           5.  **Image v18:** Take an image of `v18` with the calibrated camera. Since we're restricted to `v13`, the configuration is `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`. Ray to `v18` from `v13`.
           6.  **Communication:** Send the image of `v18` to the lander, `v9`, using the camera at `v13`. We need to calculate the exact direction.
           
           7. **Analysis of rock v4:**  Sample rock `v4` with rover `v12` (at `v13`). `type(v4, v2)`. Then send the rock to `v16`. Then, send the analysis to the lander `v9`.  
           8. **Drop Rock v4:** Since `v16` is full, need to drop.
           
           **Part 2: Analyzing Soil/Rocks (v14 is active)**
           
           9. **Analysis of rock v5:**  Sample rock `v5` with rover `v14` (at `v15`). `type(v5, v6)`. Then send the rock to `v16`. Then, send the analysis to the lander `v9`.
           10. **Drop Rock v5:** Since `v16` is full, need to drop.
           
           11. Configuration values will be added.
           
           Key points to remember:
           
           *   **No Movement:** The key constraint is that the rovers are fixed. Their positions and orientations remain constant throughout the plan.
           *   **Ray calculation (v12):**  The key component is precisely calculating the ray direction, to see that the maximum distance is not violated.
           
             *   For the image to `v17`, the range for the ray will be within (2.0)
             *   For the image to `v18`, the range for the ray will be within (2.0)
             *   For the communication `v9`, the distance constraint is (4.0).
           *   **Ray calculation (v14):**  The key component is precisely calculating the ray direction, to see that the maximum distance is not violated.
           
             *   The analysis predicates have the same constraints.
           
           *   **Configurations:** We have two specific rovers and so only these configurations can be used.
           
             *   v12: Configuration for this will be at `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)`.
             *   v14: Configuration for this will be at `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.
           
           That's the plan. With a little care in the configuration calculations and checking preconditions, we should be able to get this done.  It should work and

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal Reachability with Restricted Actions**
           
           Okay, the previous plan was flawed, as pointed out. I'm limited to just `move` (which appear to be no-ops in this context) and `drop_rock`. Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the initial state, given these restrictions.
           
           The goal is to achieve several conditions: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, and, crucially, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, along with `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for rocks of type `v2`, and the same for soil of type `v6`.
           
           Initially, only the `atconf` and `free` predicates are true. The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, which are key to fulfilling the goal, are *not* true initially. These are the objectives that need to be met.
           
           Now, let's look at the available actions. The `move` actions simply reposition objects, and aren't relevant to making progress toward the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. The `drop_rock` actions have the precondition `full(rover, store)`. However, since both `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true initially, the rover is *not* full. This means the `drop_rock` actions can't even be executed in the initial state.
           
           More importantly, `move` and `drop_rock` don't provide a method to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Those predicates are typically achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis`, actions that aren't included in the allowed action set.
           
           In short, given the extremely limited action space – `move` (useless here) and `drop_rock` (impossible to execute) – the goal is fundamentally unreachable. There's simply no way to get to a state where the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates are true. This plan is doomed from the start.
