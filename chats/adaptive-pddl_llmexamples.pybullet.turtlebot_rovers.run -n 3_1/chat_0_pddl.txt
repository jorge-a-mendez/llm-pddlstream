           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` axiom, which means achieving all of its conjunctive conditions. Looking at the definition of `new-axiom@0`, it requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This needs to be achieved.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is true implicitly through the `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` facts. So, `?stone` can be `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`.
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze one of `v1`, `v3`, or `v4` and send the analysis.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is true implicitly through `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)` facts. So, `?soil` can be `v7`, `v8`, or `v5`.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze one of `v7`, `v8`, or `v5` and send the analysis.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the missing conditions:
           
           **Achieving `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`:**
           For each of these, we need to:
           1. Calibrate a camera (`calibrate` action).
           2. Take an image with that camera (`take_image` action).
           3. Send the image to the lander (`send_image` action).
           
           The initial state shows `imagevisible` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` from both `v12` and `v14` using `v10` as the camera and `v11` as the mode. Both rovers have `v10` onboard and `v10` supports `v11`.
           
           Let's consider rover `v14` as it's at `v15` and has `imagevisible` for all three objectives.
           - Calibrate `v10` for `v14` at `v15` using ray `#o4` and objective `v19` (or any other objective).
           - Take image of `v19` with `v10` for `v14` at `v15`.
           - Send image of `v19` with `v10` for `v14` at `v15` to `v9` using ray `#o1`.
           Repeat for `v17` and `v18`.
           
           **Achieving `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:**
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, we can choose `v1` (type `v2`).
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, we can choose `v7` (type `v6`).
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)` for a rock `?r`:
           1. Sample the rock (`sample_rock` action).
           2. Send the analysis (`send_analysis` action).
           
           From the initial state, `rover(v14)` is `atconf(v14, v15)` and `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`. It also has `free(v14, v16)`.
           This means `v14` can sample any of these rocks. Let's pick `v1` for `?stone` and `v7` for `?soil`.
           
           Rover `v14` can:
           - `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v1, v16)`
           - `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           However, it cannot sample two rocks with the same store unless it drops the first one. The problem states `free(v14, v16)` and `store(v16)`. After sampling `v1`, `v16` will be full. To sample `v7`, it would need to `drop_rock(v14, v16)` first, but the goal requires `free(v14, v16)`. This means we cannot use the same rover and store for two samples unless we drop the first one. However, the final state requires `free(v14, v16)`, which implies we can't end with a full store. Since we need to receive analysis for a stone and a soil, and we only have one store per rover, we can use rover `v14` to sample one type and rover `v12` to sample the other, or sample one, send analysis, drop, sample the other, send analysis. Given the goal `free(v14, v16)` and `free(v12, v16)`, both rovers must end up with free stores. This suggests that if we sample a rock, we must eventually drop it.
           
           Let's refine the analysis plan:
           - Sample `v1` (stone) with `v14`. This makes `full(v14, v16)`.
           - Send analysis for `v1`.
           - Drop `v1` from `v14`. This makes `free(v14, v16)` again.
           - Sample `v7` (soil) with `v12`. This makes `full(v12, v16)`.
           - Send analysis for `v7`.
           - Drop `v7` from `v12`. This makes `free(v12, v16)` again.
           
           The available actions list only `move` and `drop_rock`. This indicates that all other actions (calibrate, take_image, send_image, sample_rock, send_analysis) are not available, which means the goal is unreachable.
           
           However, the question states "You will always try to provide a new plan that achieves the goal from the initial state." and "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This implies that the only actions allowed are `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           Given this severe restriction on available actions, the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` (which requires image sending and analysis sending) cannot be achieved. The `new-axiom@0` requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. These predicates are only achieved by `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. None of these actions are in the provided list of "valid action instances". Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           I will explain why the goal is unreachable.
           
           The goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` requires the achievement of several sub-goals, including `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
           The `receivedimage` predicate can only be made true by executing the `send_image` action. The `receivedanalysis` predicate can only be made true by executing the `send_analysis` action.
           
           The list of "available action instances" provided in the problem statement is:
           * `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`
           * `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`
           * `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           * `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           
           Neither `send_image` nor `send_analysis` actions are present in this allowed list. Since these actions are necessary to achieve parts of the goal and are not allowed to be used, the goal is unreachable.
