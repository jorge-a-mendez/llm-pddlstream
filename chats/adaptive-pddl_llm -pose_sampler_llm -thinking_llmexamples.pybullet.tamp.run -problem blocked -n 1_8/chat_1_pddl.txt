           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, so here's the situation as I understand it. I'm given the goal of achieving `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked to mean I need to get an object of a certain type (`?green`) onto the object `v18`. From the initial state, I see that both `v8` and `v12` fit the type requirement.
           
           My initial approach is to try and get either `v8` or `v12` `on v18`. I know that something is "on" another object if it's both supported and at a particular pose. Let's try `v8` first. Currently, `v8` is on `v11`, at pose `v9`. I see in the initial state that `v8` is *also* supported by `v18` at a different pose (#o2). So, if I can move `v8` to pose `#o2`, I'll be good.
           
           To do that, I'd need a `pick` action to pick it up from `v9` and a `place` action to put it on `v18` at pose `#o2`. The issue is, both the `pick` and `place` actions require the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) to be at `#o3`. However, the robot is currently at `v3`. The only available `move_base` action doesn't change the robot's base configuration. It just stays at `v3`.
           
           I have to face the music: I can't move the robot's base configuration to the required `#o3`. This means I can't execute the `pick` and `place` actions that I *need* to achieve my goal. The goal is, therefore, unreachable given the initial state and the available actions. This implies the planner must have a flaw, or the problem is fundamentally unsolvable. I've re-examined the problem and stand by this conclusion.
