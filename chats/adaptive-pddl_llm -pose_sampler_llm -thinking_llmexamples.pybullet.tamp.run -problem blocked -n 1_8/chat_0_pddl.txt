(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement requires that the object is fully contained within the surface's bounds and does not collide with any other objects. Since this is the initial placement, I will focus solely on the first condition.
           
           I began by understanding the geometry of the object.  The half-extents (hx, hy) of the object are initially (0.035, 0.035). When the object is rotated by an angle, 'theta', its effective bounding box changes. I calculated the rotated dimensions: `rotated_size_x = abs(size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y * sin(theta))` and `rotated_size_y = abs(size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(size_y * cos(theta))`, resulting in new half-extents. Since the object is a square, the rotated dimensions are equal. The critical angle to consider is when the object rotates 45 degrees, as this is when the area is at its maximum.
           
           For the initial placements, I decided to use two angles, `0` and `pi/4` and space placements in an evenly distributed manner. For `theta = 0`, the minimum x value is `4.2 + 0.035 = 4.235` and the maximum is `4.8 - 0.035 = 4.765`. Similarly, y is between `-0.6 + 0.035 = -0.565` and `0.0 - 0.035 = -0.035`.  Then, I took 5 steps to create 5 distinct x and y coordinates. At `pi/4` I did a similar operation, calculating the dimensions, x and y limits, then spaced the points in an equivalent manner to that of theta equals 0.  With each angle, I generated 25 distinct (x, y) combinations resulting in a total of 50 proposed placements.
           
           I double-checked all the math to ensure it was correct.
           
           ```python
           #  Generated placements with Object ID: 5
           
           placements = [
               # theta = 0

               (0, 0, 4.235, -0.3), (0, 0, 4.3675, -0.3), (0, 0, 4.5, -0.3), (0, 0, 4.6325, -0.3), (0, 0, 4.765, -0.3),
