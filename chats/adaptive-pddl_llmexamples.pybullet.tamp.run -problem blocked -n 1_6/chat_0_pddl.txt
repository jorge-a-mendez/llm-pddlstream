           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v15) at various poses and supported by different objects. Two arms (v4, v6) are present, both empty and at their respective home configurations. The robot is at base configuration v3 and can move. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is equivalent to the conjunction `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state:
           - `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)` implies `on(v8, v11)`
           - `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)` implies `on(v12, v14)`
           - `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)` implies `on(v15, v11)`
           - We also have `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`.
           
           The goal `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` means we need to find an object `?green` such that it is of type `v17` and is on `v18`. From the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is on `v11`, not `v18`.
           Currently, `v12` is on `v14`, not `v18`.
           
           There is no action instance provided that can change the `on` predicate (i.e., `pick` and `place` actions). The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not affect the object poses or their `on` relationships.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given action instances.
