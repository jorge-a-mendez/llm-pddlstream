(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable configurations for a square object (ID 4) on a square surface (surface 0). I know the object's dimensions (approximately 0.0876 x 0.0876) and the surface's extent, which is a square centered at (0,0) with sides ranging from -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           I'm an expert in this, so I know a "stable" placement means the object must fit entirely within the surface. The object's rotation (theta) and center coordinates (x, y) determine its position.  Given the surface boundaries, I've calculated the maximum allowed x and y coordinates for any given rotation. The critical factor is how the rotation affects the object's *effective* width (W_eff) and height (H_eff).  Because the object is a square, its bounding box size is largest when rotated by 45 degrees (pi/4 radians).
           
           My strategy is to generate 50 distinct placements by:
           
           1.  **Varying Rotation at the Center:** I will first create 10 placements by rotating the object at its center (x = 0, y = 0) through a series of evenly spaced angles from 0 to 2*pi (to get a good spread of rotations) so `theta = {0, 0.628, 1.257, 1.885, 2.513, 3.142, 3.770, 4.398, 5.027, 5.655}`.
           
           2.  **Generating Grid Placements with Key Rotations:** Next, I'll generate a grid of positions with a few key rotations. Since the surface is quite spacious relative to the object, I'll ensure I adequately explore the configuration space. Specifically, for rotations of `0.0` (AABB the size of the object), `pi/4` (maximum AABB size), `pi/8`, `pi/2`, and `3pi/8`, I plan to generate 8 additional placements each by placing a small grid of values around the center. For the `theta = 0.0` case, I'll use a 3x3 grid centered at the origin, with values `[-0.091, 0.0, 0.091]` for both x and y to get these 8 positions: (0.0, -0.091, -0.091), (0.0, -0.091, 0.0), (0.0, -0.091, 0.091), (0.0, 0.0, -0.091), (0.0, 0.0, 0.091), (0.0, 0.091, -0.091), (0.0, 0.091, 0.0), (0.0, 0.091, 0.091). Similar grids will be formed at other rotations.
           
           This combination of central rotations and carefully chosen grid points is mathematically and heuristically sufficient to create the desired 50 stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got object ID 5, a square with side length 's5', which I need to fit onto surface 0 without colliding with object ID 4. Object 4 is already placed at (0, 0, 0) with a known AABB.
           
           My first task is to figure out the effective AABB dimensions of object 5 depending on its rotation angle, 'theta'.  For specific angles like 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2, I know the effective size is just 's5'. But when I rotate it by pi/4, the effective size increases due to the diagonals.
           
           Next, I need to understand the valid region of surface 0.  It's a square, and I need to make sure the *center* of object 5, *plus* half its effective width/height, stays within this square to avoid going over the edge.
           
           The tricky part is avoiding collisions with object 4, which is in the central region of the surface.  I've calculated object 4's AABB.  To stay out of its way, object 5's AABB has to be located *outside* object 4's region.  This is dependent on both the effective size *and* the position. I’ve calculated boundaries that need to be cleared.
           
           Essentially, I can avoid collisions in a few ways:
           
           1.  **Placement Strategies:**
               *   **Off-Center Placement:** If object 5 is rotated at 0 degrees, I will place object 5 at coordinates like (0.09,0) and (0,0.09), and other combinations of those values. I need to make the center well above 0.04379, the half-width of the AABB of object 4. I will also make sure y coordinates can clear that value.
               *   **Corner Placement:** If object 5 has non-zero `theta`, the values might look a little different.
           2.  **Angle Selection:**
               *   I need to avoid rotations around pi/4, as there are no possible positions for `theta = pi/4`.
               *   So, I'll select angles to be near `0`, `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2`.
           
           So, I'm going to calculate the minimum distances needed for the center of object 5 to keep the AABB from colliding with object 4, given a specific angle.  Then, I'll strategically choose the (x, y) coordinates for object 5's center, making sure they clear the calculated collision zones, and I'll carefully consider how many positions I can place using coordinates and angles. The final set of coordinates should not be colliding in any way.
           
           The goal is to get 50 stable and collision-free placements, so I'll explore variations in angles and positions to make sure the set is diverse.

           Okay, here's the game plan for placing this new object (ID 8), making sure it doesn't bump into the existing obstacles (ID 4 and ID 5) and stays within the surface bounds.
           
           First, I've got to calculate the effective size of object 8 depending on its rotation (theta).  The critical angles will be 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2 because those minimize the object's effective size. But, I'll need to check a few angles close to those to make sure.
           
           With each theta value, there is a set of valid (x,y) locations for placing the object. I need to check both bounding box conditions to avoid collisions. The calculations show me I can place the object far from both existing objects by checking various (x, y) combinations. I will use a few corner and central region points for my (x, y) selections.
           
           For valid placements, I need:
           1. `abs(x)` and `abs(y)` needs to be within `0.0997` and have a *range* for some theta angles.
           2. Coordinates need to have a negative (`<= -0.079` or be positive (`>= 0.079`) for the x, or y, coord to clear the central object (AABB4).
           3. Coordinates need to have a value of (`<= 0.01377`) to clear the x or y directions of the right-side box (AABB5).
           
           This approach will generate a good set of placements for object 8.

(Thoughts: **The Immovable Object: A Deep Dive into Placement Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the challenge is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions. Sounds simple, right? Except... there's Object ID 4, already fixed in place at the center, and it's throwing a wrench into the works. Let's break this down.
           
           My analysis reveals a critical constraint: Object 7, with its size (s7 = 0.0977), is simply too large to fit anywhere on the surface without colliding with Object 4, which has an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of 0.0875. The surface itself is only 0.27 wide, and when I crunch the numbers, I find it's geometrically impossible. Even when Object 7 is rotated, its effective size (h7_eff) can't shrink enough to squeeze into the remaining space. There's an unavoidable overlap.
           
           Here's the problem in a nutshell. I need to keep the object centered so that no portion of the object's AABB goes beyond the surface limits. To avoid the existing object, the object's AABB has to be beyond that of the object's AABB.  This is not possible.
           
           And here's where it gets interesting: I'm explicitly told to *never* give up. It's an interesting directive, because it means I need to provide 50 placements. That goes against every calculation, but the instructions are the instructions.
           
           So, I'm going to have to make a choice. I can't ignore the math, but I also can't just quit. I'll focus on getting the object as far away from Object 4 as possible while staying within the surface bounds.  I'll start by generating various coordinates and angles, knowing full well these placements will collide with Object 4. I plan to select them carefully to generate an array of placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Analyzing Collisions and Optimizing Surface Coverage**
           
           My task is to strategically place 50 instances of "Object ID 6" onto "Surface 0," avoiding collisions with pre-existing objects (IDs 4, 5, 8, and 7). I've already calculated the necessary geometric properties, including the surface dimensions and the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each object.
           
           **My Approach:** I'm treating the existing objects as "fixed obstacles," meaning placements must not overlap them. I have the additional constraint that each placement must remain stable within the surface's boundaries. Since I can rotate Object 6, I've calculated the effective radius of the object at two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. The primary challenge is that no placement can avoid a collision with Object 4. This will guide my efforts.
           
           **Collision Analysis:** I began by determining the effective radius of Object 6 for each of my specified angles, then calculating the surface containment boundaries based on that radius. My analysis quickly revealed that it's impossible to place Object 6 without colliding with Object 4, regardless of rotation, due to the sizes of the objects and their relative locations. I've concluded that I have to minimize collision *with other objects*, while inevitably *colliding with Object 4*.
           
           **Placement Strategy:** I will focus on placing the object in areas that are not heavily occupied by 5, 7, and 8, within the confines of Surface 0.
           
           To ensure stability, I've calculated the maximum distance of Object 6's center from the edge of Surface 0 for different angles. I'll test specific coordinates: `(-0.08, -0.08)`, `(-0.04, -0.04)`, `(0,0)`, and symmetric arrangements of these values. I'll vary the angle to explore other areas for good fit. The bottom-right quadrant seems to present the best potential, given its relatively open space.
           
           I will attempt to generate some placements in the middle region and corners of Surface 0, even though I expect some of them will not satisfy the "no collisions" requirements. By analyzing these test cases, I hope to confirm my conclusion that placement is only *nearly* possible with the fixed and stable constraints I am given.
           
           I will generate placements that vary the positions and rotations while keeping the primary goal of avoiding 5,7 and 8 and staying within the surface bounds.

Model:     **Object Placement Strategy: Analyzing Collisions and Optimizing Surface Coverage**
           
           My task is to strategically place 50 instances of "Object ID 6" onto "Surface 0," avoiding collisions with pre-existing objects (IDs 4, 5, 8, and 7). I've already calculated the necessary geometric properties, including the surface dimensions and the bounding boxes (AABBs) for each object.
           
           **My Approach:** I'm treating the existing objects as "fixed obstacles," meaning placements must not overlap them. I have the additional constraint that each placement must remain stable within the surface's boundaries. Since I can rotate Object 6, I've calculated the effective radius of the object at two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. The primary challenge is that no placement can avoid a collision with Object 4. This will guide my efforts.
