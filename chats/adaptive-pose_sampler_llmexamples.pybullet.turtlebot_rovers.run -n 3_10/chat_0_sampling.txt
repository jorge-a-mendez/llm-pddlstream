User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (wall 5) at x=0. There are also a number of smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I need to find 3 positions within a radius of 2 from the target point that avoid collisions and occlusions. I will try to space out the positions to increase the chances of finding valid ones.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was given as (-0.5532152652740479, 2.1664493083953857), and all proposed positions failed with 'no line of sight to target'. This suggests that there might be an obstacle between the previous proposed positions, which were around (-1, -0.6), and the target point at (-0.55, 2.16). The vertical wall (obstacle 5) at x=0 is a likely culprit if the target was on the other side. Looking at the coordinates, the target is at x=-0.55, so it's to the left of x=0. The previous proposed positions were also to the left of x=0. This suggests that some other obstacle blocked the view. Obstacles 15, 16, 21, and 10, 9, 8 are in that general region.

           The target is at (0.17, -1.97). I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point.
