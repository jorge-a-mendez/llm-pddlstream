           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.046, 0.383), (0.053, 0.482)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.134, -0.54), (-0.038, -0.444)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.045, 0.279), (0.133, 0.367)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.273, -0.24), (-0.203, -0.17)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.003, 0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.374, 0.928).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.117, -0.426), (0.199, -0.344)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.086, -0.492, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.967, 0.254).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.089, 0.323, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.587, 0.809).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.238, -0.205, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.002, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.158, -0.385, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.638, 0.77).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan Evaluation: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to move several objects onto a target object (`v20`). This requires executing `pick` and `place` actions for each object. The preconditions for these actions include `kin` facts and `atbconf`, which dictates that the robot base must be at a specific base configuration, and that the `kin` fact's configuration must be the same as the base configuration. My assessment is that there is an incompatibility.
           
           The initial state reveals object positions that need to change to satisfy the goal.  I analyze the preconditions of `pick` and `place`, specifically looking at the constraints and the allowed actions. The key problem is the robot's base configuration:  The only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely restricts my options.
           
           I have reviewed the available facts and checked the preconditions. I have noticed that the system only allows the robot to move from base configuration `v3` to the same configuration `v3` - which is a no-op. If I can't move the robot, I can't satisfy the goal preconditions.
           
           I can't move the objects using only a `move_base` action. There are no available `pick` or `place` instances, and these are required to achieve the `on(object, v20)` goal.
           
           Therefore, because only the base movement `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is valid, I conclude that the goal state of `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)` is *unreachable* with the given action instances.
