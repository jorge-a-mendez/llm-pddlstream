           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 10) -- 0.08056590394266117, 0.080565903942662)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's the breakdown of my approach to generate 50 stable placements for the object on the surface:**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for an object within a defined surface. The object is nearly square with dimensions `obj_x = 0.080566` and `obj_y = 0.080566`. The surface in question is defined by its two opposing corners at  `(4.2, -0.6)` and `(4.8, 0.0)`.
           
           A placement is represented by `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The `surf_idx` is `0`, as there's only one surface. `theta` controls the rotation, `x` and `y` position the object's center. The challenge is ensuring the object stays *entirely* within the surface, regardless of the rotation.
           
           I will focus on the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) around the object. This simplifies placement calculations. Rotating the object changes its effective width and height.
           
           I calculated the object's bounding box effectively. Rotating the object by *pi/4* results in the maximum bounding box size. I have determined a safe range for x and y to ensure that the object is always inside.
           
           I will generate a grid of positions with two different angles of rotation to create a diverse set of placements. I will generate 5 values for `x` and 5 values for `y` at each angle. 
           
           The strategy is to generate 50 unique positions. I will use the safest and smallest rectangle that can encompass the object, in case of an rotation. I will calculate `x` and `y` bounds by shifting them so the largest object can always fit inside. Using `0` and `pi/4` (45 degrees), I will produce a diverse set of placements.
