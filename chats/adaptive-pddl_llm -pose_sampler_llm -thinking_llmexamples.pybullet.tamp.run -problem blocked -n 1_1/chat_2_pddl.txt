(Thoughts: **The Path to New-Axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which boils down to finding an object that's both *on* a specific object (v18) and of a particular type.  I've identified two potential candidates that fit the type requirement: v12 and v8. Now, to be *on* v18 means we need a supporting relationship and a correct pose.  Since there's already a supporting relationship for v12 and v8 at pose #o2, I'll aim for those to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`.
           
           My plan is to place either v12 or v8 onto v18 at the pose #o2, since those already have support relationships defined in the starting state. I'll begin with v12 since it's listed first, which means picking up and placing it on v18. The problem is I have to pick it up and place it in the correct configuration.
           
           Here's the sequence I've formulated:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must ensure that the robot is at a configuration compatible with the *kinematic* relationships needed for picking and placing (to bconf #o3 in this case). So, I'll execute the 'move_base' action. This action takes us to a safe configuration for manipulation.
           
           2.  **Pick:** Then, I need to pick up v12. To do this, I will use the 'pick' action which requires `kin` (kinematic) and `atpose` (at a pose), `handempty`, and the appropriate bconf and that the approach and trajectory are safe (assumed true initially). This will result in me grasping v12, ready to move it.
           
           3.  **Place:** After picking up v12, I'll place it on v18 at the designated pose (#o2). This involves the 'place' action, which similarly needs the correct `kin`, that v12 is `atgrasp`, bconf, and that the approach and trajectory are safe, and ensures the robot isn't in an unsafepose.
           
           Since the initial conditions and action effects are properly accounted for, the state after the place action satisfies `on(v12, v18)`, and combined with the initial facts showing that `type(v12, v17)` the goal `new-axiom@0()` is met.
           
           Therefore, the final plan is: `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`, `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, and `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
