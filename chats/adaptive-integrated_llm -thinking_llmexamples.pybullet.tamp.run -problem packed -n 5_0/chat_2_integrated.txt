           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.246, 0.436), (-0.149, 0.533)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.11, -0.311), (0.184, -0.238)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, -0.51), (0.029, -0.429)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.09, -0.353), (0.001, -0.263)).

           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.197, 0.484, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.463, 0.886).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.147, -0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.727, 0.687).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.011, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.997).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.308, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.565, 0.825).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.139, -0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.202, 0.979).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of Planning Process**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm approaching this planning problem. The ultimate goal is to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a specific object, v20.  Currently, they are all on a table, v11, at specific poses.  I know that "on(x,y)" is the desired outcome. The robot has an arm (v4) and a base configuration (v3), and the arm is currently empty.
           
           My initial thought is that this is a straightforward pick-and-place problem for each object.  I need to move each object *o* from its starting pose on v11 to a target pose on v20. Since all of these objects are already "supported" by the `v20`, I simply need to move them to their final, target poses.
           
           I need to make a plan. The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. The pick and place are going to be key, and I will be using those quite a bit.
           
           There is also a `move_base` action. Now, looking at the kin predicates, I see I'm using `#o3` for all pick and place actions. It seems like the arm can reach all pick and place locations *from* a specific base configuration, but first, I will need to move the base from its current configuration, v3, to this `#o3`.  This is a significant detail.
           
           Let's break it down: for each object, I need to pick it up from its current location, and then place it on v20 at a pre-defined pose. These pre-defined poses are all represented by `#o2`.
           
           **Object Poses & Obstacles**
           
           First, I need to map out the poses of the objects at the moment.
           
           *   `v8`: on v11 at pose `v9`
           *   `v12`: on v11 at pose `v13`
           *   `v14`: on v11 at pose `v15`
           *   `v16`: on v11 at pose `v17`
           *   `v18`: on v11 at pose `v19`
           
           So, that leads me to my plan.
           
           **Move Base to `#o3`:**
           
           `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`
           
           Now, for each object:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, o, p_current, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, o, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           And since `total-cost` is minimized, the move base cost is minimal.
           
           **Object Positioning on v20**
           
           I need to come up with a collision-free placement arrangement for the five objects on v20. Because the current poses are all very small objects, I know that v20 is a small surface, so I am going to position them in a square-like pattern.
           
           I looked at a series of stable placements, so that the x,y coordinates are all within the ranges [-0.135, 0.135].
           
           My plan includes:
           
           For the plan, I am positioning v8 and v12 in the top left and top right, and v14 and v16 at the bottom left and bottom right. v18 is in the center.
           
           - `v8`: x=-0.08, y=0.08, z=0.781. The z is surface of the table
           - `v12`: x=0.08, y=0.08, z=0.781
           - `v14`: x=-0.08, y=-0.08, z=0.781
           - `v16`: x=0.08, y=-0.08, z=0.781
           - `v18`: x=0, y=0, z=0.781
           
           **Base Configuration (`#o3`)**
           
           I need a position for the robot's base that lets the arm reach both the current poses of the objects on v11 and the target placement on v20. It looks like placing the base at (-0.5, 0.0, 0.0) seems the best.
           
           **Putting It All Together**
           
           The complete plan looks like:
           
           1.  `move_base(v3, (-0.5, 0.0, 0.0), #o0)`
)
