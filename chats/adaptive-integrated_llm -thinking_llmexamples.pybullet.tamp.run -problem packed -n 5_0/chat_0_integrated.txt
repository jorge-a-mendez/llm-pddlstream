           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.246, 0.436), (-0.149, 0.533)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.11, -0.311), (0.184, -0.238)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, -0.51), (0.029, -0.429)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.09, -0.353), (0.001, -0.263)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.093, -0.477), (0.185, -0.385)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.197, 0.484, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.463, 0.886).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.147, -0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.727, 0.687).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.011, -0.469, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.997).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.308, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.565, 0.825).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.139, -0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.202, 0.979).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unachievable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to create a plan to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` on object `v20`.  The initial state describes these objects being on `v11`, with the robot base at `v3`, two empty arms (`v4` and `v6`), and `v20` recognized as a surface.  The crucial element here is the *provided list of valid actions*:  `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely limits my options.
           
           I understand the core process requires picking up each object from `v11` and placing it onto `v20`. I recognize that to achieve the goals of `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`, I'll need `place` actions that will manipulate predicates of the objects so that they are "on" `v20`.  However, I also understand I must provide a unique continuous value for *each* object at `v20` to satisfy the requirements of the problem.
           
           The problem, however, arises from the constraints on valid actions.  I see no `pick` or `place` action instances in the provided list. The given action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` does not change the position of objects.  The problem states that only actions in the provided list are valid. I cannot use any custom `pick` or `place` instances with specific parameters for the objects to move them.
           
           Since the only available action doesn't allow me to move the objects, I can conclude that the goal, as stated, is *unachievable* within the imposed action constraints. I must report that no plan is possible given the provided action instance list.
