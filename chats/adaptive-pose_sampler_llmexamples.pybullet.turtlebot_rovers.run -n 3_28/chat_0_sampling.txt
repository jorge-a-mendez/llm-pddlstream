User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a rectangular boundary defined by AABBs 1, 2, 3, and 4, which are essentially walls at x = +/-2.55 and y = +/-2.55. There's also a vertical wall (AABB 5) at x = 0.
           
           There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I need to ensure the proposed base positions are within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5] and within a distance of 2 from the target point. I also need to avoid collisions with the listed AABBs.
           
           Given the target point (1.7161860822159844 1.761895697361719), I'll look for positions in its vicinity. Since the target is in the top-right quadrant, I'll prioritize positions in that general area, keeping in mind the smaller obstacles like AABB 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)), AABB 19 ((2.092566181693936, 1.934780289207364), (2.1909106478348725, 2.0331247553483003)), AABB 12, AABB 13, AABB 16. I will try to stay clear of these.
           
           The target point is (1.716, 1.761). I will try positions around this point, within a radius of 2. I should try to spread out the suggested points to offer a diverse set of options.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.0)
           (1.5 0.5)
           (0.5 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous attempt failed because the target point was (-1.972, 2.049), and I proposed positions in the first quadrant, which obviously wouldn't have line of sight. My initial reasoning was based on a different target point. I need to be careful to base my reasoning on the *current* target point.
           
           The new target point is (-1.9728646278381348, 2.049459457397461). This point is in the top-left quadrant, near the wall. I need to find positions within a 2-unit radius of this point, avoiding obstacles. Relevant obstacles in this area include:
           - AABB 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - This is a square right around the target.
           - AABB 20: ((-2.0189435392777977, 2.003380545957798), (-1.9267857163984718, 2.095538368837124)) - This is a smaller square directly overlapping the target point. This means I need to be careful to not place the base inside this obstacle.
           - AABB 4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) - The left wall.
           
           Given the target (-1.972, 2.049), and the obstacle AABB 20 covering much of the immediate area around the target, I should try to place the base a bit further away, perhaps to the left or below the obstacle, while still being within the 2-unit range. I'll also consider positions further from the wall.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 1.0)
           (-2.0 0.5)
           (-1.5 1.5)

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     My apologies, I seem to have made an error in interpreting the target point from the previous request. I must strictly use the target point given in the *current* request. The target point in the *previous* request was indeed (-1.972, 2.049), and I correctly identified that. However, the feedback provided in the failures section refers to a target point of `(-1.9728646278381348, 2.049459457397461, 0.20100000500679016)`, which is identical to the target point in *this* current request. This means my previous suggestions for this specific target point were invalid.
           
           The target point is (-1.9728646278381348, 2.049459457397461).
           My previous proposed positions were:
           (-1.0 1.0)
           (-2.0 0.5)
           (-1.5 1.5)
           
           Since all previous proposed positions were marked as "no line of sight to target", it suggests that there might be an obstacle between them and the target.
           Let's re-examine the obstacles near (-1.972, 2.049):
           - AABB 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))
           - AABB 20: ((-2.0189435392777977, 2.003380545957798), (-1.9267857163984718, 2.095538368837124))
           - AABB 4: ((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55)) (left wall)
           - AABB 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) (top wall)
           
           The target point (-1.972, 2.049) is within AABB 8 and AABB 20. AABB 20 is particularly small and covers the target. It is very likely that AABB 20 is occluding the view from my previous proposed positions. Also, AABB 5 ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) is a tall vertical wall at x=0. This would definitely block line of sight from (1.0, 1.0), (1.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5) to a target in the negative x-quadrant.
           
           For the current target (-1.972, 2.049), I need positions on the same side of the x=0 wall (AABB 5). The previous positions from *this* model were: (-1.0 1.0), (-2.0 0.5), (-1.5 1.5).
           Let's analyze them against the obstacles:
           - Target: (-1.972, 2.049)
           - Obstacle AABB 20: from x=-2.018 to x=-1.926 and y=2.003 to y=2.095. This box *contains* the target.
           
           If I place the robot at (-1.0, 1.0), the line of sight to (-1.972, 2.049) would cross through the x=0 wall (AABB 5), which is an obvious collision/occlusion. So that's why it failed.
           Similarly for (-2.0, 0.5) and (-1.5, 1.5). For (-2.0, 0.5), the line of sight to (-1.972, 2.049) might be blocked by AABB 8. For (-1.5, 1.5), the line of sight is also likely blocked by AABB 8 or AABB 20.
           
           I need to find positions that are relatively close to the target, and avoid the immediate obstacles.
           Let's try to place the robot very close to the target, but not inside AABB 20, and on the 'outside' of AABB 8 to get a clear view.
           Distance from target must be <= 2.
           Target: (-1.972, 2.049)
           
           I'll try placing the robot to the left or below AABB 8, and ensuring there's a clear path.

Model:     My apologies for the continued errors. I am having trouble correctly identifying the current target point and using it consistently throughout my reasoning. I will be more careful now.
           
           The *current* target point is (2.1417384147644043, 1.983952522277832). This is in the first (top-right) quadrant.
           The previous failed attempts for *this* target point were:
           Proposed position: (-2.4, 2.0) -- collides with AABB 0 and AABB 1. This is clearly wrong, as AABB 0 is the large bounding box for the entire scene, and AABB 1 is the top wall. More importantly, (-2.4, 2.0) is far from the target (2.141, 1.983) and in a different quadrant separated by the x=0 wall (AABB 5). It also collides with AABB 4 (left wall) which has x = -2.45 to -2.55.
           Proposed position: (-2.0, 1.5) -- no line of sight to target. Again, wrong quadrant separated by the x=0 wall.
           Proposed position: (-1.5, 2.0) -- no line of sight to target. Same issue.
           
           I clearly messed up my quadrant selection for the previous set of proposed positions. The target point is (2.141, 1.983). This is in the top-right quadrant.
           Relevant obstacles in this area:
           - AABB 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This is a square right around the target.
           - AABB 19: ((2.092566181693936, 1.934780289207364), (2.1909106478348725, 2.0331247553483003)) - This is a smaller square directly overlapping the target point. This means I need to be careful to not place the base inside this obstacle.
           - AABB 3: ((2.45, -2.55), (2.55, 2.55)) - The right wall.
           - AABB 1: ((-2.55, 2.45), (2.55, 2.55)) - The top wall.
           
           The target (2.141, 1.983) is very close to AABB 19, which likely contains it. This means I need to place the robot outside of AABB 19 to have line of sight. Also, AABB 7 is a larger box encompassing AABB 19.
           
           I need to find positions that are within 2 units of (2.141, 1.983), on the same side of the x=0 wall, and avoid collision with the other fixed obstacles, especially AABB 7 and AABB 19.
           
           Let's try to place the robot just outside of AABB 7 and AABB 19.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 2.0)
           (2.0 1.5)
           (1.8 2.3)
