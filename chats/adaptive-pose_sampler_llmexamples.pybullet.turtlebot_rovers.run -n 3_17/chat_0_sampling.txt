Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a central vertical wall (5) at x=0. Other obstacles are scattered within the room. I will try to find diverse positions around the target point, prioritizing locations away from the known obstacles and the central wall. I'll distribute them around the target in a circular fashion, making sure they are within the allowed range and maximum distance from the target.

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.9049495458602905, 2.1330580711364746).
           The failed positions were:
           1. (0.10609075775459341, 1.9830863800658405) collided with the central wall (5) and obstacle (9). This is because the central wall is at x=0 and obstacle 9 is at x between 0.25 and 0.75 and y between 1.75 and 2.25. The proposed x-coordinate 0.10609075775459341 is very close to the wall and the y-coordinate 1.9830863800658405 is within the range of obstacle 9.
           2. (2.1060907577545938, -0.016913619934159515) had no line of sight. This position is on the right side of the room, while the target is on the left side, close to the top. The central wall (5) at x=0 would occlude this view.
           3. (-1.8939092422454067, -0.016913619934159515) also had no line of sight. This position is on the bottom-left, while the target is on the top-left. It's likely blocked by some smaller obstacles or possibly just a bad angle.
           
           The current target point is the same as the previous one: (-1.9049495458602905, 2.1330580711364746).
           I need to find positions within 2 units of this target, avoiding the central wall (x=0) and the obstacles around the target point. The target is in the top-left quadrant.
           
           Given the failures, I should prioritize positions that are also in the top-left quadrant and avoid crossing the x=0 line. Also, I need to be careful with the y-coordinate as there are several small obstacles in the upper region.
           I will try positions close to the target, slightly to its left, right, and below, keeping clear of any known obstacles. I'll stay within the same quadrant as the target and ensure the x-coordinate is sufficiently far from 0.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (-0.48335546255111694, 2.1239449977874756).
           Let's analyze the failures for the previous target point:
           1. (-1.9049495458602905, 0.1330580711364746) had no line of sight. This position is far below the target in the same left quadrant.
           2. (-0.9049495458602905, 2.1330580711364746) collided with obstacle (10) which is `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. The proposed x-coordinate (-0.9049495458602905) is outside the x-range of obstacle 10, but the y-coordinate (2.1330580711364746) is within its y-range. This collision is likely due to the robot's physical dimensions or a slight miscalculation on my part. I should avoid this region. The x-coordinate of the proposed position is -0.904, and the obstacle starts at -0.75. This means the position is to the left of the obstacle. So the collision could be with the left boundary of the obstacle.
           3. (-2.4049495458602905, 1.1330580711364746) collided with obstacle (4) `((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))`. This is the left wall of the room. The x-coordinate -2.404 is too close to the wall at -2.45.
           
           The current target point is (-0.48335546255111694, 2.1239449977874756). This target is in the top-left quadrant, near the central wall (x=0) and the top wall.
           Based on the failures:
           - Avoid x-coordinates close to 0 due to the central wall (5) and objects near it (9, 10).
           - Avoid x-coordinates too close to -2.5 (left wall).
           - Be mindful of the y-coordinate 2.13, which is near the top of the room and where several small obstacles are located (e.g., 9, 10, 19, 20, 21).
           
           I need to find positions within 2 units of the target. I will try to place positions to the right of the target (but not crossing x=0), and below the target, while trying to stay away from known obstacle regions.

Model:     The previous target point was (-0.48335546255111694, 2.1239449977874756).
           Let's analyze the failures for the previous target point:
           1. (-0.48335546255111694, 0.1239449977874756) had no line of sight. This position is directly below the target and was likely blocked by the central wall (5) or other obstacles in the lower part of the room, as the target is in the top left.
           2. The other two positions proposed in the last turn, (-1.483355462551117, 1.1239449977874756) and (1.516644537448883, -0.8760550022125244), were not listed in the failures, which means they might be valid for the previous target. However, since the target point changes for this request, I cannot assume they are valid for the *current* target.
           
           The current target point is (0.8173463344573975, 2.0526719093322754).
           This target is in the top-right quadrant, close to the top wall and the central wall (x=0).
           
           Based on the cumulative failures:
           - Avoid x-coordinates close to 0 due to the central wall (5) and objects near it (9, 10).
           - Avoid x-coordinates too close to the room boundaries.
           - Be careful with y-coordinates close to 2.0, as there are obstacles in that region (7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21).
           
           Since the target is in the top-right, I will try to find positions to its right, and below it, staying within the right side of the room (x>0).
