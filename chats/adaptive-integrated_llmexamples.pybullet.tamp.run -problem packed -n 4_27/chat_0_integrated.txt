User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.258, 0.434), (-0.172, 0.519)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.145, 0.423), (0.243, 0.521)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.133, 0.329), (-0.036, 0.426)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.044, 0.503), (0.05, 0.597)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.215, 0.476, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.611, 0.791).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.194, 0.472, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.946, 0.324).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.085, 0.378, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.287, 0.958).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.003, 0.55, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.523, 0.852).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that need to be placed on object v18. Currently, v8, v12, v14, and v16 are supported by v11. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are handempty. The goal is to move all four objects to be on v18. There are poses for these objects (#o2) on v18, but the specific poses for these objects on v18 need to be computed. The only available action instance for `move_base` is a self-loop, which means the base doesn't move. Thus, the robot must be able to reach all objects from its current base configuration v3.
           
           To achieve the goal, the robot needs to pick up each object from its current location on v11 and place it onto v18. Since there's only one arm configuration provided per arm, and no other pick/place actions, the plan must use the `move_base` action if it were to move to another base configuration. However, the only `move_base` action instance is a self-loop to v3. The provided `pick` and `place` action instances are not explicit in the input (they are implicitly generated from `kin` facts). Since `kin` facts are not provided for the existing objects and poses, and only `move_base` action instances are given, the robot cannot pick or place any objects to achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
