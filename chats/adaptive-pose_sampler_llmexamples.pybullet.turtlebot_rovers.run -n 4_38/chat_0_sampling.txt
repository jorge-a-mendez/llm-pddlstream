User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene appears to be largely enclosed by bounding boxes 0-4, forming a square perimeter between -2.5 and 2.5 in both x and y. There is a vertical wall (box 5) down the center at x=0. There are several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including some in the corners (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and others forming smaller, irregular shapes (11-22).
           
           I need to find a position (x, y) within a radius of 2 from the target point {target_point}, while staying within the x and y limits of -2.5 to 2.5. I'll prioritize positions that are likely to be in open areas and have good line-of-sight to the target. Given the central wall at x=0, if the target is on one side of this wall, I should primarily consider positions on the same side. I'll also try to avoid placing the robot too close to any of the other defined obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0] - 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] + 1.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] - 1.5})

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous positions were based on a general strategy. Now, I need to consider the specific target point: {target_point}. I'll re-evaluate the best positions based on this target, still keeping in mind the fixed obstacles and the max_range=2 constraint. I'll also ensure the proposed positions are within the overall x/y limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. I will try to place the robot in an open space and avoid the central wall at x=0 if the target is on one side of it. I will also try to vary the positions to increase the chances of finding a valid one.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0] - 1.0} {target_point[1] - 1.0})
           ({target_point[0] + 1.0} {target_point[1] - 1.0})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 1.5})
