           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that requires satisfying several conditions simultaneously. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: Store `v16` on rover `v12` is free. This is true in the initial state.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: Store `v16` on rover `v14` is free. This is true in the initial state.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received.
           7.  `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object `?stone` is of type `v2` (stone).
           8.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of that stone has been received.
           9.  `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object `?soil` is of type `v6` (soil).
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of that soil has been received.
           
           We have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`. Both are at their initial configurations and both have a free store `v16`. We need to achieve `receivedimage` for objectives `v17` and `v18` with mode `v11`. We also need to analyze one stone (type `v2`) and one soil (type `v6`) and have their analysis received.
           
           Let's identify the rocks and their types:
           *   `v4`, `v1`, `v3` are of type `v2` (stone).
           *   `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6` (soil).
           
           The available action instances are very limited. We only have `move` actions for both rovers to their current configurations, and `drop_rock` actions. This means we cannot take images, calibrate, sample rocks, or send anything as there are no instances of `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, or `send_analysis` actions provided.
           
           Since `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are part of the goal and the only actions available are `move` and `drop_rock`, it implies that these `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates must already be true in the initial state, or are impossible to achieve with the given action instances. Checking the initial state, none of these are present. Therefore, with the provided action instances, it is impossible to achieve the goal.
           
           The available action instances are:
           *   `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           *   `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           *   `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           *   `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           None of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. Thus, the goal is unreachable.
