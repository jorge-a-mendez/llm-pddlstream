           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Evaluation: Goal Unachievable with Limited Actions**
           
           I've been tasked with crafting a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've interpreted as achieving a set of conditions related to image reception and analysis.  My first instinct was to break down the goal into its components: obtaining images of three specific objectives and analyzing two types of rocks (stone and soil). I identified the actions necessary: `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. I outlined a plan involving two rovers, assigning image capture to one and analysis to the other, streamlining the process.
           
           However, a crucial constraint surfaced: the permissible action set was severely limited. I was only allowed to use four action instances: two no-ops (`move` actions for the rovers, keeping them in their initial configurations) and two `drop_rock` actions that are impossible to execute because the initial state does not satisfy the `full` predicate.  No actions for taking images or analyzing rock samples are available.
           
           Given this restriction, it became clear the goal is impossible. The required predicates (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`) are false in the initial state, and the permitted actions cannot alter this. The provided "no-op" `move` actions do not change the state either.  Therefore, I'm forced to conclude that a solution satisfying `new-axiom@0()` cannot be found with the given constraints.
