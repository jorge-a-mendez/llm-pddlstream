User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Planning for Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three good spots for a robot's base to go, all within a certain range of a given target point. The robot has to be able to see the target, and it can't run into anything. I've got a list of where all the walls and obstacles are, and it's my job to figure out how to work around them. This is the initial attempt, so I don't need to consider any failures from previous attempts, as this is the first request.
           
           Here's how I'm thinking about it:
           
           1.  **Scene Geometry:** I've got the map of the environment. There's a big central pillar at x=0, and then walls around the edges. I need to make sure the base position is within `x=[-2.5, 2.5]` and `y=[-2.5, 2.5]`. I should use the given AABB coordinates to determine collision.
           
           2.  **Base Constraints:** The robot's base can only be up to 2 units away from the target, and it must have a clear line of sight.
           
           3.  **My Strategy:** I'm going to start by picking a few potential spots around the target. To make sure there's no collision, I will check whether the base's location is inside an AABB obstacle. To test LoS, I'm going to check if the line from the base to the target passes through any of the obstacles. I plan to pick one spot to the right of the target, one to the left, and one above or below, to make sure I get variety.
           
           The key challenge is the line-of-sight check. I will use the actual AABB coordinates for each obstacle and test to make sure that the base location (and any location in between the base and the target location) is not contained within that AABB. If it is in the AABB, or if the line of sight intersects the AABB, then the spot is invalid.
           
           *Now*, let's *assume* the target point is `(1.5, 0.0)`.
           
           Based on my understanding:
           
           *   I'll try points above, below, and to the right of `(1.5, 0.0)`.
           *   The central pillar (at x=0) could block positions at x < 0, but this will change when the real target point is substituted.
           *   The LoS check is the key. The line from base to the target should not be blocked by anything.
           
           So here's what I'll do: I'll carefully generate a small number of candidate positions and then test each one using these steps:
           1.  Check that the position's x and y are within the global range of -2.5 and 2.5.
           2.  Make sure the position's distance to the target is less than or equal to 2.
           3.  Check if the position collides with any of the AABBs.
           4.  Check line of sight, using the segment-AABB intersection method for all AABBs.
           
           If a point passes these tests, I'll count it as a "valid" point.
           
           My thought process gives me three positions that are far enough away from the walls and obstacles and close enough to the target. For our test example, the positions are: `(1.5, 1.5)`, `(1.5, -1.5)`, and `(2.0, 0.0)`. These locations should satisfy the constraints.
