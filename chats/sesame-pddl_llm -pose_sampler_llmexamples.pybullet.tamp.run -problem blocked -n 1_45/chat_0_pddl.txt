           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single surface, surface 0, defined by the bounding box from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). The object (ID: 5) has dimensions of approximately 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0. Stability requires the object to be fully contained within the surface boundaries. Since the object is very small relative to the surface, there's a large area for stable placements. I will generate placements across the surface, varying both position (x, y) and orientation (theta). Since the object is square-ish, rotations of 0, pi/2, pi, and 3*pi/2 radians will result in the same bounding box on the surface. However, I will still vary the rotation to cover a diverse set of options.
           
           For surface 0:
           x_range: 4.2 to 4.8 (length 0.6)
           y_range: -0.6 to 0.0 (length 0.6)
           
           Object (ID 5):
           size_x = 0.07
           size_y = 0.07
           
           When theta = 0 or pi, the effective size on the surface is 0.07x by 0.07y.
           When theta = pi/2 or 3*pi/2, the effective size on the surface is 0.07x by 0.07y (because it's a square).
           The object's center (x_obj, y_obj) must satisfy:
           lower_x + size_x/2 <= x_obj <= upper_x - size_x/2
           lower_y + size_y/2 <= y_obj <= upper_y - size_y/2
           
           For theta = 0:
           x: 4.2 + 0.07/2 = 4.235 to 4.8 - 0.07/2 = 4.765
           y: -0.6 + 0.07/2 = -0.565 to 0.0 - 0.07/2 = -0.035
           
           I will generate a grid of positions within these allowed ranges and vary the rotation for each.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, with a single surface (surface 0) defined by the bounding box from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). The object (ID: 5) still has approximate dimensions of 0.07 x 0.07. The previous successful placements indicate that there are no hidden fixed obstacles in those specific locations. I will continue to generate a diverse set of stable placements within the bounds of surface 0, trying to cover the remaining areas and different orientations. Since the object is square-ish, the exact rotation does not affect the AABB on the surface, but I will still vary it for diversity.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has one surface (surface 0: (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)). This time, a new object (ID: 10) is introduced, with dimensions approximately 0.099 x 0.099. This object is slightly larger than the previous object (ID: 5). I need to ensure that the new placements for object ID 10 do not collide with any of the previously successfully placed objects (ID 5). Since the previous placements for ID 5 were given as successes, they are now considered fixed obstacles.
           
           The bounding box for object 10 (size_x=0.099, size_y=0.099) needs to fit within the surface 0.
           For theta = 0:
           x_center range: 4.2 + 0.099/2 = 4.2495 to 4.8 - 0.099/2 = 4.7505
           y_center range: -0.6 + 0.099/2 = -0.5505 to 0.0 - 0.099/2 = -0.0495
           
           The previous successful placements for object ID 5 are:
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.55), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.55), (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.55), (0, 0.0, 4.55, -0.55), (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.55), (0, 0.0, 4.75, -0.55)
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.45), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.45), (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.45), (0, 0.0, 4.55, -0.45)
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.35), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.35), (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.35), (0, 0.0, 4.55, -0.35), (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.35), (0, 0.0, 4.75, -0.35)
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.25), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.25), (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.25), (0, 0.0, 4.55, -0.25), (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.25), (0, 0.0, 4.75, -0.25)
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.15), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.15), (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.15), (0, 0.0, 4.55, -0.15), (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.15), (0, 0.0, 4.75, -0.15)
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.05), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.05)
           
           Each of these object ID 5 placements occupies an AABB of approximately 0.07x0.07 centered at the given (x,y).
           I need to avoid placing object ID 10 in a way that its 0.099x0.099 AABB overlaps with any of these 0.07x0.07 AABBs.
           
           Given the density of object ID 5 placements, especially in the bottom and middle rows, finding clear spaces for object ID 10 will be challenging. For example, if an ID 5 object is at (4.25, -0.55), it occupies x from 4.215 to 4.285 and y from -0.585 to -0.515. If an ID 10 object is centered at (x,y), it occupies x from x-0.0495 to x+0.0495 and y from y-0.0495 to y+0.0495.
           To avoid collision, the distance between centers of object 5 and object 10 must be greater than (size5_x/2 + size10_x/2) in x and (size5_y/2 + size10_y/2) in y.
           (0.07/2 + 0.099/2) = (0.035 + 0.0495) = 0.0845
           So, if an object 5 is at (4.25, -0.55), then object 10 cannot be centered at (x_10, y_10) where |x_10 - 4.25| < 0.0845 and |y_10 - (-0.55)| < 0.0845.
           
           Many of the previously successful placements for object ID 5 are close together. For instance, (4.25, -0.55) and (4.35, -0.55) are only 0.1 units apart in x.
           If object 10 is centered at (4.30, -0.55), it would span x from 4.2505 to 4.3495 and y from -0.5995 to -0.5005.
           Object 5 at (4.25, -0.55) spans x from 4.215 to 4.285. This overlaps.
           Object 5 at (4.35, -0.55) spans x from 4.315 to 4.385. This also overlaps.
           So, any "gap" between object 5 placements (like between 4.25 and 4.35 in x) is too small for object 10.
           
           It looks like the top row of object 5 placements is:
           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.05), (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.05)
           This means y from -0.085 to -0.015 for these objects.
           Object 10 needs y_center <= -0.0495.
           Perhaps I can place object 10 above these, but the surface y_upper_bound is 0.0.
           The only space left for object 10 seems to be in the corners or edges not heavily covered by ID 5, or if there's a larger gap in the Y direction.
           Let's check the y-coordinates. The rows are at -0.55, -0.45, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15, -0.05.
           The distance between y-centers is 0.1.
           For an ID 5 at y=-0.55, its AABB is y from -0.585 to -0.515.
           For an ID 5 at y=-0.45, its AABB is y from -0.485 to -0.415.
           If I try to place an ID 10 object with y_center = -0.50, its AABB would be from -0.5495 to -0.4505. This would collide with both the -0.55 row and the -0.45 row of object 5.
           This means that placing object 10 in between existing rows is not possible due to its larger size.
           
           This implies that object 10 must be placed in a region not covered by object 5 placements, or in a "gap" that is sufficiently large.
           Let's re-examine the successful ID 5 placements. They are a dense grid covering most of the surface.
           The only areas not covered by ID 5 are:
           1. The rightmost edge (x > 4.55 for the top two rows, x > 4.75 elsewhere)
           2. The topmost edge (y > -0.05 for x > 4.35)
           3. The very corners not covered.
           
           Let's try to place an object 10 in the top-right corner.
           Available x range for ID 10: 4.2495 to 4.7505
           Available y range for ID 10: -0.5505 to -0.0495
           
           Consider the top-right corner, where ID 5 objects are less dense:
           (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.05) and (0, 0.0, 4.55, -0.05), (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.05), (0, 0.0, 4.75, -0.05) were *not* listed as successful. Only (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.05) and (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.05) were successful for the y=-0.05 row.
           This means the region with x > 4.35 and y between -0.085 and -0.015 is *free* of ID 5 objects.
           This implies there's a large open area in the top-right section of the surface.
           
           Let's try to place object 10 there.
           For object 10 (size 0.099), x_center_max = 4.7505, y_center_max = -0.0495.
           A placement like (0, 0.0, 4.70, -0.07) seems viable.
           Check for collisions with (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.05) and (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.05).
           Object 10 at (4.70, -0.07) spans x: 4.6505 to 4.7495, y: -0.1195 to -0.0205.
           Object 5 at (4.35, -0.05) spans x: 4.315 to 4.385, y: -0.085 to -0.015.
           No x overlap (4.70 vs 4.35). So this placement should be valid.
           
           I will populate the top-right region which appears to be free of ID 5 objects.
           x_start = 4.2 + 0.099/2 = 4.2495
           x_end = 4.8 - 0.099/2 = 4.7505
           y_start = -0.6 + 0.099/2 = -0.5505
           y_end = 0.0 - 0.099/2 = -0.0495
           
           Since the successful object 5 placements only go up to y = -0.05 and x = 4.35 in the top-most region, there's a big empty space for x from 4.35 to 4.8 and y from -0.0495 (top edge of surface) down to perhaps -0.15 (bottom edge of the second-to-top row of object 5s).
           Let's try filling the region x from 4.40 to 4.70, y from -0.10 to -0.07.
           
           The list of *successful* object 5 placements are:
           - Row at y=-0.55: (4.25, -0.55) through (4.75, -0.55) (all listed, 6 items)
           - Row at y=-0.45: (4.25, -0.45) through (4.55, -0.45) (4 items)
           - Row at y=-0.35: (4.25, -0.35) through (4.75, -0.35) (all listed, 6 items)
           - Row at y=-0.25: (4.25, -0.25) through (4.75, -0.25) (all listed, 6 items)
           - Row at y=-0.15: (4.25, -0.15) through (4.75, -0.15) (all listed, 6 items)
           - Row at y=-0.05: (4.25, -0.05), (4.35, -0.05) (2 items)
           
           So the unoccupied areas for ID 5 were:
           - x in [4.65, 4.8] for y in [-0.485, -0.415] (around y=-0.45)
           - x in [4.415, 4.8] for y in [-0.085, -0.015] (around y=-0.05)
           
           Let's target the top right area: x in [4.4, 4.75], y in [-0.1, -0.05] for object 10.
           This translates to x_center in [4.4+0.0495, 4.75-0.0495] = [4.4495, 4.7005]
           And y_center in [-0.1+0.0495, -0.05-0.0495] = [-0.0505, -0.0995]... wait, y-values are inverted here.
           y_center range: [-0.6 + 0.0495, 0.0 - 0.0495] = [-0.5505, -0.0495].
           The empty region for object ID 5 was for x > 4.35 and y_center=-0.05. This corresponds to y range [-0.085, -0.015].
           So, object 10 can fit in the top right region.
           Let's pick (4.50, -0.07) for object 10.
           This implies AABB for object 10: x [4.4505, 4.5495], y [-0.1195, -0.0205].
           Object 5 at (4.35, -0.05) has x [4.315, 4.385], y [-0.085, -0.015].
           These overlap in x, and also overlap in y. This is a collision. My reasoning about the "free" space was flawed by not considering the extent of object 5.
           
           The actual free spaces for ID 10 must be clear of the *extents* of ID 5 objects.
           Each ID 5 object (center x_c, y_c) covers:
           x_c - 0.035 to x_c + 0.035
           y_c - 0.035 to y_c + 0.035
           
           Consider the space from 4.2 to 4.8 in x, and -0.6 to 0.0 in y.
           The ID 5 objects form a dense grid.
           The 'leftmost' successful placements for ID 5 are at x=4.25.
           The 'rightmost' successful placements for ID 5 are at x=4.75, for all rows except y=-0.45 and y=-0.05.
           The 'bottommost' successful placements for ID 5 are at y=-0.55.
           The 'topmost' successful placements for ID 5 are at y=-0.05 (specifically at x=4.25 and x=4.35).
           
           So, the region x in [4.215, 4.785] and y in [-0.585, -0.015] is largely occupied by ID 5 objects.
           The remaining space is very narrow.
           Let's try to place ID 10 in the small gaps or corners.
           For example, the gap between the top-rightmost ID 5 at (4.35, -0.05) and the right edge of the surface at x=4.8.
           The ID 5 at (4.35, -0.05) covers x_range [4.315, 4.385].
           The object 10 needs x_min = x_center - 0.0495 and x_max = x_center + 0.0495.
           If object 10 is to the right of (4.35, -0.05) without collision, its x_min must be >= 4.385.
           So, x_center - 0.0495 >= 4.385 => x_center >= 4.4345.
           The surface's max x_center is 4.7505.
           So, x_center for ID 10 can be in [4.4345, 4.7505].
           
           Now consider the y-dimension. The ID 5 at (4.35, -0.05) covers y_range [-0.085, -0.015].
           The object 10 needs y_min = y_center - 0.0495 and y_max = y_center + 0.0495.
           If object 10 is to be placed above this ID 5, then y_center - 0.0495 >= -0.015 => y_center >= 0.0345. But the surface ends at y=0.0 (max y_center = -0.0495). So, no space above.
           If object 10 is to be placed below this ID 5, then y_center + 0.0495 <= -0.085 => y_center <= -0.1345.
           The next row of ID 5 is at y=-0.15, covering y_range [-0.185, -0.115].
           So, if y_center for ID 10 is -0.1345, its y_max is -0.085. This still overlaps with the y=-0.05 row.
           No, that's not right. If y_center = -0.1345, y_max = -0.1345 + 0.0495 = -0.085. And y_min = -0.1345 - 0.0495 = -0.184.
           This means its top edge is at -0.085, which just touches the bottom edge of the y=-0.05 row.
           Its bottom edge is -0.184, which would overlap with the y=-0.15 row (y from -0.185 to -0.115).
           So, placing object 10 *between* rows of object 5 is extremely difficult or impossible due to its size.
           This implies I should look for regions *outside* the entire block of ID 5 objects.
           
           The overall occupied area by ID 5 objects is roughly:
           x_min = 4.25 - 0.035 = 4.215
           x_max = 4.75 + 0.035 = 4.785
           y_min = -0.55 - 0.035 = -0.585
           y_max = -0.05 + 0.035 = -0.015
           
           Surface 0 bounds: x in [4.2, 4.8], y in [-0.6, 0.0].
           Object 10 bounds (for center): x in [4.2495, 4.7505], y in [-0.5505, -0.0495].
           
           Areas not covered by ID 5:
           - x < 4.215: Left edge. For ID 10, x_center < 4.215 + 0.0495 = 4.2645. But ID 10 x_center must be >= 4.2495. So, a tiny sliver of x from 4.2495 to 4.2645 is available on the left.
           - x > 4.785: Right edge. For ID 10, x_center > 4.785 - 0.0495 = 4.7355. But ID 10 x_center must be <= 4.7505. So, a tiny sliver of x from 4.7355 to 4.7505 is available on the right.
           - y < -0.585: Bottom edge. For ID 10, y_center < -0.585 + 0.0495 = -0.5355. But ID 10 y_center must be >= -0.5505. So, a tiny sliver of y from -0.5505 to -0.5355 is available on the bottom.
           - y > -0.015: Top edge. For ID 10, y_center > -0.015 - 0.0495 = -0.0645. But ID 10 y_center must be <= -0.0495. So, a tiny sliver of y from -0.0645 to -0.0495 is available on the top.
           
           It appears there are very small regions along the outer perimeter of the ID 5 block that are available.
           Let's try to place an object 10 in the very top-left corner, just outside the ID 5 cluster.
           The ID 5 at (4.25, -0.05) covers x from 4.215 to 4.285 and y from -0.085 to -0.015.
           Object 10 (ID 10) must not overlap.
           Let's try x_center = 4.2495 (leftmost possible).
           y_center for ID 10 must be outside [-0.085, -0.015].
           If y_center = -0.0495 (topmost possible), then ID 10 spans y from -0.099 to 0.0. This *would* collide with the ID 5 at (4.25, -0.05) in y.
           
           Let's carefully check the successful placements again:
           y=-0.05 row: (4.25, -0.05), (4.35, -0.05). Extents are:
           (4.25, -0.05): x [4.215, 4.285], y [-0.085, -0.015]
           (4.35, -0.05): x [4.315, 4.385], y [-0.085, -0.015]
           
           This means the region x in [4.385, 4.8] and y in [-0.085, -0.015] (where the y center for ID 5 would have been -0.05) is *free* of ID 5 objects.
           This implies x_center for ID 10 must be in [4.385 + 0.0495, 4.8 - 0.0495] = [4.4345, 4.7505].
           And y_center for ID 10 must be in [-0.0495, -0.0495] (given that the y range for ID 5 was [-0.085, -0.015], object 10 needs to be outside this range vertically, but still within surface bounds).
           This means that placing object 10 above y=-0.015 is impossible (since max y_center for ID 10 is -0.0495).
           Placing object 10 below y=-0.085 is an option. If y_center for ID 10 is -0.0495 (topmost position), its AABB is y from -0.099 to 0.0.
           This would collide with the y-extent of ID 5 from [-0.085, -0.015].
           
           So, the only way is to ensure that the x-range of object 10 does not overlap with any of the x-ranges of object 5, *or* its y-range does not overlap with any of the y-ranges of object 5.
           Given the density of object 5, it means I need to find coordinates where *neither* x nor y range for object 10 overlaps with *any* object 5.
           This means placing it where there are no object 5s at all.
           
           Let's simplify.
           Surface is (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).
           Object 10 is (0.099, 0.099). Its center must be in [4.2495, 4.7505] x [-0.5505, -0.0495].
           
           Known occupied areas (approximate centers of ID 5 objects, with 0.07 extent):
           y=-0.55: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75
           y=-0.45: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55
           y=-0.35: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75
           y=-0.25: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75
           y=-0.15: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75
           y=-0.05: x=4.25, 4.35
           
           Let's try to target the gaps.
           Consider the top-right part of the surface where there are no ID 5 objects.
           The highest placed ID 5 objects are at y_center -0.05, covering y from -0.085 to -0.015.
           The rightmost of these are at x_center 4.35, covering x from 4.315 to 4.385.
           So, any x_center for ID 10 > 4.385 (its left edge must be > 4.385) and y_center for ID 10 < -0.085 (its top edge must be < -0.085).
           This means x_center > 4.385 + 0.0495 = 4.4345.
           And y_center < -0.085 - 0.0495 = -0.1345.
           So, possible x_center range for ID 10: [4.4345, 4.7505].
           And possible y_center range for ID 10: [-0.5505, -0.1345].
           
           This region is largely covered by other ID 5 objects!
           For example, the row at y=-0.15 has objects from x=4.25 to x=4.75.
           If y_center for ID 10 is -0.1345, its y extent is [-0.184, -0.085].
           This would collide with the y=-0.15 row (y from -0.185 to -0.115). Specifically, the bottom of ID 10 (-0.184) overlaps with the top of ID 5 at -0.185, which is barely okay. But the top of ID 10 (-0.085) overlaps with the top of ID 5 at -0.115, it's above.
           The region between y=-0.15 and y=-0.05 is exactly y in [-0.115, -0.085] based on ID 5 extents.
           Object 10 with y_center=-0.099 fits this gap with y-extent [-0.1485, -0.0495]. This is too tall and overlaps with both.
           
           The only remaining "free" areas for the *entire* object 10 would be:
           1. The thin strip at the very bottom of the surface (y < -0.585 for object 5).
              y_center_10 from -0.6 + 0.0495 = -0.5505 to -0.585 + 0.0495 = -0.5355.
              x_center_10 from 4.2495 to 4.7505.
              This range for y is very small: [-0.5505, -0.5355].
              I can place them along this line.
           2. The thin strip at the very top of the surface (y > -0.015 for object 5).
              y_center_10 from -0.015 - 0.0495 = -0.0645 to 0.0 - 0.0495 = -0.0495.
              This range for y is very small: [-0.0645, -0.0495].
              However, the ID 5 objects at y=-0.05 already cover y to -0.015 (top edge), so if I place ID 10 with its bottom edge at -0.015, its center would be -0.015 + 0.0495 = 0.0345, which is outside the surface.
              This means the topmost edge (y=-0.0495) for ID 10 will collide with ID 5 at y=-0.05.
              This implies that area is only free if I avoid the x ranges covered by ID 5 (4.215 to 4.385).
              So for x_center > 4.385 + 0.0495 = 4.4345 and y_center in [-0.0645, -0.0495], this should be free.
           
           Let's try strategy 1: bottom strip.
           y_center for ID 10: -0.54. This covers y from -0.5895 to -0.4905.
           This range for y (-0.5895 to -0.4905) includes the bottom ID 5 objects (y from -0.585 to -0.515).
           So, even the bottom edge is hard due to the object's height.
           
           It seems the ID 5 objects are so densely packed that it's extremely difficult for a larger object (ID 10) to find a space without overlap.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision condition.
           AABB1: (x1_min, y1_min, x1_max, y1_max)
           AABB2: (x2_min, y2_min, x2_max, y2_max)
           Collision if: (x1_min < x2_max and x1_max > x2_min) AND (y1_min < y2_max and y1_max > y2_min)
           
           Object 5 AABB (center x_c, y_c, size 0.07):
           x_min = x_c - 0.035, x_max = x_c + 0.035
           y_min = y_c - 0.035, y_max = y_c + 0.035
           
           Object 10 AABB (center x, y, size 0.099):
           X_min = x - 0.0495, X_max = x + 0.0495
           Y_min = y - 0.0495, Y_max = y + 0.0495
           
           Let's place Object 10 far right and slightly above the top-rightmost ID 5.
           The rightmost ID 5 objects are at x=4.75 for y=-0.55, -0.35, -0.25, -0.15.
           Let's use the object 5 at (4.75, -0.15). Its AABB is x [4.715, 4.785], y [-0.185, -0.115].
           Let's try to place object 10 at (4.75, -0.07).
           Object 10 AABB: x [4.7005, 4.7995], y [-0.1195, -0.0205].
           This collides with the ID 5 (4.75, -0.15) in x-range (both x-ranges overlap heavily) and in y-range (ID 10's bottom edge -0.1195 overlaps with ID 5's top edge -0.115).
           
           Given the previous successes, I must use those as fixed obstacles. The space is indeed very constrained.
           The available space on surface 0 for object 10 (size 0.099x0.099) must be completely clear of any previously placed ID 5 objects (size 0.07x0.07).
           
           Let's reconsider the top-right corner.
           The topmost ID 5 objects are (4.25, -0.05) and (4.35, -0.05).
           Their combined X range is [4.215, 4.385].
           Their Y range is [-0.085, -0.015].
           
           So, the region for ID 10 to be placed *above* this:
           Y_min for ID 10 must be > -0.015.
           Y_min = y_center - 0.0495 > -0.015 => y_center > 0.0345.
           But max y_center for ID 10 is -0.0495. This means no space above the topmost ID 5 objects.
           
           The region for ID 10 to be placed *to the right* of the rightmost of these (4.35, -0.05):
           X_min for ID 10 must be > 4.385.
           X_min = x_center - 0.0495 > 4.385 => x_center > 4.4345.
           So, the x-range for ID 10 can be from x_center in [4.4345, 4.7505].
           For this x-range, the y-range must be clear of *other* ID 5 objects.
           The y=-0.15 row has objects up to x=4.75.
           If I pick x_center = 4.45 and y_center = -0.0495.
           ID 10 AABB: x [4.4005, 4.4995], y [-0.099, 0.0].
           This x range [4.4005, 4.4995] is within the acceptable x range (4.4345, 4.7505), as x_center is 4.45 > 4.4345. So x-wise, it won't collide with (4.35, -0.05).
           Now, check y. ID 10 y range is [-0.099, 0.0].
           The ID 5 at (4.25, -0.05) has y range [-0.085, -0.015].
           These y ranges overlap. So this placement (4.45, -0.0495) collides.
           
           This is very tricky. It seems there is literally no available space for ID 10.
           Wait, I must have made a mistake in calculating the available region from the list of successes.
           Let me list the entire occupied space by ID 5, as a union of AABBs.
           ID 5 dimensions: dx=0.07, dy=0.07. Half-extents: hx=0.035, hy=0.035.
           Object 10 dimensions: DX=0.099, DY=0.099. Half-extents: HX=0.0495, HY=0.0495.
           
           The union of all ID 5 successful placements will define the "no-go" zone for object 10.
           The most 'open' region seems to be in the upper right.
           The ID 5 objects in the y=-0.05 row are: (4.25, -0.05) and (4.35, -0.05).
           Their AABBs are:
           O5_1: x in [4.215, 4.285], y in [-0.085, -0.015]
           O5_2: x in [4.315, 4.385], y in [-0.085, -0.015]
           
           This means the x region [4.385, 4.8] combined with y region [-0.085, -0.015] (where ID 5 objects are absent) is not necessarily free.
           The surface for ID 10 is: x_center in [4.2495, 4.7505], y_center in [-0.5505, -0.0495].
           
           Let's try to place ID 10 where no ID 5 is present.
           The successful placements for ID 5 were:
           y=-0.05: (4.25, -0.05), (4.35, -0.05). So x-centers 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75 are free in this y-row.
           y=-0.45: (4.25, -0.45), (4.35, -0.45), (4.45, -0.45), (4.55, -0.45). So x-centers 4.65, 4.75 are free in this y-row.
           
           Let's try (x_center, y_center) for object 10.
           Target the spot at x=4.70, y=-0.07.
           Obj 10 AABB: x in [4.6505, 4.7495], y in [-0.1195, -0.0205].
           Check for collision with *all* successful ID 5 placements.
           The only ID 5s that could potentially overlap with this are from the y=-0.15 row, or the y=-0.05 row.
           Y=-0.05 row ID 5s (4.25, -0.05) and (4.35, -0.05).
             O5_1 x [4.215, 4.285], y [-0.085, -0.015]
             O5_2 x [4.315, 4.385], y [-0.085, -0.015]
           Our Obj 10: x [4.6505, 4.7495], y [-0.1195, -0.0205].
           No collision with these two. X-ranges don't overlap, Y-ranges don't overlap (for O5_1.y_max = -0.015 and O10.y_min = -0.1195).
           
           Y=-0.15 row ID 5s (all listed as successes): (4.25, -0.15) through (4.75, -0.15).
           Let's check the one closest to Obj 10: (4.75, -0.15).
           O5_3: x [4.715, 4.785], y [-0.185, -0.115].
           Obj 10: x [4.6505, 4.7495], y [-0.1195, -0.0205].
           Collision check:
           X-overlap: O10.x_max (4.7495) > O5_3.x_min (4.715). O10.x_min (4.6505) < O5_3.x_max (4.785). So X-overlap exists.
           Y-overlap: O10.y_max (-0.0205) > O5_3.y_min (-0.185). O10.y_min (-0.1195) < O5_3.y_max (-0.115). So Y-overlap exists.
           Collision. This placement is invalid.
           
           I must target empty cells, not just "visually empty" cells.
           The problem is that the previously successful placements for object 5 are a nearly complete grid. The spacing between the centers of object 5 is 0.1, and the object 5 size is 0.07. So, an object 5 at (x,y) covers [x-0.035, x+0.035]. Two adjacent objects at x and x+0.1 leaves a gap of 0.1 - 2*0.035 = 0.03. Object 10 is 0.099 wide, so it cannot fit in these 0.03 gaps.
           This means that object 10 *must* be placed in a region where there are *no* object 5 placements, not even adjacent ones.
           
           The only places where ID 5 placements are missing are:
           - For y=-0.45 row: x=4.65, 4.75 are missing.
             Specifically, x in [4.585, 4.785] (to the right of (4.55, -0.45)) in the y=-0.45 lane.
             And x in [4.385, 4.715] (between (4.35, -0.05) and (4.75, -0.15) etc.) in the y=-0.05 lane.
           This is where I need to look.
           
           Let's carefully examine the missing squares for ID 5.
           Missing in y=-0.45 row: (4.65, -0.45) and (4.75, -0.45).
           This means the area x in [4.585, 4.715] for y in [-0.485, -0.415] (from the right edge of (4.55, -0.45) to the left edge of (4.75, -0.45) if it were there) is *not* occupied by an ID 5.
           Let's choose (4.65, -0.45) for ID 10.
           Obj 10 AABB: x [4.6005, 4.6995], y [-0.4995, -0.4005].
           Check collisions with adjacent ID 5 objects:
           - (4.55, -0.45): x [4.515, 4.585], y [-0.485, -0.415].
             Collision in x? O10.x_min (4.6005) > O5.x_max (4.585). No x collision.
             Collision in y? O10.y_max (-0.4005) > O5.y_min (-0.485) and O10.y_min (-0.4995) < O5.y_max (-0.415). Yes, y collision.
             This means the gap of 0.03 is too small.
           
           The only way for object 10 to fit is if there's a larger "hole" or region at the very edge of the surface, not touching any existing object 5, or if I rotate it to make it fit a non-axis-aligned gap (which is not handled by this AABB-based reasoning for stability, but could be a strategy for avoiding collision). However, for stability, the AABB must fit the surface, and I'm asked for stable placements. The AABB of a square rotated by 45 degrees is larger. My current approach assumes theta 0 or pi/2 for AABB, effectively using the larger of size_x, size_y. Since it's a square, its AABB is always 0.099x0.099.
           
           I need to find a space such that the object 10 AABB (0.099x0.099) does not overlap any of the 0.07x0.07 AABBs of the ID 5 objects.
           This implies for any ID 5 at (x_i, y_i), for a potential ID 10 at (X, Y):
           abs(X - x_i) >= (0.07 + 0.099)/2 = 0.0845 OR abs(Y - y_i) >= (0.07 + 0.099)/2 = 0.0845.
           
           Let's systematically try the corners and edges.
           Top right corner of the surface:
           Candidate ID 10 center (X, Y) close to (4.7505, -0.0495).
           The ID 5 placements in the top-right vicinity are:
           - (4.55, -0.45) -> x [4.515, 4.585], y [-0.485, -0.415]
           - (4.25, -0.05) -> x [4.215, 4.285], y [-0.085, -0.015]
           - (4.35, -0.05) -> x [4.315, 4.385], y [-0.085, -0.015]
           - No ID 5 for x in [4.65, 4.75] and y in [-0.485, -0.415]
           - No ID 5 for x in [4.45, 4.75] and y in [-0.085, -0.015]
           
           This last point is crucial! The region in the x-range [4.45 - 0.035, 4.75 + 0.035] = [4.415, 4.785] for y in [-0.085, -0.015] is currently *empty* of ID 5 objects.
           Can ID 10 fit in this *empty rectangle*?
           The empty rectangle is X_empty from 4.415 to 4.785, Y_empty from -0.085 to -0.015.
           Dimensions of this empty rectangle: width = 4.785 - 4.415 = 0.37. Height = -0.015 - (-0.085) = 0.07.
           Object 10 is 0.099 x 0.099.
           It cannot fit height-wise (0.099 > 0.07).
           
           This is a very difficult problem because the previous successful placements completely tile the area such that a slightly larger object cannot fit. It must mean there's a small region *outside* the convex hull of the ID 5 objects, or something else.
           My assumption that "successes are now fixed obstacles" must be used carefully. A placement for object X could be stable on its own, but then collide with object Y.
           
           Let's assume there *must* be a solution. The only way is to find a coordinate for object 10 that is completely outside any of the *extents* of the ID 5 successful placements.
           The union of ID 5 AABBs covers:
           x in [4.215, 4.785]
           y in [-0.585, -0.015]
           The surface is x in [4.2, 4.8], y in [-0.6, 0.0].
           
           Available region for object 10 (AABB for its center):
           x_center in [4.2495, 4.7505]
           y_center in [-0.5505, -0.0495]
           
           Let's test edge cases.
           A. Place ID 10 in the extreme bottom-left corner.
           x_center = 4.2495, y_center = -0.5505.
           Obj 10 AABB: x [4.2, 4.299], y [-0.6, -0.501].
           Check collision with ID 5 at (4.25, -0.55).
           ID 5 AABB: x [4.215, 4.285], y [-0.585, -0.515].
           Collision: x_overlap ([4.2, 4.299] and [4.215, 4.285] overlap). y_overlap ([-0.6, -0.501] and [-0.585, -0.515] overlap).
           This collides.
           
           B. Place ID 10 in the extreme top-right corner.
           x_center = 4.7505, y_center = -0.0495.
           Obj 10 AABB: x [4.701, 4.8], y [-0.099, 0.0].
           Check collision with ID 5 at (4.75, -0.15) (from the previous list of successes, it was a success).
           ID 5 AABB (4.75, -0.15): x [4.715, 4.785], y [-0.185, -0.115].
           Collision: x_overlap ([4.701, 4.8] and [4.715, 4.785] overlap). y_overlap ([-0.099, 0.0] and [-0.185, -0.115] do not overlap).
           No y-overlap. Y_max of Obj 10 is 0.0, Y_min of Obj 5 is -0.185. Y_min of Obj 10 is -0.099, Y_max of Obj 5 is -0.115. These ranges do not overlap.
           So, this placement (4.7505, -0.0495) for Object 10 is valid!
           
           This is a good candidate. I can fill placements around this region.
           The key insight was that ID 5 objects are mostly below y = -0.115 in the very rightmost column.
           The ID 5 at (4.75, -0.15) has y_max = -0.115.
           My object 10 at (4.7505, -0.0495) has y_min = -0.099.
           Since -0.099 > -0.115, there is no overlap in y-dimension.
           And x_center = 4.7505, for Object 10: x_min = 4.701, x_max = 4.8.
           For Object 5 (4.75, -0.15): x_min = 4.715, x_max = 4.785.
           Overlap in x: 4.715 to 4.785 (from Object 5) and 4.701 to 4.8 (from Object 10). They clearly overlap.
           But if there is no overlap in one dimension, then there is no collision.
           
           So, (0, 4.7505, -0.0495) is a valid placement candidate.
           I will generate placements near this valid one.
           
           Let's double-check the successful ID 5 placements again from previous feedback, carefully.
           Previous response said:
           `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.55` ... `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.05`
           This list has 30 items.
           The full list of successful ID 5 placements:
           y=-0.55: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75 (6)
           y=-0.45: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55 (4)
           y=-0.35: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75 (6)
           y=-0.25: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75 (6)
           y=-0.15: x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55, 4.65, 4.75 (6)
           y=-0.05: x=4.25, 4.35 (2)
           
           Okay, my previous list of ID 5 objects was missing some.
           Specifically, for y=-0.15, all x positions from 4.25 to 4.75 are occupied.
           So, the ID 5 at (4.75, -0.15) *is* present.
           Object 10 at (4.7505, -0.0495) AABB: x [4.701, 4.8], y [-0.099, 0.0].
           Object 5 at (4.75, -0.15) AABB: x [4.715, 4.785], y [-0.185, -0.115].
           Check for collision:
           X-axis: max(4.701, 4.715) = 4.715. min(4.8, 4.785) = 4.785. Intersection [4.715, 4.785]. Overlap.
           Y-axis: max(-0.099, -0.185) = -0.099. min(0.0, -0.115) = -0.115. Intersection [-0.099, -0.115]. This is empty, since -0.099 is greater than -0.115. No overlap in Y.
           Therefore, *no collision*. This is indeed a valid placement.
           
           Now I need to generate 50 such placements. I will generate them in the area around this point.
           The valid y range for ID 10 is [-0.5505, -0.0495].
           The valid x range for ID 10 is [4.2495, 4.7505].
           
           Let's try to fill the region at the top-right which has some gaps in ID 5.
           ID 5 at y=-0.05 has only x=4.25, 4.35.
           ID 5 at y=-0.15 has all x=4.25 ... 4.75.
           ID 5 at y=-0.25 has all x=4.25 ... 4.75.
           ID 5 at y=-0.35 has all x=4.25 ... 4.75.
           ID 5 at y=-0.45 has only x=4.25, 4.35, 4.45, 4.55.
           ID 5 at y=-0.55 has all x=4.25 ... 4.75.
           
           This means the regions that are "open" in the ID 5 grid are:
           - (x,y) around (4.65, -0.45) and (4.75, -0.45), which were missing for y=-0.45 row.
           - (x,y) around (4.45, -0.05), (4.55, -0.05), (4.65, -0.05), (4.75, -0.05), which were missing for y=-0.05 row.
           
           Let's try the top-right corner region more densely.
           x_center from 4.4345 to 4.7505.
           y_center from -0.0495 (top edge) down to where it touches the y=-0.15 row.
           The y=-0.15 row objects have y_min = -0.185, y_max = -0.115.
           So, if ID 10 has y_center, its y_min and y_max must not overlap with [-0.185, -0.115].
           If Y_min for ID 10 is -0.115, its center is -0.115 + 0.0495 = -0.0655.
           So, y_center in [-0.0655, -0.0495] is possible without colliding vertically with the y=-0.15 row.
           
           Let's choose y_center = -0.06 (within [-0.0655, -0.0495]).
           And x_center in [4.4345, 4.7505].
           Let's try x_center = 4.45.
           Placement (0, 0.0, 4.45, -0.06).
           Obj 10 AABB: x [4.4005, 4.4995], y [-0.1095, -0.0105].
           Check collision with ID 5 at (4.35, -0.05).
           O5_2: x [4.315, 4.385], y [-0.085, -0.015].
           X-overlap: O10.x_min (4.4005) > O5_2.x_max (4.385). No X-overlap. This is valid!
           This is a clear space! I found it!
           
           Okay, so I can fill the region:
           x_center from 4.45 to 4.75 (in increments, ensure no X overlap with O5s at y=-0.15)
           y_center from -0.06 down to say -0.08 (as long as it doesn't overlap with y=-0.15 row).
           y_center=-0.08. Obj 10 AABB: y [-0.1295, -0.0305]. This still doesn't overlap the y=-0.15 row.
           Let's use y_center = -0.06.
           Possible x_centers for object 10 to avoid x-collision with objects at y=-0.15:
           The y=-0.15 row has objects at x=4.25, ..., 4.75.
           So for any x_center_10, its X-interval [x_center_10-0.0495, x_center_10+0.0495] must not overlap with [x_center_5-0.035, x_center_5+0.035] for any x_center_5 in {4.25, ..., 4.75}.
           Given the density, this means x_center_10 must be very close to the edge.
           
           My prior reasoning for (4.7505, -0.0495) was based on Y-non-overlap with (4.75, -0.15).
           And for (4.45, -0.06) it was based on X-non-overlap with (4.35, -0.05).
           This is the approach: identify specific x and y ranges where one dimension (x or y) guarantees no collision, then iterate the other dimension.
           
           Strategy:
           1. Place objects in the top row, just outside the y-extent of the y=-0.05 row.
              Y_min for ID 10 must be > -0.015 (top edge of ID 5 at y=-0.05).
              Y_min = y_center - 0.0495 > -0.015 => y_center > 0.0345. Not possible.
           
           This means all the previous objects (ID 5) make it impossible for object 10 to be fully contained in the region.
           Perhaps a slight rotation of the object 10 AABB. But the problem states AABB, so rotation does not change the effective footprint unless it's a slender object. This is a square object.
           
           This implies there might be no valid placement. But I never give up. There must be one.
           The only scenario where the object is stable is if it's completely inside the surface *and* does not collide with the previous obstacles.
           Is it possible that *some* of the previous successes for ID 5 were actually not successful due to collision with another hidden obstacle, but the feedback just said it didn't collide with *fixed* obstacles? "The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles."
           This implies that these are indeed fixed obstacles now.
           
           Let me try coordinates extremely close to the edge of the surface, in the gap regions.
           The rightmost gap between a successful ID 5 and the surface edge:
           The last successful ID 5 at (4.75, -0.15) occupies x range [4.715, 4.785].
           The surface max x is 4.8.
           The object 10 needs x_max <= 4.8, so x_center <= 4.7505.
           For no collision with (4.75, -0.15), ID 10's X_min must be >= 4.785.
           So, x_center - 0.0495 >= 4.785 => x_center >= 4.8345. This is beyond 4.7505, so no full X-separation is possible on the right.
           
           This means I must rely on Y-separation only.
           As established, (4.7505, -0.0495) for object 10 and (4.75, -0.15) for object 5 don't collide in Y.
           So (4.7505, -0.0495) is a valid candidate for ID 10.
           Let's try to find more near it.
           x_center must be 4.7505 (to get max x_max = 4.8).
           What about y_center?
           Let's try y_center = -0.05. AABB: x [4.701, 4.8], y [-0.0995, 0.0005].
           This is within surface bounds.
           It does not collide with (4.75, -0.15) because of Y-separation.
           
           What about (4.65, -0.05)?
           Obj 10 AABB: x [4.6005, 4.6995], y [-0.0995, 0.0005].
           This collides in Y with all ID 5 objects in y=-0.05 row (4.25, -0.05) and (4.35, -0.05) because for them y is [-0.085, -0.015] and for O10 y is [-0.0995, 0.0005]. The ranges overlap in Y.
           But there is X separation!
           O10 x: [4.6005, 4.6995].
           O5_1 x: [4.215, 4.285]. No X overlap.
           O5_2 x: [4.315, 4.385]. No X overlap.
           So (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.05) is also a valid placement!
           
           Okay, the strategy is to identify a clear column in X (or row in Y).
           For x_center = 4.65, I need to check against all ID 5 objects.
           O10 at (4.65, -0.05) -> x [4.6005, 4.6995], y [-0.0995, 0.0005].
           Collision check with all 30 ID 5 obstacles.
           Most are far away in X. The ones closest in X are:
           - Any in x=4.65 column: (4.65, -0.55), (4.65, -0.35), (4.65, -0.25), (4.65, -0.15).
             E.g. (4.65, -0.15) has x [4.615, 4.685], y [-0.185, -0.115].
             O10 X-range [4.6005, 4.6995] overlaps with O5 X-range [4.615, 4.685].
             O10 Y-range [-0.0995, 0.0005] does not overlap with O5 Y-range [-0.185, -0.115] (since -0.0995 > -0.115). No collision!
           
           This opens up a lot of placements. I can place object 10 at (4.65, -0.05) to (4.65, -0.55) as long as y doesn't collide.
           Let's pick a fixed x_center for ID 10, say 4.65. Its x-extent is [4.6005, 4.6995].
           Any ID 5 at x=4.65 (e.g., (4.65, -0.15)) will collide in X. So I must rely on Y-separation.
           ID 5 at (4.65, -0.15) has y-extent [-0.185, -0.115].
           ID 5 at (4.65, -0.25) has y-extent [-0.285, -0.215].
           ID 5 at (4.65, -0.35) has y-extent [-0.385, -0.315].
           ID 5 at (4.65, -0.55) has y-extent [-0.585, -0.515].
           
           So, for object 10 at x=4.65, I need to pick y_center such that its y-extent [y_center-0.0495, y_center+0.0495] avoids all these y-extents.
           For example, if y_center = -0.05, its y-extent is [-0.0995, 0.0005]. This does not overlap with any of the [-0.185,-0.115], [-0.285,-0.215], etc.
           So (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.05) is a valid placement.
           
           What other y_centers are available for x=4.65?
           Between y=-0.15 and y=-0.25 rows:
           Top edge of (4.65, -0.25) is -0.215. Bottom edge of (4.65, -0.15) is -0.185.
           So, the gap in y is [-0.215, -0.185]. Size 0.03. Too small for 0.099 height.
           So, I must use y_center where there's no X-overlap or the Y-overlap is none.
           
           I will target the top-right and bottom-right regions, and also the bottom-left.

           (0, 0.0, 4.65, -0.05) # top-right, avoids y-collision with y=-0.15 row, x-collides with x=4.65 column

             Check with (4.65, -0.55): x-overlap, but y[-0.5195, -0.4205] and [-0.585, -0.515] are separated. No Y-overlap. Valid.
             Check with (4.65, -0.35): x-overlap, but y[-0.5195, -0.4205] and [-0.385, -0.315] are separated. No Y-overlap. Valid.

           (0, 0.0, 4.25, -0.57) # bottom-left, avoids y-collision with y=-0.55 row, x-collides with x=4.25 column
             (4.25, -0.57) -> O10: x[4.2005, 4.2995], y[-0.6195, -0.5205]
             Check with (4.25, -0.55): x-overlap, but y[-0.6195, -0.5205] and [-0.585, -0.515] are separated. No Y-overlap. Valid.
           (0, 0.0, 4.30, -0.57)
           (0, 0.0, 4.35, -0.57)
           
           I will fill up 50 of these, varying x and y slightly, and also theta. Since it's a square, theta 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 all have the same AABB. I'll just use a few angles for diversity.
