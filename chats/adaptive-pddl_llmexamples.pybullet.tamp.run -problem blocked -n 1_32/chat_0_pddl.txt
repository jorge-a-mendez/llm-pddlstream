           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, some of which are stackable and graspable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are handempty. The robot is currently at base configuration `v3` and can move. Objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are at specific poses and are supported by other objects. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that is true if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)`. So, the goal reduces to making `on(v12, v18)` true. Since `on(?o, ?r)` is an axiom defined as `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`, we need to place `v12` at a pose `?p` such that `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` is true and `atpose(v12, ?p)` is true.
           
           The available action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` indicates that the robot can stay at its current base configuration. However, there are no pick or place actions available in the provided action instances, which are necessary to change the location of objects. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving `v12` to `v18`.
           
           The given initial state has `type(v12, v17)`. The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. If we substitute `?green` with `v12`, the goal becomes `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Since `type(v12, v17)` is already true, we need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`.
           The `on(?o, ?r)` axiom requires `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           In the initial state, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)` and is `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, we would need to place `v12` on `v18`. This would involve picking up `v12` from its current location `v14` and placing it on `v18` at some pose `?p`. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the provided action instances to manipulate `v12`. The only available action is `move_base`, which does not change the state of objects. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
