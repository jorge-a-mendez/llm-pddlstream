           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.118, -0.52), (0.211, -0.427)).

           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.164, -0.474, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.215, 0.977).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.222, 0.273, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.062, 0.998).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.085, 0.518, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.858, 0.514).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.092, -0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.803, 0.596).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.219, -0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.58, 0.815).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Relocation**
           
           My primary goal is to efficiently move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their initial positions on surface v11 to a new target surface, v20. This requires a carefully coordinated plan using the PR2 robot's arm (v4).
           
           The foundational principle is the 'on' predicate, which necessitates that an object `o` must be 'supported' by a surface `r` and be positioned at a specific 'pose' `p`. The initial configuration dictates that all objects currently rest on v11, supported by their specific initial poses. My objective is to achieve the goal: `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`.
           
           To accomplish this, I must identify a feasible "pose" `p` (I will use `#o2` as a place holder) for each object on the target surface v20 and place them there. Initial conditions hint at each object already having a 'supported' relationship with v20 and some default pose `#o2`. I need to interpret this as a single symbolic pose but give distinct numerical values for each object-target pair, due to "if the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose" rule.
           
           The plan itself will be a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions executed by the robot arm v4. Each action involves picking an object from its initial pose (v9, v13, v15, v17, or v19) and placing it onto the defined target pose on v20. The robot needs to move from it's base at configuration v3 to a configuration `#o3` near the surfaces v11 and v20 to support pick and place operations. All Kinematic predicates `kin` require that all pick and place actions be at bconf `#o3`.
           
           Critical to the plan's success is avoiding collisions. The preconditions for "pick" and "place" must be validated for each action. Preconditions for Pick include robot being at the bconf `#o3` and ensuring that no 'unsafe' motions are planned. "Place" action must also adhere to the same requirements. To avoid unsafepose (avoiding collision), the poses on v20 I select must be distinct. Therefore I must choose `#o2` pose values within the bounds of v20 such that each object has a unique place.
           
           Furthermore, it is necessary to move the robot base from its current position `v3` to a base pose `#o3` from which it can reach both the objects and the target surface. My analysis indicates a base pose of `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` is a sensible, and a low cost starting point for the PR2 arm, with `distance(v3, #o3) = 1.0` will likely be an acceptable cost for the plan execution.
           
           The plan will comprise these steps:
           
           1.  **`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`**: To transition the robot from initial state to base pose `#o3`, this action will incur a cost of 1.0.
           2.  **Iterative Pick and Place**: For each object:
           
               *   **(Pick)** `pick v4 o p_initial #o1 #o3 #o4`: Picking the object from initial pose `p_initial`. Cost 1.
               *   **(Place)** `place v4 o #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`: Placing the object at the defined pose on v20. The key aspect here is the unique parameter value of `#o2` for each object being placed on v20, which has a cost of 1.
           
           The total estimated cost for this approach is 1 (move_base) + 5 (picks) + 5 (places) = 11. Assuming the base pose `#o3` facilitates all pick and place operations.
           The poses on v20 will then be defined (x,y,z, theta) for each pair (#o2, v_object, v20), which satisfies the problem description.
