           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it, breaking down how to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This thing wants me to make sure a whole bunch of conditions are true, specifically a conjunction of several atomic facts. Let's dig in.
           
           The goal hinges on several conditions, but the main pain points are: 1) capturing four images using `receivedimage` predicates, and 2) receiving analysis results for stone and soil, which requires `receivedanalysis`. I've looked at the initial state and, guess what? Neither of those are initially true! So, it's my job to *create* those.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I'll need rovers (`v12`, `v14`) to *take* pictures and then *send* them to some receiving station. The actions I *need* are `take_image` and `send_image`. Now, the preconditions for these actions are the issue. `take_image` requires the rovers to be in the correct *configuration* for imaging (`#o3` according to the *imagevisible* predicates) and I'm guessing that configuration is different from their starting ones (`v13`, `v15`). The `imagevisible` predicates provide the visibility information in this configuration. To actually get the pictures I need those. Then I also need to make sure the images are sent back to the lander.
           
           My plan has a potential hurdle: the given set of actions doesn't contain actions to change the rovers' current configuration. In fact, the only *move* actions are the self-loop ones, which means no rover can move to the imaging position. This is the first roadblock.
           
           Now, if I can’t change their configurations, the goal will be unreachable! I need to take the image, but I can’t because the visibility predicates require a specific configuration, while the initial state and the allowed actions lock the rovers to their initial states. There are simply no actions available to get the rovers into these needed image-taking configurations! The image taking and the analysis receiving actions aren’t even available, so those parts of the goal are absolutely unreachable. It’s a closed system, and the right tools aren't there.
           
           So, in the end, it boils down to this: given the *extremely* limited available actions – only the unhelpful self-loop *move* actions, and an *impossible* *drop_rock* – and with the *absolute* lack of image-taking or image-sending options, I must conclude that `new-axiom@0()` is currently *impossible* to achieve. This is because there are no actions to create the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates required. I'm essentially locked in.
