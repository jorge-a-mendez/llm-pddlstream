(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions (0.0976, 0.0976) on a given surface (Surface 0). Surface 0 is a square region defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Given that the object is square (0.0976 x 0.0976), the rotation angle `theta` does not affect its minimal bounding box (AABB) extents.  Therefore, I'll strategically vary `theta` to create a geometrically diverse set of placements.
           
           First, I calculated the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) on Surface 0 to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface. The half-extents of the square object were calculated to be `0.048808507374627775`. This led to a valid x range of [-0.086191492625372225, 0.086191492625372225] and the same for y.
           
           To achieve 50 placements, I'll generate a grid of 49 points within the valid (x, y) range. The x and y values are evenly spaced along the valid edges. For the grid, I will use steps of `0.028730497541790925` on both x and y. These points are generated using loops over the grid space. I will alternate the rotation between 0 and pi/2 for each alternate position. In addition to this 7x7 grid, I add one additional point at (0.0, 0.0) with an angle of `pi/4`. This point offers an additional placement in the space.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The user wants me to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with object ID 5, which is already placed. I'll need to work with the given surface and object dimensions.
           
           First, I looked at the surface boundaries and the dimensions of both objects.  Object 5 is pretty much tucked in the bottom-left corner of the surface. To avoid collisions, I need to keep object 4 away from that region.
           
           I calculated the valid region for the center of object 4, ensuring it stays on surface 0. Then, I had to figure out how far object 4's center needs to be from object 5 to *avoid* a collision, taking into account the object's size and possible rotations (though, since object 4 is nearly square, it's not a huge factor).
           
           I realized that to avoid a collision, object 4's center needs to be a certain distance away from the edges of object 5. This led me to identify a small "forbidden" zone in the bottom-left corner of surface 0 where the center of object 4 *cannot* be.  
           
           To generate these placements, I'm using a grid-based approach. I'll create a grid of points on the surface, carefully skipping any points that fall within that forbidden zone.  To guarantee diverse rotations, I will incorporate several rotations to generate the final list. I then apply the logic to iterate through and keep placing objects until the requested number of placements is achieved. I will take the first 50 valid placements. I'm being conservative in my calculations to make sure all placements I generate are truly collision-free and stable.

(Thoughts: **My Goal: Find 50 stable placements for Object 6 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with Object 5 and Object 4.**
           
           I started by defining the boundaries. Surface 0 is a square area, and Object 6 is essentially a square of size (0.0715..., 0.0715...). This means its center must lie within the surface's bounds, with a small buffer to ensure the entire object is contained.  The valid x and y range for the object's center without considering other objects are roughly [-0.099, 0.099].
           
           Next, I calculated the collision zones. Object 5 has a bounding box in the bottom-left corner of the surface. Object 4 is in the middle-bottom. I had to create "forbidden zones" within the valid surface range for Object 6's *center* coordinates to prevent collisions. I expanded the bounding boxes of objects 5 and 4 by half of Object 6's maximum dimension to account for its size. This ensured that no part of object 6 would overlap with another object if Object 6's center was in these forbidden zones.
           
           The Forbidden Region 5 (FR5) blocked the bottom left part of the valid area. I calculated that by adding an offset `h6` for Object 6's half size to each side of object 5's bounds. FR4 took up a long horizontal rectangular zone in the bottom of the valid area.
           
           I then generated a grid of potential placement points, and did collision tests with these forbidden regions to prevent collisions. In detail, a 9x9 grid was generated and checked. I added a new placement at 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4. I had to ensure enough placements were found (50, with different rotations). I calculated 56 to verify.
