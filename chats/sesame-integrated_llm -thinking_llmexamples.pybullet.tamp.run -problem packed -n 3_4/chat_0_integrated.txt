           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.282, 0.46), (-0.196, 0.545)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.246, -0.421), (-0.161, -0.336)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.206, -0.182), (0.28, -0.109)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.239, 0.502, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.127, 0.992).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.203, -0.378, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.127, 0.992).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.243, -0.146, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.028).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to place three objects (v8, v12, and v14) onto surface v16. These objects currently reside on surface v11 at the following poses: v8 at v9, v12 at v13, and v14 at v15. The designated target pose for all three objects is #o2 on surface v16.  This task necessitates utilizing the 'pick' and 'place' actions, utilizing arm v4, which is the only arm supported by the given 'kin' actions.
           
           The basic strategy involves the robot picking each object from its initial pose and subsequently placing it at the specified pose #o2 on v16.  Since the 'kin' actions incorporate base configuration #o3, and the initial base position is v3, a preliminary 'move_base' action is required to position the robot correctly.  Given that all three objects must be moved to pose #o2, but the problem's specifications require discrete object poses in a simultaneous placement, I will carefully define unique continuous values for #o2 (symbolic pose) for each object. For clarity, I'm thinking of these as #o2_v8, #o2_v12, and #o2_v14, but the final output will correctly use #o2 and specific object names.
           
           The overall plan structure is:
           1.  Move the robot's base from v3 to base configuration #o3.
           2.  Pick v8 from v9.
           3.  Place v8 at #o2 on v16.
           4.  Pick v12 from v13.
           5.  Place v12 at #o2 on v16.
           6.  Pick v14 from v15.
           7.  Place v14 at #o2 on v16.
           
           For the placements, after a survey of the objects' AABBs and the space available on v16 (which is much smaller than v11 and likely a tray), I've determined it's feasible to place the objects in a row on v16 along the x-axis, using a 0 rotation. The height will be at z=0.781 (the height of objects on table and possibly surface). This yields the following poses for the target objects: #o2_v8 at (-0.0795, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0), #o2_v12 at (0.0005, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0), and #o2_v14 at (0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0), which I am confident meet the criteria for stable and non-colliding placement on v16.  I assume all collisions are accounted for, given the constraints of 'pick' and 'place' and the available grasp information in #o1. The 'move_base' cost is unknown but will have to meet the constraints of the continuous BCONF provided.
