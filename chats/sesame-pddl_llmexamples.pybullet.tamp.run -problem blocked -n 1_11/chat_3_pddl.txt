           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, `v12` and `v15`, which are graspable and stackable. `v12` is currently at `v13` and `v15` is at `v16`. Both are supported by `v14` and `v11` respectively. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom for `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, `type(v12, v17)` is true, meaning `v12` is the `?green` object. Therefore, the goal simplifies to achieving `on(v12, v18)`. `on(v12, v18)` can be achieved if `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true. We have `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, so we need to place `v12` at pose `#o2`. Currently, `v12` is at `v13`.
           
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, we need to move `v12` from its current pose `v13` to `#o2`.
           
           1. **Pick `v12` from `v13`**: Use `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`. This will make the robot hold `v12`.
           2. **Place `v12` at `#o2`**: Use `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. This will place `v12` at `#o2`, satisfying the `atpose(v12, #o2)` condition for `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies, I missed the `atbconf` precondition for the `pick` action. The initial state does not explicitly state `atbconf(#o3)`. However, the `basemotion` axiom `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` implies that the robot can move from `#o3` to `#o3` using trajectory `#o0`. The initial state also has `bconf(#o3)`. I should have used `move_base` to explicitly set `atbconf(#o3)` before attempting to pick.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The initial state has `bconf(#o3)`, but not `atbconf(#o3)`. The `move_base` action `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` can achieve `atbconf(#o3)` as its effect if `atbconf(#o3)` is true initially, which it is not. This seems to be a chicken and egg problem.
           
           Looking at the problem definition, `atbconf(?q: object)` is a predicate for the *current* base configuration. The initial state *should* specify `atbconf` for some base configuration. Since `bconf(#o3)` is given, it's implied that `#o3` is a valid base configuration. However, `atbconf(#o3)` is not asserted.
           
           Let's assume that `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state implicitly means `atbconf(#o3)`. If not, and assuming the `move_base` action *must* be used, then a `move_base` action from `#o3` to `#o3` would require `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition, which would lead to a circular dependency if it's not initially set.
           
           Given `bconf(#o3)` and the available actions, the most direct interpretation is that `#o3` is the current base configuration, and therefore `atbconf(#o3)` should be true. If it's not, the provided problem formulation makes it impossible to satisfy the `pick` or `place` preconditions, as they all depend on `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Let me retry with the assumption that `bconf(#o3)` in the initial state means `atbconf(#o3)` is true, or that a `move_base` from `#o3` to `#o3` implicitly satisfies the precondition for the subsequent actions. However, the error message clearly states that `atbconf(#o3)` is not satisfied.
           
           This indicates that `bconf(#o3)` is just a declaration of a base configuration, not that the robot is currently *at* that configuration. The initial state does not contain any `atbconf` facts. This is a critical missing piece of information. If the robot is not at any base configuration, and the only way to get to a base configuration is via `move_base`, which requires being *at* a base configuration already, then no base motion is possible.
           
           Since `pick` and `place` both require `atbconf(?q)`, and no `atbconf` fact is provided in the initial state, and there's no way to establish `atbconf` based on the given actions and initial state, the goal is unreachable.
           
           However, the problem statement says "Never assume that any precondition is true by default: it must either be explicitly stated in the initial state, or be achieved by a previous action (and not undone by another action)." And "If any fact is not explicitly stated in the initial state, it is *false*."
           
           Since `atbconf(#o3)` is not explicitly stated, it is false. And since there's no action to make it true (as `move_base` requires an `atbconf` in the first place), no action that requires `atbconf` can be executed. Both `pick` and `place` require `atbconf(#o3)`. Therefore, neither `pick` nor `place` can ever be executed.
           
           Given that the goal requires moving `v12` (which implicitly means picking and placing), and picking and placing are impossible, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The initial state should have an `atbconf(?q)` for some `?q`. Since it doesn't, and no action can establish it, no plan is possible.
