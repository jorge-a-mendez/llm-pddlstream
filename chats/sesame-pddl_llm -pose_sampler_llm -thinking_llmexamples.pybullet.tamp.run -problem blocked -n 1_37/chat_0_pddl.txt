(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07 on a specified surface (index 0).  The surface's boundaries are defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement requires that the object's AABB be entirely within the surface's AABB.  The object can be rotated.
           
           Initially, I'll calculate the valid center region on the surface where the object can be placed. Since the object is essentially a square (0.07 x 0.07), its dimensions and thus its AABB, change based on the rotation (`theta`). The smallest bounding rectangle always remains at 0.07 side length. The valid range for `x` (the object's center) is calculated as: 4.2 + (0.07/2) <= `x` <= 4.8 - (0.07/2), which simplifies to 4.235 <= `x` <= 4.765. Similarly, for `y` we find -0.6 + 0.07/2 <= `y` <= 0.0 - 0.07/2, which simplifies to -0.565 <= `y` <= -0.035.
           
           I'll generate a grid of 49 placements within this region using theta = 0, as this gives the greatest placement area.  The grid will be a 7x7 grid. I can define this grid:
           For x, starting at 4.235 and incrementing by 0.53/6 = 0.08833
           For y, starting at -0.565 and incrementing by 0.53/6 = 0.08833
           All 49 placements will be defined by `surf_idx = 0`, `theta = 0`, and the corresponding `x` and `y` values.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll select a rotation different than 0 (e.g., pi/4).  I recalculate the appropriate placement area by calculating the new object dimensions.  Then I will center the object at the valid center point within the surface constraints.  Finally, I will output the 50 placements in the specified format with all placements having object ID 5. No objects previously exist on the surface, so collision checking is not necessary.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Strategy for Object 10 Placement**
           
           Okay, so here's the plan. I've got a solid understanding of the scene layout and the constraints I'm dealing with.  We've successfully placed a bunch of Object 5 instances, and those are now "fixed obstacles" that Object 10 has to navigate around.  I've analyzed the surface dimensions and object sizes to determine the valid placement region for Object 10 on Surface 0, taking into account that it can't collide with those existing Object 5 instances.
           
           I'm aiming for 50 stable placements, and I'm going to primarily use the `theta = 0` configuration (no rotation) for simplicity and to maximize available space. The object is pretty much square (0.09844 side), so this is a sensible choice. I’ve carefully calculated the AABBs and identified the collision zones around the Object 5 placements, carving out the areas where Object 10 *cannot* be placed.
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid of placements in two key regions that are clear of collisions:
           
           *   **Region 1 (Upper):** This is the larger, safer zone. I'll use a dense 8x6 grid to generate 48 placements within this region, ensuring there's a good spread.
           *   **Region 2 (Lower Right):** I’ll supplement with two more placements in the lower right area.
           
           All the points will be generated as center points of the object, as the check for valid range has accounted for the half-size of the object.
           
           Here's a breakdown of the process:
           
           1.  **Define Safe Regions:**  I've defined two rectangular regions on the surface where Object 10 *will not* collide. The precise dimensions are from previous calculations, taking into account object sizes and collision buffer areas.
           2.  **Region 1 Placement:** I will place object centers in a grid within Region 1 using calculated step size.
           3.  **Region 2 Placements:** Place two objects center coordinates for two additional points in Region 2.
           
           This grid-based strategy and region exclusion provides a good spread of placements while meeting the non-collision constraints and surface bounds, and hitting the requested count of 50. I'll execute the placement engine using this strategy.
