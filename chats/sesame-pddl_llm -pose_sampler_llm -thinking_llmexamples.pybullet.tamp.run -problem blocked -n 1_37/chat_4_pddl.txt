           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've come up with to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           First, I need to figure out what `new-axiom@0()` actually means. It's defined as having an object that's both `on` something and of a certain `type`.  I see there's an object, `v12`, that has the right `type` (v17). So, now I just need to get `v12` `on` `v18`.
           
           Looking at the axioms, `on(v12, v18)` means `v12` must be `supported` by `v18` and `atpose`.  In the initial state, I see that `v12` can be supported by `v18` *at* pose `#o2`.
           
           Since `v12` starts at a different pose (v13), I'll need to use the robot arm (`v4`) to move it to `#o2`. The robot's hand is initially empty, and the robot base is at configuration `v3`.
           
           My plan is to:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base from its current configuration (`v3`) to the base configuration necessary for the arm to interact at `#o2`.**  I see from the `kin` relations that this required configuration is `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick up `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) using arm `v4`.**
           3.  **Place `v12` at pose `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.**
           
           There's some nuance around the base movement and the `canmove()` predicate. This `canmove()` seems to be a flag that gets set to false by a `move_base` action and set to true again by `pick` or `place`. I've double-checked that `pick` and `place` don't *require* canmove() as a precondition.
           
           I've carefully checked all the action preconditions, and I think this plan is solid. The key is recognizing that `v12` is of the correct `type` and that the `kin` predicates allow for the manipulation necessary to satisfy the `on` axiom and therefore `new-axiom@0()`.
