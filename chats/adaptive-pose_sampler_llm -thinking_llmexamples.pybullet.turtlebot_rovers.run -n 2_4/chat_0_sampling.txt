(Thoughts: **Robot Positioning Strategy: A Deep Dive**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing this robot in three distinct spots near a target point. Crucially, the robot needs to stay within two meters of that target and, of course, avoid any collisions with these fixed obstacles. And, well, it's gotta have line-of-sight too.
           
           I'm thinking about how to do this strategically. First, I have these hard-coded obstacles: walls around the environment, and a big ol' wall right in the middle, splitting the area. My first order of business is to define those AABBs so my collision detection is solid. The environment itself is constrained by outer walls, effectively giving me a playable space that's about 2.4 units in each direction to the walls.
           
           My thinking is, given this `target_point`, I need to find locations `(x, y)` where three conditions are satisfied: the distance to the target is less than or equal to two, the coordinates fall within that safe `[-2.45, 2.45]` bounds (I’ll use the 2.4 as a safety margin), no collisions, and, finally, a clear view of the target.
           
           My plan? First, I'm going to scan the area around the target, looking for a circle-shaped area within the 2-meter radius. Then, I generate candidate points around this circle and filter out those that collide with obstacles. This also involves ruling out locations that are outside the allowed area.
           
           Now, let's say the target is at `(tx, ty)`. Key obstacles here are the central wall. My strategy is to generate candidate points based on a circle with different radii around the target. I'll test points using different angles. I'll prioritize a few radii - the best radii will be close to 2.
           
           Now, if the target is to the right of the middle wall (tx is positive), I generally want the robot on the right side. And vice versa.
           
           I've written a detailed collision checker that also takes into account the robot's physical dimensions. I’ve included a margin of 0.05 meters.
           
           My strategy includes prioritizing positions based on the target point - for example, if the x coordinate of the target is positive, I prefer x coordinates greater than 0 for the robots. I also use a set of predefined angles around the target and check collisions. If one point fails, I can switch direction.
           
           I know how to define collision, how to bound the search. Now to generate the solutions.
           
           Now, with my logic in mind, let's take your specific target point of `(1.8, -1.8)`.
           
           Since the target x coordinate is positive, I look for spots where x is also positive, so in the same half of the area. I generate points and filter out collisions with the walls and any obstacles. I generate a few locations - the goal is three.
           
           So, I’ve decided on a process: I'll start with points on a circle, use different radii to mix things up, and filter them out to check for potential collisions.
           
           Now I am going to find those positions.
           
           I generated a few points: `(1.8, 0.1)`, `(0.457, -0.457)`, and `(0.3, -1.8)`. All of these positions are within the environment walls and do not collide.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Obstacles and Formulating a Plan for a New Target**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating previous reasoning had flaws, specifically with a target near the central wall. The key takeaway is to be absolutely certain the target isn't *inside* an obstacle, because that's a surefire "no line of sight" scenario. I need to be more rigorous about checking obstacle boundaries.
           
           The new target is (-1.7, -0.6). Based on the updated environment information and the previous failure, here's my plan:
           
           1. **Target Analysis:** The target is in the lower-left quadrant, with a negative x-coordinate. This means the central wall (x = 0) is a key concern.
           2. **Strategy:** I should keep my robot positions on the *same side* of the central wall as the target (x < 0) for better line-of-sight potential.
           3. **Constraints:** Max range is 2. The robot's center must stay within the map's bounds: [-2.4, 2.4] for x and y.
           4. **Obstacle Review:** The only *potentially* problematic obstacle in the area is a large one in the bottom left, plus obstacle 6. Obstacle 5 is the central wall.
           5. **Position Generation:** My approach will be to generate candidate positions, check distances and obstacle clearances. My preference for starting point is "behind" the target.
           
           I will iterate through different position candidates to avoid being blocked by Obstacle 6.
           
           My candidate positions are:
           
           *   **P1: (-1.7, 0.9)**: Directly above the target.
           *   **P2: (-2.2, -0.6)**: To the left and level with the target.
           *   **P3: (-1.0, -1.5)**: Further back and a little diagonally from the target.
           
           These were all calculated after considering the previous "no line of sight" feedback and carefully checking them against obstacles with an added buffer.
