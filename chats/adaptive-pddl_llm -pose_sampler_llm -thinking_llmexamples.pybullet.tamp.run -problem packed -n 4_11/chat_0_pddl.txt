(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with dimensions approximately 0.08 x 0.08 meters on a surface that is 0.27 x 0.27 meters, centered at (0,0). "Stable" means the object must be entirely within the surface's boundaries.
           
           The core of the problem involves determining the (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values for each of the 50 placements. I'll focus on surface 0, so surf_idx is fixed. The critical considerations are the object's rotation (theta) and its center position (x, y) on the surface.
           
           For a rectangular object on a rectangular surface, the position constraints depend on rotation. When the object is aligned with the axes (theta = 0, PI/2, PI, 3*PI/2), the allowed (x,y) range can be easily calculated by subtracting half the object's width and height from the surface boundaries.
           
           For arbitrary angles, I need to compute the effective bounding box dimensions. Given an object width (w) and height (h), and an angle theta, the effective half-width is (w/2) * |cos(theta)| + (h/2) * |sin(theta)|, and the effective half-height is (w/2) * |sin(theta)| + (h/2) * |cos(theta)|.
           
           The object's dimensions are almost equal (0.08008709319388757, 0.08008709319388752), so rotating it will only marginally change the necessary bounding box area.  For practical purposes, the effective dimensions won't change greatly. The calculations of the ranges are critical. The object is so small relative to the surface (0.27 x 0.27) that I'm confident there will be enough space for placements at every rotation.
           
           To create 50 unique placements, I'll use 10 distinct angles from 0 to Pi (inclusive). For each angle, I will position the center using 5 different (x, y) coordinates within the allowed bounds. Those bounds will be calculated using the maximal effective bounding box dimension. This maximizes space for diversity across angles and avoids having too many unique angles at identical positions.
           I have a solid strategy in place.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object 7 on surface 0, and the previous placement of object 4 (at (0,0,0,0)) was successful. So, object 4 is now a fixed obstacle that I *must* avoid. Object 7 is a square with dimensions approximately 0.098 x 0.098. Surface 0 is a square as well, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           First, I calculated the effective half-extents of object 7, considering different rotations. Since it's a square, its bounding box size varies with rotation. The maximum effective half-extent (worst-case scenario) is about 0.069, and the minimum is about 0.049. This maximum is still less than half the surface width (0.135), so object 7 *could* technically fit on the surface *if* there was no object 4.
           
           I then identified the crucial constraint: avoid colliding with object 4, which is at the center of the surface.  Object 4's bounding box has half-extents of about 0.04.  By carefully calculating the bounding boxes and potential centers for object 7, I discovered a crucial issue: *for any rotation, it is geometrically impossible to place object 7 on surface 0 without some collision with object 4.* The size of object 7 is just too large relative to the space available around object 4. The available space on the surface is not big enough.
           
           I verified the impossibility using exact calculations and floating point arithmetic. No matter the angle, I calculated the overlap, showing that any valid center point for Object 7 would necessarily overlap with Object 4. Any attempt to squeeze the object 7 around object 4, even at an angle, fails due to the geometric constraints.
           
           The instructions say to provide 50 valid placements. I interpret "valid" as "stable and avoiding collisions." However, given this impossible geometric scenario, I have to output placements *that meet the stability requirements, but not the collision avoidance.* I have to prioritize. I'll provide 50 locations and orientations for object 7 that are on the surface, and as far as possible from the center where object 4 is placed. These positions will include angles 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2, with 10 positions near the edges for each angle. The result of these attempts, I anticipate, will be 50 placements that fail on collision with object 4.
