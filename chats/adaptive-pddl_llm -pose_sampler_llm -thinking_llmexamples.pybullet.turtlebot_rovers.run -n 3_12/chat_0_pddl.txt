           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Feasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with crafting a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` from the initial state. The definition of `new-axiom@0()` is pretty straightforward: it hinges on a conjunction of several `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, `type`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           I started by taking a look at each predicate individually and checking their initial truth values. I quickly noticed that the `atconf` and `free` predicates in the goal are already satisfied in the initial state. This indicates the rovers are already in their starting configurations with empty sample stores.
           
           However, the remaining predicates are where the challenge lies: `receivedimage`, `type`, and `receivedanalysis`. I carefully examined the initial state to identify the existing stone and soil objects and their corresponding types, which are `v2` and `v6`. I concluded that to successfully satisfy the goal, I would need to have both: `receivedanalysis` for *some* stone (`v1`, `v4`, or `v3`) and `receivedanalysis` for *some* soil (`v5`, `v7`, or `v8`).
           
           Next, I reviewed the available actions. The key actions seem to be `move`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `drop_rock`. I immediately realized a critical issue. The *only* valid `move` actions don't change the configurations, and the only `drop_rock` actions available would violate the `free` predicate.
           
           I took a closer look at the preconditions and effects of these available actions, specifically checking the conditions and the applicability of the `drop_rock` and the `move` actions.
           
           After careful consideration of the only available actions, I was able to conclude that none of them produce the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates required to achieve my goal. The key action types needed for those predicates, specifically, `send_image` and `send_analysis`, are simply *not* included in the allowed action instances.
           
           Ultimately, given the constraint that I can't use any actions *not* in the given list, I can decisively conclude that it's impossible to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. None of the allowed actions can produce the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. I double-checked the initial state and axioms to ensure I wasn't overlooking anything, but my conclusion remains firm: the goal is unattainable.
