User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.242, 0.185, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.174, 0.985).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.186, -0.289, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.614, 0.79).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.103, -0.513, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.548, 0.836).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located at v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all on the surface v11. The goal is to place all three objects on the surface v16. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are handempty and at their home configurations. The robot's base is at v3.
           
           The goal requires placing v8, v12, and v14 on v16. Since there are no `place` actions available, and only a `move_base` action that doesn't change the state of the objects, this task is impossible to achieve with the given available actions. The `on` predicate requires `atpose` and `supported`, and no actions that change `atpose` are available.
           
           Since no pick or place actions are available, and the only available action is a `move_base` action that moves the robot from `v3` to `v3`, which does not help with placing objects, the goal of placing objects on `v16` cannot be achieved.
