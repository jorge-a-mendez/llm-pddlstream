User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.242, 0.185, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.174, 0.985).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.186, -0.289, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.614, 0.79).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.103, -0.513, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.548, 0.836).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`, currently placed on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. There are several pre-computed poses for the objects to be placed on `v16`, represented by `#o2`. The plan will involve moving the robot base to a suitable configuration, picking up each object from its current location, and then placing it on `v16` at a collision-free pose. Since there are multiple objects to be placed on `v16` at `#o2`, I will provide different continuous values for each object on `v16`.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Move the base to a configuration `o3` to facilitate picking and placing.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           5. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.

The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration.

Since there are multiple objects to be placed on `v16` at `#o2`, I will provide different continuous values for each object on `v16`.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Move the base to a configuration `o3` to facilitate picking and placing.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           5. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           I will adjust the poses to ensure the objects are within the bounds of `v16`. `v16` has an AABB from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           `v8` has an AABB of `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`. I need to place it such that its AABB is within `v16`'s AABB.
           `v12` has an AABB of `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`. I need to place it such that its AABB is within `v16`'s AABB.
           `v14` has an AABB of `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`. I need to place it such that its AABB is within `v16`'s AABB.
           
           The AABBs given for the objects are relative to their own origin. When placing them on `v16`, I need to specify the pose of the object's origin relative to the world frame, such that the object's AABB, when transformed by this pose, lies within `v16`'s AABB. I will assume the z-coordinate for placing objects on `v16` should be 0.781, as that is the z-coordinate for the other poses.
           
           Let's re-calculate the poses of the objects such that they are within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           For `v8` (AABB `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`), if the center is at (x,y), then its x-range is approximately `x-0.1865` to `x-0.1865` and y-range is `y-0.2885` to `y-0.2885`. Let's try placing `v8` with its origin at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` for a stable placement on `v16`.
           The x-range of `v8`'s AABB with pose `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` is `(-0.229, -0.144)`. This needs to be within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           The y-range of `v8`'s AABB with pose `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` is `(-0.331, -0.246)`. This needs to be within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           This pose is not suitable. Let's adjust for the center of `v8`'s AABB: `(-0.1865, -0.2885)`. To center it in `v16`, we want the center of `v8` to be at `(0,0)` relative to `v16`'s center (assuming `v16`'s center is at `(0,0)`). So, the object's origin should be at `(0.1865, 0.2885)` in the world frame to place `v8`'s AABB center at `(0,0)` in the world frame. Let's try `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`. This would put its actual AABB at `(-0.229, -0.331)` to `(-0.144, -0.246)`.
           To make it stable on `v16`, the object's transformed AABB should be within `v16`'s AABB `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           The dimensions of `v8` are `0.085` in x and `0.085` in y.
           The dimensions of `v12` are `0.09` in x and `0.09` in y.
           The dimensions of `v14` are `0.092` in x and `0.093` in y.
           
           Let's place `v8` at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`. Its AABB relative to its origin is `(-0.229, -0.331)` to `(-0.144, -0.246)`. The new pose needs to shift this to be within `v16`. If we place `v8` such that its center `(-0.1865, -0.2885)` is shifted to `(0,0)` on `v16`, then its pose `x` would be `0.1865`, `y` would be `0.2885`. This is too far from the origin of `v16`.
           Let's try to place `v8` closer to the center of `v16`. Given `v8`'s AABB relative to its origin: `min_x = -0.229`, `max_x = -0.144`, `min_y = -0.331`, `max_y = -0.246`.
           Its width is `0.085` and height is `0.085`.
           `v16` has a width of `0.27` and height of `0.27`.
           A stable pose for `v8` on `v16` would be, for example, center of `v8`'s AABB at `(0,0)` world coordinate, so that `v8`'s AABB in world coordinate becomes `(-0.0425, -0.0425)` to `(0.0425, 0.0425)`. To achieve this, the pose of `v8`'s origin must be at `(0.1865, 0.2885)`. This will be too far from `v16`'s origin.
           Let's choose `x=0.0`, `y=0.0`. The AABB of `v8` is `(-0.229, -0.331)` to `(-0.144, -0.246)`. We need to move the *object itself* to be within `v16`.
           The object `v8` has a size of `0.085 x 0.085`. The surface `v16` has a size of `0.27 x 0.27`.
           Let's place `v8` at `x_center = -0.135 + 0.085/2 = -0.0925`, `y_center = -0.135 + 0.085/2 = -0.0925`. No, this refers to the bounds of the object.
           The origin of `v8` is at `(x, y)` in world coordinates. Its AABB is `(x-0.229, y-0.331)` to `(x-0.144, y-0.246)`. This transformed AABB needs to be within `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           To center `v8` on `v16`, the center of `v8`'s AABB must coincide with the center of `v16`'s AABB, which is `(0,0)`. The center of `v8`'s AABB relative to its origin is `(-0.1865, -0.2885)`. So the pose of `v8` should be `(0.1865, 0.2885, 0.781, 0.0)`. This places `v8`'s AABB at `(-0.0425, -0.0425)` to `(0.0425, 0.0425)`, which is within `v16`.
           
           Similarly for `v12`, AABB `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`. Center is `(0.242, 0.185)`. Pose of `v12` should be `(-0.242, -0.185, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           This makes `v12`'s AABB at `(-0.045, -0.045)` to `(0.045, 0.045)`, which is within `v16`.
           
           For `v14`, AABB `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`. Center is `(-0.103, -0.5125)`. Pose of `v14` should be `(0.103, 0.5125, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           This makes `v14`'s AABB at `(-0.046, -0.0465)` to `(0.046, 0.0465)`, which is within `v16`.
           
           Let's space them out a bit on `v16`.
           `v16` bounds: `x` from `-0.135` to `0.135`, `y` from `-0.135` to `0.135`.
           
           For `v8` (dimensions `0.085 x 0.085`):
           Let's place its center at `(0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)` in `v16`.
           Its AABB (relative to its origin) is `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`.
           Its center is `(-0.1865, -0.2885)`.
           If `v8`'s origin is at `(x_p, y_p)`, then its AABB is `(x_p - 0.229, y_p - 0.331)` to `(x_p - 0.144, y_p - 0.246)`.
           We want `x_p - 0.1865` (center x) to be `0.0`, so `x_p = 0.1865`.
           We want `y_p - 0.2885` (center y) to be `0.08`, so `y_p = 0.08 + 0.2885 = 0.3685`.
           Pose for `v8`: `(0.1865, 0.3685, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           This means `v8`'s AABB will be `(0.1865 - 0.229, 0.3685 - 0.331)` to `(0.1865 - 0.144, 0.3685 - 0.246)`, which is `(-0.0425, 0.0375)` to `(0.0425, 0.1225)`.
           This is within `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           For `v12` (dimensions `0.09 x 0.09`):
           Let's place its center at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` in `v16`.
           Its AABB (relative to its origin) is `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`.
           Its center is `(0.242, 0.185)`.
           If `v12`'s origin is at `(x_p, y_p)`, then its AABB is `(x_p + 0.197, y_p + 0.14)` to `(x_p + 0.287, y_p + 0.23)`.
           We want `x_p + 0.242` (center x) to be `0.0`, so `x_p = -0.242`.
           We want `y_p + 0.185` (center y) to be `0.0`, so `y_p = -0.185`.
           Pose for `v12`: `(-0.242, -0.185, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           This means `v12`'s AABB will be `(-0.242 + 0.197, -0.185 + 0.14)` to `(-0.242 + 0.287, -0.185 + 0.23)`, which is `(-0.045, -0.045)` to `(0.045, 0.045)`.
           This is within `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           For `v14` (dimensions `0.092 x 0.093`):
           Let's place its center at `(0.0, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)` in `v16`.
           Its AABB (relative to its origin) is `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`.
           Its center is `(-0.103, -0.5125)`.
           If `v14`'s origin is at `(x_p, y_p)`, then its AABB is `(x_p - 0.149, y_p - 0.559)` to `(x_p - 0.057, y_p - 0.466)`.
           We want `x_p - 0.103` (center x) to be `0.0`, so `x_p = 0.103`.
           We want `y_p - 0.5125` (center y) to be `-0.08`, so `y_p = -0.08 + 0.5125 = 0.4325`.
           Pose for `v14`: `(0.103, 0.4325, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           This means `v14`'s AABB will be `(0.103 - 0.149, 0.4325 - 0.559)` to `(0.103 - 0.057, 0.4325 - 0.466)`, which is `(-0.046, -0.1265)` to `(0.046, -0.0335)`.
           This is within `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.

           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`, currently placed on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. There are several pre-computed poses for the objects to be placed on `v16`, represented by `#o2`. The plan will involve moving the robot base to a suitable configuration, picking up each object from its current location, and then placing it on `v16` at a collision-free pose. Since there are multiple objects to be placed on `v16` at `#o2`, I will provide different continuous values for each object on `v16`.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Move the base to a configuration `o3` to facilitate picking and placing.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           5. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           I need to recalculate the poses to ensure stability. The surface `v16` has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Let's correctly identify the object's actual AABB relative to its origin for placement:
           For `v8`: The relative AABB is `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`. The actual object's extent is `max_x - min_x = -0.144 - (-0.229) = 0.085`, `max_y - min_y = -0.246 - (-0.331) = 0.085`. The center of this relative AABB is `x_c = (-0.229 - 0.144) / 2 = -0.1865`, `y_c = (-0.331 - 0.246) / 2 = -0.2885`.
           If we want to place `v8` such that its center is at `(world_x_c, world_y_c)`, the object's origin `(pose_x, pose_y)` must be `(world_x_c - x_c, world_y_c - y_c)`.
           
           Let's try to place `v8` with its center at `(0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)` in world coordinates.
           Then `pose_x = 0.0 - (-0.1865) = 0.1865`.
           `pose_y = 0.05 - (-0.2885) = 0.3385`.
           The AABB for `v8` at `(0.1865, 0.3385, 0.781, 0.0)` would be:
           `x`: `(0.1865 - 0.229, 0.1865 - 0.144)` = `(-0.0425, 0.0425)`
           `y`: `(0.3385 - 0.331, 0.3385 - 0.246)` = `(0.0075, 0.0925)`
           This range `(-0.0425, 0.0425)` for x and `(0.0075, 0.0925)` for y is within `(-0.135, 0.135)` for both x and y. So this is a stable pose.
           
           For `v12`: The relative AABB is `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`. The actual object's extent is `max_x - min_x = 0.287 - 0.197 = 0.09`, `max_y - min_y = 0.23 - 0.14 = 0.09`. The center of this relative AABB is `x_c = (0.197 + 0.287) / 2 = 0.242`, `y_c = (0.14 + 0.23) / 2 = 0.185`.
           Let's try to place `v12` with its center at `(0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)` in world coordinates.
           Then `pose_x = 0.0 - 0.242 = -0.242`.
           `pose_y = -0.05 - 0.185 = -0.235`.
           The AABB for `v12` at `(-0.242, -0.235, 0.781, 0.0)` would be:
           `x`: `(-0.242 + 0.197, -0.242 + 0.287)` = `(-0.045, 0.045)`
           `y`: `(-0.235 + 0.14, -0.235 + 0.23)` = `(-0.095, -0.005)`
           This range `(-0.045, 0.045)` for x and `(-0.095, -0.005)` for y is within `(-0.135, 0.135)` for both x and y. So this is a stable pose.
           
           For `v14`: The relative AABB is `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`. The actual object's extent is `max_x - min_x = -0.057 - (-0.149) = 0.092`, `max_y - min_y = -0.466 - (-0.559) = 0.093`. The center of this relative AABB is `x_c = (-0.149 - 0.057) / 2 = -0.103`, `y_c = (-0.559 - 0.466) / 2 = -0.5125`.
           Let's try to place `v14` with its center at `(0.05, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` in world coordinates.
           Then `pose_x = 0.05 - (-0.103) = 0.153`.
           `pose_y = 0.0 - (-0.5125) = 0.5125`.
           The AABB for `v14` at `(0.153, 0.5125, 0.781, 0.0)` would be:
           `x`: `(0.153 - 0.149, 0.153 - 0.057)` = `(0.004, 0.096)`
           `y`: `(0.5125 - 0.559, 0.5125 - 0.466)` = `(-0.0465, 0.0465)`
           This range `(0.004, 0.096)` for x and `(-0.0465, 0.0465)` for y is within `(-0.135, 0.135)` for both x and y. So this is a stable pose.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`, currently placed on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. There are several pre-computed poses for the objects to be placed on `v16`, represented by `#o2`.

           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           I am making a mistake in calculating the transformed AABB or the desired world coordinates for the objects. Let me rethink the process for ensuring stability.
           
           The surface `v16` has an AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. This means its minimum x is -0.135, maximum x is 0.135, and similarly for y.
           The objects' AABBs are given relative to their own local frame. When we specify a pose `(x, y, z, theta)` for an object, this pose defines the transformation from the object's local frame to the world frame. The object's AABB in the world frame is then the transformed AABB.
           
           Let's use a simpler approach. We need the object's local AABB to be fully contained within `v16`'s AABB when transformed by the pose.
           Assume `theta = 0` for simplicity.
           Let the object's local AABB be `(obj_min_x, obj_min_y)` to `(obj_max_x, obj_max_y)`.
           If the object's pose is `(pose_x, pose_y, z, 0.0)`, then its AABB in the world frame will be `(pose_x + obj_min_x, pose_y + obj_min_y)` to `(pose_x + obj_max_x, pose_y + obj_max_y)`.
           We need `v16_min_x <= pose_x + obj_min_x` and `pose_x + obj_max_x <= v16_max_x`.
           And `v16_min_y <= pose_y + obj_min_y` and `pose_y + obj_max_y <= v16_max_y`.
           
           For `v8`: Local AABB `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`.
           `v16_min_x = -0.135`, `v16_max_x = 0.135`.
           `v16_min_y = -0.135`, `v16_max_y = 0.135`.
           
           For `v8` at `(pose_x, pose_y, 0.781, 0.0)`:
           `-0.135 <= pose_x - 0.229` => `pose_x >= -0.135 + 0.229 = 0.094`
           `pose_x - 0.144 <= 0.135` => `pose_x <= 0.135 + 0.144 = 0.279`
           So, `0.094 <= pose_x <= 0.279`.
           
           `-0.135 <= pose_y - 0.331` => `pose_y >= -0.135 + 0.331 = 0.196`
           `pose_y - 0.246 <= 0.135` => `pose_y <= 0.135 + 0.246 = 0.381`
           So, `0.196 <= pose_y <= 0.381`.
           
           Let's pick a pose for `v8`: `pose_x = 0.1`, `pose_y = 0.2`.
           The transformed AABB would be `(0.1 - 0.229, 0.2 - 0.331)` to `(0.1 - 0.144, 0.2 - 0.246)`.
           This is `(-0.129, -0.131)` to `(-0.044, -0.046)`. This is within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           For `v12`: Local AABB `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`.
           For `v12` at `(pose_x, pose_y, 0.781, 0.0)`:
           `-0.135 <= pose_x + 0.197` => `pose_x >= -0.135 - 0.197 = -0.332`
           `pose_x + 0.287 <= 0.135` => `pose_x <= 0.135 - 0.287 = -0.152`
           So, `-0.332 <= pose_x <= -0.152`.
           
           `-0.135 <= pose_y + 0.14` => `pose_y >= -0.135 - 0.14 = -0.275`
           `pose_y + 0.23 <= 0.135` => `pose_y <= 0.135 - 0.23 = -0.095`
           So, `-0.275 <= pose_y <= -0.095`.
           
           Let's pick a pose for `v12`: `pose_x = -0.2`, `pose_y = -0.1`.
           The transformed AABB would be `(-0.2 + 0.197, -0.1 + 0.14)` to `(-0.2 + 0.287, -0.1 + 0.23)`.
           This is `(-0.003, 0.04)` to `(0.087, 0.13)`. This is within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           For `v14`: Local AABB `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`.
           For `v14` at `(pose_x, pose_y, 0.781, 0.0)`:
           `-0.135 <= pose_x - 0.149` => `pose_x >= -0.135 + 0.149 = 0.014`
           `pose_x - 0.057 <= 0.135` => `pose_x <= 0.135 + 0.057 = 0.192`
           So, `0.014 <= pose_x <= 0.192`.
           
           `-0.135 <= pose_y - 0.559` => `pose_y >= -0.135 + 0.559 = 0.424`
           `pose_y - 0.466 <= 0.135` => `pose_y <= 0.135 + 0.466 = 0.601`
           So, `0.424 <= pose_y <= 0.601`.
           
           Let's pick a pose for `v14`: `pose_x = 0.05`, `pose_y = 0.45`.
           The transformed AABB would be `(0.05 - 0.149, 0.45 - 0.559)` to `(0.05 - 0.057, 0.45 - 0.466)`.
           This is `(-0.099, -0.109)` to `(-0.007, -0.016)`. This is within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           These three new poses for the objects are distinct and should be stable on `v16`.

           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`, currently placed on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. There are several pre-computed poses for the objects to be placed on `v16`, represented by `#o2`. The plan will involve moving the robot base to a suitable configuration, picking up each object from its current location, and then placing it on `v16` at a collision-free pose. Since there are multiple objects to be placed on `v16` at `#o2`, I will provide different continuous values for each object on `v16`.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Move the base to a configuration `o3` to facilitate picking and placing.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           5. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           I apologize for the repeated errors in calculating stable poses. I'm going to meticulously re-calculate the poses using the exact AABB definitions.
           
           Surface `v16` AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           
           **For object `v8`:**
           Local AABB: `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`
           Width: `0.085`, Height: `0.085`
           We need `pose_x + min_x_obj >= v16_min_x` and `pose_x + max_x_obj <= v16_max_x`.
           `pose_x - 0.229 >= -0.135` => `pose_x >= 0.094`
           `pose_x - 0.144 <= 0.135` => `pose_x <= 0.279`
           So, `0.094 <= pose_x <= 0.279`. Let's choose `pose_x = 0.095`.
           
           `pose_y - 0.331 >= -0.135` => `pose_y >= 0.196`
           `pose_y - 0.246 <= 0.135` => `pose_y <= 0.381`
           So, `0.196 <= pose_y <= 0.381`. Let's choose `pose_y = 0.2`.
           
           Let's test `v8` at `(0.095, 0.2, 0.781, 0.0)`:
           Transformed AABB X: `(0.095 - 0.229, 0.095 - 0.144)` = `(-0.134, -0.049)`. This is within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           Transformed AABB Y: `(0.2 - 0.331, 0.2 - 0.246)` = `(-0.131, -0.046)`. This is within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           This pose for `v8` should be stable.
           
           **For object `v12`:**
           Local AABB: `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`
           Width: `0.09`, Height: `0.09`
           `pose_x + 0.197 >= -0.135` => `pose_x >= -0.332`
           `pose_x + 0.287 <= 0.135` => `pose_x <= -0.152`
           So, `-0.332 <= pose_x <= -0.152`. Let's choose `pose_x = -0.155`.
           
           `pose_y + 0.14 >= -0.135` => `pose_y >= -0.275`
           `pose_y + 0.23 <= 0.135` => `pose_y <= -0.095`
           So, `-0.275 <= pose_y <= -0.095`. Let's choose `pose_y = -0.1`.
           
           Let's test `v12` at `(-0.155, -0.1, 0.781, 0.0)`:
           Transformed AABB X: `(-0.155 + 0.197, -0.155 + 0.287)` = `(0.042, 0.132)`. This is within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           Transformed AABB Y: `(-0.1 + 0.14, -0.1 + 0.23)` = `(0.04, 0.13)`. This is within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           This pose for `v12` should be stable.
           
           **For object `v14`:**
           Local AABB: `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`
           Width: `0.092`, Height: `0.093`
           `pose_x - 0.149 >= -0.135` => `pose_x >= 0.014`
           `pose_x - 0.057 <= 0.135` => `pose_x <= 0.192`
           So, `0.014 <= pose_x <= 0.192`. Let's choose `pose_x = 0.02`.
           
           `pose_y - 0.559 >= -0.135` => `pose_y >= 0.424`
           `pose_y - 0.466 <= 0.135` => `pose_y <= 0.601`
           So, `0.424 <= pose_y <= 0.601`. Let's choose `pose_y = 0.43`.
           
           Let's test `v14` at `(0.02, 0.43, 0.781, 0.0)`:
           Transformed AABB X: `(0.02 - 0.149, 0.02 - 0.057)` = `(-0.129, -0.037)`. This is within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           Transformed AABB Y: `(0.43 - 0.559, 0.43 - 0.466)` = `(-0.129, -0.036)`. This is within `(-0.135, 0.135)`.
           This pose for `v14` should be stable.
           
           The new poses are:
           `v8`: `(0.095, 0.2, 0.781, 0.0)`
           `v12`: `(-0.155, -0.1, 0.781, 0.0)`
           `v14`: `(0.02, 0.43, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           It seems there might be a misunderstanding of how the AABB and pose interact or the expected values for the surface. The AABB of `v16` is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. This implies the surface is centered at `(0,0)` and spans `0.27` units in x and y.
           
           The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14` are also relatively small. My calculations above should ensure the transformed AABB of the object is within the bounds of `v16`. Let's use the exact center coordinates for each object.
           
           `v8`: Center of local AABB is `(-0.1865, -0.2885)`. To place its center at `(0.0, 0.0)` relative to `v16` (i.e., at world `(0.0, 0.0)`), the pose of `v8` should be `(0.1865, 0.2885, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Then its AABB in world coords would be `(0.1865 - 0.229, 0.2885 - 0.331)` to `(0.1865 - 0.144, 0.2885 - 0.246)`, which is `(-0.0425, -0.0425)` to `(0.0425, 0.0425)`. This is perfectly centered and within `v16`.
           
           `v12`: Center of local AABB is `(0.242, 0.185)`. To place its center at `(0.0, 0.0)` relative to `v16`, the pose of `v12` should be `(-0.242, -0.185, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Then its AABB in world coords would be `(-0.242 + 0.197, -0.185 + 0.14)` to `(-0.242 + 0.287, -0.185 + 0.23)`, which is `(-0.045, -0.045)` to `(0.045, 0.045)`. This is perfectly centered and within `v16`.
           
           `v14`: Center of local AABB is `(-0.103, -0.5125)`. To place its center at `(0.0, 0.0)` relative to `v16`, the pose of `v14` should be `(0.103, 0.5125, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Then its AABB in world coords would be `(0.103 - 0.149, 0.5125 - 0.559)` to `(0.103 - 0.057, 0.5125 - 0.466)`, which is `(-0.046, -0.0465)` to `(0.046, 0.0465)`. This is perfectly centered and within `v16`.
           
           The issue is that these three objects cannot all be placed at `(0,0)` of `v16` without colliding with each other. I need to space them out on `v16`.
           
           Let's try to place them like this on `v16`:
           `v8`: center at `(0.0, 0.08)` of `v16`
           `v12`: center at `(0.0, -0.08)` of `v16`
           `v14`: center at `(-0.08, 0.0)` of `v16`
           
           For `v8`: world center `(0.0, 0.08)`. Local AABB center `(-0.1865, -0.2885)`.
           `pose_x = 0.0 - (-0.1865) = 0.1865`.
           `pose_y = 0.08 - (-0.2885) = 0.3685`.
           Pose `v8`: `(0.1865, 0.3685, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Transformed AABB X: `(0.1865 - 0.229, 0.1865 - 0.144)` = `(-0.0425, 0.0425)`.
           Transformed AABB Y: `(0.3685 - 0.331, 0.3685 - 0.246)` = `(0.0375, 0.1225)`.
           This is within `v16`.
           
           For `v12`: world center `(0.0, -0.08)`. Local AABB center `(0.242, 0.185)`.
           `pose_x = 0.0 - 0.242 = -0.242`.
           `pose_y = -0.08 - 0.185 = -0.265`.
           Pose `v12`: `(-0.242, -0.265, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Transformed AABB X: `(-0.242 + 0.197, -0.242 + 0.287)` = `(-0.045, 0.045)`.
           Transformed AABB Y: `(-0.265 + 0.14, -0.265 + 0.23)` = `(-0.125, -0.035)`.
           This is within `v16`.
           
           For `v14`: world center `(-0.08, 0.0)`. Local AABB center `(-0.103, -0.5125)`.
           `pose_x = -0.08 - (-0.103) = 0.023`.
           `pose_y = 0.0 - (-0.5125) = 0.5125`.
           Pose `v14`: `(0.023, 0.5125, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Transformed AABB X: `(0.023 - 0.149, 0.023 - 0.057)` = `(-0.126, -0.034)`.
           Transformed AABB Y: `(0.5125 - 0.559, 0.5125 - 0.466)` = `(-0.0465, 0.0465)`.
           This is within `v16`.
           
           These three poses place the objects such that their AABBs are within `v16` and they are spaced out.

Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`, currently placed on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. There are several pre-computed poses for the objects to be placed on `v16`, represented by `#o2`. The plan will involve moving the robot base to a suitable configuration, picking up each object from its current location, and then placing it on `v16` at a collision-free pose. Since there are multiple objects to be placed on `v16` at `#o2`, I will provide different continuous values for each object on `v16`.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Move the base to a configuration `o3` to facilitate picking and placing.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           5. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           I understand the repeated issue is that my calculated poses are not resulting in the object's transformed AABB being *within* the `v16` AABB of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I must be misinterpreting something critical about the AABB transformation or the stability check.
           
           Let's re-examine the core principle for stability:
           For a given object `o` with local AABB `(min_ox, min_oy)` to `(max_ox, max_oy)`, and a pose `(px, py, pz, theta)` (assuming `theta=0`), the object's AABB in world coordinates is `(px + min_ox, py + min_oy)` to `(px + max_ox, py + max_oy)`.
           For this to be stable on surface `s` with world AABB `(min_sx, min_sy)` to `(max_sx, max_sy)`, we need:
           1. `px + min_ox >= min_sx`
           2. `px + max_ox <= max_sx`
           3. `py + min_oy >= min_sy`
           4. `py + max_oy <= max_sy`
           
           This gives us the ranges for `px` and `py`:
           `min_sx - min_ox <= px <= max_sx - max_ox`
           `min_sy - min_oy <= py <= max_sy - max_oy`
           
           Let's apply this method strictly for each object.
           Surface `v16` AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           `min_sx = -0.135`, `max_sx = 0.135`
           `min_sy = -0.135`, `max_sy = 0.135`
           
           **For object `v8`:**
           Local AABB: `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`
           `min_ox = -0.229`, `max_ox = -0.144`
           `min_oy = -0.331`, `max_oy = -0.246`
           
           `px` range for `v8`:
           `-0.135 - (-0.229) <= px <= 0.135 - (-0.144)`
           `0.094 <= px <= 0.279`
           
           `py` range for `v8`:
           `-0.135 - (-0.331) <= py <= 0.135 - (-0.246)`
           `0.196 <= py <= 0.381`
           
           To space them out, let's target the center of `v16`'s AABB `(0,0)` and try to place `v8`'s AABB such that it uses a portion of the `v16` space, e.g., in the top-left quadrant of `v16`.
           Let's choose `px` and `py` values that are within these calculated ranges.
           For `v8`, let's choose `px = 0.1` and `py = 0.2`.
           AABB in world coords: `(0.1 - 0.229, 0.2 - 0.331)` to `(0.1 - 0.144, 0.2 - 0.246)`
           `(-0.129, -0.131)` to `(-0.044, -0.046)`.
           This is within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           **For object `v12`:**
           Local AABB: `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`
           `min_ox = 0.197`, `max_ox = 0.287`
           `min_oy = 0.14`, `max_oy = 0.23`
           
           `px` range for `v12`:
           `-0.135 - 0.197 <= px <= 0.135 - 0.287`
           `-0.332 <= px <= -0.152`
           
           `py` range for `v12`:
           `-0.135 - 0.14 <= py <= 0.135 - 0.23`
           `-0.275 <= py <= -0.095`
           
           Let's choose `px = -0.2` and `py = -0.1`.
           AABB in world coords: `(-0.2 + 0.197, -0.1 + 0.14)` to `(-0.2 + 0.287, -0.1 + 0.23)`
           `(-0.003, 0.04)` to `(0.087, 0.13)`.
           This is within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           **For object `v14`:**
           Local AABB: `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`
           `min_ox = -0.149`, `max_ox = -0.057`
           `min_oy = -0.559`, `max_oy = -0.466`
           
           `px` range for `v14`:
           `-0.135 - (-0.149) <= px <= 0.135 - (-0.057)`
           `0.014 <= px <= 0.192`
           
           `py` range for `v14`:
           `-0.135 - (-0.559) <= py <= 0.135 - (-0.466)`
           `0.424 <= py <= 0.601`
           
           Let's choose `px = 0.05` and `py = 0.45`.
           AABB in world coords: `(0.05 - 0.149, 0.45 - 0.559)` to `(0.05 - 0.057, 0.45 - 0.466)`
           `(-0.099, -0.109)` to `(-0.007, -0.016)`.
           This is within `v16`'s bounds.
           
           My calculations indicate these coordinates are valid. The system seems to be using slightly different AABB values in its validation. Let me manually check the AABB of the objects in the initial problem description to make sure I am not off.
           `v8`: `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))`
           `v12`: `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`
           `v14`: `((-0.149, -0.559), (-0.057, -0.466))`
           `v16`: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           
           The error messages state:
           `v8`: `AABB(lower=(0.151, 0.333), upper=(0.221, 0.403))` is not contained in `v16`. This AABB corresponds to `(px + min_ox, py + min_oy)` to `(px + max_ox, py + max_oy)`.
           If `(0.1, 0.2)` was the pose, then:
           `px + min_ox = 0.1 - 0.229 = -0.129` (lower x)
           `px + max_ox = 0.1 - 0.144 = -0.044` (upper x)
           `py + min_oy = 0.2 - 0.331 = -0.131` (lower y)
           `py + max_oy = 0.2 - 0.246 = -0.046` (upper y)
           This is `((-0.129, -0.131), (-0.044, -0.046))`. This is indeed within `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           The validation message for `v8` at pose `(0.1 0.2 0.781 0.0)` shows a *different* AABB `(lower=(0.151, 0.333), upper=(0.221, 0.403))`. This implies the system is using different relative AABB values for `v8` than what was provided in the problem description.
           
           I'm going to assume the *system's* interpretation of the object AABBs relative to their center, as seen in the error messages. The error message gives me the *transformed AABB* it calculates for my provided pose. I need to work backwards from that.
           
           Let's assume the error message provides the correct AABB of the object `v8` at the given pose `(0.1 0.2 0.781 0.0)`.
           For `v8` at `(0.1, 0.2, 0.781, 0.0)`, the system computes AABB `((0.151, 0.333), (0.221, 0.403))`.
           This AABB is not contained in `v16` `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Indeed, all its values are outside.
           This indicates that the `obj_min_x, obj_max_x, obj_min_y, obj_max_y` values I'm using from the problem description are not what the validator is using.
           
           Let's try to infer the correct relative AABBs from the provided poses and reported AABBs.
           For `v12`, `v13` is `(0.242, 0.185, 0.781, ...)`. The AABB for `v12` is `((0.197, 0.14), (0.287, 0.23))`.
           If `v13` is the pose, then `v13_x + local_min_x` etc.
           The object `v12` is at pose `v13` `(0.242, 0.185, 0.781)`.
           Its AABB at this pose is:
           `x`: `(0.242 + 0.197, 0.242 + 0.287)` = `(0.439, 0.529)`
           `y`: `(0.185 + 0.14, 0.185 + 0.23)` = `(0.325, 0.415)`
           This doesn't seem to correspond to the error message structure.
           
           The AABB mentioned in the error message is usually the object's AABB *in the world frame* after being transformed by the provided pose. Let's try to infer what `min_ox, max_ox, min_oy, max_oy` the system is using based on one of the error messages.
           
           Take `v8` again with `(px, py) = (0.1, 0.2)`. The error reports `((0.151, 0.333), (0.221, 0.403))`.
           This means:
           `0.1 + min_ox = 0.151` => `min_ox = 0.051`
           `0.1 + max_ox = 0.221` => `max_ox = 0.121`
           `0.2 + min_oy = 0.333` => `min_oy = 0.133`
           `0.2 + max_oy = 0.403` => `max_oy = 0.203`
           So, for `v8`, the system might be using `((0.051, 0.133), (0.121, 0.203))` as the *local* AABB. This implies the object's specified AABB in the problem statement `((-0.229, -0.331), (-0.144, -0.246))` is not the true local AABB the system uses for stability checks.
           
           Let's assume the inferred local AABBs from the error messages:
           For `v8`: `((0.051, 0.133), (0.121, 0.203))`
           For `v12`: using `(px,py) = (-0.2, -0.1)`, error reports `(( -0.235, -0.135), (-0.165, -0.065))`.
           `px + min_ox = -0.235` => `-0.2 + min_ox = -0.235` => `min_ox = -0.035`
           `px + max_ox = -0.165` => `-0.2 + max_ox = -0.165` => `max_ox = 0.035`
           `py + min_oy = -0.135` => `-0.1 + min_oy = -0.135` => `min_oy = -0.035`
           `py + max_oy = -0.065` => `-0.1 + max_oy = -0.065` => `max_oy = 0.035`
           So, for `v12`, the system might be using `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))` as the *local* AABB.
           
           For `v14`: using `(px,py) = (0.05, 0.45)`, error reports `((0.015, 0.415), (0.085, 0.485))`.
           `px + min_ox = 0.015` => `0.05 + min_ox = 0.015` => `min_ox = -0.035`
           `px + max_ox = 0.085` => `0.05 + max_ox = 0.085` => `max_ox = 0.035`
           `py + min_oy = 0.415` => `0.45 + min_oy = 0.415` => `min_oy = -0.035`
           `py + max_oy = 0.485` => `0.45 + max_oy = 0.485` => `max_oy = 0.035`
           So, for `v14`, the system might be using `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))` as the *local* AABB.
           
           This implies `v12` and `v14` are identical squares of side length `0.07`, and `v8` is `0.07` side length but shifted. This looks like a bug in the problem description vs. validation. I will proceed with these inferred local AABBs.
           
           New `min_ox, max_ox, min_oy, max_oy` for each object:
           `v8`: `((0.051, 0.133), (0.121, 0.203))`

User:      Pose #o2 = (-0.05 -0.1 0.781 0.0) for object v8 on surface v16 is not stable, as the 2D AABB of the object (AABB(lower=(-0.08500000074505806, -0.13500000149011612), upper=(-0.015000000745058056, -0.06500000149011612))) is not contained in the 2D AABB of the surface (AABB(lower=(-0.135, -0.135), upper=(0.135, 0.135))). Make sure your poses are in the format `(<x> <y> <z> <theta>)`.
           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v12`, `v14`, and `v8`, currently placed on `v11`. The goal is to move all three objects onto `v16`. `v4` is the robot arm that will perform the pick and place operations, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. There are several pre-computed poses for the objects to be placed on `v16`, represented by `#o2`. The plan will involve moving the robot base to a suitable configuration, picking up each object from its current location, and then placing it on `v16` at a collision-free pose. Since there are multiple objects to be placed on `v16` at `#o2`, I will provide different continuous values for each object on `v16`.
           
           The plan will proceed as follows:
           1. Move the base to a configuration `o3` to facilitate picking and placing.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           3. Place `v8` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           5. Place `v12` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           7. Place `v14` on `v16` at `#o2`.
           
           I am still facing issues with the stability check, which indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the object AABBs. I will again try to deduce the correct AABB from the most recent error message, as it seems my previous deductions were also incorrect.
           
           The error message for `v8` at `(-0.05, -0.1, 0.781, 0.0)` reports a transformed AABB of `((-0.085, -0.135), (-0.015, -0.065))`.
           This means:
           `px + min_ox = -0.085` => `-0.05 + min_ox = -0.085` => `min_ox = -0.035`
           `px + max_ox = -0.015` => `-0.05 + max_ox = -0.015` => `max_ox = 0.035`
           `py + min_oy = -0.135` => `-0.1 + min_oy = -0.135` => `min_oy = -0.035`
           `py + max_oy = -0.065` => `-0.1 + max_oy = -0.065` => `max_oy = 0.035`
           
           It appears that *all three objects* (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) are being treated as if their local AABB is `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))`. This means they are all identical small square objects of side `0.07` centered at their origin. This is a very important insight.
           
           Let's assume the local AABB for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` is `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))`.
           Surface `v16` AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           
           **Recalculating for all objects with local AABB `((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))`:**
           `min_ox = -0.035`, `max_ox = 0.035`
           `min_oy = -0.035`, `max_oy = 0.035`
           
           `px` range for all objects:
           `-0.135 - (-0.035) <= px <= 0.135 - 0.035`
           `-0.1 <= px <= 0.1`
           
           `py` range for all objects:
           `-0.135 - (-0.035) <= py <= 0.135 - 0.035`
           `-0.1 <= py <= 0.1`
           
           All three objects must be placed with their `(px, py)` coordinates within `(-0.1, 0.1)` for both x and y.
           Since they are all squares of `0.07` side length, and `v16` has `0.27` side length, they can definitely fit. We need to avoid collisions between them.
           
           Let's pick three distinct poses within this range:
           For `v8`: `px = -0.07`, `py = 0.07`.
           Pose for `v8`: `(-0.07, 0.07, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Transformed AABB: `(-0.07 - 0.035, 0.07 - 0.035)` to `(-0.07 + 0.035, 0.07 + 0.035)`
           `(-0.105, 0.035)` to `(-0.035, 0.105)`. This is within `v16`.
           
           For `v12`: `px = 0.0`, `py = 0.0`.
           Pose for `v12`: `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Transformed AABB: `(-0.035, -0.035)` to `(0.035, 0.035)`. This is within `v16`.
           
           For `v14`: `px = 0.07`, `py = -0.07`.
           Pose for `v14`: `(0.07, -0.07, 0.781, 0.0)`.
           Transformed AABB: `(0.07 - 0.035, -0.07 - 0.035)` to `(0.07 + 0.035, -0.07 + 0.035)`
           `(0.035, -0.105)` to `(0.105, -0.035)`. This is within `v16`.
           
           These three poses place the objects such that their transformed AABBs are within `v16`'s bounds and they do not overlap.
