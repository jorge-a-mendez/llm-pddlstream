User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (1.6315570077995892, -0.6385108037305138).
           I need to find a position (x, y) such that the Euclidean distance between (x, y) and the target point is less than or equal to 4, and the position is within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. I also need to avoid the given obstacles.
           
           Looking at the obstacles:
           There's a large central cross-shaped obstacle formed by obstacles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This makes the center of the environment difficult to navigate.
           Obstacle 5 is a thin vertical wall at x=0.
           Obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 are smaller boxes scattered around.
           
           The target is at (1.63, -0.63). This is in the top-right quadrant, near the center, but slightly to the right of the vertical wall at x=0.
           
           I should try to place the robot in areas that are relatively open and provide a good line of sight to the target. Given the target's position, placing the robot to its left, right, top, or bottom might be good, while considering the obstacles.
           
           Obstacle 13 is at ((1.22, 0.23), (1.35, 0.36)), which is somewhat near the target.
           Obstacle 12 is at ((0.86, -1.22), (1.00, -1.08)), which is also somewhat near.
           Obstacle 11 is at ((0.74, -1.48), (0.86, -1.36)).
           Obstacle 14 is at ((0.34, -1.11), (0.47, -0.98)).
           
           These obstacles are to the left and slightly below the target. This suggests that positions directly to the left of the target might be obstructed.
           
           Good areas to explore:
           1. To the right of the target.
           2. Below the target, but being mindful of the central horizontal obstacle.
           3. Above the target, again mindful of central obstacles.
           4. Further right, further down, or further up, as long as it's within range.
           
           I will generate positions around the target point, ensuring they are within the max_range=4 and within the [-2.5, 2.5] limits. I'll prioritize positions to the right, slightly below, and slightly above the target, as the left side seems more cluttered.
