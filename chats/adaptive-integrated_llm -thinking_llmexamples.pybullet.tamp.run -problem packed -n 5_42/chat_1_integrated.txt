           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).

           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.193, -0.369), (-0.099, -0.276)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.1, -0.334), (0.199, -0.235)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.111, 0.197), (0.189, 0.275)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.235, -0.066, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.12, 0.993).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.207, 0.393), (0.288, 0.475)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.146, -0.323, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.221, 0.975).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.15, -0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.925, -0.38).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.15, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.661, 0.75).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, 0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.64, 0.768).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects on v20**
           
           My goal is to place five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto the target surface, v20.  These objects are currently supported by v11, each at a distinct pose. The axioms tell me that to place an object *on* a surface, it must also be *supported* by that surface at a specific *pose*.  This means I must move each object from its initial pose on v11 to a new, supported pose on v20.  I will be using arm v4, which has grasp #o1 and base configuration v3, to pick and place these objects.
           
           My plan involves a simple sequence of *pick* and *place* actions.  First, I'll *pick* up an object using arm v4, and then *place* it onto v20 at a designated pose.  I'll repeat this process for each of the five objects. The key is to select collision-free and stable poses on v20 for each object. The poses on the `v20` surface for the objects will be within `v20`'s AABB: x will be between -0.135 and 0.135 and y will be between -0.135 and 0.135. The poses on `v20` will maintain the same z as the poses on `v11`, 0.781. I will place the objects in the following pattern: `v8` at (-0.06, 0.06), `v12` at (0.06, 0.06), `v14` at (-0.06, -0.06), `v16` at (0.06, -0.06), and `v18` at (0.0, 0.0).  Each of the poses retains the initial rotation of the objects. Since `v20` is small, it's crucial to ensure each object is placed in a way that minimizes the risk of collision, given their small size. I need to pick and place each object individually in this manner.
           
           I won't use the `move_base` action, as the `pick` and `place` actions automatically ensure the necessary `canmove()` predicate. This will also have a low cost as it involves 5 picks and 5 places.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Impossibility of Goal Achievement**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new constraint: the *only* action I can use is `move_base`. My goal, however, is to get five objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, all onto surface v20. This translates into satisfying a conjunction of `on(vX, v20)` atoms.  I know that achieving `on(?o, ?p)` hinges on having `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` predicates true. Currently, based on the initial state, all those objects are *supported* on v11.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is that `move_base` *only* manipulates the robot's base configuration – essentially, where the robot *itself* is located. It doesn't touch the positions or support relationships of the objects.  I'd need `pick` and `place` actions at the very least to satisfy `atpose` and ultimately `on`.  Those actions would change the `atpose` and `supported` predicates, which `move_base` simply can't do.
           
           Given my understanding of the problem space and the constrained actions, I'm forced to conclude: this goal is *unachievable* with the given action set.  I'm essentially trying to move objects around with only the ability to move the robot, which is a non-starter.
