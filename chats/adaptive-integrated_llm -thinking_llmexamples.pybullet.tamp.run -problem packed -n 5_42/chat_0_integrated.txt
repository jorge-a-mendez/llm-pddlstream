           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).

           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.1, -0.334), (0.199, -0.235)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.111, 0.197), (0.189, 0.275)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.235, -0.066, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.12, 0.993).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.207, 0.393), (0.288, 0.475)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.146, -0.323, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.221, 0.975).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.15, -0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.925, -0.38).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.15, 0.236, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.661, 0.75).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, 0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.64, 0.768).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with moving five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current positions on v11 to v20.  This boils down to a classic pick-and-place problem.  My initial assessment is that I need to pick each object from v11 and then place them on v20. The `on` predicate, which defines the goal, is derived from `supported` and `atpose`, so for each object, I'll need to figure out a pose on v20 that supports it, and then execute the appropriate `pick` and `place` actions.  Initially, it looks like each object *can* be supported by v20, and the planner is expecting `#o2` values to be continuous variables in its format, and so there needs to be five individual poses starting with this value for the individual objects.
           
           Looking at the problem's details, the objects are currently supported by v11 at specific poses and the initial state indicates that they are also supported by the final position at a pose `#o2`. I need to transform these facts into actions.
           
           However, the critical constraint is the list of valid action instances. I'm given only one: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This constrains my possibilities considerably, because it's a no-op, meaning it resets `canmove` to true but can't interact with the objects.  `pick` and `place` actions, which are fundamental to achieving the desired `on` predicates, are absent from this list.  This is a significant roadblock.
           
           I've re-read the instructions carefully. The statement "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" is clear.  Without `pick` and `place` instances, I can't manipulate the objects to satisfy the goal.  The single `move_base` action doesn't assist me.
           
           Therefore, despite my expertise in planning, the goal is unattainable given the strict constraints imposed by the allowable action instances. The required `pick` and `place` actions simply aren't available, meaning I have to reject the plan.
