(Thoughts: **Understanding Stable Placement for Object 6**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for object 6, which has the dimensions (0.07314755538409365, 0.07314755538409368), on surface 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). Stability means the object must fully fit within the surface boundaries after rotation.
           
           I begin by calculating the object's half-extents (`hx` and `hy`). The surface 0, a square of side 0.27, has its center at (0, 0). The stable placement constraint is that no point of the rotated bounding box may extend beyond `x_min=-0.135` or beyond `x_max=0.135`, and likewise for the y-axis.
           
           For a rotated object, the effective half-extents are computed based on the formula `abs(hx * cos(theta)) + abs(hy * sin(theta))`. Given that the object is nearly square, I can safely approximate it as square, which is when the rotation effective extents become equivalent. The maximum projection of the diagonal onto an axis becomes the maximum effective extent. I therefore use the formula `sqrt(hx^2 + hy^2)`.
           
           To achieve diverse placements, I will use four angles of rotation: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4 radians.
           
           For each rotation, I will compute the valid range for the object's center coordinates (`x` and `y`) to ensure stability.
             I will then divide each of those valid x and y range into equal-sized steps. For rotation of zero and pi/2, I will generate 4x4 grid. For rotation of pi/4 and 3pi/4, I will generate a 3x3 grid.
             This allows me to guarantee no-collisions between objects with different `x` and `y` coordinates.
           
           This systematic approach guarantees that the 50 provided placements will satisfy the stability and containment requirements and cover a variety of orientations and positions on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Placement of Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, here's the plan for placing Object ID 5, while making sure it doesn't bump into the already-placed Object ID 6. The key is that the user has given me a successful placement for Object ID 6, which I've stored. Now, for Object ID 5, I have to ensure its position doesn't conflict with that of Object ID 6. The rule is, "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." Since Object ID 6 is already in the scene and this new request is for ID 5, I must ensure there is no collision.
           
           First, I know the size of Object ID 5 (`0.0988366285947701 x 0.09883662859477016`) and that it needs to go on surface 0. Also, I know the position and orientation of Object ID 6 is `(0, 0.0, -0.09842622230795317, -0.09842622230795316)`. Since its orientation is `0.0`, its effective size is the same as its size. I've calculated the size of the objects' AABBs based on their orientation and size. With that information in mind, I need to provide 50 stable placements for Object ID 5.
           
           Now, to make sure I don't get any collisions, I'll calculate the *axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)* of Object ID 6, which is already placed. This gives me a "forbidden zone" where Object ID 5 cannot go. This P6_AABB will serve to avoid the overlap of these two objects by ensuring there is separation between them.
           
           With that, I'm going to set a dense grid on the surface 0 for object ID 5. Before I add a placement to my list, I will ensure there is no collision with Object ID 6's known placement. If there is a collision, I'll skip that placement. For efficient computation, I'll compare the extents of the two bounding boxes.
           
           I will perform this operation for a variety of thetas (orientations) such as 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4. I'll transform object 5 from surface 0 for these angles. Then, I'll iterate through the generated grid, filtering out points that don't satisfy the condition. I'll continue this for all thetas and continue until I find 50 placements. To handle the case in which some angles are sparse, I have the option to increase the grid density if not enough placements have been found.
           
           Here are the 50 stable placements I generated for Object ID 5:

(Thoughts: **My Thinking Process for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, making sure they don't crash into the two existing objects (IDs 6 and 5).  I've got the surface size (-0.135 to 0.135) and the positions and sizes of the two obstacles, plus the dimensions of my new object (0.093). The goal is to come up with a set of valid locations and orientations for the new object.
           
           First, I'll figure out the space I *can* use.  The surface is a square, so I'll consider rotating the new object at 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees. Since it’s a square, 0 and 90, and 45 and 135 will have the same AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) dimensions due to symmetry.  However, varying rotations is a good way to cover more space diversity, so I'll check all of them.
           
           To get the valid search area, I'll calculate the *effective* size of the object for each rotation.  This requires the formula for the AABB based on the object's original half-extents. Then I adjust the surface boundary by those extents. The goal is to set the `valid_x` and `valid_y` search ranges.
           
           Next, I need to generate potential locations within that area. For each rotation angle, I'll create a grid of points within the valid space.  I'll start with 8x8 grids, though I may need to adjust the grid density for the non-zero angles where the object is rotated.
           
           Now comes the collision detection. For each candidate (x, y) location and rotation angle, I need to calculate the *exact* AABB for the new object. Then, I'll check if the AABB overlaps with the AABBs of either obstacle (IDs 6 and 5). If there's no overlap with both, the placement is valid.
           
           I'll keep generating and checking placements until I have 50 unique non-colliding locations. If I don't find enough valid placements quickly, I might need to refine the grid density or try additional rotations. Ultimately, I'll return the 50 valid object placement configurations that I identified.
