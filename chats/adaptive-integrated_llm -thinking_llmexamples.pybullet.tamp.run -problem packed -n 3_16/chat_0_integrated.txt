User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.077, -0.3), (0.168, -0.209)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.093, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.457, 0.889).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.142, 0.225), (-0.044, 0.323)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.163, 0.473, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.049, 0.999).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.201, 0.435), (-0.124, 0.512)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.122, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.563, 0.826).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a problem where I need to get v8, v12, and v14 onto v16.  Essentially, I need `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` to be true.  Currently, they're all sitting on v11. The robot has two arms and a movable base, and the only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move doesn't actually *move* anything, since it's from the same base configuration to itself, nor does it affect object placement.
           
           My initial thought was to use a pick-and-place strategy: pick up each object from v11, and then place it on v16. However, the available action set is severely limited. I don't see any `pick` or `place` actions allowed.  The problem explicitly states that any action not in the list cannot be used.
           
           I checked the state axioms, and to satisfy `on(?o, ?r)`, I need `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  I know there are valid poses for the objects on v16 (as confirmed by the existing `supported` facts), but I need to modify the `atpose` facts.  Right now, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, which are on `v11`. I can't directly change these `atpose` facts with the given action.
           
           The `move_base` action doesn't modify these object poses.  Also, it would make `canmove()` false, which would then prevent further actions. The crucial point is: the *only* way to move objects is with pick and place, and those are forbidden. Therefore, there's no sequence of allowed actions that can change the initial state to the desired goal state. The goal is unreachable given the current action constraints.
