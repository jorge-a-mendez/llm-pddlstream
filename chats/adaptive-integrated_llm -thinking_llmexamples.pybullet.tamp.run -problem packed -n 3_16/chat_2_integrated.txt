User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.142, 0.225), (-0.044, 0.323)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.201, 0.435), (-0.124, 0.512)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.077, -0.3), (0.168, -0.209)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.093, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.457, 0.889).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.163, 0.473, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.049, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.122, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.563, 0.826).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. My objective is crystal clear: to position objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  Currently, these items are resting on `v11`, and it's my job to orchestrate their relocation.  I've got the PR2 robot at my disposal, equipped with two arms, `v4` and `v6`.  Fortunately, arm `v4` is the workhorse for this task, as `kin` facts are only available for it. Arm `v6` is handempty, and currently cannot be used.
           
           The tools at my disposal are "pick" and "place" actions.  The trick lies in leveraging these with precision. I will focus all actions to the `v4` arm.
           There are a couple of poses - these are represented by variables that begin with "#".
           In particular, "#o2" is the key to achieving the goal, which signifies the target location, as well as several kinematic relationships, but not the current position of the arm.
           The target positions will be at `v16`. Since I'm positioning multiple objects simultaneously, I need distinct coordinates for each one on this surface. This will be the key to plan formulation.  This is a critical aspect, and I'll detail the target poses in the "Poses" section. I will treat these as poses on `v16`.
           
           The plan unfolds in a systematic manner:
           
           1.  **Preparation:** Initially, the robot's base configuration is at `v3`. It needs to move to base configuration `#o3` which has the necessary `kin` facts for object pick-up.
           2.  **Object Retrieval:** The sequence starts by picking up `v8` from its current location, `v9`
           3.  **Precise Placement:**  Next, I'll place `v8` at its final, target pose, labeled `#o2_v8`, on surface `v16`.
           4.  **Repeating the Cycle:** This pick-and-place process is then repeated in order for the second and third objects in the plan.
               *   Pick `v12` from `v13`. Place `v12` to `#o2_v12` on `v16`.
               *   Pick `v14` from `v15`.  Place `v14` to `#o2_v14` on `v16`.
           
           The base movement at the start is something to consider. While moving the robot's base might seem unnecessary, it is required for proper robot configuration in this world. This movement is a precondition for a successful plan.  The robot is initially in base configuration `v3`, which is at `(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           *   The goal in the move is to move the robot base.
           *   This is achieved via `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           *   The system will optimize the base configuration, which means that the two are likely to be the same, making this operation of moving the base essentially zero-cost and without effect, but it must be included in the plan.
           
           Now, for these continuous variables:
           
           *   The location of `#o3` must be defined. Since it's linked with the kinematic information, and the start base position is at (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0), I'll set `#o3` to `(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0)` for the first move.  This will reduce the cost of moving.
           
           *   `#o2` is more complicated. This must be the target location for placement.
               *   I need to consider the dimensions and the relative positions. Surface `v16` has dimensions that are centered at `(0,0)`, and extend from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
               *   I will compute poses for `v8`, `v12`, `v14` based on their size and their initial positions.
               *   `v8` has bounding box dimensions of width and height of about 0.098.
                   *   Thus, I will assign it to a position near the center of the table.
               *   `v12` has similar dimensions.
               *   `v14` has smaller dimensions.
               *   I'll assign the positions:
                   *   `(#o2 v8 v16)`: `(0.093 -0.274
)

           Please provide a plan and poses that achieves the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all poses are valid and stable.

(Thoughts: **Addressing Feedback and Refining the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback, and it's clear I need to refine a few things. First, regarding the base configuration, it looks like I mis-interpreted how to handle `#o3`. It's a `bconf`, not a pose, so it shouldn't be listed in the `--Poses--:` section. I need to make sure I understand the `basemotion` cost-optimization, which states the cheapest way to move the base with 0 cost is `(move_base X X #o0)`, which will be used along with `#o3` and `v3`.
           
           The biggest challenge is ensuring the objects placed on surface `v16` are stable. The key here is the calculation of object footprints within the surface's AABB. I need to take a fresh look at my calculations:
           * **Object AABBs & Surface Containment:** I had the right idea about the AABB definitions, but the calculations had some discrepancies, mostly due to my interpretation. The `AABB` definitions for the objects are *relative to the object's center*, and the pose of the object gives the world coordinates of this center.
           *   **Re-evaluating Placement:** I re-examined the AABB dimensions of the objects `(v8, v12, and v14)` and the surface `(v16)`.  The goal is to ensure that the objects are stable. I made sure their AABBs can fit within the surface's AABB.
           *   **No Overlap:** The `AABB` dimensions allow three objects to be placed within the surface without overlap. I re-computed the placement positions.
               *   `v8`: centered at `(-0.05, -0.05)` and AABB `([-0.099, -0.001], [-0.099, -0.001])`.
               *   `v12`: centered at `(0.05, 0.05)` and AABB `([0.0045, 0.0955], [0.0045, 0.0955])`.
               *   `v14`: centered at `(-0.05, 0.05)` and AABB `([-0.0885, -0.0115], [0.0115, 0.0885])`.
               This set of poses looks good because the non-overlap is confirmed using the AABBs.
           
           With these calculations and an understanding of the relationship between object center and object AABB, the plan now looks like this:
           1. `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` : Set `atbconf(#o3)` to be true, by setting `#o3 = v3` implicitly.
           2. `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3. `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4. `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5. `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`

           I am confident that the new plan will place the objects stably and according to the instructions. I have the updated calculations for pose positions and object AABBs.

Model:     **Addressing Feedback and Refining the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback, and it's clear I need to refine a few things. First, regarding the base configuration, it looks like I mis-interpreted how to handle `#o3`. It's a `bconf`, not a pose, so it shouldn't be listed in the `--Poses--:` section. I need to make sure I understand the `basemotion` cost-optimization, which states the cheapest way to move the base with 0 cost is `(move_base X X #o0)`, which will be used along with `#o3` and `v3`.
           
           The biggest challenge is ensuring the objects placed on surface `v16` are stable. The key here is the calculation of object footprints within the surface's AABB. I need to take a fresh look at my calculations:
           * **Object AABBs & Surface Containment:** I had the right idea about the AABB definitions, but the calculations had some discrepancies, mostly due to my interpretation. The `AABB` definitions for the objects are *relative to the object's center*, and the pose of the object gives the world coordinates of this center.
           *   **Re-evaluating Placement:** I re-examined the AABB dimensions of the objects `(v8, v12, and v14)` and the surface `(v16)`.  The goal is to ensure that the objects are stable. I made sure their AABBs can fit within the surface's AABB.
           *   **No Overlap:** The `AABB` dimensions allow three objects to be placed within the surface without overlap. I re-computed the placement positions.
               *   `v8`: centered at `(-0.05, -0.05)` and AABB `([-0.099, -0.001], [-0.099, -0.001])`.
               *   `v12`: centered at `(0.05, 0.05)` and AABB `([0.0045, 0.0955], [0.0045, 0.0955])`.
               *   `v14`: centered at `(-0.05, 0.05)` and AABB `([-0.0885, -0.0115], [0.0115, 0.0885])`.
               This set of poses looks good because the non-overlap is confirmed using the AABBs.
           
           With these calculations and an understanding of the relationship between object center and object AABB, the plan now looks like this:
           1. `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` : Set `atbconf(#o3)` to be true, by setting `#o3 = v3` implicitly.
           2. `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3. `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4. `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5. `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6. `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7. `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           I am confident that the new plan will place the objects stably and according to the instructions. I have the updated calculations for pose positions and object AABBs.
           

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v30) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Refinement of the Planning Strategy**
           
           The previous plan failed due to a crucial misunderstanding of how the system handles base configurations. I initially assumed that assigning the base configuration `v3` to the object placeholder `#o3` would implicitly satisfy the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition required for `pick` and `place` actions. However, the system treats `#o3` as a distinct object until explicitly defined. The key insight is that I need to *explicitly* set `atbconf(#o3)` through a `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, the first action in the plan must be `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This action establishes `atbconf(#o3)` and sets `#o3`'s continuous value to be the same as `v3`. This corrects the problem.
           
           Additionally, I need to provide placement poses on v16 for the objects v8, v12, and v14 which were not part of the previous failure. To calculate valid placement poses, I need to consider each object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) relative to its origin. The prompt states that to ensure stable placement, I must calculate the allowed ranges for each object's *footprint center* on v16. I used a method that derives these object's centers to calculate their positions. I ensured that each object's footprint center remained within v16's bounds. I found and fixed the overlap problem by using a quadrant configuration. I've calculated the world AABB footprint for each of those objects.
           
           Finally, I'm confident that these placement poses are valid and will result in the successful execution of the plan. The solution to the "atbconf(v30) is not satisfied!" issue lies in explicitly moving to the base configuration using the `move_base` action with the correct object.

(Thoughts: **My primary concern right now is generating stable and non-overlapping poses for three objects (v8, v12, and v14) on surface v16.** The user's feedback highlighted that my previous attempts resulted in unstable placements, with object footprints exceeding the surface's boundaries. I also need to provide the base configuration `#o3` (which represents the robot's starting position) in a format that's causing some confusion due to a rigid error-checking system.
           
           To ensure stability, I'm meticulously calculating the valid `(px, py)` ranges for each object based on its AABB and the surface's AABB.  The general constraint is that the object's footprint (the object's AABB shifted by `(px, py)`) must be fully contained within the surface's AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've learned to:
           *   Calculate `px` range: `-0.135 - minx <= px <= 0.135 - maxx`
           *   Calculate `py` range: `-0.135 - miny <= py <= 0.135 - maxy`
           
           I initially tried to just pick `px, py` values within these ranges, but I ran into overlapping footprints. I also found that picking *centered* positions was problematic. I'm now adopting a strategy of placing objects in distinct corners and regions to avoid overlap.
           
           My biggest challenge is to account for the object's internal geometry and to find poses that do not overlap with other objects or the surface boundaries.
           
           I've discovered that it's challenging to find *any* combination of positions that does not result in footprint overlap.
           
           After numerous attempts and geometric reasoning, I finally arrived at a set of poses that seem to work:
           *   **v8:** positioned such that its x-range is -0.135 to -0.037.  y-range is -0.049 to 0.049.  This centers v8's y range in the v16 footprint.
           *   **v14:** positioned such that its x-range is -0.036 to 0.041. y-range is -0.0385 to 0.0385. This gives a small x overlap on v8.
           *   **v12:** positioned such that its x-range is 0.042 to 0.133. y-range is -0.0455 to 0.0455.
           
           These x-footprints are near each other but do not overlap, in order for the surface to fit them all within the allowable area. The arrangement of the objects on v16 is now in a straight line, as far as possible to be sure there are not any overlaps.
           
           In addition to this, the system is rigidly checking continuous values, so I'm also providing a starting base configuration value. I've been instructed that the plan requires that I present my starting value for bconf, #o3, according to a particular syntax, as if it was a pose of an object on a surface. Because bconf is not a pose by definition, this may be an error in the system. However, in order to comply, I've had to make a dummy object/surface pairing, but I think that is an issue.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The feedback I'm getting points to consistently unstable pose calculations for object `#o2`, specifically, leading to placements that extend beyond surface `v16`. Also, the format for `#o3` seems to be incorrect, but I'll get to that.
           
           The key challenge is figuring out a method to guarantee the object's AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) is within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           **Delving into AABB Calculations**
           
           Let's break down the problem. `v16`'s AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. For a given object, its relative AABB is defined from `(minx_rel, miny_rel)` to `(maxx_rel, maxy_rel)` relative to its origin.
           
           If the object's origin is at `(px, py)` in world coordinates, then the world AABB is `(px + minx_rel, py + miny_rel)` to `(px + maxx_rel, py + maxy_rel)`.
           For stability, these conditions must hold true.
           
           *   `px + minx_rel >= -0.135` => `px >= -0.135 - minx_rel`
           *   `px + maxx_rel <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.135 - maxx_rel`
           *   `py + miny_rel >= -0.135` => `py >= -0.135 - miny_rel`
           *   `py + maxy_rel <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.135 - maxy_rel`
           
           These conditions determine the valid ranges for `px` and `py`. I need to ensure these bounds are met for each object, and thus each posed value.
           
           **Object Analysis and Validator Discrepancies**
           
           *   **Object v8:** Its AABB is `((-0.142, 0.225), (-0.044, 0.323))`.
               *   I've calculated the ranges for v8 as:
                   *   `px_range_v8 = [0.007, 0.179]`
                   *   `py_range_v8 = [-0.360, -0.188]`
               *   Previously, I had selected `(0.007, -0.274)` for `v8`. However, the validator's error message shows a different world AABB for `v8` compared to my calculations, suggesting a fundamental disagreement on AABB interpretation.
           
           The validator has issues with my calculated AABB for the pose I have chosen for `v8`. The error message provides a world AABB that looks significantly different from mine. Also, it expects to see `#o3`, which it shouldn't. Something's off.
           
           **Hypothesis #1: The Validator's Misinterpretation of AABB Data**
           
           I initially thought there was a problem with the AABB calculation. But I am almost sure my math is right. Let's make an assumption that the `AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))` are centered on the *object's origin*, and pose values place the origin.
           
           I have found from the initial state's description, the validator correctly assesses stability for the known configuration. I did not realize that `(minx_o, miny_o)` is a description of object AABB from the object's origin, which is standard interpretation.
           
           **Hypothesis #2: The Validator's Centered AABB and a Standardized Sized "Footprint"**
           
           Looking at the error message, the x and y dimensions are 0.07. This suggests the validator is using a *simplified* and standardized `0.07x0.07` AABB for all objects, centered on the *pose location*. If so, the object's true geometry is irrelevant, and the poses need adjusting.
           
           *   **Recalculating with the `0.07 x 0.07` Footprint**
               *   Given my current understanding, I am assuming the validators treats a 0.07 AABB, the poses can be readily calculated. This is only way to explain the error message.
               *   This implies, `px` and `py` need to be in `[-0.1, 0.1]` for surface `v16`.

Model:     **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The feedback I'm getting points to consistently unstable pose calculations for object `#o2`, specifically, leading to placements that extend beyond surface `v16`. Also, the format for `#o3` seems to be incorrect, but I'll get to that.
           
           The key challenge is figuring out a method to guarantee the object's AABB (Axis Aligned Bounding Box) is within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           **Delving into AABB Calculations**
           
           Let's break down the problem. `v16`'s AABB is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. For a given object, its relative AABB is defined from `(minx_rel, miny_rel)` to `(maxx_rel, maxy_rel)` relative to its origin.
           
           If the object's origin is at `(px, py)` in world coordinates, then the world AABB is `(px + minx_rel, py + miny_rel)` to `(px + maxx_rel, py + maxy_rel)`.
           For stability, these conditions must hold true.
           
           *   `px + minx_rel >= -0.135` => `px >= -0.135 - minx_rel`
           *   `px + maxx_rel <= 0.135` => `px <= 0.135 - maxx_rel`
           *   `py + miny_rel >= -0.135` => `py >= -0.135 - miny_rel`
           *   `py + maxy_rel <= 0.135` => `py <= 0.135 - maxy_rel`
           
           These conditions determine the valid ranges for `px` and `py`. I need to ensure these bounds are met for each object, and thus each posed value.
           
           **Object Analysis and Validator Discrepancies**
           
           *   **Object v8:** Its AABB is `((-0.142, 0.225), (-0.044, 0.323))`.
               *   I've calculated the ranges for v8 as:
                   *   `px_range_v8 = [0.007, 0.179]`
                   *   `py_range_v8 = [-0.360, -0.188]`
               *   Previously, I had selected `(0.007, -0.274)` for `v8`. However, the validator's error message shows a different world AABB for `v8` compared to my calculations, suggesting a fundamental disagreement on AABB interpretation.
           
           The validator has issues with my calculated AABB for the pose I have chosen for `v8`. The error message provides a world AABB that looks significantly different from mine. Also, it expects to see `#o3`, which it shouldn't. Something's off.
           
           **Hypothesis #1: The Validator's Misinterpretation of AABB Data**
           
           I initially thought there was a problem with the AABB calculation. But I am almost sure my math is right. Let's make an assumption that the `AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))` are centered on the *object's origin*, and pose values place the origin.
           
           I have found from the initial state's description, the validator correctly assesses stability for the known configuration. I did not realize that `(minx_o, miny_o)` is a description of object AABB from the object's origin, which is standard interpretation.
           
           **Hypothesis #2: The Validator's Centered AABB and a Standardized Sized "Footprint"**
           
           Looking at the error message, the x and y dimensions are 0.07. This suggests the validator is using a *simplified* and standardized `0.07x0.07` AABB for all objects, centered on the *pose location*. If so, the object's true geometry is irrelevant, and the poses need adjusting.
           
           *   **Recalculating with the `0.07 x 0.07` Footprint**
               *   Given my current understanding, I am assuming the validators treats a 0.07 AABB, the poses can be readily calculated. This is only way to explain the error message.
               *   This implies, `px` and `py` need to be in `[-0.1, 0.1]` for surface `v16`.
