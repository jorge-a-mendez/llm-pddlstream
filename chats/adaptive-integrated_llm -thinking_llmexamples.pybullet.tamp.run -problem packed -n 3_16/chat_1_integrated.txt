User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.142, 0.225), (-0.044, 0.323)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.201, 0.435), (-0.124, 0.512)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.077, -0.3), (0.168, -0.209)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.093, 0.274, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.457, 0.889).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.163, 0.473, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.049, 0.999).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.122, -0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.563, 0.826).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Instance Constraint**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goals `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  This means I need to move objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16, starting from their initial positions on surface v11. The robot has two arms, but only arm v4 has the necessary kinematic information for the task. The plan, as I initially envisioned it, would have been: pick up each object using arm v4, and place them on surface v16 at carefully chosen positions, denoted as #o2_v8_v16, #o2_v12_v16, and #o2_v14_v16.
           
           However, a crucial constraint is introduced. I am only allowed to use action instances (specific applications of actions) that are explicitly listed.  The given list consists solely of `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, a no-op move.  No instances of the `pick` or `place` actions that are essential for manipulating the objects are provided.  
           
           According to the instructions, any action instance not listed is prohibited.  Since `pick` and `place` are not in the permitted list, I am *unable* to move the objects.  The initial state specifies the objects' starting positions on table `v11`, and the goal requires their positions to be on table `v16`. Since `pick` and `place` actions are required to transform the `atpose` of an object, and they are forbidden, the overall goal is unattainable given this constraint. The goal, then, must be deemed unreachable.
