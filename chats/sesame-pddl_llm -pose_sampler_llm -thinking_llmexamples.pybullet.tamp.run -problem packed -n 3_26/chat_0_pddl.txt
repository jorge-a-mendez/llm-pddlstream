(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to generate 50 stable placements of a square object (ID 5, size 0.0736 x 0.0736) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27) centered at (0,0). Each placement is defined by (surface index, rotation angle, x, y). Stability means the object remains entirely within the surface bounds. I am accounting for the object's rotation.
           
           First, I recognized that because the object is a square, the effective bounding box (AABB) size changes with rotation. I calculate this AABB size based on the rotation angle using `abs(cos(theta))` and `abs(sin(theta))` to find the valid range for placing the square's center. This valid range for the object's center is affected by the rotation angle. The rotation angle is accounted for by the surface bounds.
           
           My primary strategy is to diversify both rotation angles and object positions to create a good sampling of potential placements.
           
           1.  **Angle Diversity:** I am using 10 evenly spaced angles between 0 and π/2 (inclusive), using a range of radians: `0, pi/18, pi/9, pi/6, 2pi/9, 5pi/18, pi/3, 7pi/18, 4pi/9, pi/2`. Rotations beyond π/2 are redundant for a square object and are not taken into account.
           2.  **Position Diversity:** For each angle, I need to place 5 objects (unique x,y coordinates). I will be placing positions around the middle of the valid placement space for the current angle. 
               1.  I calculate a valid range of `x` and `y` center coordinates depending on the object's AABB size.
               2.  For each angle, I will use: (1) center position, and (2-5) positions that are corner like within range to ensure stability (by offsetting slightly into the bounding box)
           3.  **Safety Checks:** Throughout the calculations, I check for edge cases. I address the scenario where the valid placement range shrinks to an invalid or extremely small interval. In this case the algorithm will try to use edge points. If still not enough, the algorithm will repeat placements to meet the `50 placements` goal.
           
           I will iterate through each angle. I determine the valid range of center coordinates, and then, based on each angle and valid range, generate a list of the 5 coordinate points. After this, each point can be placed on the object. The result is a list of 50 stable placements, ready for further processing, which should be robustly generated.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down.  I've got a new object, ID 4, a square with side length ~0.08, and I need to place it on surface 0 without colliding with object 5, which is already there, centered and unrotated. Surface 0 is bounded by +/- 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The key is avoiding collisions. I know the position and size of object 5, so I need to place object 4 *around* it.  Also, object 4 can be rotated. This rotation will affect the area it occupies.
           
           Since object 5 is centered, the best approach is to consider placement in strips or corners. Because of rotation, the best positions will always be away from the object that has a fixed position, i.e. object 5. Because of the size, at particular angles the only possibility is that object 4 is placed strictly in a strip, or can't be placed at all without a rotation. The largest effective dimension that I need to calculate is based on the angle of rotation, I'll call it `half_s_eff`, and this needs to fit within the placement region and avoid overlapping with object 5.
           
           I will be working with the AABB of object 4 and object 5. I will make a list of valid x,y positions by finding the edges of object 5. Object 4 can be placed to either side or above or below. Then I will calculate the range of safe placement by adding `half_s_eff` to avoid the collisions.  These "safe" regions will be the strips and corners created. I need to make sure the AABB of both objects do not overlap.
           
           Here's the problem: at certain angles the object just won't fit to the side.  The maximum *effective* side length occurs at 45 degrees. At angles close to that I can't place it and avoid collision. At those higher angles, the area needed to be safe exceeds what's available.
           
           So, I will focus on 4 specific angles,  0, pi/18, 4pi/9, and pi/2, for the most practical distribution of placements. I will generate 50 distinct locations overall. For each angle, I need to place 12-13 times in different parts of the safe region I've calculated (top/bottom/left/right) I'll consider the midpoints of the strips and the edges to get a good spread of placements.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of object 6 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with the existing objects 5 and 4. Here's my breakdown:
           
           1.  **Defining the Space:**  Surface 0 is a square,  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to account for object 6's size and possible rotations.
           
           2.  **Object Sizes:**  Object 6 is a square of side  `s6`. Object 5 and 4 are also squares, with sides `s5` and `s4` respectively.  I calculate half-extents for each object (e.g., `s5_half`) to simplify AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) calculations.
           
           3.  **Rotation and Effective Size:** To handle rotations, I calculate the effective half-extent  `h6` of object 6 based on its side `s6` and rotation angle `theta`.  The maximum effective extent `h6_max` occurs at `pi/4` rotation. I realize it's best to stick to specific, easily calculated angles.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance (Key):**  The core of the strategy is collision avoidance. For each potential placement  `(x, y)` of object 6's center, I need to ensure it's outside the combined AABB of objects 4 and 5, plus a buffer for the maximum rotated size of object 6.  I must check if the center of the object lies outside the combined AABB region by comparing the center x, y coordinates to the edges of AABB of the obstacles.
           
           5.  **Finding Valid Areas:**
               *   **Surface Bounds:** The center  `(x, y)` must stay within the surface's bounds, minus  `h6` to prevent object 6 from going off the surface.
               *   **Forbidden Zones:** Areas occupied or influenced by objects 4 and 5 are forbidden. I calculate "collision regions" around each object, extending them by  `h6`. Object 6's center can't be inside these regions.
               *   **Combined Forbidden Region:** The total forbidden region is the union of object 4's collision region and object 5's.  I must make sure `(x, y)` is outside of this space.
           
           6.  **Angle Selection:**  Because the size of the combined AABB varies with rotation (the most constrained being pi/6), I will check only these three rotations: `theta = 0`, `pi/18`, `pi/9`, and then mirror their angles. This gives 6 unique angles, while generating 50 positions.
           
           7.  **Iterative Placement:**  For each angle, I calculate  `h6` and surface bounds. Then, I define collision rectangles  `R4` and `R5` for each angle, and calculate the available placement positions `(x, y)`. I will define a list of tuples like this:  `[(angle, (x, y)) for angle in selected_angles, (x, y) in placement_coordinates]`, where angles can repeat.
           
           8.  **Refinement:**  The strategy will iterate through angles. Because rotating object 6 causes AABB variations, I will re-check the effective size of each.
           
           9.  **Point Generation and Verification:**  I carefully construct candidate points, which are then refined for diversity. I double-check the placement coordinates, to make sure the combined rectangle of object 4 and object 5 do not overlap object 6's AABB. I also take care to avoid placing objects on borders.
           
           10. **Final Point Set:** I generate and verify the final placement coordinate set of 50 points by repeating the 25 unique placements for the mirrored angles.
           
           This approach combines surface boundary constraints, collision detection with clear and efficient point generation and placement.
