(Thoughts: **Placement Generation Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object with ID 4, which is a square with extents of (0.09084435418048664, 0.09084435418048664). This means its side length is 0.09084435418048664.  The only available surface is surface 0, a square centered at (0, 0) with extents of (0.27, 0.27). A placement is defined by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where surf_idx is always 0. Theta is the rotation angle, and (x, y) is the center of the object's AABB.
           
           Since the object is a square, its effective size after rotation is given by s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))), where s is the object side.  The maximum effective size is achieved at a 45-degree angle. The half-width of the surface is 0.135.
           
           My strategy involves generating a diverse set of placements by varying the rotation angle and the object's position within the surface. I will use 25 different angles and two positions per angle to generate the required 50 placements. I chose this number because it gives me flexibility to place more positions around the surface.
           
           I've determined that the key is to consider `effective_half_size = s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'll calculate `max_coord_abs(theta) = 0.135 - effective_half_size(theta)`. Then, for each angle `theta`, I'll place the object at the center, then at a point on one of the edges or corners, by using this max_coord_abs, and thus get a diversity of positions around the surface. If there are not sufficient room to do so, a placement at (0,0) will always be available.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object 5. I've got a new request, Object 5, with dimensions that make it practically a square. My primary concern is avoiding collisions with Object 4, which is already successfully placed on Surface 0.
           
           Based on the known data, Object 4 is placed at the center of the surface. Its bounding box, due to zero rotation, is easily defined. The trick is: Object 5's placement *must not overlap* with this.
           
           I've determined that Object 5 can only be placed within the boundaries of Surface 0, which also limits the available placements. The key is to calculate the effective size of Object 5 based on its rotation (theta). The effective size is influenced by `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` and the actual side length of the square, `s5`. This relationship is critical.
           
           To avoid collision, I've calculated a "clearance" or "forbidden zone" around Object 4.  Object 5's center must stay outside this. Using this, I can define the maximum allowable `x` and `y` coordinates for Object 5 relative to object 4. This is basically the radius `M` of the surface less the effective half-size.
           
           However, a key insight is that *most* rotations are useless!  My earlier calculations revealed that the effective side length of Object 5 becomes larger with rotations other than 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2. In effect, most rotations cause the object to effectively be larger than the allowable space after the obstacle is taken into account. This means, I will focus on using the least "rotations" possible.
           
           My strategy now is to use almost only zero rotation, with a few rotations at 90 degrees.
             I will generate many positions using zero degrees of rotation, which are safe in their distance from the central object.  The positions will be placed on the boundary between the allowed and forbidden zones to get the maximum number of placements.
           The boundary of the allowed area is: the surface limit MINUS object 4.
           
           I calculated specific placements using the coordinates, such as ` (0.09373766239, 0.09373766239)`.
           In other words, I have a square boundary to work with. I will only pick rotation zero to have maximum placements. In addition, I will use rotation 90 degrees twice. This fulfills the placement requirement to find 50 different placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object, ID 6, that I need to place stably 50 times on Surface 0.  I've got to work around Objects 4 and 5, which are already in place, and avoid any collisions. Surface 0's a square with dimensions of 0.27, so I've got to stay within that area.  Object 6 is a square of size 0.0715, meaning its AABB is 0.0715 as well.
           
           I'm thinking rotation is tricky, but let's assume `theta = 0` for now because that simplifies things, makes my `half_s6_eff` for object 6's bounding box minimal at 0.0357, and potentially maximizes the area.
           
           So, Object 4's a square of size 0.0908, centered at (0,0), and I need to avoid it.  Object 5's also a square, size 0.0825, and positioned at about (0.09, 0.09). Avoiding collisions with Object 4 requires the center of Object 6 to be far enough from Object 4's center.  I need to ensure that the distance is greater than the sum of half the extents. Object 5 is trickier because it's in a corner of the surface and its bounding box must avoid that corner. I will simplify the strategy by using only a bounding box check and setting `theta = 0`.
           
           The main challenge is to find a set of 50 stable positions on the surface where Object 6 won't overlap with any part of Objects 4 or 5. To start, the area I have to work with is the center of Surface 0.
           
           So, to ensure that Object 6 doesn't collide, I've defined a few regions where the placement of Object 6 must be. I can think of it as these steps:
           1.  **Region 1:**  Places Object 6 on the left.
           2.  **Region 2:** Places Object 6 on the bottom.
           3.  **Region 3:** Places Object 6 on the right and on the top.
           
           I will use a combination of these regions, covering the available surface with x, y values at specific points. I have made sure that the point sets include points that follow all the given constraints. By following this method, I can find 57 total points to generate 50 stable object placements for ID 6.
           
           Let's do it!

(Thoughts: **The Object Placement Puzzle: A Focused Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for a square object (Object 6) on a specific surface (Surface 0). Object 6 has a side length of approximately 0.0715. Surface 0 is a square area defined by coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The challenge is to avoid collisions with previously placed objects (Object 4 and Object 5) and the 42 existing instances of Object 6 from the previous iteration.
           
           Based on prior attempts, I've identified key constraints. Object 4, centered at (0, 0), is an obstacle, and Object 5, placed in the corners, further restricts placement options. My goal is to maximize placements while satisfying these rules.
           
           To calculate placement options, the valid placement region is constrained by the surface limits, and also considering the bounds around the previous ID 6's locations to prevent overlap. I also have to consider the fact that Object 5's corners restrict Object 6's placement. Because the objects are placed in the corners, the areas in the corner regions of Surface 0 where the center of Object 6 *cannot* be located are defined by the placement of the previous instances of object ID 5.
           
           Therefore, for ID 6 to successfully place, the center point must be *outside* the central space `x = 0`, `y=0`. Furthermore, the corners *cannot* be used because this is where a previous instance of ID 5 exists.
           
           Therefore, after calculating the bounds of Object 6 and Object 5, and the clearance required, I devised a strategy. Instead of focusing on generating the maximum number of potential candidate points, the strategy identifies the available regions for the center. The regions are defined to be within the rectangle, but *outside* the center region and the corners (where ID 5 objects are placed). Thus, the region for placing the center is a thin border around the edge of the board, around where Object 6's ID 6 instances already exist, and excluding the 4 corner regions.
           
           By carefully selecting points in these specific regions, I can ensure that any of the 50 placements I generate will be distinct and avoid any collisions with prior objects.
