           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.309, -0.474), (4.574, 0.617)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.318, -0.459), (4.417, -0.36)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.476, 0.09), (-4.393, 0.173)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.435, 0.131, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.63, 0.777).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom indicating that at least one `graspable` object (`culprit`) does not have `(=(?culprit, ?o))` as a fact. This means that to achieve the goal, we need to pick up an object, any object, and thus satisfy `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)`. The provided actions allow us to pick up `v8`, `v12`, or `v15`.
           
           The initial state shows that `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`, `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`, and `v15` is at `v16` on `v11`. All objects are graspable.
           
           The previous plan failed because `pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0` had a collision during the trajectory `t0`. This means that the robot arm while picking up `v8` from `v9` would collide with `v15` at `v16`. Since both `v8` and `v15` are on `v11` (which is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`), they are close to each other.
           
           Therefore, to avoid collision, we should either pick up `v12` from `v13` (which is on `v14` ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))) as it is far from other objects, or we can pick up `v8` or `v15` and place them on a different pose to resolve the collision. Since `v12` is far from `v8` and `v15`, picking `v12` should avoid collision.
           
           Let's try to pick `v12` from `v13`. The action is `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t7)`.
           The preconditions are:
           - `kin(v4, v12, v13, #g2, #q4, #t7)`: This is true.
           - `atpose(v12, v13)`: True.
           - `handempty(v4)`: True.
           - `atbconf(#q4)`: False, current `atbconf(v3)`. So, we need to `move_base v3 #q4 #t8`.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v12, v13, #g2)`: Needs to be checked. Assuming this is fine since it's an object far away.
           - `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#t7)`: Needs to be checked. Assuming this is fine.
           - `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(v12)`: True (no culprit).
           
           If we pick `v12`, then the goal `new-axiom@0()` will be satisfied since `NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)` will be satisfied by `v12`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 #q4 #t8)
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t7)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` is `Conjunction NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o) Atom graspable(?culprit)`. This means we need to *not* have `(=(something, ?o))` where `something` is a graspable object. The goal is satisfied if there is some `graspable` object `o` that is not equal to `culprit` for which `new-axiom@0(o)` is being evaluated. When we pick up an object, say `v12`, it is no longer `atpose(v12, v13)`, but rather `atgrasp(v4, v12, #g2)`. So, `new-axiom@0(v12)` implies that `v12` is not `culprit`. This goal `new-axiom@0()` is essentially stating that *some* graspable object is not equal to `o`. However, this is always true as long as there is more than one graspable object. The initial state already contains `graspable(v8)`, `graspable(v12)`, and `graspable(v15)`. Therefore, the `new-axiom@0()` is *already satisfied* if we consider `culprit` to be, for example, `v8` and `o` to be `v12`. The goal in this form appears to be a trick.
           
           Let me re-read the definition of `new-axiom@0(?o: object)` and the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           The definition of `new-axiom@0(?o: object)` is:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0(?o: object)
             Conjunction
               NegatedAtom =(?culprit, ?o)
               Atom graspable(?culprit)
           ```
           The goal is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. This typically implies `new-axiom@0(some_object)` should be true. However, without an explicit argument for `new-axiom@0()`, it means that there must exist *some* object `?o` for which `new-axiom@0(?o)` is true. If this is the case, and there are multiple graspable objects (e.g., `v8`, `v12`), then `new-axiom@0(v8)` could be true by picking `v12` as `culprit`, satisfying `NegatedAtom =(?v12, v8)` and `Atom graspable(v12)`. Or `new-axiom@0(v12)` could be true by picking `v8` as `culprit`. This means the goal is already satisfied in the initial state as long as there are at least two graspable objects.
           
           However, since the planning system indicated the plan was invalid due to `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`, it implies that the interpretation of `new-axiom@0()` must be that *some* object *should be affected* to satisfy it. Given that we are supposed to create a plan involving robot actions, a common interpretation of such a goal with an implicit object is that some state change involving a graspable object must occur to satisfy it. The most direct way to change the state of a graspable object is to pick it up. This changes `atpose` to `atgrasp`, and consequently `on` will no longer be true.
           
           Let's assume the intent of `new-axiom@0()` is that some object needs to be picked up to be considered 'culprit' for the axiom to hold in an active sense. The previous plan tried to pick up `v8` but failed due to collision. The second attempt tried to pick up `v12` which is spatially separated from `v8` and `v15`, making it a more promising candidate to avoid collisions. The failure message `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()` suggests that simply picking `v12` is not enough to satisfy the axiom in the way the system expects.
           
           The axiom `new-axiom@0(?o: object)` states that `?o` is *not* `culprit` and `culprit` is graspable. The goal `new-axiom@0()` probably means that there exists *some* object `X` such that `new-axiom@0(X)` is true in the final state. If `X` is an object, then it is not equal to `culprit` for some graspable object `culprit`. This is true if there are two distinct graspable objects.
           
           Let's consider the axiom definitions for `new-axiom@1()`, `new-axiom@0()` etc., which appear multiple times in the problem description. They all contain `Atom on(?green, v18) Atom type(?green, v17)`. The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v15` are of type `v17`. `v18` is a surface `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `stackable(v12, v18)` and `stackable(v8, v18)` are true.
           This suggests the goal might be related to `on(?green, v18)`. If `?green` refers to `v8` or `v12`, then the goal might implicitly mean that either `v8` or `v12` needs to be placed on `v18`.
           
           Let's try to place `v8` on `v18`. The pose for this is `#p1`.
           Initial state: `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`.
           Goal for `v8`: `on(v8, v18)`. This requires `atpose(v8, #p1)` and `supported(v8, #p1, v18)`.
           Actions:
           1. `move_base v3 #q2 #t5` (move to configuration to pick `v8` from `v9`)
           2. `pick v4 v8 v9 #g1 #q2 #t4` (pick `v8` from `v9`)
           3. `move_base #q2 #q3 #t10` (move to configuration to place `v8` on `#p1` on `v18`)
           4. `place v4 v8 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t6` (place `v8` on `#p1` on `v18`)
           
           The previous failure of picking `v8` from `v9` was due to collision with `v15` at `v16`. `v11` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6))`. `v9` is `(4.5, 0.3, 0.8)`. `v16` is `(4.35, 0.3, 0.8)`. These are indeed very close. To avoid collision, we need to provide a new pose for `v15` or not consider `v15` at all during `v8`'s pick. The problem states to use available poses.
           
           Since the goal `new-axiom@0()` is vague, and its multiple definitions involve `on(?green, v18)`, it is most likely that the actual task is to place one of the objects (`v8` or `v12`) on `v18`. Let's assume `?green` refers to `v8` since `stackable(v8, v18)` is given.
           
           To place `v8` on `v18`:
           1. Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` on `v11`.
           2. Place `v8` on `#p1` on `v18`.
           
           The collision during `pick v4 v8 v9 #g1 #q2 #t4` occurred because `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`. This means the robot's arm trajectory to pick `v8` from `v9` collided with `v15` at `v16`. Since `v15` is on `v11`, very close to `v8`, we cannot simply pick `v8` without moving `v15`. However, we cannot move `v15` first, as the goal is to make `new-axiom@0()` true, which we are interpreting as placing something on `v18`. So, we need to choose an object such that picking it does not cause collisions.
           
           Let's revisit picking `v12`. `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`. `v14` is `((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6))`. This is far from `v15` and `v8` which are on the right side of the robot. So, picking `v12` should not cause collisions with `v8` or `v15`.
           
           Plan to pick `v12`:
           1. `move_base v3 #q4 #t8` (move to configuration to pick `v12` from `v13`)
           2. `pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t7` (pick `v12` from `v13`)
           
           If this satisfies the goal, then we are good. The system's previous response was `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`, suggesting this sequence alone wasn't enough. However, the exact meaning of `new-axiom@0()` is ambiguous. If the multiple definitions of `new-axiom@0()` are relevant, they all suggest placing `?green` (an object of type `v17`) on `v18`. Both `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. `v18` is a stackable surface for `v8` and `v12`.
           
           Let's try picking `v12` and placing it on `v18` at `#p2`. This would make `on(v12, v18)` true.
           1. `move_base v3 #q4 #t8`
           2. `pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t7`
           3. `move_base #q4 #q5 #o0` (move to configuration to place `v12` on `#p2` on `v18`)
           4. `place v4 v12 #p2 #g2 #q5 #t9`
           
           Let's provide this plan with the assumption that `new-axiom@0()` implicitly means to put one of the type `v17` objects on `v18`. `v12` is suitable for this.
