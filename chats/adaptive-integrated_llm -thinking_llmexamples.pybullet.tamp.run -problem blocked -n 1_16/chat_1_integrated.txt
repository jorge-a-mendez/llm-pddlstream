User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.423, -0.415), (-4.341, -0.333)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.382, -0.374, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.638, 0.77).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()`: My Plan**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to placing an object, let's call it *green*, onto a specific surface, *v18*. I see two *types* of objects in the initial state, one of which *green* can be.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I can see that *green* could be either *v8* or *v12*. The *on* axiom dictates that to be "on" something, an object needs to be both supported and at the correct pose.  I need to ensure *v8* or *v12* ends up *on* *v18*.  I'll start with placing *v8* *on* *v18* as the solution.
           
           Initially, *v8* is *on* *v11*.  To make *v8* *on* *v18*, I need to first grab *v8* with the available arm *v4*, currently empty, with the help of the available *kin*ematic. *v4* can grasp *v8* at current state (which *v9*) and move *v8* to surface *v18* so it would be at *#o2*.  I'll do that by executing two steps.
           *   First, I pick *v8* using arm *v4* by performing `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           *   Then, I place *v8* on *v18* using `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           Now, for those continuous values.  The only one I *need* to define is the pose `#o2`, which tells me where to place *v8* on the surface *v18*. Based on their geometry, I've calculated that a safe and stable pose for *v8* on *v18* is (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), with a zero rotation (0.0).  So, I will specify `4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0` as the value for `#o2`. I assume that this object can be grasped without collision and with no additional parameters since there is nothing about `#o1` in the initial state and the only related predicate is `grasp(v8, #o1)`.
           
           No movement of the base is needed. So, this plan is the most efficient. This plan is validated since all the initial preconditions will be met.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having something green, specifically `v8`, `on v18`.  Given my expert knowledge, I know that means `v8` needs to be in a specific pose, #o2.  Currently, `v8` is in pose `v9`.
           
           My previous plan was using `pick` and `place` to move `v8` to the desired pose. However, the available action is limited to `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only changes the robot's base configuration, not the object's pose. This is where the problem hits me.
           
           Since `move_base` can't manipulate objects directly, and I need to change `v8`'s pose to satisfy the goal, it's immediately clear that achieving this goal with the given valid actions is impossible. I'm hitting a fundamental constraint that I, as an expert in this field, understand to be a critical roadblock. The robot's base configuration can move, but the object's position is fixed. I need to inform the user that their goal is unreachable given the current state and action limitations.
