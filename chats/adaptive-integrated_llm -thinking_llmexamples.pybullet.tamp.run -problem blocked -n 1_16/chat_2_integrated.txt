User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.423, -0.415), (-4.341, -0.333)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.382, -0.374, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.638, 0.77).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear picture of what needs to happen. My main goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type (v17) placed on a surface (v18).  I can see that I have two objects of type v17 available: v8 and v12.  Both are stackable on v18.
           
           Initially, I decide to work with `v8`. Currently, it's resting on a surface (v11) and at the pose `v9`. To get `v8` on `v18`, I need to execute `on(v8, v18)`. Since I have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` in the initial state, the plan requires I move `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           The initial plan:
           
           1.  Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  Place `v8` at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           Now, I need to check the action preconditions. I have to incorporate moving the robot base to the necessary configuration. This prompts me to move the base from the initial position `v3` to `#o3`. Then, `v8` is picked, and placed.
           
           Therefore, the revised plan is:
           
           1.  Move the robot base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` from pose `v9`.
           3.  Place `v8` at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           All actions are carefully checked, with the preconditions noted for each step. After that, I double-check that this plan does, in fact, achieve the goal. I verify that `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` are satisfied after the plan is executed.
           
           To define the continuous pose `#o2`, I will need to consider the dimensions and positions. `v8` (object) is a small object. Also, I have the AABB definitions for both `v8` and `v18`, which I use to find a valid placement of `v8` on `v18`.
           
           The selected pose `#o2` will be placed on the middle of the surface, with a matching Z coordinate.
           
           Finally, I have a complete and detailed plan that satisfies the requirements and achieves the desired goal.
