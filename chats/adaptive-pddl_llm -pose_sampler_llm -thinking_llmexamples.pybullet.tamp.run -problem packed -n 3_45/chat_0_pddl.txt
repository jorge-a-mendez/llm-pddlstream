(Thoughts: **My Solution for Stable Object Placements**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) that's a square with sides of approximately 0.089 units, on a square surface with sides of 0.27 units, centered at (0,0). A placement is defined by the surface index (0 in this case), rotation angle (theta), and the object's center coordinates (x, y).
           
           Stability means the object must be entirely *within* the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation. Since we have a square object and a square surface, the math simplifies considerably due to symmetry.
           
           To keep things straightforward, let me define some key variables:
           `obj_s = 0.089` (object side)
           `surface_half_dim = 0.135` (half side of the square)
           
           For *any* rotation, the effective width and height of the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) are determined by `obj_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. We need to calculate how much we need to shift inside the boarder:
           `effective_side = obj_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The half of that determines how far we can move into the boarder.
           
           I've crafted a strategy to cover the space effectively. I started with a set of angles spanning 0 to π/2 to cover all possible rotations, leveraging the symmetry of the square. I then calculated the maximum allowable x and y coordinates, given the object's effective dimensions for each rotation.
           
           Here's my breakdown of how I did this:
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I've carefully picked angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and pi/8.
           2.  **Coord Range:** For *each* angle, I calculated the permissible range for x and y.
           
           I've made sure to generate enough placements by:
           
           *   Using a 5x5 grid for the angle 0.
           *   A 3x3 grid for the angle pi/4.
           *   A 3x3 grid for the angle pi/2.
           *   A 3x3 grid for the angle pi/8.
           
           I can make sure that each of the locations are calculated, and I should have 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Calculating Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a successful placement for object 4 as a point of reference. Now, I need to find 50 stable placements for object 5, which is a square with side length 0.09787391577916538, on surface 0. That surface is defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           First, I'll calculate the effective AABB size for the object for a few different rotations. I'm using the formula `s_eff = s * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`, where `s` is the side length. My goal is to determine the valid `(x, y)` ranges for different angles. I can use this information to create grids of placements, aiming to have at least 50 in total.
           
           For a 0-degree rotation, `s_eff` simply equals `s`, and I calculate `max_abs_coord` as `0.135 - s/2`, which is about 0.086063. Then I plan to generate a 5x5 grid of points, resulting in 25 placements.
           
           For a 45-degree rotation, the effective size increases, and `max_abs_coord` becomes about 0.0658. I will generate a 3x3 grid, resulting in 9 placements.
           
           For a 22.5-degree rotation, I calculate `s_eff` to find a `max_abs_coord` of around 0.07106. Then a 3x3 grid will also give me 9 placements.
           
           Finally, for a 67.5-degree rotation, I can use the same values for calculations as with 22.5 degrees. Again, I will generate a 3x3 grid to obtain an additional 9 placements.
           
           In summary, this gives me a total of 52 placements. I need 50, so I'll just take the first 50 stable placements from the generated sets. I won't need to consider collision avoidance with object 4, because I'm assuming the object does not exist in the scene when this placement occurs.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Object ID 6: A Comprehensive Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I've got to place this square object (ID 6) – dimensions `s = 0.098` – on surface `0` within the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, and I need 50 stable positions. The catch? I *must* avoid collisions with the objects already placed: ID 4 and ID 5. This adds a layer of complexity.
           
           First, I had to figure out how the object's rotation angle (`theta`) would impact the "effective" size (half-width/height, `s_eff / 2`). I calculated `s_eff` for angles 0, π/4, π/2, and π/8. Then, I had to ensure that `(x, y)` was within `[-0.135 + s_eff / 2, 0.135 - s_eff / 2]` for valid placement with respect to the bounds.
           
           Crucially, I had to calculate the AABBs for the existing objects (ID 4 and ID 5).  These objects were placed at `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.090, y=-0.090)` and `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.086, y=-0.086)` respectively. These squares were positioned such that they created a "blocked" corner in the bottom left area. I had to merge their occupied spaces so that the new placements don't overlap. I found that their AABBs mostly overlapped, so I made sure that there would be no collisions, using this logic: the valid AABBs for the new square should *not* overlap the AABB that combines both of the previous squares.
           
           The key to avoiding this blocking area is to restrict placement of the new square to a different region. I decided I'd create points around the edges of the block using a filter. So I created the following strategy for placement:
           1. I calculated `s_eff / 2` and `max_coord` for several values of rotation angles.
           2. I found the coordinates of the AABBs by calculating them, then combining their minimum coordinates for lower x and y boundaries and maximum coordinates for upper x and y boundaries, or more succinctly:
               *   Minimum x = `min(AABB_4.lower_x, AABB_5.lower_x) = -0.135`
               *   Maximum x = `max(AABB_4.upper_x, AABB_5.upper_x) = -0.0371`
               *   Minimum y = `min(AABB_4.lower_y, AABB_5.lower_y) = -0.135`
               *   Maximum y = `max(AABB_4.upper_y, AABB_5.upper_y) = -0.0371`
           3.  Given the fact that they are sharing their same coordinates, then for the new placement, the condition should be such that either the x-center, or the y-center has to pass the boundaries of that combined AABB, which can be summarized:
               `x_6 - h_6 > occ_upper_x` OR `y_6 - h_6 > occ_upper_y`  (where x_6, y_6 are object 6 center coordinates, and `h_6` is object's half-width or height).
           
           Then, for each rotation angle, I set up a grid of potential `(x, y)` coordinates and then checked for collisions.  I applied the condition `x_6 > occ_upper_x + h_6` or `y_6 > occ_upper_y + h_6` and iterated to get `(x, y)` coordinates that will not collide, from which I selected the first 50 points. For `theta = 0`, I used a 7x7 grid to find 33 valid placements. For the other rotations, I used a 3x3 grid: for `theta = pi/4, pi/2, and pi/8`, I found 5 valid placements each, with similar calculations.
           
           With the placement strategy defined, I should be able to quickly determine coordinates and rotation for ID 6 that meet the requirements.
