           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about a Plan to Achieve Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto object `v16`. This means each object needs to be *supported* by `v16` and *at* the correct *pose* on `v16`.  Essentially, I need to *move* these objects from their current location, `v11`, to `v16`. The `on` axiom spells this out clearly: `on` requires both *support* and the *correct pose* be satisfied.
           
           Breaking this down, I've got to use the robot's arm, `v4` (or `v6`, but `v4` is the only one with relevant facts), to:
           
           1.  **Pick up** each object (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`).
           2.  **Place** each object on `v16` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Examining the provided knowledge, I've got `kin` facts that tell me what's *possible*. For example, `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` indicates that arm `v4` *can* pick `v8` from pose `v9` with grasp `#o1`.  I also know that `v16` *supports* each of these objects at a *specific pose* (i.e., `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`).  So far, so good.
           
           However, a serious problem emerges: **The robot's current base configuration is `v3`, but the `kin` facts *require* a base configuration of `#o3`**. And critically, the *only* action I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action *does not change the robot's base configuration*! It just states it moves from `v3` to `v3`, for cost.
           
           Therefore, because there's no way to reach the required `#o3` configuration, I'm stuck. It's impossible to execute any `pick` or `place` actions, because they all have the base configuration as a critical precondition that cannot be fulfilled given the provided facts.
           
           The goal *cannot* be achieved with the given information and allowed actions. The `move_base` action isn't capable of moving the base to the configuration required for other actions to be executed. The available actions and facts are internally inconsistent.
