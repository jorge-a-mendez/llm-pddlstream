User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.758, 0.481), (-4.661, 0.578)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.709, 0.529, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.478, 0.878).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`. From the initial state, I know either `v8` or `v12` could be that object, as both are of type `v17`. To get one of them "on" `v18`, I need to satisfy the `on(?o, ?r)` axiom, meaning the object must be supported by `v18` *and* at the correct pose, `#o2`. The initial state tells me both `v8` and `v12` are supported at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           Here's the problem:  both `v8` and `v12` are *not* currently at the necessary pose `#o2`. `v8` is at `v9`, and `v12` is at `v13`.  To move either object, I need `pick` and `place` actions. However, the *only* action I'm allowed to use is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That does nothing to change object poses!
           
           To use `pick` and `place`, I'd first need to pick up an object (e.g., `v8`) from its current pose (`v9`). This, of course, requires a `kin` relation for a specific base configuration `atbconf(#o3)`. But here's the kicker: the only move action available to me is the trivial one (`move_base v3 v3 #o0`), which keeps my base configuration at `v3`! I can't reach the needed base config to perform pick/place actions and this is clearly stated in the problem as *"Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."*
           
           Therefore, without the ability to use `pick` and `place` instances, I am stuck. I can't manipulate any objects.  The robot is simply not capable of changing the `atpose` of either `v8` or `v12`. Because of this constraint, I cannot make either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` true. My goal, the fulfillment of `new-axiom@0()`, is simply unreachable given the constraints.
