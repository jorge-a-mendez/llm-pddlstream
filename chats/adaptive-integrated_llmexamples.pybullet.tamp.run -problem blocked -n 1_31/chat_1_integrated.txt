User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.465, 0.022), (-4.392, 0.095)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.429, 0.058, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.693, 0.721).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom that evaluates to true if `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)` are true. The object `v12` is of type `v17`. The object `v18` is a surface. Therefore, the task reduces to placing `v12` on `v18`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13` and is supported by `v14`. We need to move `v12` from `v14` to `v18`. This requires a pick action, followed by a move base (if needed), and then a place action.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)`. We have `grasp(v12, #o1)` and `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. This allows us to pick `v12` from `v13` with arm `v4`. After picking, we need to place `v12` on `v18`. We have `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. We also have `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. This allows us to place `v12` at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The robot's base is at `v3` and can move to `v3` via `#o0`. This suggests no base movement is necessary if `v3` is sufficient for both pick and place operations.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameters #o0, #o1, #o2, #o3, #o4 are all valid for the sequence of actions.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Pick `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`.
           2. `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`: Place `v12` at `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`.
           
           The pose `#o2` needs to be provided a value. It's a pose for `v12` on `v18`. `v18` has AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v12` has AABB `((-4.465, 0.022), (-4.392, 0.095))`. The provided AABB for `v12` seems to be its default bounding box relative to its own origin. We need to place `v12` on `v18`. Let's choose a pose within the bounds of `v18`. For instance, x=4.5, y=-0.3. Since `v12` is a small object, a z-value slightly above the surface of `v18` would be suitable. Assuming `v18` is a table-like surface and `z=0.8` is a standard height for objects on such surfaces, we can use `z=0.8`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v12 v18): (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I overlooked the limited set of valid action instances. The only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow for picking or placing objects.
           
           The goal is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)`. As identified earlier, `v12` is of `type(v12, v17)`. So, the goal translates to having `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The initial state has `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. This means `v12` is currently on `v14`. To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, we would need to pick `v12` from `v14` and place it on `v18`.
           
           However, the only allowed action is `move_base`. This action cannot change the state of objects (like picking or placing them). Therefore, with the given valid actions, it is impossible to move `v12` from `v14` to `v18`. The goal is unreachable.
