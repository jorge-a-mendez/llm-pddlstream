           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable, given the provided initial state and the limited set of allowed actions.  Let me elaborate on my reasoning:
           
           First, I broke down the goal definition, recognizing the critical conditions I need to satisfy: `receivedimage` predicates for different objectives, and `receivedanalysis` predicates for both stone and soil types. I thoroughly examined the initial state and found that none of these predicates are satisfied initially.
           
           Next, I determined the available actions.  The only actions available are `move` and `drop_rock`.  These actions, as I understand them, operate on predicates like `atconf`, `free`, and `full`, primarily concerned with the physical configuration of objects and rovers.
           
           Now, I systematically evaluated whether these actions could lead to the necessary goal state.  I quickly realized that to achieve `receivedimage`, I'd need actions like `take_image` and `send_image`. Similarly, `receivedanalysis` requires actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. However, neither the requisite actions nor their associated preconditions are present in the provided action instances.
           
           Essentially, the necessary actions to manipulate images and analyze samples are absent from the permissible action set. Since I'm strictly constrained to the provided actions, I conclude that there is no valid sequence of moves and rock drops that can generate the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts, thereby rendering the goal unattainable under the current conditions. I confirmed this by reviewing the initial state once more to ensure that the initial condition did not satisfy any part of the goal.
