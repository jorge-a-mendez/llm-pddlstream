           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.075x0.075.
           
           Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its footprint. The available surface is quite large compared to the object, so there are many possible stable placements. I will try to distribute the placements across the surface, varying x and y coordinates, and also vary the rotation for completeness, although for a square object it might not strictly be necessary.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I now know that object 5, a square of size ~0.075, was successfully placed at (0, 0, 0, 0).
           The new object, ID 4, is also a square, slightly larger at ~0.077.
           The surface is still the same square at ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           When placing object 4, I need to ensure it does not collide with object 5, which is at the center of the surface. Since both objects are square and centered at (0,0,0,0) and the previous placement of object 5 was at (0,0,0,0), any placement of object 4 that overlaps with object 5 should be avoided.
           Since object 5 is centered at 0,0 and is ~0.075 wide, its bounds are roughly from -0.0375 to 0.0375 in both x and y.
           Object 4 is ~0.077 wide. If it is also centered at 0,0, its bounds would be -0.0385 to 0.0385, which would entirely overlap object 5.
           Therefore, for object 4, I need to choose placements that are sufficiently far from the origin to avoid collision with object 5.
           
           Let's consider the maximum extent of the surface. It is from -0.135 to 0.135.
           The object has a half-width of approximately 0.0384. So, its center must be at least 0.0384 away from the edges.
           This means the center of object 4 can be between -0.135 + 0.0384 and 0.135 - 0.0384, which is approximately -0.0966 to 0.0966.
           
           Given object 5 is centered at (0,0) and has a half-width of approx 0.0373.
           To avoid collision, the center of object 4 must be at least (0.0373 + 0.0384) = 0.0757 away from the origin in at least one direction (assuming axis-aligned bounding boxes).
           So, if I place object 4 at (0.0757, 0, 0) or (0, 0.0757, 0), it should avoid collision.
           I will generate a variety of placements, ensuring they are outside the central region occupied by object 5.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have recorded successful placements for object 5 and object 4.
           Object 5 (size ~0.075) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its bounding box is approximately x in [-0.0373, 0.0373], y in [-0.0373, 0.0373].
           Object 4 (size ~0.077) is at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0). Its bounding box is approximately x in [0.08 - 0.0384, 0.08 + 0.0384] = [0.0416, 0.1184], y in [-0.0384, 0.0384].
           
           The new object, ID 8, is a square with size ~0.0985. Its half-width is approximately 0.04925.
           The surface is still the same square at ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           The maximum allowed coordinates for the center of object 8 are:
           x_max = 0.135 - 0.04925 = 0.08575
           y_max = 0.135 - 0.04925 = 0.08575
           So the center of object 8 can be within [-0.08575, 0.08575] for both x and y.
           
           Now I need to find placements for object 8 that do not collide with object 5 or object 4.
           
           Collision check with object 5 (center 0,0, half-width ~0.0373):
           For object 8 (half-width ~0.04925) to not collide with object 5, the absolute difference in their centers must be greater than the sum of their half-widths, i.e., > (0.0373 + 0.04925) = 0.08655.
           So, if placed on the x-axis, the x-coordinate of object 8's center must be > 0.08655 or < -0.08655.
           However, the maximum x-coordinate for object 8's center is 0.08575. This means that placing object 8 on the x or y axis such that its center is at (x,0) or (0,y) will always result in a collision with object 5, as 0.08575 < 0.08655.
           This means object 8 cannot be placed such that its AABB overlaps the central AABB of object 5, if it is axis-aligned.
           Let's re-evaluate. The condition for axis-aligned bounding boxes not colliding is:
           abs(x1 - x2) > (width1 + width2)/2 OR abs(y1 - y2) > (height1 + height2)/2.
           For object 8 and object 5:
           (width5 + width8)/2 = (0.07461 + 0.09852)/2 = 0.17313/2 = 0.086565.
           So for no collision, abs(x8 - 0) > 0.086565 OR abs(y8 - 0) > 0.086565.
           The maximum allowed x or y for object 8's center is 0.08575.
           Since 0.08575 < 0.086565, it is impossible to place object 8 such that it does not collide with object 5 if both are axis-aligned and their bounding boxes overlap the x or y axes.
           However, I can try to place object 8 such that it is not axis-aligned, or place it such that the intersection with object 5 is minimal (e.g. corner to corner). Or, I can place it in a corner of the main surface such that it only marginally overlaps with object 5. The prompt says 'fully contained within the bounds of the surface', and 'stable placement' (which I am assuming includes no collision with other fixed objects).
           The strict AABB non-collision rule makes it very hard to place object 8.
           
           Let's re-read the rules: "you must find a stable placement for the object on one of the surfaces. The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface. You are not given the full geometry of the scene, but you will be given feedback of whether a placement is stable and whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene."
           The current success record is for ID 5 and ID 4. This implies that they are "fixed obstacles" now.
           
           If an axis-aligned bounding box collision check is used, then placing object 8 on the surface without colliding with object 5 is impossible if the objects are axis aligned.
           If object 8 is rotated, its effective width and height can change, but for a square, the smallest dimension of its rotated AABB is when it's axis-aligned, and the largest is at 45 degrees. At 45 degrees, the effective width/height becomes sqrt(2) * side / 2 + sqrt(2) * side / 2 = side * sqrt(2). So its AABB at 45 degrees would be even larger. This means an axis-aligned placement is the most compact for a square, so rotating it won't help in terms of fitting it.
           
           This means my assumption of "no collision between objects i and j" must be checked against the constraints.
           Maybe the collision detection allows for some overlap at the corners, or my half-width calculation is too strict.
           Object 5 center: (0,0), half-width: 0.037305. Max extent from center: 0.037305.
           Object 4 center: (0.08,0), half-width: 0.038434. Max extent from center: 0.038434.
           Object 8 half-width: 0.049262. Max extent from center: 0.049262.
           
           Let's check the ranges:
           Obj 5: x in [-0.0373, 0.0373], y in [-0.0373, 0.0373]
           Obj 4: x in [0.08 - 0.0384, 0.08 + 0.0384] = [0.0416, 0.1184], y in [-0.0384, 0.0384]
           
           For Obj 8 to be clear of Obj 5:
           Distance_x > (0.0373 + 0.049262) = 0.086562 OR Distance_y > (0.0373 + 0.049262) = 0.086562
           So, for an axis-aligned placement, the center of Obj 8 must be such that abs(x_center) > 0.086562 or abs(y_center) > 0.086562.
           
           For Obj 8 to be clear of Obj 4:
           Center of Obj 4 is (0.08, 0).
           Distance_x > (0.038434 + 0.049262) = 0.087696 OR Distance_y > (0.038434 + 0.049262) = 0.087696
           So, abs(x_center - 0.08) > 0.087696 or abs(y_center - 0) > 0.087696.
           
           Let's try to place object 8 at x = -0.085. This might collide with object 5.
           The max allowed center is 0.08575.
           
           This looks like a really tight fit or even an impossible fit if strictly using AABB for collision with fixed objects 4 and 5.
           If I put object 8 at (-0.08575, 0.08575) (top-left corner of the usable surface area for its center).
           Its AABB would be x in [-0.08575-0.049262, -0.08575+0.049262] = [-0.135, -0.036488]
           and y in [0.08575-0.049262, 0.08575+0.049262] = [0.036488, 0.135].
           
           Let's check for collision with object 5 (center (0,0), x in [-0.0373, 0.0373], y in [-0.0373, 0.0373]).
           For object 8 at (-0.08575, 0.08575):
           x overlap: [-0.0373, 0.0373] and [-0.135, -0.036488]. There is no x overlap. Max x of obj 8 is -0.036488, min x of obj 5 is -0.0373. They are very close.
           y overlap: [-0.0373, 0.0373] and [0.036488, 0.135]. There is no y overlap. Min y of obj 8 is 0.036488, max y of obj 5 is 0.0373. They are very close.
           
           If I place object 8 at (-0.08575, 0.08575), and then at (0.08575, 0.08575), etc., these might work.
           Let's try positions that are in the corners of the surface, away from the central objects.
           
           (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.085)
           (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)
           (0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085)
           (0, 0.0, 0.085, -0.085)
           
           Let's recheck the collision with object 4, which is at (0.08, 0).
           If object 8 is at (0.085, 0.085):
           Obj 8 x-range: [0.085 - 0.049262, 0.085 + 0.049262] = [0.035738, 0.134262]
           Obj 8 y-range: [0.085 - 0.049262, 0.085 + 0.049262] = [0.035738, 0.134262]
           
           Obj 4 x-range: [0.0416, 0.1184]
           Obj 4 y-range: [-0.0384, 0.0384]
           
           Checking for overlap between Obj 8 (at (0.085, 0.085)) and Obj 4:
           X overlap: [0.035738, 0.134262] and [0.0416, 0.1184]. These overlap.
           Y overlap: [0.035738, 0.134262] and [-0.0384, 0.0384]. These do not overlap (min y of obj 8 is 0.035738, max y of obj 4 is 0.0384. They are very close, but no overlap).
           
           The problem asks for "stable placement ... meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface." It does NOT explicitly say "without collision with other fixed objects". However, the feedback from the previous request was for successful placements that did not collide with *fixed obstacles*. This heavily implies that collision avoidance is part of the problem.
           
           Let's look at the gap between the objects.
           Object 5 (at (0,0)) extends to x = 0.0373 and y = 0.0373.
           Object 4 (at (0.08,0)) extends from x = 0.0416 to x = 0.1184 and y = -0.0384 to y = 0.0384.
           There's a "corridor" between them, along the x-axis, from x=0.0373 (Obj 5 right edge) to x=0.0416 (Obj 4 left edge). This is a tiny gap of 0.0043.
           This means no axis-aligned object of width larger than 0.0043 can pass between them if its center is on the x-axis. Object 8's width is 0.0985, so it certainly can't fit.
           
           The available space for object 8 seems extremely limited if strict AABB non-collision applies.
           If I place object 8 at (-0.08575, 0.08575):
           X-range: [-0.135, -0.036488]
           Y-range: [0.036488, 0.135]
           
           Obj 5 X-range: [-0.0373, 0.0373], Y-range: [-0.0373, 0.0373]
           Is there an X-overlap? No, max X of obj 8 (-0.036488) is > min X of obj 5 (-0.0373), but it doesn't extend into obj 5's x range. Actually, the ranges don't overlap: [-0.135, -0.036488] vs [-0.0373, 0.0373]. No overlap on X.
           Is there a Y-overlap? No, min Y of obj 8 (0.036488) is > max Y of obj 5 (0.0373). No overlap on Y.
           So (0, 0.0, -0.08575, 0.08575) might be a valid placement against object 5.
           
           Now check (0, 0.0, -0.08575, 0.08575) against object 4:
           Obj 4 X-range: [0.0416, 0.1184], Y-range: [-0.0384, 0.0384]
           Obj 8 X-range: [-0.135, -0.036488], Y-range: [0.036488, 0.135]
           No X overlap: Max X of obj 8 is -0.036488, which is less than min X of obj 4 (0.0416).
           No Y overlap: Min Y of obj 8 is 0.036488, which is greater than max Y of obj 4 (0.0384).
           This means that placing object 8 centered at (-0.08575, 0.08575) (or (0.08575, 0.08575), etc.) should avoid collision with both 4 and 5, assuming axis-aligned bounding box collision.
           
           This means there are four "corner" positions available for object 8. I will use the maximum possible extent for the center coordinates to ensure minimal interference.
           
           Let's try to calculate the precise maximum/minimum coordinates for the center of object 8:
           Surface bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135]
           Object 8 half_side: 0.0985239973457932 / 2 = 0.0492619986728966
           Max/Min center coordinates for object 8:
           x_max = 0.135 - 0.0492619986728966 = 0.0857380013271034
           x_min = -0.135 + 0.0492619986728966 = -0.0857380013271034
           Same for y.
           
           So the four corner placements for object 8 (axis-aligned) will be:
           (-0.085738, 0.085738)
           (0.085738, 0.085738)
           (-0.085738, -0.085738)
           (0.085738, -0.085738)
           
           Given the very tight fit and the proximity of the "no-collision" boundary, it might be that my floating point precision is affecting the outcome, or that there's a slight tolerance in the collision system. I'll use 0.085 for x/y center positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have recorded successful placements for objects 5, 4, and 8.
           Object 5 (size ~0.0746) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-width: 0.0373. Bbox: x in [-0.0373, 0.0373], y in [-0.0373, 0.0373].
           Object 4 (size ~0.0769) is at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0). Half-width: 0.03845. Bbox: x in [0.08 - 0.03845, 0.08 + 0.03845] = [0.04155, 0.11845], y in [-0.03845, 0.03845].
           Object 8 (size ~0.0985) is at (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.085). Half-width: 0.04925. Bbox: x in [-0.085 - 0.04925, -0.085 + 0.04925] = [-0.13425, -0.03575], y in [0.085 - 0.04925, 0.085 + 0.04925] = [0.03575, 0.13425].
           
           The new object, ID 7, is a square with size ~0.0792. Its half-width is approximately 0.0396.
           The surface is still the same square at ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           First, let's determine the bounds for object 7's center.
           Surface bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135]
           Object 7 half_side: 0.079233 / 2 = 0.0396165
           Max/Min center coordinates for object 7:
           x_max = 0.135 - 0.0396165 = 0.0953835
           x_min = -0.135 + 0.0396165 = -0.0953835
           Same for y. So the center of object 7 can be within [-0.09538, 0.09538] for both x and y.
           
           Now I need to find placements for object 7 that do not collide with objects 5, 4, or 8.
           
           Collision check with object 5 (center 0,0, half-width ~0.0373):
           Sum of half-widths for Obj 7 and Obj 5 = 0.0396165 + 0.0373 = 0.0769165.
           So, for an axis-aligned placement, the center of Obj 7 must be such that abs(x_center) > 0.0769165 or abs(y_center) > 0.0769165.
           
           Collision check with object 4 (center 0.08,0, half-width ~0.03845):
           Sum of half-widths for Obj 7 and Obj 4 = 0.0396165 + 0.03845 = 0.0780665.
           So, abs(x_center - 0.08) > 0.0780665 or abs(y_center - 0) > 0.0780665.
           
           Collision check with object 8 (center -0.085,0.085, half-width ~0.04925):
           Sum of half-widths for Obj 7 and Obj 8 = 0.0396165 + 0.04925 = 0.0888665.
           So, abs(x_center - (-0.085)) > 0.0888665 or abs(y_center - 0.085) > 0.0888665.
           
           Let's look at the available regions.
           Object 5 blocks the central region defined by abs(x) < 0.0769 or abs(y) < 0.0769.
           Object 4 blocks region around (0.08, 0). Its x-range is [0.04155, 0.11845], y-range is [-0.03845, 0.03845].
           Object 8 blocks region around (-0.085, 0.085). Its x-range is [-0.13425, -0.03575], y-range is [0.03575, 0.13425].
           
           Considering the limits for object 7's center: x in [-0.09538, 0.09538] and y in [-0.09538, 0.09538].
           
           Let's try to place object 7 in the remaining "corners" or "edges".
           Consider the area at the bottom right: x > 0.0769 and y < -0.0769.
           For example, center at (0.08, -0.08).
           1. Check against object 5 (center (0,0)):
           abs(0.08) > 0.0769 (True for x)
           abs(-0.08) > 0.0769 (True for y)
           This placement would not collide with object 5.
           
           2. Check against object 4 (center (0.08,0)):
           abs(0.08 - 0.08) = 0. This is not > 0.0780665 (False for x).
           abs(-0.08 - 0) = 0.08. This is > 0.0780665 (True for y).
           Since the y-condition is met, (0.08, -0.08) would not collide with object 4.
           The y-ranges would be:
           Obj 7: [-0.08 - 0.0396, -0.08 + 0.0396] = [-0.1196, -0.0404]
           Obj 4: [-0.03845, 0.03845]
           These y-ranges do not overlap.
           
           3. Check against object 8 (center (-0.085, 0.085)):
           abs(0.08 - (-0.085)) = abs(0.165) = 0.165. This is > 0.0888665 (True for x).
           abs(-0.08 - 0.085) = abs(-0.165) = 0.165. This is > 0.0888665 (True for y).
           This placement would not collide with object 8.
           
           So (0.08, -0.08) seems like a valid candidate. I will use 0.08 and -0.08 for coordinates because they are within the max/min center limits of [-0.09538, 0.09538].
           I will fill out the remaining available "corners" and edges as well.
           
           The four corners of the surface, avoiding existing objects:
           1. Top-right quadrant: Try (0.085, 0.085)
              - Against Obj 5 (0,0): abs(0.085) > 0.0769 (True). No collision.
              - Against Obj 4 (0.08,0): abs(0.085-0.08)=0.005 (False). abs(0.085-0)=0.085 (True). No collision. (Obj 7 y range: [0.085-0.0396, 0.085+0.0396] = [0.0454, 0.1246]. Obj 4 y range: [-0.03845, 0.03845]. No y overlap).
              - Against Obj 8 (-0.085, 0.085): abs(0.085 - (-0.085)) = 0.17 (True). No collision.
              So (0.085, 0.085) is a good candidate.
           
           2. Bottom-left quadrant: Try (-0.085, -0.085)
              - Against Obj 5 (0,0): abs(-0.085) > 0.0769 (True). No collision.
              - Against Obj 4 (0.08,0): abs(-0.085 - 0.08) = 0.165 (True). No collision.
              - Against Obj 8 (-0.085, 0.085): abs(-0.085 - (-0.085)) = 0 (False). abs(-0.085 - 0.085) = 0.17 (True). No collision. (Obj 7 x range: [-0.085-0.0396, -0.085+0.0396] = [-0.1246, -0.0454]. Obj 8 x range: [-0.13425, -0.03575]. Overlap on x. Oh wait, previous placement for obj 8 was -0.085, 0.085, it's in the top-left quadrant. So, if object 7 is at (-0.085, -0.085), its x-range is [-0.1246, -0.0454] and its y-range is [-0.1246, -0.0454]. Object 8's x-range is [-0.13425, -0.03575] and y-range is [0.03575, 0.13425]. The x-ranges overlap, but the y-ranges do not. So this is valid.
              So (-0.085, -0.085) is a good candidate.
           
           3. Bottom-right quadrant: Try (0.085, -0.085)
              - Against Obj 5 (0,0): abs(0.085) > 0.0769 (True). No collision.
              - Against Obj 4 (0.08,0): abs(0.085-0.08)=0.005 (False). abs(-0.085-0)=0.085 (True). No collision. (Obj 7 y range: [-0.085-0.0396, -0.085+0.0396] = [-0.1246, -0.0454]. Obj 4 y range: [-0.03845, 0.03845]. No y overlap).
              - Against Obj 8 (-0.085, 0.085): abs(0.085 - (-0.085)) = 0.17 (True). No collision.
              So (0.085, -0.085) is a good candidate.
           
           These four corner placements are good. I will vary the positions and rotations.
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)
           (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.085) # This overlaps with Object 8 at (-0.085,0.085). Half-width 0.0396 for 7, 0.04925 for 8. Center -0.085. Sum of half-widths 0.0888. The x-range of 7 is [-0.085-0.0396, -0.085+0.0396] = [-0.1246, -0.0454]. The x-range of 8 is [-0.085-0.04925, -0.085+0.04925] = [-0.13425, -0.03575]. The x-ranges overlap. The y-ranges also overlap because they both use 0.085 center. So this is a collision.
           
           My previous analysis for (-0.085, -0.085) against object 8 was incorrect for the x-overlap.
           Let's re-evaluate placement strategy.
           The previous success for object 8 was at (-0.085, 0.085).
           So, for the new object 7, placing its center at (-0.085, 0.085) would indeed cause a collision with object 8, as their centers are identical and they are both square.
           I need to shift my placements from the location of Object 8.
           
           Let's list the occupied areas:
           Obj 5: centered at (0,0), half-width ~0.0373. x_range [-0.0373, 0.0373], y_range [-0.0373, 0.0373].
           Obj 4: centered at (0.08,0), half-width ~0.03845. x_range [0.04155, 0.11845], y_range [-0.03845, 0.03845].
           Obj 8: centered at (-0.085,0.085), half-width ~0.04925. x_range [-0.13425, -0.03575], y_range [0.03575, 0.13425].
           
           New Obj 7: half-width ~0.0396. Max center coords: [-0.09538, 0.09538].
           
           Available "empty" areas, considering the existing objects:
           1. Top-Right quadrant: x > 0 and y > 0.
              - For Obj 7 to be clear of Obj 5: x_center > 0.0769 or y_center > 0.0769.
              - For Obj 7 to be clear of Obj 4: (x_center - 0.08) > 0.078 or (y_center - 0) > 0.078.
                x_center > 0.158 or x_center < 0.002, or y_center > 0.078.
              - For Obj 7 to be clear of Obj 8: (x_center - (-0.085)) > 0.0888 or (y_center - 0.085) > 0.0888.
                x_center > 0.0038 or x_center < -0.1738, or y_center > 0.1738 or y_center < -0.0038.
           
           Let's focus on the top-right corner. A candidate for the center of object 7 could be (0.09, 0.09).
           - Max coordinates for Obj 7 center are (0.09538, 0.09538), so (0.09, 0.09) is valid.
           - Against Obj 5: (0,0), half-width 0.0373. Obj 7 at (0.09,0.09), half-width 0.0396.
             x_diff = 0.09. y_diff = 0.09. Sum of half-widths = 0.0769.
             Since 0.09 > 0.0769, no collision with Obj 5.
           - Against Obj 4: (0.08,0), half-width 0.03845. Obj 7 at (0.09,0.09), half-width 0.0396.
             x_diff = abs(0.09 - 0.08) = 0.01. y_diff = abs(0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum of half-widths = 0.0780665.
             Since x_diff (0.01) is not > 0.0780665, we need y_diff > 0.0780665. Indeed, 0.09 > 0.0780665. No collision with Obj 4.
           - Against Obj 8: (-0.085,0.085), half-width 0.04925. Obj 7 at (0.09,0.09), half-width 0.0396.
             x_diff = abs(0.09 - (-0.085)) = 0.175. y_diff = abs(0.09 - 0.085) = 0.005. Sum of half-widths = 0.0888665.
             Since x_diff (0.175) is > 0.0888665, no collision with Obj 8.
           
           So (0.09, 0.09) is a good candidate.
           By symmetry, (-0.09, -0.09) should also work.
           Let's verify (-0.09, -0.09)
           - Against Obj 5: abs(-0.09) > 0.0769. No collision.
           - Against Obj 4: (0.08,0). x_diff = abs(-0.09 - 0.08) = 0.17. y_diff = abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum = 0.078. Since 0.17 > 0.078, no collision.
           - Against Obj 8: (-0.085,0.085). x_diff = abs(-0.09 - (-0.085)) = 0.005. y_diff = abs(-0.09 - 0.085) = 0.175. Sum = 0.0888. Since y_diff (0.175) > 0.0888, no collision.
           
           So (0.09, 0.09) and (-0.09, -0.09) are good candidates.
           What about (0.09, -0.09)?
           - Against Obj 5: abs(0.09) > 0.0769. No collision.
           - Against Obj 4: (0.08,0). x_diff = abs(0.09 - 0.08) = 0.01. y_diff = abs(-0.09 - 0) = 0.09. Sum = 0.078. Since y_diff (0.09) > 0.078, no collision.
           - Against Obj 8: (-0.085,0.085). x_diff = abs(0.09 - (-0.085)) = 0.175. y_diff = abs(-0.09 - 0.085) = 0.175. Sum = 0.0888. Since 0.175 > 0.0888, no collision.
           
           So (0.09, -0.09) is a good candidate.
           What about (-0.09, 0.09)? This would be very close to Object 8 at (-0.085, 0.085).
           - Against Obj 8: (-0.085,0.085). Obj 7 at (-0.09,0.09).
             x_diff = abs(-0.09 - (-0.085)) = 0.005. y_diff = abs(0.09 - 0.085) = 0.005. Sum of half-widths = 0.0888.
             Since neither 0.005 is > 0.0888, this would be a collision.
           
           So I cannot place object 7 at (-0.09, 0.09).
           This means I must explore other regions.
           I have (0.09, 0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09). These are three corners.
           I need to find other placements.
           Maybe along the edges?
           
           Consider the left edge. y-coords between -0.03 and 0.03 are problematic due to Obj 5 and Obj 4.
           What about x = -0.09?
           y must be far from 0.085 (Obj 8's y). And far from 0 (Obj 5's y).
           If y = -0.09: This is the (-0.09, -0.09) case, which works.
           
           If y = 0.0:
           x must be abs(x) > 0.0769. So I could try x = -0.09.
           Let's try center (-0.09, 0.0).
           - Against Obj 5 (0,0): abs(-0.09) = 0.09 > 0.0769. No collision.
           - Against Obj 4 (0.08,0): abs(-0.09 - 0.08) = 0.17 > 0.078. No collision.
           - Against Obj 8 (-0.085,0.085): abs(-0.09 - (-0.085)) = 0.005. abs(0.0 - 0.085) = 0.085. Sum = 0.0888.
             Since neither 0.005 is > 0.0888, this implies a collision.
             This means Obj 7 cannot be along the x-axis near x = -0.09, because it would collide with Obj 8.
           
           The region x < -0.03575 (from Obj 8) and y < 0.03575 (from Obj 8) is problematic, as that corner is occupied.
           But my check for (-0.09, -0.09) against Obj 8 showed no collision.
           Obj 7 at (-0.09, -0.09): x in [-0.1296, -0.0504], y in [-0.1296, -0.0504].
           Obj 8 at (-0.085, 0.085): x in [-0.13425, -0.03575], y in [0.03575, 0.13425].
           X-ranges overlap. Y-ranges do not. So valid. My AABB logic holds.
           
           Let's try to fill the remaining area.
           The area not used yet:
           - Top-left quadrant, but Obj 8 is there:
             Object 8: x in [-0.13425, -0.03575], y in [0.03575, 0.13425].
             Can I place Obj 7 at x = -0.09, y = 0.0? NO (collides with Obj 8).
             Can I place Obj 7 at x = -0.095, y = 0.0?
             - Against Obj 8 (-0.085,0.085): x_diff = abs(-0.095 - (-0.085)) = 0.01. y_diff = abs(0.0 - 0.085) = 0.085. Sum = 0.0888. No collision because y_diff is very close to sum. (0.085 < 0.0888. This IS a collision!)
           
           Okay, the available region is really shrinking.
           The successful placements are at (0.09, 0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09). These are outside the immediate collision zones.
           
           Let's consider rotations. For a square object, rotating by 45 degrees increases its axis-aligned bounding box. So it might be harder to fit.
           For example, if object 7 is rotated by 45 degrees, its new AABB will have side length ~0.0792 * sqrt(2) = 0.112. Its half-width would be 0.056.
           The max center would then be 0.135 - 0.056 = 0.079. This is very restrictive.
           So, I will primarily stick to 0 or pi/2 rotations (or 0, 0.785, 1.57, etc for diversity) and focus on positions.
           
           I need 50 placements.
           I have (0.09, 0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09) and their small variations for x, y.
           Also, the region at (0, y) where y is far from 0. The y limits are [-0.095, 0.095].
           If I place at (0, -0.09), then against Obj 5: y_diff=0.09 > 0.0769. No collision.
           Against Obj 4 (0.08,0): x_diff=0.08. y_diff=0.09. Sum=0.078. x_diff (0.08) > 0.078. No collision.
           Against Obj 8 (-0.085,0.085): x_diff=0.085. y_diff=0.175. Sum=0.0888. y_diff (0.175) > 0.0888. No collision.
           So (0.0, -0.09) is a good candidate.
           By symmetry, (0.0, 0.09) should also be checked.
           Against Obj 8 (-0.085,0.085): x_diff=0.085. y_diff=0.005. Sum=0.0888. Collision because x_diff (0.085) not > 0.0888 and y_diff (0.005) not > 0.0888. So (0.0, 0.09) would collide with Obj 8.
           
           The "safe" area seems to be:
           1. Quadrant 1 (x>0, y>0), far enough from origin. Like (0.09,0.09).
           2. Quadrant 4 (x>0, y<0), far enough from origin. Like (0.09,-0.09).
           3. Quadrant 3 (x<0, y<0), far enough from origin. Like (-0.09,-0.09).
           4. Along the negative y-axis, far enough from origin: (0.0, -0.09).
           5. Along the positive x-axis, far enough from origin, but also sufficiently far from Obj 4.
              E.g., x=0.09, y=0.0.
              - Against Obj 5: x_diff=0.09 > 0.0769. No collision.
              - Against Obj 4: (0.08,0). x_diff=0.01. y_diff=0.0. Sum=0.078. Collision.
           This suggests the region x > 0 and y near 0 is problematic due to Obj 4.
           
           So, the open regions are somewhat limited due to the fixed objects.
           I will generate placements that are slightly varied around the (0.09,0.09), (0.09,-0.09), (-0.09,-0.09) and (0.0,-0.09) points.
           
           Let's use (0.09, 0.09), (0.09, -0.09), (-0.09, -0.09), (0.0, -0.09) as anchor points.
           And (0.095, 0.095), etc., up to the max bound for coordinates.
           
           Placements:

Model:     I have recorded successful placements for objects 5, 4, 8, and 7.
           Object 5 (size ~0.0746) is at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Half-width: 0.0373. Bbox: x in [-0.0373, 0.0373], y in [-0.0373, 0.0373].
           Object 4 (size ~0.0769) is at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0). Half-width: 0.03845. Bbox: x in [0.04155, 0.11845], y in [-0.03845, 0.03845].
           Object 8 (size ~0.0985) is at (0, 0.0, -0.085, 0.085). Half-width: 0.04925. Bbox: x in [-0.13425, -0.03575], y in [0.03575, 0.13425].
           Object 7 (size ~0.0792) is at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085). Half-width: 0.0396. Bbox: x in [0.0454, 0.1246], y in [0.0454, 0.1246].
           
           The new object, ID 6, is a square with size ~0.0989. Its half-width is approximately 0.04945.
           The surface is still the same square at ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           First, determine the bounds for object 6's center.
           Surface bounds: x in [-0.135, 0.135], y in [-0.135, 0.135]
           Object 6 half_side: 0.09888 / 2 = 0.04944
           Max/Min center coordinates for object 6:
           x_max = 0.135 - 0.04944 = 0.08556
           x_min = -0.135 + 0.04944 = -0.08556
           Same for y. So the center of object 6 can be within [-0.08556, 0.08556] for both x and y.
           
           Now I need to find placements for object 6 that do not collide with objects 5, 4, 8, or 7.
           
           Collision check with object 5 (center 0,0, half-width ~0.0373):
           Sum of half-widths for Obj 6 and Obj 5 = 0.04944 + 0.0373 = 0.08674.
           So, for an axis-aligned placement, the center of Obj 6 must be such that abs(x_center) > 0.08674 or abs(y_center) > 0.08674.
           This is greater than the max allowed center coordinate (0.08556). This means any axis-aligned placement of Object 6 will collide with Object 5.
           This object is too large to fit in the available regions if it has to be completely non-overlapping by AABB with object 5.
           If the collision detection system allows for minor overlaps (e.g. at corners), or if "fixed obstacles" only means the boundary of the surface, then it might be possible. But the problem statement implies collision with *fixed obstacles* must be avoided.
           
           Let's carefully re-read the constraint: "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           If this condition implies axis-aligned bounding box collision, then placement of object 6 is impossible.
           
           Let's double check calculations.
           Object 6 side = 0.09888. Half-side = 0.04944.
           Surface from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Max center for Object 6 = 0.135 - 0.04944 = 0.08556.
           Min center for Object 6 = -0.135 + 0.04944 = -0.08556.
           So Object 6's center must be within [-0.08556, 0.08556].
           
           Object 5 side = 0.07461. Half-side = 0.037305.
           Center of Object 5 is (0,0).
           For no AABB collision between Object 6 and Object 5:
           abs(x_6 - x_5) > (half_side_6 + half_side_5) OR abs(y_6 - y_5) > (half_side_6 + half_side_5)
           abs(x_6 - 0) > (0.04944 + 0.037305) = 0.086745 OR abs(y_6 - 0) > 0.086745.
           
           So, for object 6 to not collide with object 5, its center (x_6, y_6) must satisfy either abs(x_6) > 0.086745 or abs(y_6) > 0.086745.
           However, the maximum allowed center coordinate for object 6 is 0.08556 (from surface bounds).
           Since 0.08556 < 0.086745, it is impossible for object 6's center to satisfy abs(x_6) > 0.086745 or abs(y_6) > 0.086745 while also being within the surface bounds.
           
           This means that under the strict AABB collision rules, there is no stable placement for object 6.
           Given the problem statement "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement... you will always try to find a new placement," and "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement.", I should not just give up.
           
           One possibility is that the collision detection is not strictly AABB, or has a small tolerance.
           Or, the definition of "fixed obstacle" might not apply to *all* previously placed objects, but only to *some* of them that the system identifies as such. The prompt states "you must avoid collision between objects i and j". This suggests all previous ones are fixed obstacles.
           
           Let's assume there is a very small tolerance or that my calculation is slightly off.
           If I use the maximum possible coordinates for object 6, like (0.085, -0.085), it might succeed.
           Let's try to place it at the extreme corners of the valid center region.
           
           If the collision detection is based on the actual geometry of the square (not its AABB when rotated), and if the object is rotated by 45 degrees, its footprint for collision is smaller than its axis aligned bounding box. But for a square on a flat surface, the stable orientation is usually axis-aligned (theta=0, pi/2, etc.) or 45 degrees. A 45-degree rotation results in a larger AABB. So rotation probably won't help fitting.
           
           I am forced to try placements that, by strict AABB calculation, would collide with object 5.
           The smallest overlap would be when x_center or y_center is at its maximum allowed value, 0.08556.
           I will place object 6 at these coordinates and hope that the collision detection has some tolerance.
           
           Let's try to minimize overlap with existing objects.
           Obj 5 is at (0,0).
           Obj 4 is at (0.08,0).
           Obj 8 is at (-0.085,0.085).
           Obj 7 is at (0.085,0.085).
           
           The area that is "most free" is the bottom left quadrant (x < 0, y < 0), as only object 5 (at (0,0)) is somewhat near, but not heavily occupying that corner like 8 and 7 do their respective corners, and 4 does its edge.
           
           Try center (-0.085, -0.085).
           Object 6 (half-side 0.04944) center (-0.085, -0.085). Bbox: x in [-0.13444, -0.03556], y in [-0.13444, -0.03556].
           
           Check against Object 5 (center 0,0, half-width 0.0373):
           x_overlap: [-0.13444, -0.03556] and [-0.0373, 0.0373]. They overlap at x = -0.03556 to -0.0373.
           y_overlap: [-0.13444, -0.03556] and [-0.0373, 0.0373]. They overlap at y = -0.03556 to -0.0373.
           This is a collision by AABB.
           
           Since I cannot fulfill the "no collision" requirement with my current understanding of AABB, I must assume there is a tolerance or a different collision model. I will provide placements at the edges of the allowed region, hoping they are interpreted as valid. I will try to place it such that the overlap is minimal.
