           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, -0.154), (-0.198, -0.055)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.012, 0.41), (0.106, 0.503)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.082, -0.36), (0.003, -0.274)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.248, -0.104, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.417, 0.909).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.059, 0.457, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, 0.227).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.039, -0.317, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.793, 0.609).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to move three objects (v8, v12, v14) onto a target surface (v16).  My starting point is all three objects are currently on surface v11, and the goal is to have all three on v16, according to the `on` predicate which hinges on being supported and having the correct pose.  
           
           Since I have to use the provided `pick`, `place`, and `move_base` actions, it looks like I'll need to pick up each object individually from v11 and place it onto v16.  The challenge will be picking distinct `x,y` coordinates for each object on v16 because the instructions are clear, each object needs a *distinct* target pose `#o2`.
           
           Breaking it down, I see three subgoals: getting each object "on" v16.  To do that, I'll need a different world pose for each. 
           
           I know the robot has two arms, v4 and v6. Both are currently handempty. I start at base configuration v3, with arm v4 at v5 and v6 at v7. The `kin` predicate is relevant here, it links the arm and objects and poses, and how the base needs to be positioned for action. I can see from the `kin` facts that, for the `pick` and `place` actions to work, I need to position the base to `#o3`.
           
           Let's look at what I'm given: v11 (the initial surface) has an AABB of ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)), v16 (the target) has a smaller AABB: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The objects have their own AABBs: v8 is on v9 with AABB ((-0.297, -0.154), (-0.198, -0.055)), v12 is on v13 with AABB ((-0.082, -0.36), (0.003, -0.274)), and v14 is on v15 with AABB ((0.012, 0.41), (0.106, 0.503)).
           
           Given this, I have to pick them up in sequence from v11 and put them on v16.
           
           The problem hints at a `move_base` step because the initial base configuration is `v3` and actions rely on `#o3`. Based on the `kin` facts, it looks like moving from `v3` to the base pose of `#o3` is necessary, so that's the first step.
           
           The overall plan seems pretty clear:
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick v8 from v9.
           3.  Place v8 at the target pose, `#o2`, on v16.
           4.  Pick v12 from v13.
           5.  Place v12 at the target pose, `#o2`, on v16.
           6.  Pick v14 from v15.
           7.  Place v14 at the target pose, `#o2`, on v16.
           
           Now, I have to ensure the preconditions of each action are satisfied, and most importantly, I need to compute collision-free, stable positions on v16. I can see that `unsafepose` is a precondition for each `place` action, which means I have to calculate the correct x,y positions for each object's placement on v16.
           
           For the x, y, and z values, my assumption is that the height of the surface, z, will be that of v9, v13 and v15. And, the theta is 0 to start.
           
           I'm thinking about the surface dimensions, I need to carefully ensure that the AABBs of the objects *do not* overlap and remain within the boundaries of v16.  This seems straightforward, but I have to provide specific values. I've chosen to use `p_x` and `p_y` to shift the object so that it's AABB is properly positioned on v16.
           However, I will define this based on the values in the AABB. So my plan will be to define x and y of object 1, then x and y of object 2, then x and y of object 3 and check that the objects have no collision in
