           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a defined surface (index 0, defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0)).  Each placement is represented by a tuple: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, where `surf_idx` is the surface index, `theta` is the rotation angle, and `(x, y)` are the coordinates of the object's center.  Since the object must be entirely within the surface bounds, I need to calculate the allowable range for its center.
           
           Given the surface's dimensions, I calculate that the valid range for the center's `x` coordinate is [4.235, 4.765] and the valid range for its `y` coordinate is [-0.565, -0.035]. The square object's AABB is always 0.07 x 0.07, so the orientation angle (theta) doesn't change the bounds. However, to introduce diversity to the placements, I plan to cycle through a set of angles, which does not affect stability.
           
           To efficiently generate the 50 placements, I'll employ a grid-based approach. I will create a grid of points within the valid `x` and `y` ranges, selecting `8 x 7 = 56` placements. This allows for both x and y steps. Since a square object has AABB of 0.07, step size is (range_width) / (number_of_steps - 1). This should give an approximate spacing and cover the surface area well. The angular variation is introduced.
           
           By taking the first 50 placements, I'll satisfy the request.
