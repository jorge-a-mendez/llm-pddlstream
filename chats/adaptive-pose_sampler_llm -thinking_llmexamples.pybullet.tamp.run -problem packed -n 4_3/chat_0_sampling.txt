           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with extents of approximately 0.0956 x 0.0956 on a surface defined by the square `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I must ensure each placement is fully contained within the surface, considering the object's rotation.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Given an object's width (`obj_w`) and height (`obj_h`), and its rotation (`theta`), I calculate the effective half-width and half-height of the bounding box after rotation. This will determine the valid `(x, y)` center positions within the surface. The formulas are: `half_w_rot = 0.5 * (obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta)))` and `half_h_rot = 0.5 * (obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta)))`.
           
           For this specific object, `obj_w` and `obj_h` are nearly equal.  This means the object is almost square. This has an important implication: regardless of rotation, its bounding box size won't change drastically. I can exploit this fact to simplify the placement strategy.
           
           I'll start with `theta = 0` (no rotation). With this, the valid region for the center (`x, y`) will be determined by the initial object extents.  The object dimensions are nearly 0.1, so the center point is constrained by a region about 0.08 by 0.08, centered on zero.  Then, for comparison, I compute for `theta = pi/4`.  Because the object is nearly square,  the valid `x,y` region shrinks. This confirms the initial thought - I can pick a few thetas and generate good coverage.
           
           To systematically generate placements, I will create a grid of (x, y) coordinates for a few rotation angles.  Because this object is almost square, I can choose only a couple of rotations;  `0` and `pi/4` (45 degrees). This will allow me to generate more diverse placements without overcomplicating things. I'll take a 5x5 grid for x and y points, making 25 total placements for each theta value, giving a total of 50. I calculate the precise `x` and `y` ranges for each `theta`, which gives me the constraints for each coordinate. I will sample points within these bounds at equal intervals, which will ensure complete surface coverage. This gives me a good method to find stable and uniform placements of the object on the given surface.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown:**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating that object ID 4 has been successfully placed. That's a good start. My immediate task is to position a new object, ID 5, on surface 0. The catch? Object 5 needs to avoid colliding with the already-placed object 4. This requires a precise understanding of the available space and a careful strategy to ensure no overlap.
           
           **Scene Context and Constraints:**
           
           The scene is straightforward: a single surface, surface 0, and two objects. Surface 0 has defined bounds: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 4's location is known: `(surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=-0.0872097279745931, y=-0.08720972797459312)`. Object 4's dimensions are roughly square, which simplifies some calculations.  Crucially, object 4 is positioned in the bottom-left corner and is also almost square.  Object 5 also has dimensions which are nearly square. The theta rotation of these objects is important as it affects how much space they occupy, which determines the collision risks.
           
           **Placement Strategy and Collision Avoidance:**
           
           My approach boils down to two key steps:
           1.  **Valid Placement Region:** I need to determine the area on surface 0 where object 5 can be placed without overlapping the surface boundaries.
           2.  **Collision Check:** I will evaluate valid placements for collision with Object 4's AABB which I know occupies [-0.135, -0.0394] for both x and y.
           
           I'll start by making the surface boundaries smaller by the half extent of the object 5, in order to guarantee there won't be surface collisions. With the placement boundaries defined, I will assess placements based on object 4's known placement, making sure the object center plus its half extent is not overlapping with object 4's boundaries.
           
           **Candidate Generation - Rotation and Position Sampling:**
           
           To get a diverse set of options, I'll generate candidates at multiple orientations of the object 5:
           *   `theta = 0` (no rotation).
           *   `theta = pi/4` (45-degree rotation).
           I'll also divide the placement surface into 4 parts:
           *   Region 1: Above Object 4
           *   Region 2: To the right of Object 4
           *   Region 3: Region 1 rotated (for Object 5 at pi/4).
           *   Region 4: Region 2 rotated (for Object 5 at pi/4).
           I'll create 4 grids, where object 5 has 16, 12, 12, and 12 positions at the different angles, and combine all the options to take the first 50 unique placements to ensure diversity.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable locations for a new object (ID 7) on Surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two existing objects, Object 4 and Object 5.  These two objects are already pretty snug in the bottom-left of the surface.  Object 4 occupies the bottom-left corner with object 5 snuggled along it.
           
           First, I meticulously calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each object.  This will let me determine the occupied space and, consequently, the *available* free space. I found that Object 4's AABB is approximately [-0.135, -0.0394] x [-0.135, -0.0394], and Object 5's AABB is roughly [-0.0394, 0.0467] x [-0.135, -0.0489].  A key insight is that x_max of object 4 almost touches the x_min of Object 5.
           
           This means that the *total* area occupied by both objects is approximately [-0.135, 0.0467] x [-0.135, -0.0394], which occupies much of the bottom-left of the surface.
           
           Now, my strategy is to focus on placing Object 7 *above* or *to the right* of these occupied objects.  I will be generating two types of placement: a grid above the block and a grid at a rotated angle. This increases the possible placements and helps with stability and diversification. The reasoning here is if `y_min_obj7 > y_max4` or `x_min_obj7 > x_max5`, then no collision is guaranteed.
           
           To make this efficient, I calculated the half-extents of Object 7, both at its default orientation (theta = 0) and at a 45-degree angle (theta = pi/4).  I realized that if I keep Object 7 *above* both Object 4 and Object 5, I would not have collisions.
           
           *   **Region 1 (above):** I will position the new object's center `y` to be above `y_max4 + hh`. I calculate the min and max y coordinates to have a grid.
           *   **Region 2 (right):** A second region will not be generated since the object would be colliding with the edge.
           
           I will be using two orientations:
           *   Theta = 0, will produce a 5x5 grid in the top left, roughly above the occupied blocks.
           *   Theta = pi/4, will produce a 5x5 grid in the top left, which ensures that there are enough varied placement locations.
           
           Now, I'll generate the precise placement coordinates. I'm going to create my grid, and ensure that the coordinates are valid.
           This method gives me a robust set of potential placements, making sure that there will be at least 50 valid locations that won't result in collisions.

           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 4, 5, and 7. The surface is a square,  `[-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135]`.  
           
           First, I need to get a good handle on where those existing objects are.  I've got their positions and dimensions, from which I can easily calculate their axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs).  Object 4 is in the bottom left, Object 5 is to the right of it, and Object 7 is mainly above Object 4.  The combined space they occupy is roughly `[-0.135, 0.047] x [-0.135, 0.057]`.
           
           Object 6 itself is nearly square, about `0.0969` units on each side.  I'll start by trying to place it either "above" or "to the right" of the existing cluster. However, to avoid any overlaps, I actually need to *check* against *each* individual object's AABB. Simple "above and to the right" strategy will be challenging as the current objects fill most of the available space.
           
           I considered two main orientations for Object 6:  `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees).  I need to calculate the *effective* width and height for *both* these angles when performing the collision checks.  For `theta=0`, the effective size is just Object 6's width/height itself. For the rotated object, I've got to take into account the combined widths/heights.
           
           My approach is to create a fine-grained grid of candidate center positions across the surface, at two orientations. I then carefully check the bounding box (AABB) of *each candidate placement* to ensure it does *not* collide with any of the three existing object AABBs. This way, if my AABB check says 'no collision,' it's stable and valid. I'll test 36 positions for each of the two theta values to produce 50 non-colliding placements.

           I considered two main orientations for Object 6:  `theta = 0` (aligned with the axes) and `theta = pi/4` (rotated 45 degrees).  I need to calculate the *effective* width and height for *both* these angles when performing the collision checks.  For `theta=0`, the effective size is just Object 6's width/height itself. For the rotated object, I've got to take into account the combined widths/heights.
           
           My approach is to create a fine-grained grid of candidate center positions across the surface, at two orientations. I then carefully check the bounding box (AABB) of *each candidate placement* to ensure it does *not* collide with any of the three existing object AABBs. This way, if my AABB check says 'no collision,' it's stable and valid. I'll test 36 positions for each of the two theta values to produce 50 non-colliding placements.
