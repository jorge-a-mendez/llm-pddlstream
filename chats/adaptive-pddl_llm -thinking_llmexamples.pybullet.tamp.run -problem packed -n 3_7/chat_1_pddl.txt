           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching for the Stack:**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. The goal is to stack these three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all on top of `v16`.  That means they need to be both supported by `v16` and in the right pose.  I've got the initial state facts to work with, but first I need to lay out the current situation.  
           
           I have two arms, both empty, and the robot base is at configuration `v3`.  The robot can move, and all the objects are graspable and stackable on `v16`.  Right now, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are sitting on `v11` at their current respective poses.
           
           To get the stacking right, I need to pick them up from where they are on `v11` and place them on `v16` in the designated `#o2` pose as the facts suggest.
           
           Now, my toolset is primarily `pick` and `place` actions, which depend on `kin` facts that dictate valid movements,  `atpose` to know the object's position, `handempty` and `atbconf`, which is the base configuration. The relevant `kin` facts are present, along with the `pick` and `place` actions that would execute this movement.
           
           The problem? I'm stuck at `atbconf(v3)`.  The `kin` facts require `atbconf(#o3)` for the current arm configuration, but the only `move_base` action I have doesn't actually change the base configuration to the required `bconf`.  It just resets `canmove()`.  No other actions are available to alter this configuration.
           
           So, I'm at an impasse.  I can't use `pick` and `place` because of this base configuration mismatch.  This means I can't move the objects to `v16`. The `atpose` of the target objects can only be changed with `pick` and `place`, so the goal `on` can't be reached as is.  It appears this plan is unachievable, at least in the initial state I've got. The goal is unreachable.
