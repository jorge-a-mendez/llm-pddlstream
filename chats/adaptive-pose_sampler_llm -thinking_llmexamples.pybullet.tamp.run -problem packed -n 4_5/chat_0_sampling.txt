(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with figuring out 50 stable placement configurations for a square object on a square surface. The object is a square, measuring roughly 0.078 units on each side. The surface is also a square, spanning from -0.135 to 0.135 on both x and y axes, meaning it's 0.27 units across.
           
           Given that it's a square, its orientation (theta) doesn't change the collision check, or the AABB, or does it? It states that x and y dimensions of the object are of the AABB definition. That means if I rotate it, the bounding box *does* get bigger. Since the dimensions are the same, I can just use `abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))` to get the `W` and `H` of the AABB. So, I will have to find the correct expression for that...
           
           After some mental gymnastics, it's clear: the effective side of the rotated square's AABB is  `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means as `theta` varies, the bounding box changes size. I've to calculate the appropriate ranges.
           
           Now, to tackle this placement problem, I'll calculate the *effective* width of the square, accounting for rotation, so I know I am within bounds. The surface area is 0.27 units on a side.  I then just need to ensure the AABB stays within the limits of the surface.  Since the object will always be smaller than the surface, there's space to place them.
           
           For 50 placements, I'll strategically vary `theta` and (x, y) coordinates. I'll stick to a surface index of 0.  I will choose 5 distinct values of theta to vary the AABB size (`0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2`).  For each `theta` value, I will have 10 placements.
           
           Now, I'll proceed with calculations for the allowable x and y ranges for each `theta` value, and then choose a set of distinct positions. I will vary both `x` and `y` from near the min to max values to generate the placement sets, to have a very good coverage.
           
           Okay, let's get this done.

(Thoughts: **My Current Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement for Object 6, and now it's time to find a good spot for Object 4 on the same surface.  My main concern is making sure Object 4 doesn't collide with Object 6.  I've got the details of both objects: Object 6's AABB is perfectly centered at the origin, and I'm treating Object 4 as a square for simpler collision detection.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Understand Object 6:** Object 6 is a square with an AABB extending from approximately -0.039 to 0.039 in both the x and y directions. It's essentially a no-go zone.
           
           2.  **Account for Rotations and AABBs:** I need to figure out how Object 4's AABB changes based on its rotation (`theta`).  At `theta = 0` or multiples of pi/2, the AABB is straightforward, but at angles like pi/4, it becomes much wider.
           
           3.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** I'll calculate `s_effective` which describes the effective side length of the AABB based on the chosen rotation angle.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance is Key:** I need to make *absolutely sure* that no parts of Object 4's AABB overlap with Object 6's.  I realized earlier that the collision conditions are *much* stricter than I initially thought.  No overlaps, *at all*.
           
           5.  **Placement Validation:** I need to check if the proposed placement location for Object 4 will actually fit on the surface of `surf_idx = 0`. Then, I'll calculate Object 4's AABB based on the chosen rotation, position, and dimensions and ensure that its AABB does not overlap with Object 6.
           
           6.  **Find Valid Placements:** Based on the current object positions and the strict collision constraint, I've come to the conclusion that Object 4 *must* use `theta=0` or `theta=pi/2` (or pi or 3pi/2) to be safely placed. Any rotation will cause an intersection. I am planning on generating `50` placements, and will utilize only the `0, pi/2` options to be 100% sure I'm following the rules. I'll make sure there is no overlap by considering an offset.
           
           7.  **Generate a Placement List:** Then I will carefully place Object 4. I will set the valid placement with this offset in mind, in which case I will be able to make 50 safe placements on the surface!

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis and Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to place Object 5, a square with sides of approximately 0.099 units, onto Surface 0, which is a square region of 0.27 units on a side, centered at (0,0). The challenge? Avoid collisions with two existing objects: Object 6, a square with side 0.078, centered at (0,0) and Object 4, a square with side 0.091, centered at (0.086, 0).
           
           My initial instinct is to maximize the space available. I'll need to figure out the effective AABB of Object 5 based on its rotation, then strategically position it within the surface boundaries. Crucially, I have to ensure that Object 5 doesn't overlap with the AABBs of Objects 6 and 4. I'll need to consider how far the center of Object 5 has to be from the edge.
           
           After all that analysis, I'm left baffled. My AABB collision calculations keep pointing towards the *impossibility* of placing object 5 without collisions. It doesn't matter the orientation. The other objects are in the way. Given the problem statement, this can't be correct. It feels like there has to be some nuance I'm missing.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object 7 Placement**
           
           My goal is to place Object 7 a total of 50 times stably on Surface 0, taking into account the existing obstacles: Objects 6, 4, and 5. This requires careful consideration of both surface constraints and collision avoidance.
           
           First, I've calculated the effective bounding box (AABB) of Object 7 for different rotations, since it's a square. The minimal AABB size is used when Object 7 is not rotated at all (or at a multiple of 90 degrees). The maximal AABB size uses rotation at 45 degrees. The surface is defined by its dimensions, and I've determined that Object 7's center *must* lie within a smaller region to fully fit.
           
           Second, I've assessed the existing objects' AABBs to understand the "free" space on the surface. Object 6 is centered at the origin, and Object 4 and 5 are to its right and slightly above it. I've calculated the overlapping ranges for each object on the x and y axes. Because the objects are so close, there are very few completely "safe" regions.
           
           Third, I've defined the collision conditions. For each object, I've determined the region within which the center of Object 7 must *not* lie to avoid a collision. The AABB approach implies that if any of the axis-aligned ranges overlap, then there is a collision.
           
           I then identified and defined the collision regions with each of the obstacles. These collision regions are defined from the ranges of the obstacle AABBs increased by half the side of the Object 7's AABB. I've simplified the approach and considered only the minimal AABB (when no rotation) to simplify the analysis.
           I noted that some combinations are impossible, given the existing surface and object placement.
           
           Finally, I've used the calculations to find three very narrow rectangular regions within which the center of Object 7 can be safely placed to avoid all collisions. I've narrowed down the ranges for both the `x` and `y` center coordinates. I then found a few valid pairs of coordinates in those ranges. To meet the request for 50 placements, I'll select from these sets of coordinates, using both the `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2` settings. The chosen pairs are far apart enough to avoid overlap and will provide the requested placements.
