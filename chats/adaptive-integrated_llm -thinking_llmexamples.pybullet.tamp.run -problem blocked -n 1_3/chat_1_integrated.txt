User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.435, -0.359), (-4.34, -0.263)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.387, -0.311, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.967, -0.255).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom kin(v4, v15, v16, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, I've analyzed the problem thoroughly. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having object `v8` "on" surface `v18` and ensuring `v8` is of the correct type, which it already is.  The crux of the matter is the "on" predicate – meaning `v8` has to be at a specific pose on `v18`. From the initial state and supported facts, it is clear that I must get `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) to a pose on surface `v18`.  
           
           My initial intuition was to use a `pick` and `place` action sequence. The plan would involve picking `v8` from its current pose `v9`, and placing it at a specific target pose `#o2` on `v18`. I know that `#o2` should be calculated so that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` becomes true, meaning `v8` is physically stable on `v18`.
           
           I diligently examined the preconditions for both `pick` and `place`, including the need to have the appropriate kinematic relations, empty arm hand, and to ensure that the approach and final poses are safe (not colliding with other objects).
           
           However, there's a critical constraint.  The provided *list of valid action instances* only contains  `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. The problem description states explicitly that any action not *specifically* listed is not allowed. This means I'm severely restricted in what I can do.  I can only use the move base.
           
           This is where the problem becomes unachievable. While `move_base` is available, it cannot accomplish the task. *Moving* an object requires a `pick` and a `place`, and these actions are expressly forbidden by the given constraint. Thus, since I can't *move* the object with the given constraints, achieving the goal state of `on(v8, v18)` is impossible. The object `v8` cannot be relocated from its initial position on object `v11` and therefore the goal cannot be accomplished, as any change in location from pose `v9` requires using actions that are not available.
