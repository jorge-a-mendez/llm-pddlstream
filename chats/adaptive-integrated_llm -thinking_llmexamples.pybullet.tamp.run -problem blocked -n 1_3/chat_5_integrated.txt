           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Path to `new-axiom@0()`: Placing `v12` on `v18`**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, specifically of type `v17`, be "on" another object, in this case `v18`.  Given the initial state, I know there are two objects of the correct type: `v8` and `v12`. I need to figure out how to put either of these on `v18`. After looking at the supported predicates, my plan hinges on picking either `v8` or `v12` and placing it on `v18`.
           
           My initial analysis focused on `v8`, because there were some clear "supported" relations indicating I might be able to put it on `v18`. `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, but to put it on `v18` I'd need to pick it up and place it. Based on the initial state information, the best approach would involve `p3`, but placing `v8` on `p3` caused some issues. With  `~test-cfree-pose-pose-negative`, where not stated is false, `unsafepose` is true for any approach that isn't safe, which is why that path was blocked.
           
           I then shifted my focus to `v12`.  `v12` is also of type `v17`, so I can use it to reach my goal!
           
           Based on the initial state, my plan is now as follows:
           
           1.  **Move the base.** First, I need to get the robot base to the correct base configuration, `#o3`, by calling `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           2.  **Pick up `v12` from its current pose, `v13`**: I'll execute `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The collision checks were very important here.
           3. **Place `v12` on `v18` at pose `#o2`**: Finally, I execute `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. I will set `#o2` to (4.5, -0.3, 0.802, 0.0), which puts `v12` at the center of `v18`.
           
           That's the plan. I've re-checked all collision considerations, and with the proper interpretation of `~test-cfree-`, I should be good to go. This should do the trick! I need to ensure that the poses are within supported ranges.
