User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.435, -0.359), (-4.34, -0.263)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.387, -0.311, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.967, -0.255).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing either an object `v8` or `v12` (both of type `v17`) onto `v18`. From the initial state, I can see that `v8` is currently supported by `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. Both are at specific poses. My problem is that I need either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)` to be true, and both require `supported` and `atpose` predicates to hold.
           
           Initially, I thought I could leverage the fact that the initial state mentions `pose(v8, #o2)`, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and the similar configuration for `v12`.  This seemed to imply I *could* move the objects to `#o2` and then onto `v18`.  However, after careful consideration, I've realized this isn't possible because the only allowed action is `move_base`.
           
           The available action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` doesn't change the position of objects.  It just moves the base, and more importantly, it makes `canmove()` false, which shuts down *any* subsequent actions.  No manipulation actions (like `pick` and `place`) are allowed.  Therefore, I'm stuck: I cannot move `v8` or `v12` to `v18`.
           
           I've also analyzed the prompt's ambiguous language regarding the `#o2` pose. Since `#o2` is present with `pose` and `supported` predicates, it could be a shared pose for all those items. However, the problem explicitly states that when using "#" objects you need to provide continuous values. Since I cannot execute any action to use the `#o2` pose, I will not worry about this detail.
           
           Hence, given the constraints of only using `move_base` and the need for manipulation to solve the problem, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unachievable. The initial state and the available action instance simply do not align.
