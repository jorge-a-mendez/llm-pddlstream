               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis:  Unreachable Goal State**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is straightforward: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked *on* `v16`.  This translates to ensuring that the `on` predicate holds for each object/target pair. Easy enough to state... but how do we *achieve* it?
           
           Looking at the initial state, each target object is supported by `v11`. Now, the crucial part: I've got to analyze available actions, and here's the rub.  The ONLY available action instance is `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)`. This means the robot can *only* move its base; no arm manipulation, no picking, no placing.
           
           My understanding of the problem space requires the robot, using its arm, to pick up each object from `v11` and place them onto `v16`. To formalize the actions, I must use `pick` and `place` actions, which are not currently permitted.
           
           Specifically, I know from object knowledge that each object `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` can be placed on `v16` (confirmed by the `supported` facts).  However, I'm missing the ability to *act* on this knowledge.  I need actions that allow me to manipulate objects.
           
           The lack of `pick` and `place` actions is a hard constraint here. My plan, ultimately, boils down to performing those actions.  I need to pick up the objects, move them, and place them on the target.  Unfortunately, with only `move_base` available, this is *impossible*. I cannot pick or place any object. This is a clear case of an unachievable goal state.
