(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: I need to arrange three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, on top of object `v16`.  Currently, they're all resting on `v11`.  My analysis reveals I have a suitable arm (`v4`) available and it's currently empty, thanks to the `handempty(v4)` fact.  I also see that all these objects can be grasped, so that's a positive start.
           
           My initial thought is that the most efficient route will involve lifting each object individually and carefully placing them onto `v16`. I have a robot base that *can* move, so I will need to move it to a suitable configuration for the actions to work. I have the `kin` facts, or the robot "kinematics", needed to carry out these actions.
           
           The essential "workhorse" facts I need are `supported` and `atpose`, as my goal relies on `on` predicates that are just combinations of those. Each object needs to be both supported *and* at the desired pose on the target object.
           
           I noticed a key detail in the facts – there's a specific pose, called `#o2`, that each of the three objects *can* be placed in, according to the `supported` facts.  Also, there is a target base configuration `#o3` required for the arm kinematics. This suggests that I will need to move the base of the robot to `#o3` so I can reach the target.
           
           My plan crystallizes into the following steps:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** Since the robot is initially at `v3`, I will need to have the base move to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and place the first object (`v8`):**  I will use arm `v4` to lift `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) on top of object `v11` and place it onto `v16` at pose `#o2`.
           3.  **Pick and place the second object (`v12`):**  I will then grasp `v12` from its pose (`v13`) on object `v11`, and stack it on `v16` at pose `#o2`.
           4.  **Pick and place the third object (`v14`):** Finally, `v14` will be grasped from its pose (`v15`) on `v11`, and it also will be stacked on `v16` at pose `#o2`.
           
           Because there are no interdependencies between the goals I have, I could perform the steps in any order, so long as the robot base is at the appropriate configuration.
           I am confident that this plan will achieve the desired `on` predicates, given the information at hand. There are no conflicts.
