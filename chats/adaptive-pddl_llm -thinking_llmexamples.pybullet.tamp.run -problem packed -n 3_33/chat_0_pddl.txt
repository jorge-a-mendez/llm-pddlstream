           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Infeasible Goal**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Essentially, I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. I have the initial state, which includes where everything *currently* is.  Specifically, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all on `v11`.
           
           I know the allowed actions: just `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This is essentially a "no-op" for the base position; it only fiddles with `canmove()` and `atbconf()`.  The key problem I'm seeing is that *I need to move things around* to get them *on* `v16`.
           
           The definition of `on` tells me I need both support (`supported`) and the correct pose (`atpose`). I *know* from the initial state where `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *currently* are, and where they *could* be, from the presence of poses like `#o2` and relationships like `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`. The goal is achievable, *conceptually*.
           
           The issue is this: *the only actions I'm allowed are base movements*. No picking or placing.  The logic is clear: I need to pick these objects up from `v11`, get them to their corresponding poses on `v16`, and then place them.  This *requires* `pick` and `place` actions, which I *do not* have access to.
           
           Even though I have *poses* associated with `v16` that would allow these objects to be supported, the lack of `pick` and `place` actions means I can't *move* the objects to those positions.  I'm stuck. It doesn't matter that I can *theoretically* achieve the goal, *no valid actions* can change the `atpose` facts to reflect the goal state. Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy the `on` predicates with the given action set. The goal is *not* achievable.
