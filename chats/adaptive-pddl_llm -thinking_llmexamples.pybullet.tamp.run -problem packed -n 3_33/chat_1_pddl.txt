           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at a planning problem. My goal is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  The initial state tells me they're currently on `v11`.  Essentially, I need to manipulate these objects using `pick` and `place` actions to achieve the desired configuration.
           
           My initial thought process goes like this:  To achieve an `on(?o, ?r)` state, I know I need to satisfy two conditions:  `atpose(?o, ?p)` and `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)`.  Placing an object on `v16` means I need to `pick` it up from its current location, and then `place` it at a valid pose on `v16`.  I immediately start looking for available `pick` and `place` actions in the problem description.
           
           I see potential `pick` and `place` candidates based on the `kin` relations.  For instance, the `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` relations *imply* the ability to pick `v12` with the arm `v4`.  Similarly, the `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` relations look like the potential `place` action.  I see supported relations at pose `#o2` for objects on `v16`, which is very promising!
           
           However, the crucial piece is the "available action instances" list. That list is *the* limiting factor!  It tells me which actions I'm *allowed* to use. And unfortunately, that list is just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This "move_base" action appears to do nothing useful for this problem. It's essentially a no-op!
           
           Since I'm constrained to use only those available actions, and no `pick` or `place` actions are listed, I'm stuck.  I cannot change the positions of the objects using only a `move_base` action.  Therefore, the goal is *unreachable*. I can't construct a plan to satisfy the goal predicate within the given constraints.
