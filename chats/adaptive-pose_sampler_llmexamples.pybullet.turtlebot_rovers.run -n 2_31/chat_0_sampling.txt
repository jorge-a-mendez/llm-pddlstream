User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, including clusters of boxes in the top-right and top-left quadrants, and a few smaller obstacles near the center and bottom of the scene. I will try to find positions for the robot that are within the allowed range and avoid these known obstacles, while being within 2 units of the target. I will try to vary the angle around the target point for the positions.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous choices were based on a target point (0.13410313072216016 -0.06385311099689409). The feedback provided is for a target point at (-2.199612617492676, 2.0697171688079834). I will use the feedback provided for the previous target point for future requests on that same target point. Since this is a new target point, I will restart my search based on the initial understanding of the scene.
