(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 10**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) of size approximately 0.09x0.09 meters within a rectangular surface (Surface 0). The surface is defined as ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)) which translates to a width and height of 0.6. Since this is my initial request, I have no information about previous placements and collisions.
           
           To ensure stability and diverse coverage, I'll strategically vary the object's position (x, y) and rotation (theta). The general approach will be to create two grids: one aligned with the surface at 0 radians rotation and one rotated at $\pi/4$ radians. To calculate x and y, I need to account for the object dimensions and rotation.
           
           Object dimensions are given, and will be called `size_x` and `size_y`, and approximately 0.09. I calculate the AABB's half width and height with `obj_half_x` and `obj_half_y`.
           
           The crucial factor is ensuring the object remains entirely within the surface boundaries. For this, I calculate the object's *effective* half-width and half-height for each chosen `theta`.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the calculation is straight-forward. I use the object's half dimensions to calculate the x and y coordinate range.
           For `theta = 0`,  `effective_hw = obj_half_x = 0.045407630489163075` and `effective_hh = obj_half_y = 0.04540763048916299`.
           
           For `theta = \pi/4`,  the rotation creates an *effective* increase in dimension due to bounding box calculation.
           `effective_hw = obj_half_x*cos(pi/4) + obj_half_y*sin(pi/4)  \approx 0.06422709230537463`. The  bounding box height is calculated similarly.
           
           To accommodate the two different orientations (`0` and `pi/4`), I construct two 5x5 grids for object placement. These 5x5 grids provide sufficient placement diversity and a total count of 50. Each grid will have its own coordinate offset.
           
           For `theta = 0`:
           
           *   Valid x range: \[4.2454, 4.7546]
           *   Valid y range: \[-0.5546, -0.0454]
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           
           *   Valid x range: \[4.2642, 4.7358]
           *   Valid y range: \[-0.5358, -0.0642]
           
           The x and y coordinates are determined by dividing up the width of their ranges to make a grid.
           The step size of the x and y ranges are then used to calculate all coordinate placements.
           Each of these placements are of the form (`surf_idx, theta, x, y`), where `surf_idx` is `0`.
           
           The placement calculations are all derived using clear formulas to maintain stable placements and diversity.

Model:     **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 10**
