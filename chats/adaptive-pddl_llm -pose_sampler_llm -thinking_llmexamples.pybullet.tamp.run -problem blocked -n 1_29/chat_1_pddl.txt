           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I know how `on` works - it relies on `supported` and `atpose`.  My initial thought is to identify a suitable `?green` object that already has `type(?green, v17)` and then manipulate its position to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`.
           
           I quickly spot that both `v12` and `v8` fit the bill because `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are already true.  I decide to work with `v8` first.  Since `type(v8, v17)` is already true, I focus on getting `v8` *on* `v18`.
           
           This leads me down the path of trying to get `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` true. I find `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true in the initial state, so the problem boils down to achieving `atpose(v8, #o2)`. Since `atpose(v8, v9)` is true, I need to get `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           This is where things start to get tricky.  I know how to *pick* and *place* objects, so I formulate a plan: `pick` `v8` from `v9`, then `place` `v8` at `#o2`. I dive into the preconditions for `pick`.  I see I need `atbconf(#o3)`. But the only available `move_base` action allows the robot to *stay* at its current base configuration `v3`. This is a problem because all the `kin` predicates that support picking and placing objects explicitly require the base to be at configuration `#o3`.
           
           I check the available actions and predicates again and it's clear:  The robot is stuck at `v3`, and can't reach `#o3`. The only base movement is from `v3` to `v3`. This means I cannot execute *any* of the `pick` or `place` actions, which in turn means I can't modify the `atpose` of any object.  If `atpose` can't change, then the `on` relationships also cannot change.
           
           I revisit the goal:  `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state and the implications of being stuck at `v3`, I realize this is impossible. No object with `type(..., v17)` is currently on `v18`, and because of the constraints on base movement, they *cannot* be made to be on `v18`.  It seems the available `move_base` action prevents any change to `atpose` and thus makes it impossible to achieve the goal. I am forced to conclude that this goal, in the current state of the world, is *unreachable*. I also re-evaluated how move_base works and that it simply keeps the initial configuration the same.
           
           Therefore, the planning process stops with an analysis of a contradiction between what is needed and what is possible.
