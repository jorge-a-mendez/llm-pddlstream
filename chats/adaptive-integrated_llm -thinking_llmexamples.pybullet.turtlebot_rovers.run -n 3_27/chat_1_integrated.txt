           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for Achieving the New Axiom**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is `new-axiom@0()`, but that hinges on two key parts: getting some images and performing some soil and rock analyses.  I've got a system, and I'm ready to use it!
           
           First, those images. The setup has two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, but since `imagevisible` predicates are present with `v12`, I'm going to task `v12` with grabbing and sending them. I see that `imagevisible` depends on a ray and a target, which I need to get by checking what I'm given in the initial state. I'll need to send the images back to the base, too. That means a two-part process: take the image, then move to a comms configuration to broadcast.
           
           *   **Imaging:** `v12` will need to:
               1.  Get to `#o3`, which seems to be the sweet spot for the imagevisible criteria for each of my objectives, `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. I'll work out coordinates for each.
               2.  For each objective:
                   *   Calibrate the camera (I see `calibrated(v10, v12)` is an effect of the calibration action)
                   *   Take the picture.
                   *   Move to the correct comm config to broadcast.
                   *   Send the Image.
           
           *   **Analysis:** Meanwhile, I see that I can meet the need for a soil sample, `type(?soil, v6)`, and a rock sample, `type(?stone, v2)`. This will be the job for `v14`. I have the initial positioning for all the samples at location `#o5`. I'll also have to drop the sample if my store fills up:
               1.  The move action requires that the store is free, so sample the material and move. The initial positioning indicates these are the configurations.
               2.  Sample either a rock sample, send the analysis, drop the rock, re-configure, sample the soil, and reconfigure one last time.
           
           In other words, it's all about coordinating the movements and actions of the rovers to meet these image- and sample-collection needs. I'm seeing it all and putting the pieces together.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Configuration Logic and Values**
           
           Okay, so the user identified an error in my previous response: I needed to specify continuous values for configurations using `<x> <y>` pairs. No problem, I'm on it. The plan's logic itself is sound, so I'll be reusing it and just fixing the formatting for these configurations.
           
           First, I re-verified the plan to ensure it achieves the goal `new-axiom@0()`, and it all checks out. The issue was purely the configuration format.
           
           Here's the breakdown of what I need to address:
           
           *   **Communication:** Both rovers (`v12` and `v14`) need to communicate with the lander (`v9`). This means I need to provide `#o0` coordinates for each rover-lander pair. I've chosen `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (0.0, -2.0)` and `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-1.5, -2.0)`. These locations allow communication with `v9` while being relatively collision-free.
           *   **Imaging:** Rover `v12` needs to image three different objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). This means I need to provide separate `#o3` coordinates for each objective. The problem statement *explicitly* says to provide different values for each rover-target pair, even though the PDDL uses the same object name (`#o3`). My choices are:
               *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.5, 1.0)`
               *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18): (1.0, 1.5)`
               *   `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19): (-1.0, 1.0)`
               These locations all allow a direct line of sight to the respective objectives from the rover. I also validated that these positions are collision free by comparing these configurations with the obstacle locations from the initial state.
           
           The key thing I needed to understand was that the same object name (`#o3`, `#o0`) can represent different *physical* configurations depending on the context (rover and target). Also, I recognized that  I do *not* need to specify a configuration for `#o5`, as the problem statement explicitly only requires configurations for  `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, and `#o5` is for `above`.
           
           The final response will include these updated configuration values in the correct format, and I will be ready to provide a concise and correct answer to the user.

(Thoughts: **A Refined Approach to Configuration Values**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I've re-evaluated the continuous configuration values, focusing on avoiding collisions and ensuring reachability for rovers while adhering to the structure of the existing plan. The key here is to nail down the `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` values, specifically. I'm taking the previous plan's framework and refining the numbers.
           
           First, I need to address the ambiguities in interpreting the problem statement. The original plan had collision problems.  I must give specific values for *every* continuous parameter (`#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`) that meet these criteria.  In particular, any configuration starting with '#' for which `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state *must* get a defined value. Also, if a configuration is in an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, *then* it requires a specific, continuous value.
           
           For `#o0` (communication), I'm working with the constraint that it needs to be an occlusion-free ray to the lander (`v9`). Also, I *must* avoid the long obstacle `v20`.  For rover `v12` I tried a location near `v13` that allows direct communication to the lander. The same is the case for rover `v14` as well.
           
           The primary issue is the interpretation of what the plan demands.
           
           With `#o3` (imaging), the trick is making sure the rover can see everything in the initial state. Previously I had trouble with this, so I will define separate `#o3` configuration coordinates for each (rover, objective) pair. The prompt clarifies that I *can* create these new unique configuration locations for each pair. This is the crucial point! The single configuration `#o3` in the initial state is a placeholder. I am providing values for `#o3` each time it is used in the plan. I will define an appropriate set of coordinates for `(v12, v17)`, `(v12, v18)`, and `(v12, v19)`. I also re-checked all collision detections and ensure that each coordinate is reachable and valid.
           
           And `#o5` I am only using for rock sampling for which I will also propose new coordinates.
           
           Ultimately, I am confident that these configurations solve the collision issues, satisfy all requirements, and allow the plan to be successfully executed.

(Thoughts: **Rover Plan Summary**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to solve the "rovers" problem. I'm focusing on getting those images and analyses back to base.  I've got two rovers, v12 and v14, each with their own jobs.
           
           **Rover v12 (Imaging):**  This rover will handle the imaging tasks.  First, it needs to move from its starting position (v13, approximately at x=1.0, y=-1.75) to an image-taking configuration (`#o3`) for target `v17` (approximately at x=0.5, y=2.18). I'm planning to use `#o3` at (0.7, 0.4) for that. Then, it will calibrate the camera, snap an image, and send it back to the lander (`v9`) via its communication config (`#o0` at (0.5, -1.5)). After that, it needs to repeat the process for `v18` (approx. at x=2.03, y=2.09), where the `#o3` is at (1.5, 0.5), and then go back home. The `take_image` distance from `#o3` to the targets are within the 2m range limit.
           
           **Rover v14 (Imaging & Sampling):** Rover v14 will also take an image but will also do some sampling work. This rover needs to move from its starting position (v15, at x=-1.0, y=-1.75) to a new image configuration (`#o3`), which is (-1.1, 0.1) for objective `v19` (center at approximately x=-1.8, y=1.86), then sends the image to lander `v9`. After that it moves to sampling configs to collect samples. It goes to a sample config `#o5`, then grabs the samples of rocks `v1` and `v5`, sends their analysis, and drops the rocks off at the end of each `sample` action (frees storage). To communicate, `v14` will use the config at (-1.0, -1.0) and send its messages to `v9` at approximately (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           I've carefully selected the `#o3` and `#o0` positions to avoid collisions with any of the static obstacles and to keep the distances between positions and targets within the 2-meter visual range and 4-meter communication range. Reachability is now assumed to be the distance between two waypoints, and the actions are from a list of predefined actions.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End in the Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've been tasked with mapping out a plan for those pesky rovers to get their job done in this specific scenario. The initial layout has the rovers at specific positions, ready to kick things off. My primary headache? Figuring out the right moves for each rover: a sequence of actions plus their corresponding configurations in the world. Key challenge: any config needs to be reachable from its starting position, free from any pesky collisions, and perfectly line-of-sight to its targets for both image capture and communication. Also, image capture and communication have strict range restrictions.
           
           My goal is to achieve some crucial conditions. First, both rovers have to end up in their specific goal configurations. Plus, I need to receive images from three different locations, which I'll call image targets, through the lander - that's the communication target. The other goal? I need a "received analysis" for both a stone and soil type rock, respectively. It sounds pretty straightforward, but the devil's in the details.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is the initial arrangement and obstacle placement. After initial checks of the starting configuration, I quickly honed in on a serious snag: the wall (v20) is a major blocker. Its position along x=0 is a deal breaker.
           
           Rover v12 has to stay on the positive side. Rover v14, on the negative. The main issue is that only Rover v14 can *communicate* with the lander. The lander lies on the negative side, so any communication has to come from that direction. And it turns out that all the stone samples are on the positive side of that wall!
           
           V12 cannot send any analysis. And since Rover 14 cannot reach the stones, the goal is not reachable. All the image targets are unreachable, for the rover on the negative side of the x=0 axis.
           This means that I'm up against an unsolvable puzzle. The world's configuration, and the requirements of communication combined with sampling, mean the plan I am to create is not possible.
