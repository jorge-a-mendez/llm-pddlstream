           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` in this *rovers* domain. First things first, I need to understand the components of this goal. After dissecting the axiom, I realize it's a conjunction of several conditions. Four of these conditions are already satisfied in the initial state – perfect! However, I still need to address the remaining ones: achieving a set of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I need to make sure the lander got three images and sent analysis for all rocks and soil.
           
           My initial thought is to map out the available actions. However, after reviewing the available actions it is very clear there isn't a clear path forward for achieving the desired configuration.
           
           There's a serious constraint here: the only `move` actions I'm allowed are ones that keep the rovers *exactly* where they are. This is a huge roadblock. To get those images and analyses, I need the rovers to *move* to the appropriate positions – configurations like `#o3` for imaging and `#o5` for sampling.  But with the actions at my disposal, I can't do that. The problem statement explicitly states that *only* the actions provided are valid, and those don't allow for any configuration changes.
           
           I've carefully examined the preconditions for all the relevant actions (like `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `calibrate`, and their corresponding `send` actions). They all have one commonality: they require the rover to be at a specific configuration, which I can call `atconf(V, Q)`. This also holds true for when sending data, and must be at a particular configuration for the communication to work, as shown in the example with the lander.  The values of Q is given as a continuous parameter `#oX` in all of the cases I analyzed. I *do* see that the rover's initial positions are `v13` and `v15`, but these are distinct from the configurations I need to reach. The `move` actions listed simply keep the rovers in the same spot, so I can't ever satisfy those `atconf(V, Q)` preconditions. If this premise is not satisfied, there is no way for the rover to perform its tasks.
           
           Given these constraints and the problem statement, I can only conclude that achieving the `new-axiom@0()` goal is *impossible* with the given actions. The rovers are effectively immobilized.
