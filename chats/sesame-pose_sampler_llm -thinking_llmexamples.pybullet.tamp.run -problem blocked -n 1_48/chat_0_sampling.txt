           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements (surf_idx, theta, x, y) for object 5, a 0.07x0.07 square, on surface 0, which is a rectangle from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since the object is small relative to the surface and is a square, the rotation angle won't be a major constraint.
           
           First, I define the object's geometry:
           *   `hx = hy = 0.035` (half-extents of the square, size/2)
           
           Next, I calculate the bounds for placing the object on the surface:
           *   The valid x range: from `surf_0_lower_x + rotated_hx` to `surf_0_upper_x - rotated_hx`
           *   The valid y range: from `surf_0_lower_y + rotated_hy` to `surf_0_upper_y - rotated_hy`
           For theta = 0, hx and hy are 0.035, For theta = pi/4 hx and hy is about 0.049.
           
           My strategy involves generating a grid of placements. I'll define two sets of 5x5 grid values:
           -   Set 1, `theta = 0`, valid x from [4.235, 4.765] and y from [-0.565, -0.035]
               -   x values: [4.27, 4.37, 4.47, 4.57, 4.67]
               -   y values: [-0.53, -0.43, -0.33, -0.23, -0.13]
           -   Set 2, `theta = pi/4`, valid x from [4.249, 4.75] and y from [-0.55, -0.049]
               -   x values: [4.29, 4.39, 4.49, 4.59, 4.69]
               -   y values: [-0.51, -0.41, -0.31, -0.21, -0.11]
           
           These values are chosen to fit within the surfaces constraints at their rotated sizes. The first set will give 25 placements at 0 degrees, the second set gives 25 placements at 45 degrees, totaling to 50 stable placements. I will generate these 50 placements with the provided geometry, then return that data.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID 10**
           
           My objective is to place a new square object (ID 10) of approximately 0.0977 x 0.0977 dimensions on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). I must ensure the object is stable and avoids collisions with any previous objects, specifically ID 5, if still present.  The feedback on ID 5 placements highlighted that positions with `theta = 0` and `x` values around 4.27 and 4.37 were successful, indicating no collisions with *fixed* obstacles.  Other placements, however, may have encountered *non-fixed* obstacles. I will use this information to avoid those regions when placing object ID 10. I will first identify the *successful* positions of object ID 5. This object had successful placements at the following locations: AABB: [(4.235, 4.305] x [-0.565, -0.095]) and AABB: [(4.335, 4.405] x [-0.565, -0.095].
           
           To ensure no overlap, I've calculated the valid placement area for ID 10, considering its rotated dimensions. The half-extents are approximately 0.04885, and rotated dimensions depend on theta: for `theta = 0`, the range is [4.24885, 4.75115] for x and [-0.55115, -0.04885] for y. For `theta = pi/4`, the rotated extents are approximately 0.06908, the x-range is [4.26908, 4.73092], and the y-range is [-0.53092, -0.06908]. Object 10 cannot fit between objects 5, which are located in two columns, because object 10's dimensions with any rotation would be too large to fit in the space.
           
           Therefore, for ID 10, I'll place the object to the right of the already placed ID 5 objects. Since the goal is to generate diverse placement options, I am creating 10 options for each of the five angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2). For the case of `theta = 0`, I am using x values of 4.47 and 4.57 and y values of [-0.53, -0.43, -0.33, -0.23, -0.13].
           For other thetas, I am using different x and y values within their respective ranges. I'm taking into account the necessary clearances and making sure that the coordinates of object 10 are well within the surface bounds. By doing this, I generate 50 distinct placement configurations for object ID 10 that satisfy the stability and non-collision constraints. I am confident in my selection of placements.
