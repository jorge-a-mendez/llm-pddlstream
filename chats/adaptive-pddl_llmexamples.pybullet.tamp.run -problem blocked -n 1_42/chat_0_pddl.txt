           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The user wants me to find a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           The axiom `new-axiom@0()` is defined as:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom on(?green, v18)
               Atom type(?green, v17)
           ```
           This means I need to find an object `?green` such that it is on `v18` and its type is `v17`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I have the following information about objects and their types/locations:
           - `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)` => `on(v8, v11)`
           - `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)` => `on(v15, v11)`
           - `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)` => `on(v12, v14)`
           - `type(v8, v17)`
           - `type(v12, v17)`
           
           From this, I can see that `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`.
           So, I need either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Let's check the current `on` predicates:
           - `on(v8, v11)`
           - `on(v15, v11)`
           - `on(v12, v14)`
           
           None of the objects of type `v17` (`v8` or `v12`) are currently on `v18`.
           This means I need to move either `v8` or `v12` to `v18`.
           
           The available action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action just moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. It does not change the location of any objects.
           
           Since I cannot move any object using the only available action, and the goal requires an object of type `v17` to be on `v18`, which is not true initially and cannot be made true with the given actions, the goal is unreachable.
           The only available action is `move_base`, which does not allow for picking or placing objects. Therefore, the state of objects being on `v18` cannot be changed.
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The user is correct, I made a mistake by not providing a plan when I stated the goal was unreachable. My apologies for the formatting error.
           
           As explained previously, the goal `new-axiom@0()` requires an object of `type v17` to be `on v18`.
           From the initial state:
           - Objects of type `v17` are `v8` and `v12`.
           - `v8` is `on v11`.
           - `v12` is `on v14`.
           Neither `v8` nor `v12` are on `v18`.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only changes the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) and `canmove()` predicate. It does not allow the robot to manipulate objects (pick, place, clean, or cook) or change their `on` relationships.
           
           Therefore, the condition `on(?green, v18)` for an object `?green` of `type v17` cannot be achieved with the given actions. The goal is unreachable.
