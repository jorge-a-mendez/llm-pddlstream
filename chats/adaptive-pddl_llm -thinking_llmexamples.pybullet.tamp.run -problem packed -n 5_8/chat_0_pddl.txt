           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Plan: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. The task is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto object `v20`. The initial state has them all resting on `v11`.  I understand that `on(?o, ?r)` means that `?o` is both `supported` by a pose and is `atpose` with respect to a pose on the surface of `?r`.  My initial thought is to identify a viable plan to achieve this configuration.
           
           The obvious route is to `pick` each object from `v11` and `place` them onto `v20`.  My immediate concern is the actions available to me. I have to work with what's provided, as the prompt specifies a hard constraint regarding the permitted action instances.  I'm limited to a single action: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is a movement action, taking the base from `v3` to `v3` without changing object positions.
           
           Let's dissect this. Currently, the `on` predicate tells me that each object is `on(object, v11)`. My goal is to change that to `on(object, v20)`. The `pick` and `place` actions would seem essential to facilitate this transition.  However, critically, they are *not* permitted.
           
           Upon revisiting the prompt, I confirm that only the `move_base` action instance is allowed. This implies that no changes in the `on` predicate are permissible because I cannot manipulate objects directly. Therefore, I conclude that the goal state of getting `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto `v20` *cannot be achieved*. The plan is, unfortunately, an impossibility given the constraints.
