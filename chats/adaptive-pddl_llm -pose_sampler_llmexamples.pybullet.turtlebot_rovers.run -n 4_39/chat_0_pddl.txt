User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene, particularly in the upper half (positive y values) and near the right wall (positive x values). There are also some smaller obstacles in the bottom half near the left wall.
           
           Given the target point (1.78, 0.44), which is in the first quadrant, my strategy is to try positions around the target point, keeping in mind the max distance of 2 and the fixed obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are relatively unconstrained by the known obstacles.
           
           I will try positions in the following order:
           1. Directly to the right of the target point, as this area seems less cluttered.
           2. Below the target point, also seemingly less cluttered.
           3. Above the target point, but being careful about the cluster of obstacles in the upper region.
           
           Positions:
           (2.5 0.44)
           (1.78 -1.56)
           (1.78 2.44)
