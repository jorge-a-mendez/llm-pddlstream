(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on a given surface (surf_idx = 0). The surface is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement requires the object to be fully contained within the surface and not collide with any fixed obstacles (which are assumed to be non-existent for this initial attempt) or previously placed objects (also non-existent at the start).
           
           Given the rectangular shape of the surface and square object, I've determined valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) when the object is aligned with the axes (theta = 0 or pi/2). Half-extents are calculated (0.035 for both x and y). The valid range for x is [4.235, 4.765] and for y is [-0.565, -0.035].
           
           Because the object is small relative to the surface and the surface is rectangular, I can easily create multiple placements by generating a grid of (x, y) coordinates within the calculated bounds. For simplicity, and because the object is a square, I will start by using only a theta of 0. I will generate a grid of x and y coordinates, separated by a step size of 0.05.
           
           The x coordinates will range from 4.235 to 4.735, and the y coordinates will range from -0.565 to -0.065, each with a step of 0.05.
           
           After systematically iterating the x and y coordinates, I will select the first 50 placement combinations, with a theta of 0, resulting in 50 distinct positions to be generated. This will generate a set of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples. If any issues are found after placement, I will attempt a new set of placements based on feedback, if I receive any.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Generating Placement Options for Object ID 10**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new object, ID 10, and it's the first time I'm dealing with it. The previous feedback is irrelevant here, as there are no existing objects to avoid yet. The scene setup includes just one surface, `surf_idx = 0`, a simple axis-aligned bounding box defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           The object is almost a perfect square, with dimensions roughly 0.0815 by 0.0815. To ensure it fits snugly, I need to ensure it's completely contained within the surface. For an axis-aligned object (which I'll assume for simplicity, theta=0), this translates to some straightforward bounds calculations.
           
           Given the surface dimensions, I can derive the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y).  Half the object's dimensions are hx and hy, which are 0.04072881150000729 and 0.040728811500007065.
           
           The range for `x` is between `4.2 + hx` and `4.8 - hx`, which gives approximately 4.2407 to 4.7593.  For `y`, the range is between `-0.6 + hy` and `0.0 - hy`, or approximately -0.5593 to -0.0407.
           
           My strategy will be to create a grid of possible positions by varying `x` and `y` within those boundaries. I'll use `theta = 0` for all placements. For the grid, I'll start with x coordinates like 4.245 and increment by around 0.07, and start with the y coordinates as -0.555 and increment by 0.07 too. That will give 8 * 8 = 64.  I will take the first 50 possible locations.  `surf_idx` for all those is `0`.
