User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.777, 0.135), (-4.698, 0.214)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.738, 0.175, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.756, 0.654).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing the conjunction `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. Therefore, we need to place either `v12` or `v8` on `v18`. Since `v18` is a table, we can pick up either `v8` or `v12` and place it on `v18`.
           
           Let's choose `v8`. Currently, `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`. We need to pick up `v8` and then place it on `v18`.
           `v18` has a bounding box of `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. A suitable pose for `v8` on `v18` would be `#o2`. The `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` fact is present in the initial state, which means `#o2` is a valid pose on `v18`.
           
           The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`. `v4` has a kinematic chain defined for `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v6` does not have any kinematic chain defined for `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` in the given action instances, therefore we must use `v4`.
           Also, the initial state has `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. This implies that `v4` can pick `v8` from `v9` using grasp `#o1` and place it at `#o2` also using grasp `#o1`.
           The `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is available. This action does not change the base configuration, but it does consume the `canmove()` predicate. However, since the current base configuration `v3` is also the target base configuration, this action will not change the robot's position. This is a no-op move and its cost is 0. Thus, we don't need to consider moving the base.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           2. Place `v8` at `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           
           We need to provide a continuous value for `#o2` for `v8` on `v18`. `v8` has AABB `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))`. `v18` has AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. A valid placement for `v8` on `v18` would be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) because the `z` value 0.8 is above the `v18` surface. The object `v8` is small enough to fit within `v18` surface.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The available actions only contain `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, which is essentially a no-op movement. It does not allow for picking, placing, cleaning, or cooking any objects. The goal requires placing an object on `v18` to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`. Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, it is impossible to move any object to `v18` to satisfy the goal. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of valid actions.
