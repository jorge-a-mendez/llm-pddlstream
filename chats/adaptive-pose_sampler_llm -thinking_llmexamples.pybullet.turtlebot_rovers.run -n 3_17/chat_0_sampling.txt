(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Candidate Position Generation**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a tricky scenario: find three robot base positions near a target point, avoiding obstacles and ensuring line of sight. My immediate thought is to break this down. First, I need to understand the constraints: a max range of 2 from the target, global robot limits of [-2.5, 2.5] in both x and y, and a list of fixed obstacles.
           
           I start by mentally mapping the scene. It's essentially a 5x5 square. I visualize the obstacles. The outer walls are straightforward. Then there's a central pillar (x=0) that divides the space. Crucially, I notice that the actual working area of the robot is slightly smaller, roughly [-2.45, 2.45] due to the wall thicknesses, and I'll keep that in mind. The remaining obstacles seem to represent clutter or smaller blocks within the room. I consider the central pillar and the target point’s location (-0.955, -0.963) to be in the bottom-left of the scene.
           
           My strategy evolves from there. I’ll start by generating candidate positions within the allowed distance. Then, I filter these positions to meet the global and safe boundaries. Next, and this is key, I have to ensure the robot can "see" the target, which means avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles. For that, I check if the candidate point resides within the AABB of those. The other critical aspect is to consider the central pillar.
           
           Given the target’s location, I want the robot to also be to the left of the pillar to have a clear view to it and therefore, to avoid occlusion I'll limit the candidate positions to x < 0.
           
           Based on these considerations, I decide to place robot positions approximately at distance 1.5 away from the target to see it clearly without colliding with the obstacles. I’ll also consider points at distance 1.0 and 0.5 if necessary to meet line-of-sight and avoid the fixed obstacles, but keeping in mind the distances have to be <= 2. To have varied positions, I generate points at different angles from the target to the left, above and below.
           
           For the given target point (-0.955, -0.963), I will generate the candidate positions at 1.5, 1, and 0.5 away from the target and to the left, above, and below.
           
           After detailed calculations and checks, I settle on three final positions:
           *   (-0.955, 0.537) - Above
           *   (-0.955, -1.963) - Below
           *   (-1.455, -0.963) - Left
           
           I’ve verified that all three positions are within the global boundaries, avoid the fixed obstacles, maintain line of sight to the target and respect the maximum range of 2. Finally, a check for line-of-sight is performed by determining if a line segment between a robot position and the target intersects with any of the obstacles' AABB. A visual inspection ensures all positions and their view to the target are clear of the obstacles.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Feedback and Target Point**
           
           Okay, the user provided feedback, and it's clear I made a critical error in the previous attempt by misinterpreting the target point. The actual target, `(1.793, 1.994)`, is within obstacle 7 and obstacle 21. That changes *everything*. The previous positions were likely blocked by the central pillar. Now, I need to focus on positions that have a clear line of sight to a point that's essentially trapped within an obstacle. That suggests to me that the problem might not be solvable, at least not in a way that aligns with my understanding of line-of-sight. Usually, if the target is *inside* an obstacle, it's impossible to see it from the outside. However, the problem statement says "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail... you will always try to find a new position." So, there *must* be a solution.
           
           **Interpreting "Line of Sight" and Target Placement**
           
           I'm now hypothesizing that "line of sight" has a flexible meaning here. The target point might be on the surface of an object within the obstacle, or perhaps the target itself is not a point but an object of some dimension. I have to make a very crucial assumption: the target is visible. Since I know my robot must be within `max_range=2`, I'm looking at placing it right around the boundary of the obstacles 7 and 21.
           
           **Generating Potential Positions**
           
           Since the target is seemingly trapped inside obstacles, I'll propose three diverse positions that might offer "line of sight":
           
           1.  **Position 1:** I'll place the robot base immediately to the left of obstacle 21, approximately at `(1.655, 1.994)`.
           
           2.  **Position 2:** I will place it directly below obstacle 21, at `(1.793, 1.856)`.
           
           3.  **Position 3:** Finally, I'll place it at a diagonal, from the bottom-left of obstacle 7 (which contains 21), at `(1.550, 1.550)`.
           
           These positions try to achieve line of sight assuming the point "represents" a target surface on obstacle 21. These positions must be checked against `max_range`, and room constraints, and the most critical step is the line-of-sight check with the problem's criteria. I have a hunch this strategy has the highest probability of success because I am assuming a more realistic interpretation of line-of-sight in this scenario.

(Thoughts: **Refining My Approach for Line-of-Sight Determination**
           
           Okay, let's break down this situation. I've been getting some feedback, and it's clear I need to sharpen my strategy. Past failures have highlighted a fundamental point: placing the robot on the wrong side of the central pillar (Obstacle 5) guarantees a "no line of sight" error. I'm focusing on quadrant-specific positions relative to the target's location to correct this issue.
           
           Previous failures with the target at (1.793, 1.994) highlighted the importance of staying on the right side of the pillar. Subsequently, I've had to consider a *new* target point (-1.868, 1.938). The initial attempts for this target, when I used right side placements close to previous targets, understandably failed. It's like trying to see around the wrong corner—a collision or no line of sight results. I’ve recognized that the side of the central pillar where the robot is positioned, in relation to the target’s location, dictates a high chance of line-of-sight success.
           
           Now, my strategy has evolved:
           
           1.  **Quadrant Identification:** Determine which side of the pillar the target is on.
           2.  **Side-Specific Positioning:** Propose robot positions on the *same* side of the pillar as the target.
           3.  **Range Adherence:** Ensure positions are within a maximum range of 2 units from the target to avoid being too far.
           4.  **Boundary Conformity:** Validate positions within the room's boundaries.
           5.  **Collision Avoidance:** Meticulously check for collisions with fixed obstacles both visually and through coordinate analysis.
           6.  **Diversity of Positions**: Attempt to provide a diversity of viewpoints relative to the target and obstacles, for maximum view.
           
           For the current target, (-1.868, 1.938), it's in the top-left quadrant. Looking at all the fixed obstacles, I see this target is actually *inside* Obstacle 19 `((-1.9087, 1.898), (-1.828, 1.979))`. which itself is inside obstacle 8. So, I need to place the robot nearby.
           
           Here are the positions I'm proposing, all on the left side of the pillar, within range, and collision-checked:
           
           1.  **Position 1:** (-2.009, 1.938) – Slightly to the left of Obstacle 19.
           2.  **Position 2:** (-1.868, 1.798) – Slightly below Obstacle 19.
           3.  **Position 3:** (-2.350, 1.650) – Further out, from the bottom-left corner of Obstacle 8.
           
           All proposed positions are correctly placed to have a clear view on the left-side target, and are within the required maximum range. The third position provides a viewing diversity and angle.
           
           I'm now confident in these positions. They are strategically positioned to achieve line of sight, given that the target is *within* an obstacle.
