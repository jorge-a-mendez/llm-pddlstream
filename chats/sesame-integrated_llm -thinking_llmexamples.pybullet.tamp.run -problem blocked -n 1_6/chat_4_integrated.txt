           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.477, 0.481, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.857, 0.515).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.315, -0.167), (4.685, 0.778)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.525, 0.434), (-4.43, 0.529)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to getting `v12` *on* `v18`. Initially, `v12` is at `v13`, and we know `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`.  This means `v12` *should* already be supported, we just need to satisfy `atpose(v12, #p1)` to move `v12` to `p1`. So, it seems we'll need to move `v12` to the correct place. Since we currently have `pose(v12, #p1)`, we have the solution.  `#p1` is the pose we need!
           
           Now, the plan is pretty straightforward. I'll use the robot arm, `v4`, to pick `v12` from its current location (`v13`) and then place it at `#p1`, which we know satisfies the supported criteria and places it on `v18`.
           
           **Breaking Down the Plan:**
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll need to move the robot's base to allow the arm to reach the objects. We need to move the base from `v3` to a configuration `q2` and then to `q3`.
           2.  **Pick:** Then I'll use the `pick` action to grasp `v12` (using gripper `#g1`) from its current pose `v13` with the robot arm `v4`. The pick should also take the object into grasp from the current base, we know there is kin that will handle such action.
           3.  **Move Base:** Move base from `q2` to `q3`.
           4.  **Place:** After picking, the `place` action puts `v12` at the target pose `#p1` using the arm and the gripper, also using the kin, because all of them were found in the initial state of the problem.
           
           **Ensuring Success (Preconditions):**
           
           Each of these steps has preconditions that must be met.  For the `pick` action, the arm has to be *able* to pick, which is defined in the initial facts of the problem by `kin(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t5)` facts. The same goes for the `place` action. These will get filled to ensure collision free grasps and trajectories that will be found and validated by a planner.
           Similarly, base motion also needs to be available in the initial state of the problem. So we assume it will be.
           
           **The Continuous Value for #p1:**
           
           We need to provide continuous values for `#p1` that satisfy the requirements (collision-free, stable placement on `v18`).
           We know that `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`.
           `v18`'s AABB is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), and `v12`'s current location is `(-4.477, 0.481, 0.801)`.
           Since `v12`'s size is much smaller than `v18` (approx. 0.095 x 0.095 compared to 0.6 x 0.6), a good, valid, and collision-free placement is to center the object on the surface.
           So the center of `v18` is `(4.5, -0.3)`.
           The `z` value for `#p1` will be the top surface of the table where `v18` is placed, which is the table. Assuming the surfaces is at height `0.8` (because the objects have similar positions around the value).
           
           Therefore the solution is `#p1 = (4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`.
           
           So the actions are:
           1.  `(move_base v3 #q2 #t6)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t5)`
           3.  `(move_base #q2 #q3 #o0)`
           4.  `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t7)` with `#p1` equal to the continuous value `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`.
           
)

           2.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t5)`

           4.  `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t7)` with `#p1` equal to the continuous value `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`.
