           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which I've expanded to mean placing an object of a specific type (let's call it "?green") onto a designated surface.  The key is to determine which object qualifies as "?green" and then map out the steps to put it in place.
           
           First, I identified the potential "?green" objects: `v8` and `v12`. Both have the required `type` property and are stated as being "stackable" on the surface, which is `v18`.  Since `v8` appears to be closer to `v18` in the initial configuration, I'm going to start with that as my focus for now.
           
           The plan essentially boils down to:  *pick* `v8` and *place* it on `v18`.  Simple enough, but I need to ensure all the preconditions are met and create valid pose values.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I'll need to position the robot's base (v3) at a suitable configuration (#o3) to execute the pick and place actions. This is done with the `move_base` action: `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. The exact cost depends on the distance between the initial base position (v3) and the target base configuration (#o3) but since the initial and target base position is not given, I am assuming the path is optimal.
           2.  **Pick:** Then I'll use the `pick` action `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to grasp `v8` which is currently in pose `v9`. This requires arm `v4`,  and some grasp and arm configurations. The critical preconditions are ensuring the arm has access and `handempty(v4)` and that no collision will occur during grasp, approach, or arm trajectory. These conditions need to be checked in an external geometry.
           3.  **Place:** Finally, I'll execute the `place` action: `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)` to put `v8` onto the target surface `v18`. The most important thing here is calculating a collision-free and stable pose `#o2` for `v8` on `v18`. I need to make sure that the action is kinematically feasible and collision-free.
           
           I've carefully considered the geometry.  I've reasoned that based on the AABB properties of `v18` and `v8`, `v8`'s pose can be determined, I need to place `v8` at x=4.4, y=-0.4, with a height of 0.85, that is represented as the pose vector (#o2).
           
           The entire plan is geared toward guaranteeing that both `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true in the final state, thus satisfying the goal. The cost is the distance traveled by the base (#o3) along with the cost of pick/place (which I'm assuming is the same).
