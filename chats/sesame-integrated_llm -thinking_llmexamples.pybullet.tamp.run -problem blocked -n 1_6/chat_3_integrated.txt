           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.477, 0.481, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.857, 0.515).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.315, -0.167), (4.685, 0.778)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.525, 0.434), (-4.43, 0.529)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear objective: to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which translates to ensuring the object `v12` is "on" the surface `v18` and that `v12` has the type `v17`. The initial state gives us `type(v12, v17)`, so I just need to get `v12` on `v18`.
           
           First, I need to expand the concept of "on".  "On" really means "supported", and it involves two conditions: `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. We already know from the initial state that `v12` is supported at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`. So I need to move `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)`.  My plan boils down to these steps:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Get `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           2.  **Place:** Move `v12` to the desired pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           The robot has the actions `pick` and `place`, which are compatible with what I need to do.  However, before picking, I need to make sure the robot's base configuration is correct.  The `pick` action requires the base configuration to be `#o3`.  I know the current base configuration is `v3`, so I need to move the base.
           
           Therefore, the plan becomes:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`  (Move base from current config to one that allows picking).
           2.  **Pick:** `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` (Pick up the object).
           3.  **Place:** `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4` (Place the object at the target pose).
           
           The final crucial part is defining the continuous values, especially the target pose `#o2` for placing the object.  I've analyzed the AABB of the surface `v18`, which gives me a range for the X and Y coordinates. I'm choosing the center of this range for the X and Y.  The surface's z value I got by checking v13, as this surface looks like it’s at the same level.
           The final pose is:
           
           `#o2 v12 v18: 4.5 -0.3 0.801 0.0`.
           
           This plan guarantees that I successfully place the object `v12` onto surface `v18` with the correct type. So, the goal will be achieved.
