           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.216, -0.249, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.513, 0.858).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.241, 0.276, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.472, 0.882).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.195, -0.42, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.998, 0.067).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.263, -0.296), (-0.168, -0.202)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14) currently on a surface (v11) and the goal is to move all of them to another surface (v16). The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, but only v4 is relevant to the provided action instances. The robot is currently at base configuration v3 and arm configuration v5 for arm v4, and arm configuration v7 for arm v6. All objects are graspable and stackable on v10 and v16. The initial poses of v8, v12, and v14 are v9, v13, and v15, respectively, all supported by v11. The continuous parameters #o0, #o1, #o2, #o3, and #o4 represent a base trajectory, a grasp, a new pose for the objects on v16, a base configuration, and an arm trajectory, respectively. The plan involves picking each object from its initial pose and placing it onto the target surface (v16) at the new pose (#o2). Since multiple objects (v8, v12, v14) will be placed at #o2, a unique pose for each object must be provided. The robot will move its base and arm to perform the pick and place actions. Since the base configuration #o3 is tied to the kinematics for all pick/place actions and is then used in a base motion that just returns to v3, it implies that the robot may need to move its base to reach the objects, but this motion is trivial in cost in this problem setup. The only relevant base motion actions provided are for trivial movement, returning the base to its current location. Therefore, we assume the initial base configuration v3 is sufficient for all pick and place operations, and use #o3 as a dummy for v3. The cost for pick and place actions is 1. The base motion has 0 cost since the start and end configurations are the same. We will place the objects in the order v8, v12, v14.

           To ensure stability, the AABB of the object must be contained within the AABB of the surface. For surface v16, the AABB is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). The object v8 has an AABB of ((-0.263, -0.296), (-0.168, -0.202)), v12 has AABB ((0.156, -0.46), (0.234, -0.381)), and v14 has AABB ((-0.289, 0.227), (-0.192, 0.324)). All these are larger than the surface, so the provided AABBs for the objects might be incorrect or represent the overall geometry rather than the supportable base. Assuming the issue is with the previous calculated center points and the objects' AABBs are for collision checking only, and that the base of the objects are of similar size and thus, can be placed inside of v16, I will recalculate the poses to be within the bounds of v16's AABB for a common object size (e.g., v16 itself). Let's assume the objects are smaller in their supportable area. I will place the objects in the center area of v16, ensuring they are separated.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The initial state has `atbconf(v3)`, but the plan tries to use `atbconf(v35)`. This is a clear precondition violation. The available actions only include `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)` or `basemotion(#o3, #o0, v3)` and `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`. Since `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, any motion must start from `v3` or from the base configuration designated by `#o3`. Furthermore, the `kin` facts link the pick/place actions to `#o3` for the base configuration. This implies that the robot's base will move to `#o3` or is already at `#o3` to perform the action. However, the initial state explicitly gives `atbconf(v3)`. Let's assume `#o3` is equivalent to `v3` for simplicity and for satisfying the `atbconf` precondition, or that the `move_base` action would effectively put the robot in a valid base configuration. The given `basemotion` actions mostly involve self-loops or movement between `v3` and `#o3` with `v3` as the start or end.
           
           Since the initial state has `atbconf(v3)` and the `kin` facts require a base configuration, which for the given pick/place actions is `#o3`, we need to ensure that `atbconf(#o3)` is true before `pick` or `place` can be executed. From the provided `basemotion` actions, we have `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`. We also have `atbconf(v3)` initially. So, we must first execute a `move_base` action to change the base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`. After the pick/place, we might move back, but it's not strictly necessary for the goal since the goal does not specify the base configuration.
