           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown for Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: achieving `new-axiom@0()`. This, as I understand, translates to a specific set of conditions I need to ensure are met in the final state. It boils down to ensuring several things: both rovers (v12 and v14) are in the same configurations they started in, their stores (v16) are empty, and a few specific image transmissions and analyses are successful. These initial conditions are already met for the first two conditions.
           
           To achieve this, I've broken down the subgoals into two main tasks: 1) Sending images of various objectives and 2) analyzing specific rock and soil samples. I'll need to figure out the right sequence of actions and the order I must achieve them.
           
           **Image Transmission Strategy**
           
           For image transmission, I'll need to take the images. My available information suggests that I can use the two rovers to accomplish this task. For this, I'll use `take_image` and `send_image`. I've got to take four different images: v17, v18, v19, and v20 and mode v11 is needed for each one, so the `send_image` should be successful. To set up the imaging, I must calibrate the camera: for each image, I must invoke `calibrate`. These must also be successful, as there are no existing blockers in my initial state. The plan for images is:
           1.  **V12 will**: `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10) -> take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v17, v10, v11) -> send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           2.  **V12 will**: `calibrate(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10) -> take_image(v12, v13, #o4, v18, v10, v11) -> send_image(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           3.  **V14 will**: `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v19, v10) -> take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v19, v10, v11) -> send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           4.  **V14 will**: `calibrate(v14, v15, #o4, v20, v10) -> take_image(v14, v15, #o4, v20, v10, v11) -> send_image(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v20, v11)`
           
           I'll note that the `calibrate` action is a necessary setup. For each picture, I must calibrate again as the `take_image` will invalidate that. Both rovers have the camera available. As such, both are available for the necessary `calibrate` function.
           
           **Analysis of Rock and Soil**
           
           Next up is rock and soil analysis: I need to analyze a rock of type `v2` and a soil of type `v6`. I'll use both rovers again in order to fulfill this. I'll invoke the `sample_rock` action on the appropriate elements, and then invoke `send_analysis`. To facilitate a state where their stores are free, I will follow those up with a `drop_rock` action. In this way, I can ensure both conditions `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` remain valid. For this, the plan will be:
           
           5.  **V12 will**: `sample_rock(v12, v13, v3, v16) -> send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v3) -> drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           6.  **V14 will**: `sample_rock(v14, v15, v7, v16) -> send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v7) -> drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           
)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10), (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 v13 v3 v16), (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v3), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v19 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v19 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v19 v11), (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v20 v10), (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v20 v10 v11), (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v20 v11), (sample_rock v14 v15 v7 v16), (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the issue. The user is right to flag the invalid actions I used. Looking at the permitted actions –  `((move ...), (drop_rock ...))` – I immediately recognize the problem. This set is incredibly restrictive.  My goal, `new-axiom@0()`, has several required predicates, but none of them are achievable with the given action set.
           
           The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are immediately out of reach.  They necessitate `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, which are simply not provided.  Even if I were to somehow manipulate the initial state, the only useful action would be `drop_rock`. But, `drop_rock` relies on having sampled a rock and a full store. I have no way to fill the store initially because I only have the `move` and `drop_rock` actions available.  There's no path to get from the initial state to the goal state.  Therefore, with this action set, the goal is unequivocally unreachable. I'll need to explicitly state this conclusion.
