           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning the Robot's Task: Placing Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get this robot job done. The goal is clear: I need to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current surface (v11) onto another surface (v20). The robot has two arms (v4 and v6), but they're both empty right now, which is perfect. The robot's base is currently at v3.
           
           My approach will be to break this down into smaller steps. First, I have to figure out how to move just one object. Then I can repeat the steps for all objects.
           
           Let's start with getting object v8 to surface v20. It's pretty straightforward: I'll need to use the robot arm v4. I'll pick v8 up from its current location on v11 and put it down on v20. So, I need to choose the actions to make that happen.
           
           The system will give me two actions to choose from: `pick` and `place`. The system also requires a base configuration, which I'll call #o3. I'll need to give it a value to move the base around, and I'll use the current base v3 as the beginning base. I also need to make sure that the robot is at a pose that is suitable to manipulate all these objects - the pick and place actions use arm v4. The system is also going to give me a trajectory, called #o4.
           
           The actions and predicates I see confirm that the robot base can move to a base configuration specified by #o3 - in particular the `kin` predicates. To start out, the robot base is at v3.
           
           So, the plan for one object like v8 is to:
           1. Move the robot base to the working base config #o3 - likely (0,0,0) as this seems to be a good configuration to pick up and place objects on surfaces. I will use the `move_base` function.
           2. Pick up v8.
           3. Place v8 on v20.
           
           I need to provide continuous values for a few key things:
           *   #o0: The trajectory for moving the robot base.
           *   #o1: The grasp configuration.
           *   #o2: The final position of the object on v20 (its pose), which is the most critical for completing the plan successfully.
           *   #o3: The base configuration for picking and placing (likely near the workspace).
           *   #o4: The trajectory for the arm's motion.
           
           The initial poses of the objects are v9, v13, v15, v17, and v19. So, for the final placement step, I have to pick unique positions for each object's pose on the surface v20. The key is to find positions that are not going to collide with each other and are on the surface.
           
           The surface v20 has a bounding box of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I can place the objects around the center.
           The objects are (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18).
           The object bounding boxes need to fit within the surface v20's boundaries.
           I choose positions with a z of 0.781 (same as the initial poses), and a theta of 0 degrees, just to keep things simple.
           
           Therefore, for each object, I will choose distinct x and y coordinates on the surface v20. The selected positions are:
           * For v8: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
           * For v12: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)
           * For v14: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
           * For v16: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)
           * For v18: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0)
           
           Thus, the final plan is as follows:
           1. Move the robot's base from v3 to base configuration #o3 (0, 0, 0).
           2. Pick up object v8 from its initial location v9 and place it at the chosen position on v20.
           3. Pick up object v12 from its initial location v13 and place it

           I need to provide continuous values for a few key things:
           *   #o0: The trajectory for moving the robot base.

           *   #o2: The final position of the object on v20 (its pose), which is the most critical for completing the plan successfully.
           *   #o3: The base configuration for picking and placing (likely near the workspace).
           *   #o4: The trajectory for the arm's motion.
           
           The initial poses of the objects are v9, v13, v15, v17, and v19. So, for the final placement step, I have to pick unique positions for each object's pose on the surface v20. The key is to find positions that are not going to collide with each other and are on the surface.
           
           The surface v20 has a bounding box of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I can place the objects around the center.
           The objects are (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18).
           The object bounding boxes need to fit within the surface v20's boundaries.
           I choose positions with a z of 0.781 (same as the initial poses), and a theta of 0 degrees, just to keep things simple.
           
           Therefore, for each object, I will choose distinct x and y coordinates on the surface v20. The selected positions are:
           * For v8: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0)

           * For v14: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0)

           * For v18: (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0)
           
           Thus, the final plan is as follows:

           2. Pick up object v8 from its initial location v9 and place it at the chosen position on v20.
           3. Pick up object v12 from its initial location v13 and place it
