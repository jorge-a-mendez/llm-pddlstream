(Thoughts: **A Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `pr2-tamp` domain.  Essentially, I need to get an object of a certain type (`v17`, which is `v12`) onto another object (`v18`).  Right now, I've got `v12` supported by `v14` and its type is already confirmed, which is great.  I also know `v12` can be *placed* on `v18`.
           
           The solution jumps out at me:  I need to move `v12` from where it is on `v14` to where it should be, on `v18`. I see I have the robot with its two arms (`v4` and `v6`), and the controllable arm is `v4`.  The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`, but the latter two aren't relevant here.  So, `pick` and `place` are my tools.
           
           Here's the plan I've come up with:
           
           1.  **Move the base**: First, I see the robot's base is at `v3`, but the `kin` conditions for `pick` and `place` seem to need it at a different position (`#o3`). So, I need a `move_base` action to get the robot into position.  It's clear that the pick motion requires a particular base config.
           2.  **Pick up `v12`**:  I need to use the `pick` action with arm `v4`, object `v12`, and the current pose `v13`. I'll need some grasp and trajectory parameters like `#o1`, `#o3`, and `#o4`. I'm assuming the "unsafe" conditions (approach and trajectory) are false for now.  If they aren't, the plan won't be valid, but I can check that later.
           3.  **Place `v12` on `v18`**:  Now that I've picked it, I'll `place` `v12` onto `v18` using the pose I know it needs (`#o2`). I will use the grasp again (`#o1`), and trajectories (`#o3`, `#o4`). Again, I'm assuming those same "unsafe" conditions are satisfied.
           
           After these actions, I believe `v12` will be `atpose(#o2)`, which combined with the `supported` property from the initial state, will satisfy the `on(v12, v18)` condition. Since I already know the type of `v12` is correct, the `new-axiom@0()` goal will be achieved! I can verify this plan by simulating it and checking all the intermediate states, but this strategy seems sound. I've double checked all objects, parameters, and action availabilities. It looks good!
