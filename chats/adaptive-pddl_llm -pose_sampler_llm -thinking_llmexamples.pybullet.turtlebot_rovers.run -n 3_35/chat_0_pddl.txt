           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: Analysis of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal. Breaking it down, this axiom requires achieving several subgoals: obtaining images of objects (`receivedimage`), analyzing soil and stone samples (`receivedanalysis`), and knowing their types (`type`).
           
           I began by examining the initial state for the conditions within `new-axiom@0()`. Some conditions, like being at a specific configuration and having free space, are already true. However, the crucial parts related to image and analysis reception are not.
           
           To satisfy the `receivedimage` goals, I need to use the `send_image` action. This action's precondition includes having an image (`haveimage`), being at a specific configuration (`atconf`), and the object being comvisible. To obtain `haveimage`, I would employ the `take_image` action. This requires the robot to be in a position where it can see the object using the camera (`imagevisible`), be onboard a camera that is supporting the mode, and that the camera is calibrated.
           The cameras are supported.  However, cameras are not calibrated in the initial state. Therefore, a calibration step is necessary. This step relies on the `imagevisible` facts.
           
           Two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and a camera `v10`, are involved. The cameras are on board. The `imagevisible` facts indicate that the cameras can see the required objects, but they are from configurations #o3 and #o0. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` in the initial state tell me that the rovers are located at poses v13 and v15, respectively, not #o3 or #o0.
           
           However, the action instances provided for "move" are simple no-ops. These *move* actions *do not* change configurations. The rovers are not capable of physically *moving* from their initial positions to the ones where `imagevisible` and `comvisible` hold.
           Similarly, to achieve `receivedanalysis`, I would employ `send_analysis`. To fulfill that I need to sample the rocks, so I consider `sample_rock`.
           The sampling of rocks depends on `atconf`, and the rover cannot move to the poses required for sampling.
           
           Crucially, the only allowed actions are two simple "move" actions which *do not* move the robots, and two *drop_rock* actions. The drop action requires that the stores are full. The stores are, however, free in the initial state.  The allowed actions are incapable of altering the initial state to meet the goal's requirements.
           
           In summary, given the restricted set of actions, including two pointless move actions, the goal of satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It relies on `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` both of which are not achievable due to the lack of movement and other capabilities in the available action instances.
