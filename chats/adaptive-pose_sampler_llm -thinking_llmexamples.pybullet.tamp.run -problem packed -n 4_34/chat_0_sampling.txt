(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placements for a square object within a defined rectangular surface. The surface is a simple AABB with dimensions of 0.27m x 0.27m. The object is a square of size s = 0.08465m, centered at (x, y) coordinates with a variable rotation. Since the object is square, its bounding box size is independent of the rotation. However, to account for rotations, I first calculate the diagonal of the square, which equals s * sqrt(2), which is approximately 0.1197m. This sets the stage to determine the valid placement area.
           
           The main challenge is ensuring each placement is stable (i.e., fully contained within the surface) and varied.  Given the surface's dimensions, I have calculated the maximum diagonal extent to be approximately 0.1197m, which is significantly smaller than the surface dimensions, meaning a variety of placements will be possible. For simplicity, I choose rotations of 0 and 45 degrees to find a wide and diverse range of placements.
           
           To place, for an axis-aligned rotation (0 degrees), the object's center coordinates must be contained within the AABB. I calculate the permissible range for both x and y.  I've found that the object's center can be located within the bounds of approximately -0.0927m to 0.0927m in both x and y directions. Similarly, for the rotated object, I've calculated the range bounds to be between approximately -0.0751m to 0.0751m for the x and y coordinates.
           
           I then discretized each permitted range into 5 intervals. To fulfill the placement count of 50, I've decided to create 25 unique placements for the object oriented at 0 degrees, and 25 at 45 degrees. I calculate the step size and x/y coordinates for both rotations by calculating appropriate ranges. This method will ensure 50 distinct placements are generated, all guaranteed to be stable and contained within the rectangular surface.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Analysis and Generation**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a successful placement for an object with ID 5. It's essentially a square, sitting snugly in a corner of a surface. Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is defined by its center and extents, but more importantly for me, it occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           Now, I need to place a new, also essentially square, object with ID 7, also on this same surface, in a *stable* way, but this time, avoiding any collisions with object 5. My goal is to find 50 such stable placements.
           
           The surface's dimensions and the extents of both objects are known. Because both shapes are square, calculating their occupied spaces simplifies the process of assessing collisions.
           
           I've determined that the valid center range of object 7’s placement relative to the origin of this surface, considering stability, and collision avoidance, especially at the known coordinates where object 5 sits. Essentially, I'm identifying the "free" space available for placing object 7.  The calculations confirmed that I could start by examining the placements at two possible angles - `0` and `pi/4` radians.
           
           I've established that there's a specific forbidden region for object 7's center: a small bottom-left quadrant. Any placement of object 7 within this collision region will overlap with object 5.
           
           To generate the non-colliding placements, I decided to sample a 7x7 grid for each orientation `0` and `pi/4`. This gave me a good spatial distribution, and I could then systematically check each potential center location, at the different possible orientations, to check for overlap. 
           
           For the zero rotation placements, I calculated a good range for placements, after excluding the area of collision, then sampled my 7x7 grid to choose non-colliding positions. And the placements at rotation of pi/4 were processed the same way. The first 40 (7x7) were calculated for the zero rotation, then the first 10 for the rotation of pi/4.
           
           This process ensures I identify 50 stable and collision-free locations for the new object. I will provide a list containing the required number of placements, consisting of the surface number, rotation angle, x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the object's center.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Calculations for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking and the calculations I've gone through to find a good spot for Object ID 4. I've been given successful placements for objects 5 and 7, so I need to avoid collisions with those and stay within the bounds of Surface 0, which is a square area.
           
           First, I established the surface and object boundaries. I know the surface limits are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for objects 5 and 7 based on their size and current placements. This will tell me where they *are* occupying space. I have also calculated the AABB for object 4. I also took the time to calculate `theta=pi/4`.
           
           My strategy is to first determine the valid placement ranges for Object 4 at both `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` and then systematically check for collisions. I'll need to check the placements to see if the bounding box for object 4 collides with either of the two existing objects.
           
           I know that the collision condition is `(obj4_min_x < obj_i_max_x && obj4_max_x > obj_i_min_x && obj4_min_y < obj_i_max_y && obj4_max_y > obj_i_min_y)`.
           I'm using this condition to determine if any of the three bounding boxes overlap.
           
           I needed to calculate these ranges.
           -	For `theta=0`, I know my `X_RANGE_0` and `Y_RANGE_0`
           -	Then, for `theta=pi/4`, I needed to calculate `X_RANGE_DIAG` and `Y_RANGE_DIAG`
           
           To make sure I hit the needed diversity, I set up a grid of potential locations, 7 steps in both the x and y directions for both `theta` orientations. This leads to a total number of 50. I know from doing other placement tasks that this grid will be a good starting place, and that there will be sufficient space to have enough options.
           
           I've carefully calculated the AABB of object 4 for each grid point and angle. I then checked for collisions. I started from the upper-right corner and worked down and left to fill the space efficiently. I took the time to make sure that each potential placement didn't result in a collision, and only kept those that were collision-free.
           
           After the first iteration, there were 31 potential placements. To obtain the full number of 50 required placement points, I started the placement process with `theta=pi/4` and repeated the calculations and the AABB comparisons to add to the list. I repeated the checks for collision.
           
           After running these checks, the final number of placements comes to 50, and I will be listing them.

           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 5, 7, or 4. I've got the dimensions for Object 6: it's roughly square at 0.095 x 0.095. Surface 0 is a 0.27 x 0.27 square, centered at the origin.
           
           I've already calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects. Object 5 is in the bottom-left, Object 7 is in the middle-bottom, and Object 4 is in the top-right. I'll need to use these AABBs for fast collision checking. Collision occurs when any part of Object 6's AABB overlaps with the AABB of an existing object.
           
           To make things efficient, I'm going to create a grid of potential placements for Object 6, both at 0 degrees and at 45 degrees rotation. For each candidate placement, I'll calculate Object 6's AABB and compare it against the AABBs of the other objects. I'll prioritize filling the empty spaces, like high up and to the right, or any remaining uncollided regions. I'll also try to maximize the available area by considering placing the objects closer together. I also need to make sure to prioritize checking in a top-down and left to right order for my candidate grid to ensure better placement coverage. I need to make sure I get 50 without collision, so I'll try generating more and pick from the valid placements.
