(Thoughts: **Summary of my Approach to Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to determine 50 stable positions for a nearly-square object (ID 7, dimensions roughly 0.0772 x 0.0772) on a square surface (ID 0) centered at (0,0) and extending from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. A stable placement requires the object to be entirely within the surface's boundaries, considering all possible rotations.
           
           Given the object is close to square, I'll approximate both `obj_w` and `obj_h` as a single `obj_s = 0.0772`.
           
           To ensure stability, I've used the following strategy:
           
           *   **Understanding AABB Constraints**: The object will be stable, I need the rotated AABB to be fully contained by the surface. The max bounding box will be a square whose side is sqrt(2) times half-extent.
           
           *   **Angle Sampling**: I selected angles to ensure the object can be rotated around. This provides diversity in positions and orientations.
           
           *   **Grid Placement within Max Extent**: For a selected set of angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2), I computed the center region. Then, I sampled a grid of positions within these limits (3 x 3).
           *   **Central placements**: For 5 extra angles (pi * 0.6, pi * 0.7, pi * 0.8, pi * 0.9, pi), I placed the object at the center, (0, 0).
           *   **Coverage**: This approach enables coverage of all positions and orientations and ensures that all selected placements are stable within the surface boundaries.
           
           I've used calculations for AABB and half-extents. It accounts for all possible rotations and constraints and should result in 50 guaranteed stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Placement for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a new request to place object ID 4 on Surface 0.  I need to remember the successful placement of object 7, specifically its position `(0, 0.0, -0.06746873008224476, -0.06746873008224476)`, because object 4 cannot collide with it. The surface is a square of size 0.27 centered at (0,0). Object 4 is almost square with dimensions 0.0979 x 0.0979, and its half-extents will be approximately 0.04895.
           
           My primary concern is preventing collisions. I know object 7 has an AABB that roughly occupies the bottom-left of the surface. To avoid overlap, I’ll generate placement options that stay clear of that region. I'll need to account for rotation (theta) when calculating AABBs.
           
           Here's the plan: I'll use a grid-based approach. I will consider 5 different rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2). Then, for each rotation, I'll generate a grid of potential (x, y) placements, carefully ensuring those placements don't result in object 4's AABB intersecting with object 7's AABB.  I'll generate a comprehensive set of potential placements, filter out collisions, and select the first 50 non-colliding options.  The objective is to prioritize placements in the top-right, top-left, and bottom-right sections of the surface, but I can adapt as needed to ensure enough options are available. The x range is `[-0.08605, 0.08605]` and the y range is `[-0.08605, 0.08605]` at theta=0.

(Thoughts: **The Placement Problem: Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable and collision-free locations for a new object (ID 5) on a defined surface (Surface 0). This surface is a 2D area with limits of `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with two existing objects already placed on the surface.
           
           Object 7 (ID 7), is placed at approximately `(-0.067, -0.067)` with a size of `0.077` and object 4 is at `(-0.086, 0.086)` with a size of `0.098` These have known AABBs defined at theta = 0. My object (object 5) has a size of `0.094` and can be rotated. Both existing objects significantly cover the bottom-left of the surface and top-left of the surface.
           
           To solve this, I will:
           
           1.  **Define a Range of Rotations:** I will test object 5 at 16 angles (0 to 2pi).
           2.  **Calculate Rotated Extents:** Given an angle, I will compute the rotated extents (width and height) of object 5, accounting for its square-like shape.
           3.  **Determine Valid Placement Zones:** Based on the rotation and surface limits, I will identify the valid placement area for object 5.
           4.  **Generate Candidate Placements:** For each rotation, I'll create a grid of potential `(x, y)` locations within the valid area, and then perform a set of central placements. This should give enough candidate placements, hopefully around 400.
           5.  **Collision Checks:** I'll calculate the AABB of object 5 at each candidate location and rotation. If it doesn't collide with the AABBs of objects 4 and 7, the placement is added to the valid list.
           6.  **Iterate and Guarantee a Minimum:** These calculations continue until I locate 50 unique valid placements.
           
           The chosen algorithm allows testing for a large set of `theta`, `x`, and `y` values, ensuring that the generated placements are stable, not overlapping existing objects. The final output is 50 distinct object 5 placement configurations, suitable for further analysis or rendering.

(Thoughts: **Initial Task: Find 50 Stable Placements for a New Object (ID 6)**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 6) on surface 0, while ensuring it doesn't collide with previously placed objects (ID 7, ID 4, ID 5). I've analyzed the scene, which is a square surface of side 0.27 centered at (0,0), and identified the position and size of the obstacles.
           
           **Strategy**
           
           1.  **Define Placement Region:** I need to find a suitable region for Object 6 to be positioned.
           2.  **Define Surface Region.** The area `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)` is where all objects must be placed.
           3.  **Rotation and AABBs:** For each placement, I will rotate Object 6 by an angle (0-pi), for a series of defined increments. The rotations will be around the Z axis. Then I compute a rotated AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for the object. The smallest the AABB is at rotation `0`, the largest at `pi/4` and the same AABB size again at `pi/2`.
           4.  **Collision Check:** I will create 5x5 grid points within the surface region that may be suitable. I will create these placements and then for each one perform a collision check with the other objects. The other objects are those with ID 7, 4 and 5.
           
           **Collision Check Process**
           
           *   For each candidate placement, I'll calculate the Object 6 AABB.
           *   The placement will be recorded only if no collision with obstacles happens. The grid size of `5x5` will provide sufficient candidates to meet my goal.
           
           **Obstacles and Boundaries**
           
           I have carefully defined the precise boundaries of each existing object's AABB using the provided information. This ensures a robust collision check.
           
           **Expected Outcomes**
           
           I expect this approach to efficiently generate at least 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating Placements for Object 6**
           
           The user has requested 50 new stable placements for Object 6, and I need to ensure these placements avoid collisions with: (a) other fixed obstacles in the scene; and (b) the other placements of Object 6 from the previous request (now fixed). I'm approaching this by first defining the scene's surface and gathering the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) of the other fixed objects. This includes Object 7, Object 4, Object 5 and the 30 placements of Object 6 from the previous request, all with their known AABBs, and all of these now constitute a set of "fixed obstacles".
           
           Since the object to be placed (Object 6) is identical in size to the previous set, its bounding box size is readily calculated as half-width, and half-height as `obj_hw = 0.049026068` and `obj_hh = 0.049026068`. I will use 16 evenly spaced angles from 0 to 2π, and 11x11 grid search (or even a finer one) for each angle, creating candidates at each location of the grid. The maximum center offsets for rotation are calculated.
           
           I then run a collision detection step. For each candidate placement, I check for overlap with existing obstacles using my efficient AABB overlap check. If no collision is detected, I store the candidate as a valid placement. The grid will be sufficiently dense that there should be 50 non-colliding placements even given all the obstacles.
