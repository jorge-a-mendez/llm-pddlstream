           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, `v12`, `v8`, and `v15`, which are graspable and stackable. `v12` is at `v13` supported by `v14`. `v8` is at `v9` supported by `v11`. `v15` is at `v16` supported by `v11`. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm `v4` is at arm configuration `v5` and arm `v6` is at arm configuration `v7`. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)`, so `v12` could be `?green`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, which implies that if `v12` is at pose `#o2`, it would be on `v18`. Therefore, the goal is to get `v12` onto `v18`. However, there are no pick or place actions available in the provided action instances. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which just moves the robot base from `v3` to `v3`. This action does not change the state of `v12` or achieve the goal. Thus, the goal is unreachable with the given actions.
