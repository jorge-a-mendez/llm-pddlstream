           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom arm(v6)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v8)

           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The current scene describes two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are handempty. There are three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is at pose `v9` and is supported by `v11`. `v12` is at pose `v13` and is supported by `v14`. `v15` is at pose `v16` and is supported by `v11`. All three objects can be stacked on `v10` and `v18`. Object `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. The robot is currently at base configuration `v3` and can move.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, translates to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have objects `v8` and `v12` that are of type `v17`. If either `v8` or `v12` is moved onto `v18`, the goal will be satisfied.
           
           However, the only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot from base configuration `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of any objects, specifically their location. Since the robot cannot pick up or place any objects with the provided actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
