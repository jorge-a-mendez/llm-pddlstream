(Thoughts: **Understanding and Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object on a given surface. The object, with dimensions `size_x` and `size_y` being effectively the same (making it a square), has an ID of 5. The surface is a square centered at (0,0). A placement is considered stable if: 1) the object is fully contained within the surface, 2) it doesn't collide with other objects (none present), and 3) it doesn't collide with any fixed obstacles (none present).
           
           Since the dimensions are for the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of the *rotated* object, I have to account for rotation.  I'm assuming `size_x` and `size_y` represent the dimensions *before* rotation.  For a square, a rotation changes the AABB size; if `theta` is 0, the AABB remains the same, but for other angles, the AABB becomes larger. Specifically, the side length of the rotated AABB will be  `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` where *s* is the side length of the square.  The surface is a square with side length 0.27, so its `x` and `y` bounds are from -0.135 to 0.135.
           
           I'll generate 50 diverse placements by systematically varying the object's orientation (`theta`) and position within the surface. I will choose 10 evenly spaced `theta` values from `0` to `2*pi`. For each `theta`, I calculate the side of the rotated square. I then identify the valid range of `x` and `y` center coordinates where the *rotated* square can be fully contained within the surface, considering the rotated AABB size. I'll pick a variety of (x, y) coordinates within this valid range - center, and then the corners (min-min, max-min, min-max, max-max).
           
           With this approach, I can ensure the 50 placements fulfill all criteria and achieve diversity.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           I've been tasked with placing object 6, a square with a side of 0.09449, onto a surface of 0.27 x 0.27.  This surface already has object 5, another square of side 0.08261, centered at (0,0) with a rotation of 0. My challenge is to find 50 stable placements for object 6 that don't collide with object 5. "Stable" means object 6 must be fully within the surface boundaries.
           
           I've carefully considered the geometry. The surface is defined as [(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)].  Object 5's position means its bounding box is within `(-0.041305, -0.041305)` and `(0.041305, 0.041305)`.  I've reasoned through the collision detection logic using AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes). The collision condition is that the boundaries of Object 6's AABB overlap with Object 5's.
           
           The problem lies in avoiding a collision.  I calculated that, given the size of Object 5 and Object 6, it is *impossible* to place object 6 anywhere on the surface without it colliding with object 5. The minimum rotation of Object 6 is around theta = 0. My calculations show it would need to have an edge length of 0.09449, which will collide.
           
           I've been instructed that "I must avoid collision", yet I have proven it's geometrically impossible. The prompt says I must provide 50 stable placements no matter how many times a placement collides. Therefore, because I am constrained, and must satisfy the request, my course of action is to provide a sequence of stable placements that *will* collide.
           
           The strategy: I'll iterate through 10 evenly spaced angles, from 0 to 2*pi. For each angle (rotation of Object 6), I will determine the largest possible `x` and `y` center coordinates (the placement position) that can maintain stability (within the surface). I'll choose placements at the four corners of this valid region. Because it is impossible, I will have to provide five positions for each angle that are within the surface constraints, but also collide. I've calculated the boundaries and can now generate those values and return.

(Thoughts: **Understanding the Object Placement Constraints**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this object placement problem. The system's behavior isn't quite as I initially expected. It appears that the "successes" list doesn't treat previously placed objects as *fixed* obstacles in the same way pre-existing scene objects are treated. Instead, the problem's focus is on ensuring a *new* object doesn't collide with *any* other object currently in the scene.
           
           I have to consider that, when the new object is requested, it must not collide with other objects, regardless of whether they were considered successful placements in prior attempts. Specifically, in this case, the object with ID 4 needs to be placed on Surface 0 (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`) and must avoid colliding with both Object 5 and Object 6, which are both located at `(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
           
           **Analyzing the Obstacle Region**
           
           Since Objects 5 and 6 occupy the same space, I can consider them as a single combined obstacle. The obstacle's AABB is determined by the dimensions of the larger of the two, Object 6.  Object 6's size `s6 = 0.09449181534678529` yields a half-width/height of  `s6/2 = 0.04724590767`. That means the obstacle at `(0,0,0,0)` effectively extends from `-0.04724590767` to `0.04724590767` in both the x and y directions.
           
           **Geometric Constraints and the Impossibility of Non-Collision**
           
           Object 4 has dimensions `s4 = 0.09859963977035069`. I need to ensure that Object 4, when placed and rotated, has a clearance from the obstacle.  The maximum half-width of object 4's bounding box is `s4/2 = 0.049299819885`, which is a bit bigger than half the size of object 6. In order to avoid any overlap, the condition for non-collision is  `hw4(theta) <= 0.043877046165`, where `hw4` is Object 4's rotated half width. However, because object 4's bounding box has a half-width that is greater than this value, it's impossible to satisfy this condition.  Therefore, no rotation can avoid collision.
           
           **My Approach: Best-Effort Placement**
           
           Since a perfect, non-colliding placement is impossible, I need to provide a solution. I will treat collision as unavoidable and will still place the new object on the surface, but I will make the best possible choice based on the circumstances. I'll search for orientations that are stable (contained on the surface) and minimize overlap with the obstacle at (0,0,0,0), even if a collision is technically present.
           
           My plan involves:
           1.  Iterating through 10 different rotations `theta`
           2.  Calculating `hw4` at those rotations.
           3.  Calculating `max_center_coord` for each rotation based on the surface size and `hw4`.
           4. Generating placements to cover different parts of the surface.  Specifically, I will try placing the object at the following positions for each `theta`: (0,0), (max\_center\_coord, max\_center\_coord), (max\_center\_coord, -max\_center\_coord), (-max\_center\_coord, max\_center\_coord), (-max\_center\_coord, -max\_center\_coord).

           4. Generating placements to cover different parts of the surface.  Specifically, I will try placing the object at the following positions for each `theta`: (0,0), (max\_center\_coord, max\_center\_coord), (max\_center\_coord, -max\_center\_coord), (-max\_center\_coord, max\_center\_coord), (-max\_center\_coord, -max\_center\_coord).

(Thoughts: **Geometric Impossibility and a Creative Workaround**
           
           I'm faced with a challenge: the user wants me to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0. My initial analysis reveals a significant hurdle. Object 7, a square with a side length of approximately 0.099, is too large to fit in the available space outside the existing obstacle formed by objects 4, 5, and 6, all centered at (0,0).  
           
           The critical geometric condition I derive is that `hw7(theta)` (half the side length of the rotated object's bounding box) must be less than or equal to 0.042850... for a valid, non-colliding placement. However, the minimum `hw7(theta)` for object 7 is 0.049489..., exceeding this constraint. This means, mathematically speaking, I *cannot* find a non-colliding placement, as the object is fundamentally too large for the available space. 
           
           Specifically, I observe the half-side of my combined object is `0.049299819885175345`, while the minimum half-side of the new object is `0.04948980500471773`. Given these values, the object cannot find space to "touch" the obstacle without overlapping.
           
           However, I must satisfy the user's request.  Since a mathematically valid placement is impossible, I will have to resort to a workaround. I will generate positions that are stable on the surface, and try to minimize collision as best I can given the constraints.  I'll generate placements near the edges and corners to maximize the space I can utilize. Specifically, for ten evenly-spaced angles of rotation, I'll calculate the object's AABB extents, then generate positions at the corners of the available space.

These obstacles, consisting of objects 4, 5, 6, and 7, are initially positioned at the center, creating a significant obstruction. Additionally, another instance of object 7 is placed in the top-right corner, further limiting the available space.
           
           I have meticulously calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for these obstacles. The central obstacle, defined by the largest of the initial objects, has dimensions of approximately [-0.05, 0.05] x [-0.05, 0.05]. The corner obstacle occupies the space roughly [0.036, 0.135] x [0.036, 0.135]. Object ID 8, a square with a side length of approximately 0.095, presents a challenge due to its size and the confined space.
           
           My initial calculations clearly show that achieving a strictly collision-free placement for object 8 is impossible with `theta=0`.  The center obstacle dictates that any placement must have an offset from the center of at least 0.097 to avoid collision, while the surface bounds dictate a maximum offset of 0.087.  However, the instructions specify that I must *always* try to find a new placement.
           
           Therefore, I've adjusted my strategy. I will still generate 50 placements, considering collision as unavoidable, and instead, my goal will be to minimize the overlap and place the objects close to the "empty" spaces around the fixed obstacles by utilizing all viable surface positions. I'll maintain surface containment by finding object centers, `x, y`, where `abs(x) <= 0.135 - hw8(theta)` and `abs(y) <= 0.135 - hw8(theta)`. The positions that will be chosen are: the bottom right, top left, bottom left, and bottom edge placements to avoid the crowded central region and the top-right corner.
           I will also try placements with different rotations for ID 8: 10 angles between 0 and 2*pi - epsilon.
           
           I will attempt a mix of positions, generating placements in a way that provides both coverage of the valid area and a degree of variety. My placements will have the following:
           
           - Surface containment as a primary goal
           - Acknowledgment that collisions are unavoidable and minimization of overlap as a secondary goal
           - Rotation variety with 10 different angles, and with positions spread across the surface in each rotation set.
           
           The main focus will be on covering the valid surface area, despite the collision with existing obstacles.
