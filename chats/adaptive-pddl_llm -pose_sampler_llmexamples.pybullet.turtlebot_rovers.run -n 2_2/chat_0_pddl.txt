User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has several bounding boxes. Boxes 0-4 define the outer boundaries of the environment, creating a square. Box 5 is a vertical wall in the middle, splitting the environment into two halves. There are also several smaller boxes scattered throughout the environment, particularly clustered in the upper right, upper left, and upper middle regions, as well as some smaller, irregularly shaped boxes in other areas. I'll need to keep these in mind to avoid collisions. I will try to find positions within a 2-unit radius of the target point, ensuring they are within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. I will try to select a diverse set of positions around the target.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempts revealed some critical collision zones. The proposed position (1.916 -0.627) collided with box 11, which is a small box around (1.98, -0.77). The position (0.916 1.372) was deemed "not reachable", which likely means it was outside the allowed x/y range or within a restricted zone by some complex obstacle not explicitly defined as an AABB, or simply that the given target point was misidentified in the previous output. The position (-0.083 0.372) collided with box 5, the central vertical wall. This means I need to be careful when crossing the x=0 line.
           
           For the new request, the target point is (0.5234820246696472, 1.9876656532287598). This is in the upper right quadrant of the environment. I need to avoid the central wall (box 5). I also need to be careful about boxes 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20 which are all in the upper part of the environment.
