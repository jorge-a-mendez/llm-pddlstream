User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.303, -0.357), (-4.215, -0.269)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.259, -0.313, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.156, 0.988).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`: Placing Object `v8` on Surface `v18`**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. After examining the initial state, I've determined that object `v8` satisfies `type(v8, v17)`. Therefore, I need to make `on(v8, v18)` true. To achieve this, the primary sub-goals become positioning `v8` onto the surface `v18`. From the given knowledge-base, it is already true in the initial state that I *can* put `v8` on `v18` at pose `#o2` and the pose itself should be available.
           
           To move the object to the target I'll need a combination of "pick" and "place" actions. Given that I have access to these primitive actions, the plan to place `v8` on surface `v18` boils down to `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t1)` followed by `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #t2)`. The arm that will be used is `v4`, and the initial pose of the object is `v9`. I'll pick from the object a grasping pose `#o1` which is in my state and place it at `#o2` on surface `v18`. I will use the base configuration `v3` for pick and place, with the arm trajectories `#t1` and `#t2` respectively. My analysis revealed the object's dimensions and the surface's location, the latter implying that I could successfully place the object onto the target. The cost of a successful pick and place is two and, from my observations, I have made assumptions and interpretations that the object's dimensions *are relative* to its location which simplifies placing it. Based on the constraints in the problem, I will need to provide concrete values for `#o2` the target pose for `v8`. The appropriate pose I have computed is `x=4.5`, `y=-0.3`, `z=0.8`, and `theta=0.0`.
           
           This solution relies on computing valid continuous poses, and assuming I am able to properly use the "pick" and "place" actions within the problem constraints. I will assume this to be true and rely on the results of the plan.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t1) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #t2)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so the user has made it clear that only `move_base` is an available action. Let's reassess. The goal is `on(?green, v18)`, which implies we need to place an object of type `v17` on `v18`.  Given the initial state, that means we either need to have `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           The current state gives us that `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. To get either of them onto `v18`, we'd need to change the `on` predicate. Remember, `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose`.  We do have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, and the same for `v12`. Thus, to satisfy the `on` predicate, we need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           However, the action provided, `(move_base)`, only affects `atbconf` and `canmove`.  It does *nothing* to the pose of objects. It's a base motion action and doesn't manipulate objects directly.  The `pick` and `place` actions, which *would* modify object poses (and therefore `on` predicates), aren't on the list.
           
           Since the allowed action can't change the state of objects, and the goal *requires* a change to the object's pose, the goal seems impossible to achieve. Let's just be sure it isn't already true.
           
           Neither `on(v8, v18)` nor `on(v12, v18)` are true in the initial state, because their current poses are not `#o2`, which is what's required for the support relationship. Therefore, given the constraints, this goal is unsolvable.
