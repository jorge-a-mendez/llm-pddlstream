(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for object ID 5, a square with a side of approximately 0.096, on a square surface centered at (0,0) and ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           The key is that the object must be *fully* contained within the surface for a stable placement. This means I need to calculate the allowable range for the object's center based on its rotation.  Because it's a square, I can take advantage of symmetry.
           
           First, I define the object's half-extents (half the side length). Then, I need to account for rotation. The critical angles are 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2.  I know that at 0 and π/2, the effective extent is simply the object's half-width.  At π/4 (45 degrees), the effective extent becomes the object's diagonal, which is the half-width times the square root of 2.  I'll also consider π/8 and 3π/8 due to their symmetry with the other angles.
           
           For a given angle (theta), I calculate the "effective half-dimension" - the maximum distance the object extends from its center. This lets me determine the valid x and y ranges for the object's center.  I need to ensure the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) stays within the surface boundaries.
           
           I'll generate a grid of positions for each of these angles. This strategy helps me ensure a somewhat even distribution of placements across the available space, avoiding clustering. I determined the valid ranges for the object's center position (x and y) based on the rotation angle. Then I created a series of x and y coordinates that would give me placements that were symmetrical across the board.
           
           The final strategy is to use the calculated effective half dimensions to create grids of placements, where I used x and y coordinates that were within the allowable range for that particular angle of rotation.
           
           The total placements will then be sent back.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Plan for ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got the go-ahead – that ID 5 square (0.09567 units) placed successfully at (0, 0, -0.08, -0.08) on surface 0. That confirms my calculations. Now, time to place ID 6, another square (0.09819 units).  I'll call its half-extent `obj6_hx = 0.049098`.
           
           Stability and no collisions are key. Object 5 is the only existing object, placed at (0, 0, -0.08, -0.08).
           
           First, let's establish the AABB of object 5, which is simple given zero rotation: It's centered at (-0.08, -0.08), with half-extents 0.0478399.  Therefore:
           *   `min_x = -0.1278`

           *   `min_y = -0.1278`
           *   `max_y = -0.0321`
           
           Surface 0 runs from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Now, the goal is to find 50 stable placements for ID 6, avoiding that collision with ID 5.
           
           For rotation `theta`, `effective_half_dim_6 = obj6_hx * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.

               *   X and Y range for the center: [-0.0859, 0.0859].
           2.  **For theta = pi/8 (and 3\*pi/8):**

               *   X and Y range for the center: [-0.0655, 0.0655].
           
           I'll use those ranges and the AABB of object 5 as the collision boundary.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement Plan for Object 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for Object 4 (a square) on Surface 0.  I need to consider stability, ensuring the object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box, even when rotated) fits entirely within Surface 0's AABB.  Crucially, these placements must avoid collisions with two pre-existing, placed objects (Objects 5 and 6) whose AABBs occupy parts of the surface.
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:**  Defined by a specific x-y boundary.
           *   **Object 4:** A square with known dimensions. The effective half-width/height varies with rotation (theta).
           *   **Objects 5 & 6:**  Already placed objects, their AABBs define the "occupied" regions.
           
           **Identifying Clear Space:**
           
           Object 5 and 6 are near the bottom-left of the surface.  This means potential placement space is on the right and top.
           
           To ensure collision-free placements, I must avoid placing Object 4's AABB within these occupied zones, especially within the union of their regions. Using calculations, I find, that:
           *   **θ = 0 (and π/2):** Collision-free centers must have x > 0.017, and y in [-0.087, 0.087].
           *   **θ = π/8 (and 3π/8):** Collision-free centers must have x > 0.032, and y in [-0.072, 0.072].
           *   **θ = π/4:** Collision-free centers must have x > 0.037, and y in [-0.067, 0.067].
           
           In general, these calculations have the following collision-free region characteristics:
           
           *   The *right side* of the surface, with varying degrees of `x`.
           *   The surface is partitioned based on the rotational angle; as angle increases, the placement-region becomes increasingly constrained.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Generate candidate placements:** I am placing the center points for each value of theta and calculate all combinations, thus ensuring that collision-free areas are considered.
           2.  **Filter and Refine:** I will then filter based on the stability/collision conditions, ensuring that the final list contains feasible placements.
           
           **Results:**
           
           My calculations show that I can find at least 57 candidate placements that meet the criteria.  I will then select 50 of these, prioritizing placements at `theta=0` (and `pi/2`).

           My objective is to find 50 stable and collision-free locations for a new, square object (ID 7) on a defined surface (Surface 0). This surface is a square region centered at the origin, with sides of 0.27 units. The challenge lies in avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects: ID 5, ID 6, and ID 4, which are essentially arranged in an "L" shape.
           
           My approach involves a detailed understanding of the scene geometry. I've meticulously calculated the dimensions, half-extents (needed for bounding box calculations), and exact positions of all existing objects. I also calculated the AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes) of each object which is essential for determining collision regions. With these AABBs in place, I can efficiently test various placements of object 7. I am making sure the new object doesn't intersect any of these.
           
           Object 7 is a square object. I first calculate valid boundaries on the surface. To avoid collisions, I have to ensure that my new object doesn't overlap those AABBs. My core strategy is to place the object's center within the valid surface boundaries and then carefully check for overlaps with the other objects' AABBs. I'll test each possible placement by calculating the object's AABB based on the object's rotation (theta). I focus on avoiding collisions with existing objects by considering x-y positions as well as the object's rotation.
           
           Since this is a very confined space, I'm carefully analyzing the geometry to find areas that are clear of collision, and I'll generate a grid of potential placements in the bottom right corner region, for a diverse range of orientations. I'll take a number of diverse samples in that region and choose 50 valid solutions.
