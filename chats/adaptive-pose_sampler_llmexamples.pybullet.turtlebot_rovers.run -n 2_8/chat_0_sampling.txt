User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. The target point is (1.5, 0.5).
           
           I will try to place the robot in open areas that are not too close to the walls or known obstacles.
           Positions:
           (1.0 2.0)
           (2.0 0.0)
           (1.0 -1.0)
