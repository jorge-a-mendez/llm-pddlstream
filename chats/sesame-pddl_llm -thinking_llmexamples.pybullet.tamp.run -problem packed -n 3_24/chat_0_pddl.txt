           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve Multiple "On" Goals**
           
           My primary goal is to craft a plan to satisfy the conditions `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  I've thoroughly analyzed the initial state, where these objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`) are currently supported by `v11`, and I know from my knowledge base that the `on` predicate is satisfied if an object is at a specific pose and supported by the target.  The objects are currently at positions `v9`, `v13`, and `v15`, respectively, all on top of `v11`. My strategy is to move each object individually to the target surface, `v16`.
           
           The robot has a single arm (`v4`) which is currently empty. The possible actions I can utilize are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`.  The objective is to move the robot base to `#o3`, as it's common to all `kin` relations. Then, use pick and place operations to position the three objects onto v16. I can achieve the goal with the following sequence:
           
           1.  Move the base to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` from `v9`.
           3.  Place `v8` onto `v16`.
           4.  Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           5.  Place `v12` onto `v16`.
           6.  Pick `v14` from `v15`.
           7.  Place `v14` onto `v16`.
           
           I've verified that all preconditions for the `pick` and `place` actions are satisfied, including the robot's base configuration, grasping relations, and empty hand states. All required kinematic relations are given and the predicates that state that movement is safe are also assumed false, since they're not explicitly stated to be true. The robot's `canmove()` predicate flow appears to be valid with the sequence. The order of pick/place actions for the three objects doesn't matter, as long as each object is moved independently from its initial position to the target, `v16`.
