           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. Examining the definition of `new-axiom@0()`, we see it requires the following conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Storage `v16` on rover `v12` is free. This is true initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Storage `v16` on rover `v14` is free. This is true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received. This is not true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received. This is not true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective `v19` in mode `v11` has been received. This is not true initially.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists a rock of type `v2` (stone). This is true initially (e.g., `v4`, `v1`, `v3`).
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a rock of type `v2` (stone) has been received. This is not true initially.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists a rock of type `v6` (soil). This is true initially (e.g., `v5`, `v8`, `v7`).
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of a rock of type `v6` (soil) has been received. This is not true initially.
           
           The available actions are very limited: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           Let's analyze what each of the required goal conditions implies and if they can be satisfied with the given actions:
           
           1.  **`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`**: These are true initially and the only `move` actions are self-loops (`move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`), so these will remain true.
           
           2.  **`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`**: These are true initially. The `drop_rock` actions would only be applicable if `full` was true, which it is not. These conditions will remain true.
           
           3.  **`receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`**: To achieve `receivedimage`, we need to first `take_image` and then `send_image`.
               - `take_image` requires `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, `calibrated`, and `~blocked`.
               - `send_image` requires `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, `atconf`, and `~blocked`.
               - No `take_image` or `send_image` actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy these `receivedimage` conditions.
           
           4.  **`receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`**: To achieve `receivedanalysis`, we need to first `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
               - `sample_rock` requires `above`, `store`, `atconf`, `free`. This action makes the `analyzed` predicate true.
               - `send_analysis` requires `comvisible`, `rock`, `analyzed`, `atconf`, `~blocked`.
               - No `sample_rock` or `send_analysis` actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Therefore, it's impossible to satisfy these `receivedanalysis` conditions.
           
           Since the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true, and there are no actions provided in the allowed list to achieve these predicates, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10. They are at configurations v13 and v15 respectively. Both rovers have free storage v16. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of two types (v2, v6). There are also objectives (v17, v18, v19) and a lander v9.
           The rovers have motion capabilities to stay at their current positions (the `move` actions are self-loops).
           The rovers also have visibility of various objectives and rocks, and communication visibility with the lander.
           
           However, the provided list of valid action instances only contains `move` actions that keep the rovers in their current configurations, and `drop_rock` actions that are not applicable as the storage is initially free. Crucially, there are no `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `calibrate`, or `send_analysis` actions available.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that images of multiple objectives are received and that analysis of at least one rock of type `v2` (stone) and one rock of type `v6` (soil) are received. Without the ability to take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses, it's impossible to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the allowed actions.
