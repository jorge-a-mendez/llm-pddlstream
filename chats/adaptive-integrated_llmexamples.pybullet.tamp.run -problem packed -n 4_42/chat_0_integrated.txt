           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.012, -0.295), (0.109, -0.197)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.09, -0.475), (0.177, -0.387)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.215, -0.593), (-0.125, -0.503)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.061, -0.246, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.956, 0.293).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.241, 0.172), (-0.142, 0.271)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.133, -0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.805, 0.594).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.17, -0.548, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.173, 0.985).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.192, 0.222, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.924, -0.383).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires placing all four graspable objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto the surface v18. Currently, all these objects are on v11, which is a table. There are no pick or place actions provided in the available action instances. Only a `move_base` action is available, which doesn't directly interact with objects for picking or placing.
           
           Since pick and place actions are not available in the given list of action instances, it's impossible to move the objects from their current supported surface (v11) to the target surface (v18). The goal predicates `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)` can only be satisfied if the `atpose` predicate for each object matches a `supported` predicate on `v18`. Since we cannot change the `atpose` of any object without pick and place actions, the goal is unreachable.
