(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm going to approach this placement problem:
           
           First, I've got to ensure 50 stable placements of an object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.0964 x 0.0964) on a surface defined by the rectangle((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to provide (surf_idx, theta, x, y) for each placement. The object must remain fully within the surface bounds.
           
           Initially, I'll focus on how rotation (`theta`) affects the object's AABB. Since the object is almost a square, rotating it by 90 degrees doesn't significantly change its effective size.  For simplicity and to maintain a reasonable distribution, I'll consider angles of 0 and 90 degrees (pi/2) for rotation. These angles greatly simplify the coordinate calculations.
           
           The surface is a square of size 0.27 x 0.27, centered at (0,0). With the object being very close to a square, the effective bounding box will be close to the AABB extent in any orientation.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I can calculate the valid range for x and y. The object's effective half-width and half-height will be 0.0964/2, and I have to ensure the object stays within the surface. The same will apply to `theta=pi/2`, because of the similar object dimensions.
           
           I'll start with 25 placements at `theta=0`, which means x, y ranges are approximately -0.086 to 0.086, based on the calculation of the half extents of the object and surface. A 5x5 grid in x and y coordinates, centered at 0, should give me good coverage in this range. Then I'll add another 25 placements, all with `theta=pi/2`, with the same x and y coordinate grid. Because the object dimensions are similar, the valid ranges are almost the same.
           
           In effect, for my first 50 placements, I'll have the set `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. The plan gives me a robust set of placements to ensure a good distribution.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Candidate Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's process this. We have a placement for Object 6 already. Now it's Object 4's turn, another square object. I need to make sure I don't introduce any collisions.
           
           Object 4 has dimensions of about 0.094 units on each side. That tells me a lot. With the surface boundaries at +/- 0.135, the initial safe placement range, ignoring collisions, would be roughly from -0.088 to 0.088 in both x and y.
           
           But Object 6 is already in place. It's centered around (-0.086, -0.086), and its dimensions are slightly bigger than Object 4's. I've got its AABB calculated – it occupies the space between (-0.1342, -0.1342) and (-0.0378, -0.0378).
           
           To prevent collisions, the key is to ensure that the AABB of Object 4 doesn't overlap with that of Object 6. Let's start with the simplest: Object 4's rotation is 0 radians (or `pi`). Its extent in each dimension is therefore 0.094/2 = 0.047. The center of Object 4 can't be at (-0.086,-0.086). I’ll need to make sure I shift the range! We should calculate the AABBs for different placements and use this.
           
           Now, for `theta=0`, I want to make sure object 4 is not in the range `(-0.134213, -0.037787)` x `(-0.134213, -0.037787)`. I also know there must be other solutions, since I'm told to give fifty of them.
           
           Since I have a well-defined grid, to simplify things, and since both items are almost perfect squares, I can rotate and calculate that way. For example, if I rotate at pi/4, the total size will be increased by sqrt(2). So the range becomes much smaller.
           
           Therefore, for valid placements, for `theta = 0`, I’ve got to use: either x >= 0.0092 or y >= 0.0092.
           And in range, for `theta = pi/4` is to have, either x >= 0.0286 or y >= 0.0286.
           
           With that, I'll calculate the best set of 50. I have it all ready, so I will now generate the candidate placements:
           
           (0, 0, -0.085, 0.0425)
           (0, 0, -0.085, 0.085)

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing object ID 5, a square with extents of about 0.0863 units, onto surface 0 which is a square region of (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I need to ensure this placement is stable and non-colliding with the existing objects: object 6 at (0, 0, -0.086, -0.086) and object 4 at (0, 0, -0.085, 0.0425).  I've already analyzed the bounding boxes (AABBs) for these existing objects, which helps define the collision boundaries I need to avoid.
           
           My initial calculation of the object's half extents tells me the valid center range for the unrotated object is x, y ∈ [-0.091866, 0.091866]. For the object rotated by pi/4, this valid center range shrinks to x, y ∈ [-0.074005, 0.074005].
           
           Now, the main idea is to put the object where it can't collide. Object 6's AABB extends approximately from -0.134 to -0.038 in both X and Y. Object 4 has an AABB from -0.132 to -0.038 on the X axis, and -0.005 to 0.09 on the Y. The area is pretty occupied, so I will position the object, for the most part, to the right. To ensure I don't collide with the existing objects, it seems best to position the object to the right of the existing ones. So, I will avoid placement locations where x is less than 0.006 or so.
           
           To make things easier and to adhere to the 50 placements criteria, I'm going to create an array of points in the X and Y plane to cover most of the available space. I will use a simple rectangular 5x5 grid in the space where x is greater than 0.006 (0.01 actually) and y ranges from -0.09 to 0.09 (approximately).
           
           I will use two orientations. I will place the object at each grid point first at theta = 0, then at theta = pi/2. This generates two grids (each 25 placements), or 50 possible placements. These points, with the specified orientation, should not collide with the AABB of the two existing objects.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable objects (ID 7) on Surface 0, a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin, without any collisions with the already placed objects (ID 6, 4, and 5).  I've got the geometry down: Object 7 is a square with side length 0.093.
           
           1.  **Understand the Space:** Surface 0 goes from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. I need to figure out where to put Object 7 without it overlapping any of the other guys. I have their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to help me.
           2.  **Obstacles:**  Object 6 is a near-square in the bottom-left. Object 4 is a square just above it.  Object 5 sits in the bottom-middle. I've calculated their AABBs:
               *   Object 6: Roughly (-0.134, -0.134) to (-0.038, -0.038)
               *   Object 4: Roughly (-0.132, -0.005) to (-0.038, 0.090)
               *   Object 5: Roughly (-0.033, -0.133) to (0.053, -0.047)
           3.  **Stability First:**  Object 7 needs to be fully on the surface, which means its center can't be too close to any edge. I've got to ensure the object can be safely placed.
           4.  **Collision Avoidance (The Real Challenge):**  It's clear I can't just slap Object 7 anywhere.  The current objects are taking up a good chunk of space. If I want to avoid collisions, I need Object 7's AABB not to intersect with any of the other AABBs. My initial thought was placing Object 7 on the top-right. But, looking at my calculations, Object 4's high Y-range (0.090) means I can't place Object 7 entirely above or to the right of the already placed objects.
           5.  **A Better Strategy:** I need a more nuanced approach. I've broken this down: Object 7 is going to either overlap in X *or* Y with an existing object.  Since no area is entirely free, I have to pick one. The best solution is top-right, placing Object 7 such that its AABB *partially* overlaps with some AABB.
               *   I'll make the object 7 center `(x_c, y_c)` in a safe space to place it. I have the value `hw7 = hh7 = 0.04647248`.
               *   I'll ensure `x_c > 0.008672` to avoid any objects to the left of the plane.
               *   I'll ensure `y_c > -0.000428`.
           
               This way, `O7` might overlap with some `O5`, but not `O4` or `O6`.
           6.  **The Plan:** I'll set a grid system:
               *   `x` goes from 0.01 to 0.08, in 0.02 increments (5 values).
               *   `y` goes from 0.01 to 0.08, in 0.02 increments (5 values).
               *   If that strategy works, then I can rotate all those 25 placements 90 degrees to get a total of 50.

Model:     **Object Placement Strategy on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable objects (ID 7) on Surface 0, a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at the origin, without any collisions with the already placed objects (ID 6, 4, and 5).  I've got the geometry down: Object 7 is a square with side length 0.093.
           
           1.  **Understand the Space:** Surface 0 goes from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. I need to figure out where to put Object 7 without it overlapping any of the other guys. I have their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to help me.
           2.  **Obstacles:**  Object 6 is a near-square in the bottom-left. Object 4 is a square just above it.  Object 5 sits in the bottom-middle. I've calculated their AABBs:
               *   Object 6: Roughly (-0.134, -0.134) to (-0.038, -0.038)
               *   Object 4: Roughly (-0.132, -0.005) to (-0.038, 0.090)
               *   Object 5: Roughly (-0.033, -0.133) to (0.053, -0.047)
           3.  **Stability First:**  Object 7 needs to be fully on the surface, which means its center can't be too close to any edge. I've got to ensure the object can be safely placed.
           4.  **Collision Avoidance (The Real Challenge):**  It's clear I can't just slap Object 7 anywhere.  The current objects are taking up a good chunk of space. If I want to avoid collisions, I need Object 7's AABB not to intersect with any of the other AABBs. My initial thought was placing Object 7 on the top-right. But, looking at my calculations, Object 4's high Y-range (0.090) means I can't place Object 7 entirely above or to the right of the already placed objects.
           5.  **A Better Strategy:** I need a more nuanced approach. I've broken this down: Object 7 is going to either overlap in X *or* Y with an existing object.  Since no area is entirely free, I have to pick one. The best solution is top-right, placing Object 7 such that its AABB *partially* overlaps with some AABB.
               *   I'll make the object 7 center `(x_c, y_c)` in a safe space to place it. I have the value `hw7 = hh7 = 0.04647248`.
               *   I'll ensure `x_c > 0.008672` to avoid any objects to the left of the plane.
               *   I'll ensure `y_c > -0.000428`.
           
               This way, `O7` might overlap with some `O5`, but not `O4` or `O6`.
           6.  **The Plan:** I'll set a grid system:
               *   `x` goes from 0.01 to 0.08, in 0.02 increments (5 values).
               *   `y` goes from 0.01 to 0.08, in 0.02 increments (5 values).
               *   If that strategy works, then I can rotate all those 25 placements 90 degrees to get a total of 50.
