User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.156, -0.269), (0.254, -0.172)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.066, 0.484), (0.16, 0.578)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.011, -0.443), (0.11, -0.345)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.188, -0.483), (-0.09, -0.385)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.205, -0.221, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.886, 0.463).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.113, 0.531, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.525, 0.851).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.061, -0.394, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.346, 0.938).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.139, -0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.899, 0.438).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires placing objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto object v18. Currently, v8, v12, v14, and v16 are on v11. All objects are stackable on v18. Since the `move_base` action is the only available action instance and it only moves the base to the same location, it means that the robot cannot perform any pick or place actions from its current location, as no such actions are given as available action instances. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved with the given actions.
           
           It seems I made a mistake in my previous reasoning. The available action instances list contains only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This means that no other actions, like `pick` or `place`, are available for the robot to execute. Without `pick` and `place` actions, the robot cannot manipulate the objects to achieve the `on` predicates in the goal state. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
