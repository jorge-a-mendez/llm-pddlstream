           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at this axiom, it essentially boils down to:
           
           1.  Certain configuration and freedom conditions must hold (`atconf` and `free`). These are fortunately already satisfied in the initial state.
           2.  I need to obtain two images (`receivedimage`) and analyses (`receivedanalysis`) for various stone and soil samples.
           
           My challenge lies in how to achieve these image and analysis goals. To get a `receivedimage`, I'd need to go through a sequence: calibrate, take image, then send the image. Similarly, to get `receivedanalysis`, I'd need to sample the rock and then send the analysis.
           
           Now comes the major hurdle. My allowed actions are severely limited. I'm given: self-moves (which do nothing) and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, no `send_analysis`, nothing to allow me to obtain new information.
           
           Given this, I have to conclude that the goal is *impossible* to achieve. I can't generate the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates with the actions I'm given. The `drop_rock` action just frees up storage; it doesn't get me any closer to the goal.
           
           I've re-read the problem statement, just to be sure. I'm only allowed to use the provided actions, and those actions are fundamentally insufficient to reach my objective. The images and analyses are just completely out of reach. So, my conclusion is that, *with this highly restricted action set*, the specified goal is unattainable.
