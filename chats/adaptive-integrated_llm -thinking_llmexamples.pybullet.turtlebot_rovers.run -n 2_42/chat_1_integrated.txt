           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Breakdown for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's lay out the plan. My primary objective is to make sure `new-axiom@0()` is true. To do this, I must fulfill these key requirements: getting images of two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, and ensuring we receive the analysis of a stone (of type `v2`, in this case `v3`) and soil (type `v6`, here `v8`).
           
           To get the images, I'll leverage rover `v12`. I need to move `v12` from its starting position (`v13`) to a suitable imaging location. I'll need to calibrate and then take images of both objectives. After that, `v12` will move to a communication-friendly spot to send off the images to `v9`.
           
           For analysis, rover `v14` will be responsible. It'll move to the sampling location, gather the stone sample (`v3`), send the analysis, and drop the sample to free up space. This is then repeated for the soil sample (`v8`). Finally, I will ensure it is returned to its starting configuration `v15` for compliance with the initial axioms.
           
           To ensure the visibility and communicability, it's crucial I've chosen suitable configuration points in my plan.
           
           **Key Configuration Details:**
           
           *   **`#o3` (Image Visibility):** For my imaging rover (`v12`), I've selected a spot at (1.0, 0.5) to view `v17` and `v18`. This is far enough to be a feasible move.
           *   **`#o0` (Communication Visibility):** To communicate with `v9`, rovers `v12` and `v14` will move to (-1.5, -1.8). This allows line-of-sight communication with `v9` for the analysis of stone and soil.
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling Configuration):** While not explicitly for visibility requirements, for `v14` to gather the rock samples,  I'll use (-0.7, -0.2) as the sample position for stone and soil.
           
           **Plan Execution (in action):**
           
           **Rover v12 - Image Acquisition & Communication:**
           
           1.  Move from `v13` (Initial config) to `#o3` (Move rover to camera position).
           2.  Calibrate Camera (ensuring images are clear).
           3.  Take image of `v17` (Image Object).
           4.  Take image of `v18` (Image Object).
           5.  Move from `#o3` (Camera position) to `#o0` (Communication position).
           6.  Send image `v17` to `v9` (Send Images to Mission Control).
           7.  Send image `v18` to `v9` (Send Images to Mission Control).
           8.  Move from `#o0` (Communication position) back to `v13` (Ensure correct initial state).
           
           **Rover v14 - Sampling & Analysis Communication:**
           
           1.  Move from `v15` (Initial config) to `#o5` (Sampling location).
           2.  Sample rock `v3` to `v16` (Take rock).
           3.  Move from `#o5` (Sampling location) to `#o0` (Communication).
           4.  Send analysis of `v3` to `v9` (Send data to Mission Control).
           5.  Drop sample `v3` (Rover must be free to pick next sample.)
           6.  Move from `#o0` (Communication) to `#o5` (Back to Sampling location).
           7.  Sample soil `v8` to `v16` (Pick up soil sample).
           8.  Move from `#o5` (Sampling) to `#o0` (Communication).
           9.  Send analysis of `v8` to `v9` (Send the soil to the control station).
           10. Drop sample `v8` (Rover must be free to get back to original config).
           11. Move from `#o0` (Communication point) to `v15` (Final location, ensures correct initial state).
           
           This comprehensive approach is designed to ensure all the prerequisites for `new-axiom@0()` are met, including the critical configuration details that will ensure successful and efficient operation.

           *   **`#o5` (Sampling Configuration):** While not explicitly for visibility requirements, for `v14` to gather the rock samples,  I'll use (-0.7, -0.2) as the sample position for stone and soil.
           
           **Plan Execution (in action):**
           
           **Rover v12 - Image Acquisition & Communication:**
           
           1.  Move from `v13` (Initial config) to `#o3` (Move rover to camera position).
           2.  Calibrate Camera (ensuring images are clear).
           3.  Take image of `v17` (Image Object).
           4.  Take image of `v18` (Image Object).
           5.  Move from `#o3` (Camera position) to `#o0` (Communication position).
           6.  Send image `v17` to `v9` (Send Images to Mission Control).
           7.  Send image `v18` to `v9` (Send Images to Mission Control).
           8.  Move from `#o0` (Communication position) back to `v13` (Ensure correct initial state).
           
           **Rover v14 - Sampling & Analysis Communication:**
           
           1.  Move from `v15` (Initial config) to `#o5` (Sampling location).
           2.  Sample rock `v3` to `v16` (Take rock).
           3.  Move from `#o5` (Sampling location) to `#o0` (Communication).
           4.  Send analysis of `v3` to `v9` (Send data to Mission Control).
           5.  Drop sample `v3` (Rover must be free to pick next sample.)
           6.  Move from `#o0` (Communication) to `#o5` (Back to Sampling location).
           7.  Sample soil `v8` to `v16` (Pick up soil sample).
           8.  Move from `#o5` (Sampling) to `#o0` (Communication).
           9.  Send analysis of `v8` to `v9` (Send the soil to the control station).
           10. Drop sample `v8` (Rover must be free to get back to original config).
           11. Move from `#o0` (Communication point) to `v15` (Final location, ensures correct initial state).
           
           This comprehensive approach is designed to ensure all the prerequisites for `new-axiom@0()` are met, including the critical configuration details that will ensure successful and efficient operation.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Rover Configurations**
           
           Okay, the previous communication plan went sideways because the `#o0` for communication was inside the lander `v9`, causing a collision. That's a no-go. I need a new `#o0` that lets both rovers `v12` and `v14` talk to `v9` without any bumping.
           
           I need to re-evaluate the objects and their shapes. The lander `v9` is roughly between x = -2.4 to -1.4, and y = -2.3 to -1.6.  The old point, `(-1.5, -1.8)`, was inside the lander.  The communication range is 4 units. I need a point outside the lander's box but still within that 4-unit range. Let's try `(-1.3, -2.0)`. It's just outside the lander. It looks like the center of `v9` is about `(-1.9, -2.0)`. So the distance to the suggested point is about 0.6, which is well within range.
           
           For imaging, the existing `#o3 = (1.0, 0.5)` for `v12` seems fine. I'm imaging rocks `v17` and `v18`. After distance calculations, that point is within range for observing both targets. I am far enough away from other objects, too. The rovers are also separate, so `(1.0, 0.5)` for `v12` is reasonable.
           
           The plan structure stays the same, I am just updating my coordinate system.
           
           Let's check the `#o5` for the rock sampling. It needs to work for both `v3` and `v8`, and the rover `v14`. I'm going to try `(-0.7, -0.6)` for the rover. Distance checks show this should be easily reachable.
           The important thing about this selection is I need the *rover's base* to not collide with the rocks. So I need to ensure that the rover at `#o5` doesn't overlap those AABBs. My estimate has me offset from the objects, leaving room for the rover to operate. With assumptions about rover size, this should work.
           
           Finally, I need to check all these values for collisions to make sure they are valid. The lander point is not a collision. The imaging value isn't, either. I need to make sure the robot base doesn't collide with the target sample, so I did those calculations too, and they're good.
           
           The plan logic itself is good, I just need to plug in the right numbers and make sure they don't cause any collisions. The new values are:
           
           *   `#o3` for imaging with `v12`: `(1.0, 0.5)`
           *   `#o0` for communication with `v9` (for both rovers): `(-1.3, -2.0)`
           *   `#o5` for sampling `v3` and `v8` with `v14`: `(-0.7, -0.6)`

(Thoughts: **Plan Revision: Addressing Continuous Parameter Issues**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain again.  The previous plan failed because of those nasty continuous configurations – `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.  It looks like I need to revisit those and come up with new values that actually work.
           
           First, let's remember the goal: We need to ensure that the rovers are at the right places to fulfill the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The rovers need to be able to communicate with the lander and take images of certain objects and get their analyses. Specifically, this requires rovers `v12` and `v14` in particular locations, for both their movement and the subsequent communication.
           
           I've got a detailed breakdown of all the current object locations, which helps. Let's start with `#o0`, the communication-visible configuration for both rovers to reach the lander (`v9`). The previous value was a bust because it was inside the lander's bounding box.  So, I need something *outside* that box. I'm thinking a point just beyond the lander's edge, maybe at `(-2.7, -2.0)`. That should put it within communication range. I did the math, and both rovers can reach that spot within a comm range. Excellent!
           
           Next is `#o3`, the image-visible configuration for rover `v12` to observe the objectives (`v17` and `v18`). The previous choice didn't work, so I need to find a new spot.  It seems to be an optimal strategy, because I need to find a place that can get a clear line of sight. I will choose `(1.5, 1.5)`. The distance checks out, and it's within range for those objectives.
           
           Finally, `#o5`, which is a "above" configuration for rover `v14` to take the sample. It didn't work last time. I need a new location that allows for good sampling and line of sight.  Based on the problem I'm trying a `(-0.75, -0.5)`, which seems like a good spot. I made sure to check the distance. The math holds.
           
           So, to summarize:
           *   `#o0`:  `(-2.7, -2.0)`
           *   `#o3`:  `(1.5, 1.5)`
           *   `#o5`: `(-0.75, -0.5)`
           
           With these new configurations set, I can revisit the plan logic. I will now just replace these continuous values.
           1. `move` the rovers to these new positions.
           2. The calibration and imaging and sampling steps will be the same.
           3. Then to send analysis.
           4. Return to the starting state.
           
           This should handle the failure cases by fixing the continuous parameters. I'm confident that this revised plan will work and satisfy the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`.

(Thoughts: **Revising Continuous Configuration Coordinates**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new set of collision and reachability errors for those continuous configurations I chose earlier. Time to re-evaluate and find better coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. I'm going to carefully go through each problematic setup and adjust accordingly.
           
           First, let's tackle `#o3` for `v12`, when it's supposed to be viewing `v17` and `v18`. My original `(1.5, 1.5)` led to a collision with `v19`. I need to get further away from `v19` while maintaining a good view of those two targets.  Thinking it over, a position like `(1.0, 1.0)` seems promising. It's further away from that collision point and still offers a good line of sight to both `v17` and `v18`. I'll quickly check reachability, calculating the distances from `(1.0, 1.0)` to both `v17` and `v18`, to make sure my robot can reach these. It looks like my choice is good.
           
           Next, I need to address `#o0` for `v12` and `v14`, which is used for communicating with the lander `v9`. My previous position `(-2.7, -2.0)` was causing a collision with a wall, `v20`. So, I'll move to the right, to the other side of that barrier. Since I need to communicate, I'll place my robot within 4 units of `v9`. I'm trying `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This position gets me clear of the collision and puts me close enough to `v9` for communication. It seems I am within range and no collision should occur.
           
           Finally, I'll adjust `#o5` for `v14`, when it's sampling rocks `v3` and `v8`. The problem here was that my original `(-0.75, -0.5)` wasn't reachable. I'm going to choose `(-0.7, -1.0)`. This new position still seems to keep the rover "above" the rocks as required in the state, but it is also closer to the robot's initial position and should be reachable. I'll need to check the reachability. I am also making sure I'm not directly colliding with any obstacles with the rover base.
           
           So, I'll update my plan with these new coordinates. The plan itself should be robust with the new parameters. I have to double-check my updated coordinates against all constraints and make sure everything is collision-free and reachable. I think with these changes I'm in good shape.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Configuration Parameters**
           
           Okay, I've got a fresh set of failed configurations, which means the previously suggested poses weren't cutting it. I need to re-evaluate the continuous parameters for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` while keeping the plan structure. 
           
           Let's break down the issues with each configuration:
           
           1.  **Imaging Poses for Rover v12:** The goal is for `v12` to get a good line of sight to `v17` and `v18`. I've gotta find a position that's reachable, collision-free (especially around `v19` at (1.59, 1.46) to (1.73, 1.60)), and within a 2-meter distance to those targets. My initial thought was to place v12 at (1.0, 1.0) but now I'm leaning towards an approach that has v12 closer to the line of sight but away from obstacles. The goal is to optimize the `y` value to ensure LOS. Let's try `(1.0, 1.8)`. It seems reachable and clear of v19's AABB. `v17` and `v18` will be within range.
           
           2.  **Communication Poses for v12 and v14:** Both robots need to communicate with the lander (`v9`) at a distance less than 4 meters, and, of course, avoid collisions. The obstacle, `v20`, is a wall at x = -2.5. We should pick a spot that's reachable by each robot. The previous location, (-1.0, -2.0) had a collision issue with v20 and reachability issues. I'll test `-2.0`, since v9 is in that area. I need to pick a spot that's well within the range of both v12 and v14, which are at (1.0, -1.75) and (-1.0, -1.75), respectively. I'll pick a spot which will have an X-value to avoid the v20, perhaps `(-2.0, -1.8)`.
           
           3.  **Sampling Pose for v14:**  This needs `v14` to get *above* the rocks `v3` and `v8`, starting at (-1.0, -1.75). The last attempt at (-0.7, -1.0) didn't work. Reachability must be the problem. However, the exact reason is still uncertain, but I am assuming the y coordinate range of the robot's movement is constrained. The rocks are pretty close to its starting position, but if they are "above," and if the action to sample requires that above condition. Let's try `(-0.8, -0.6)`.
           
           I'll proceed to test the validity of the plan with these new configurations.

(Thoughts: **Refining Configurations for Rover Tasks**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: the previous configurations failed, so I need to go back and reassess the continuous parameters, specifically for `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. The primary concerns are reachability, collision avoidance, and ensuring the robot meets visibility or 'above' conditions.
           
           Let's break it down: the objective is for two rovers (`v12`, `v14`) to complete their tasks: imaging targets (`v17`, `v18`), analyzing rock samples (`v3`, `v8`), and communicating with the lander (`v9`). The problem is that the previously proposed poses are not working.
           
           First, I need to find a suitable imaging pose, `#o3`, for `v12`. It requires the rover to image both objectives, but last time I didn't get reachability. I'll aim for a position where the rover is close enough to its starting position, while also being high enough to see. The obstacles here are obstacle `v19`. I'm going to try `(0.7, 1.5)`. This pose seems to satisfy the imaging range requirement, avoid collisions with `v19`, and the path distance is reasonable.
           
           Next, I need a communication pose, `#o0`, for both rovers to connect with the lander. The previous attempt, `(-2.0, -1.8)`, resulted in a collision. I need to get further from the lander, and the obstacle to the left, but still be within communication range. I'm going to try `(-0.5, -2.0)`. It should meet communication distance and, by my calculations, collision avoidance. The path to this position from the proposed imaging pose seems feasible.
           
           Finally, I need to determine a sampling pose, `#o5`, for `v14` to collect samples from the rock targets. `(-0.8, -0.6)` failed reachability before. Therefore, I will try a pose close to the rock, around `(-0.8, -0.5)`. This is a better location to obtain those rock samples, and the calculation seems accurate.
           
           I've checked all these proposed changes to make sure reachability is not an issue, and collision avoidance is satisfied. The new configurations are:
           
           *   `#o3`: `(0.7, 1.5)`
           *   `#o0`: `(-0.5, -2.0)`
           *   `#o5`: `(-0.8, -0.5)`
           
           The logic of the plan flow should remain the same. The estimated path calculations seem reasonable. These configurations seem to be better geometrically, and it looks like a potential solution that can get this mission to the final stage.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Rovers Domain Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my updated thinking on this planning problem, having re-evaluated the configurations and constraints:
           
           I've been tasked with generating a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` domain. The initial attempt failed because the proposed configurations were not reachable or collided with obstacles.  I need to find new configurations for the rovers.
           
           I've identified these subgoals that must be met:
           
           *   **Both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, need to reach specific configurations** (`v13`, `v15`, and the intermediate ones).
           *   **Both rovers must have stores that are free to use.**
           *   **We need to receive images of objectives `v17` and `v18` in mode `v11`.**
           *   **We need to receive analysis of a stone (type `v2`) and soil (type `v6`).**
           
           The key problem is that the previous configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` were problematic due to reachability or collisions. I need to find new valid and feasible continuous parameter assignments. Let's see what is needed:
           
           *   The goal is to image the two objectives and then transmit the images.
           *   The second rover, `v14`, must sample soil and transmit the results.
           *   The starting positions for the rovers are `v12` starts at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75, 3.142)` and `v14` at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`.

           *   There's an obstacle `v19` at `((1.59, 1.46), (1.73, 1.60))` and a wall `v20` at `((-2.55, -2.55), (-2.45, 2.55))`.
           
           I have the following constraints:
           
           *   `#o3` (imaging) must be within 2 units of the target and collision-free, also reachable.
           *   `#o0` (comms) must be within 4 units of the lander and collision-free, also reachable.

           2.  **Communication Configuration (`#o0`):**
               *   The lander is an issue.  I should be close, and the wall should be avoided. The previous attempt, `(-0.5, -2.0)`, was a failure. The rover `v12`, now located at  `(1.0, 1.0)` needs to be in range to the lander `v9` but outside the bounds of `v20`. `(0.0, -2.0)` should be in range and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **My Revised Planning Strategy**
           
           Okay, based on the failed configurations, I need to generate a new plan that accounts for the obstacles and constraints. The previous attempts placed `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` in problematic locations.
           
           **Objective:** The goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, requiring both rovers to be at their designated configurations, imaging and analyzing rocks/soil.
           
           **Current Situation:** I have rovers `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, with the store `v16` available. Camera `v10` is onboard. I need to image `v17` and `v18`, and analyze `v3` (stone) and `v8` (soil). The lander `v9` is crucial for communication, and there are obstacles `v19` and `v21` that need to be avoided. `imagevisible` and `comvisible` constraints apply.
           
           **My Analysis and Revised Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Imaging (`#o3`):**
               *   Rover `v12` needs to image `v17` and `v18`.
               *   I've tried `(0.5, 1.8)` as a potential location for `#o3`.
               *   This point is within the communication and image visibility radius, and the coordinates are within reach of my initial location, (1.0, -1.75). The obstacle `v19` is avoided.
           
           2.  **Sampling (`#o5`):**
               *   Rover `v14` needs to sample `v3` and `v8`.
               *   I'll try `(-0.75, -0.7)` as a configuration.
               *   I am reasonably confident I can meet these conditions, since it is above both `v3` and `v8`, and should be reachable.
           
           3.  **Communication (`#o0`):**
               *   Both rovers need to communicate with the lander `v9`.
               *   `(-1.0, -2.5)` is my new candidate for `#o0`.
               *   This location allows for communication and is within 4 units of the lander. The new location is also a safe location outside of the obstacle.
           
           **Finalized Plan:**
           *   `#o3` (imaging): `(0.5, 1.8)`
           *   `#o5` (sampling): `(-0.75, -0.7)`
           *   `#o0` (communication): `(-1.0, -2.5)`
           
           The logic of the plan sequence still applies, but now with updated configurations. I can now finalize the action calls. The critical point is now that I have the path planning algorithm for movement.

Model:     **My Revised Planning Strategy**
           
           Okay, based on the failed configurations, I need to generate a new plan that accounts for the obstacles and constraints. The previous attempts placed `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5` in problematic locations.
           
           **Objective:** The goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, requiring both rovers to be at their designated configurations, imaging and analyzing rocks/soil.
           
           **Current Situation:** I have rovers `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, with the store `v16` available. Camera `v10` is onboard. I need to image `v17` and `v18`, and analyze `v3` (stone) and `v8` (soil). The lander `v9` is crucial for communication, and there are obstacles `v19` and `v21` that need to be avoided. `imagevisible` and `comvisible` constraints apply.
           
           **My Analysis and Revised Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Imaging (`#o3`):**
               *   Rover `v12` needs to image `v17` and `v18`.
               *   I've tried `(0.5, 1.8)` as a potential location for `#o3`.
               *   This point is within the communication and image visibility radius, and the coordinates are within reach of my initial location, (1.0, -1.75). The obstacle `v19` is avoided.
           
           2.  **Sampling (`#o5`):**
               *   Rover `v14` needs to sample `v3` and `v8`.
               *   I'll try `(-0.75, -0.7)` as a configuration.
               *   I am reasonably confident I can meet these conditions, since it is above both `v3` and `v8`, and should be reachable.
           
           3.  **Communication (`#o0`):**
               *   Both rovers need to communicate with the lander `v9`.
               *   `(-1.0, -2.5)` is my new candidate for `#o0`.
               *   This location allows for communication and is within 4 units of the lander. The new location is also a safe location outside of the obstacle.
           
           **Finalized Plan:**
           *   `#o3` (imaging): `(0.5, 1.8)`
           *   `#o5` (sampling): `(-0.75, -0.7)`
           *   `#o0` (communication): `(-1.0, -2.5)`
           
           The logic of the plan sequence still applies, but now with updated configurations. I can now finalize the action calls. The critical point is now that I have the path planning algorithm for movement.
