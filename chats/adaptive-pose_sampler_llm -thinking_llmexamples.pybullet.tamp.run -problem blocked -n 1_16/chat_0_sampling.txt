(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a square with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, on Surface 0, which is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object's world-aligned bounding box, after rotation, fits completely within Surface 0.
           
           To determine stable positions, I need to account for rotation.  When a square rotates, the size of its world-aligned bounding box changes depending on the rotation angle.  This is calculated as `effective_size_x = abs(size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(size_y * sin(theta))` and `effective_size_y = abs(size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(size_y * cos(theta))`. Since it's a square, I simplify this to `effective_size = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The effective_size varies from 0.07 at 0 and pi/2 to a maximum of approximately 0.098994 at pi/4, accounting for the effect of rotation.
           
           Surface 0 has the boundaries: lower_x = 4.2, lower_y = -0.6, upper_x = 4.8, upper_y = 0.0. After doing so, I will ensure that the object's center point fulfills these conditions:
           `surface_lower_x + effective_size / 2 <= x <= surface_upper_x - effective_size / 2`
           `surface_lower_y + effective_size / 2 <= y <= surface_upper_y - effective_size / 2`
           
           I devised a strategy: first choose ten distinct angles.  Then, for each angle, calculate its corresponding effective bounding box size. Then I determine valid ranges for x and y center positions using:
           `x_center_min = surface_lower_x + effective_size / 2`
           `x_center_max = surface_upper_x - effective_size / 2`
           `y_center_min = surface_lower_y + effective_size / 2`
           `y_center_max = surface_upper_y - effective_size / 2`
           
           Using 10 distinct orientations ensures rotational diversity, even though the same effective bounding box size may repeat. Within a valid region, 5 x center values are chosen as well as a y-center value, resulting in 50 distinct positions and orientations. This is guaranteed to generate an evenly distributed set of stable placements, respecting the surface constraints and the object's shape and size.

(Thoughts: **Generating Candidate Placements for Object 10**
           
           Okay, so I've got the feedback about placing object 5 successfully. Now, I need to figure out where to put object 10 on surface 0, and importantly, it can't collide with object 5.  Object 5 is at (4.235, -0.3) with extents of 0.07 x 0.07. Object 10, a small square, is roughly 0.0889 on each side, which I'll call 'obj10_side'.
           
           My strategy:
           
           1. **Figure out what rotation angles to try** for object 10, considering the object's square nature and potential orientations.
           2. **Calculate valid placement ranges on the surface** (4.2 to 4.8 in x, -0.6 to 0 in y), keeping the rotated size in mind.
           3.  **Generate a set of candidate placements** in a reasonable pattern.
           4.  **Carefully check** each candidate for collision with object 5.
           
           Let's begin. Object 10's dimensions will vary based on rotation (0, pi/4, pi/2, etc.). For each angle, I will need to determine how the object's AABB extends. I will treat it as square, with some rounding. I'll need to figure out the effective half-size of the rotated square.
           
           Because the object 10 AABB dimensions are very close, I'm approximating it as a square, which means that the most extreme positions of the object will occur at 0 or 45 degrees. I calculate that a rotation of object 10 would lead to the half-size of (side/2)*(abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) - in other words, that would be 0.044465 or 0.06288 for 0 and 45 degree rotations respectively.
           
           To do the collision checking, I need the AABBs.
           
           Object 5's AABB is easy, it's ((4.2, -0.335), (4.27, -0.265)).  The Y coordinates of that object are most important since the previous object's y coordinate is in that range.
           
           When checking for collisions, I'll compare the X and Y dimensions using AABB principles. If the Y ranges overlap, I must avoid x range overlap.  If the X and Y ranges don't collide, I'm safe.
           
           For the object 10 rotation, I'll take 5 x coordinates between obj5's x and the end. I can do the placement for each of my selected 10 angles.
           
           I then check, for y=-0.3, the x position such that obj10 does not have a collision.
           Then, I generate candidates for each angle and collision checks.
