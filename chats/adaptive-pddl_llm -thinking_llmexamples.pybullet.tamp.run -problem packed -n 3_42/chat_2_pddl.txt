(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got: My objective is to get three objects—v8, v12, and v14—all "on" v16.  This means they all need to be at a specific pose supported by v16.  Currently, they're each sitting on v11 at poses v9, v13, and v15, respectively.
           
           I've got the standard robot setup:  an arm (v4) that's controllable and two arms, both "handempty".  I have these actions: move\_base, pick, and place.  I'll be using action `v4`. Both `pick` and `place` seem to share the same base configuration (#o3), and I need to get the base there first.
           
           Now, I look at the available poses and how the robot can get the object onto v16.  The crucial thing here is this *#o2* pose.  It seems that #o2 is the common pose on v16 where I can place v8, v12, and v14.  That’s convenient!
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** First, I need to get the robot base to the right configuration, #o3, using `move_base`. So I will move from my current configuration (v3) to #o3.
           2.  **Pick and Place (Repeat for each object):** For each object (v8, v12, and v14), I’ll need to execute two actions:
               *   **Pick:** Use the `pick` action to grasp the object from its current location.
               *   **Place:** Then, use the `place` action to put the object on v16 at pose #o2.  And since I can place a object using the `place` action, I can place multiple objects at the same spot at the *same pose*.
           3. **Collision Concerns:**  I assume that because the facts `supported(o, #o2, v16)` exist for all objects, and that I'm given the *#o2* for place, all the safety features for not colliding objects when placing at  #o2 are implicitly and already taken care of.
           
           The key is that `#o2` must work for all three objects.  Otherwise, I'm stuck. All I have to do is place them each one by one to achieve my goal.
           
           I'll proceed with this plan, assuming those #o2 poses are compatible and everything else looks good with my initial state!
