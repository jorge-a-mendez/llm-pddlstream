           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting objects v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16.  Essentially, they need to be supported by and at a pose *on* v16.  I quickly establish that currently, all three are supported by v11, which means they're on v11, not v16. Makes sense. I need to move them.
           
           My first thought is, "Okay, pick up, move, and place."  I'm looking for *pick* and *place* actions to change the `atpose` facts, and thus the `on` facts.  But I immediately hit a wall.  I'm explicitly told I can *only* use the action instances provided. The only instance I've got is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That doesn't move any *objects*.  It's just the robot base moving between identical positions.  Pretty useless here.
           
           I review the actions. *Clean* and *Cook* aren't even relevant to this "stacking" goal. I double check the action requirements, especially those for `pick` and `place`. These actions need pre conditions that are impossible to satify.
           
           Now, I start to check the *initial state* again to make sure I don't miss something. I can see that each object *could* be on v16 at a *different* pose (e.g., v8 might be *supported* by v16 at #o2), but the initial state *facts* are:  `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `atpose(v14, v15)`.  This just means that the objects, initially, are on v11, not v16.
           
           To satisfy my goal, I need the `atpose` facts to reflect that these objects are at a pose on v16.  That would mean using `place`. But there is no way to do that. And no way to pick them up from the table.
           
           Conclusion:  Since I can't pick up and place the objects using the provided action set (i.e., just the pointless robot move), the goal is simply unreachable. I'm at an impasse. No plan exists to get these objects on v16 given these constraints.
