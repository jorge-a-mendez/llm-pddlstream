(Thoughts: **Understanding the Placement Problem**
           
           The goal is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 7, side length `0.0947`) on a square surface (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). A placement is defined by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and the object's center coordinates (x, y). Stability means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) after rotation must fully fit within the surface's AABB.
           
           **Geometric Considerations**
           
           The key lies in understanding how the square object's AABB changes with rotation. Since the object is a square, its rotated AABB is also a square, but its size changes.  The side length of this new square depends on theta. I've formulated the calculations to understand this.  The critical value here is `half_side_rotated = 0.5 * S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value ranges from half the original side length (when the square is aligned with the axes) to `S * sqrt(2) / 2` (when rotated by 45 degrees).
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           To generate the placements, I'll exploit the symmetry of the square and its bounding box.  I'll vary the rotation angle, theta, from 0 to pi/2 (this covers all possible configurations).  For each value of theta, I will place the object's center along the central y axis of the surface. To do so, I will calculate the maximum allowed `valid_coord_limit` based on `half_side_rotated`. From here, I will choose 5 positions, equally-spaced along the y axis to give diverse placements. This 10 rotations and 5 placement positions ensures the placement of 50 objects.

(Thoughts: **Generating Placements for Object 5, Avoiding Object 7**
           
           My task is to strategically place object 5, a square, on surface 0 while ensuring it doesn't collide with object 7, which is already successfully placed. Object 7's placement is known, and I've calculated its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) to define the occupied region on the surface.
           
           To place object 5, I'll consider various rotations (theta) and potential (x, y) coordinates on surface 0. My main strategy will involve generating candidate positions within a valid range, considering surface limits and object 7's AABB. I'll thoroughly check for collision with the existing AABB of object 7 and reject placements that cause an overlap.
           
           I'm applying an approach that generates a fine-grained 5x5 grid of (x,y) locations within the allowable area on the surface for each of the 10 rotations. This provides 250 candidate placements.
           These candidates are analyzed using AABB to determine if they collide with object 7, and the placements that do not collide are added to a list.  The first 50 valid placements in that list will be the ones I will select.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding Stable Positions**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on a surface (surface 0). The surface's boundaries are defined as `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`. However, I need to account for two other objects that are already placed:
           *   **Object 7 (ID 7):** Size `S_7 = 0.09474` at position `(0.0, 0.0, -0.0876)`.
           *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** Size `S_5 = 0.08979` at position `(-0.090, 0.0, 0.045)`.
           
           First, I calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for these placed objects:
           *   **AABB_7:** `[(-0.047, -0.135), (0.047, -0.040)]`
           *   **AABB_5:** `[(-0.135, 0.00015), (-0.045, 0.0899)]`
           
           The new object (ID 4) is a square with side length `S_4 = 0.09434`.
           
           For each potential placement `(surf_idx=0, theta, x, y)` of object 4, I will perform the following steps to check for stability and collision:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculation:** Calculate the rotated bounding box's half-side length, and from that, the `AABB_4` for object 4.
           2.  **Surface Stability Check:** Ensure the object remains within surface boundaries.
           3.  **Collision Check (against Object 7):** Determine if `AABB_4` overlaps with `AABB_7`. If it does, discard that placement.
           4.  **Collision Check (against Object 5):** Determine if `AABB_4` overlaps with `AABB_5`. If it does, discard that placement.
           
           The strategy involves testing different rotations (`theta`) and positions (`x`, `y`). I will iterate through 10 evenly-spaced rotation angles (0 to pi/2 radians), and at each angle, I will generate a grid of positions within surface 0. For each `theta`, I'll calculate how far I can go from the center to stay within the surface limits (and account for the object's rotation).
           
           For each valid `theta`, I create a grid of positions. The number of positions in each x and y direction will be five. Thus, for each angle, 25 points are tested.
           
           My goal is to find the first 50 placements that satisfy both stability and collision checks.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing object ID 6, a square with a side length of approximately 0.08, on surface 0. My goal: find 50 stable positions without any collisions. The surface itself is a simple rectangle, defined by an AABB (axis-aligned bounding box).
           
           **Understanding the Constraints:**
           
           First, I need to account for the space limitations. The object's center must be within a valid area determined by the surface's dimensions and the object's size. Specifically, the object's effective 'radius', accounting for its possible rotation, must be subtracted from the surface's boundaries.
           
           **Collision Avoidance:**
           
           The real challenge is avoiding collisions with three previously placed objects (IDs 7, 5, and 4), all of which are also squares. To do this, I'm using a common technique: AABB intersection checks.
           
           *   **AABB Calculation:** I pre-calculated the AABBs for each of the obstacle objects based on their placement and dimensions.
           *   **AABB-based Intersection:** For each potential placement of object 6, I calculate its AABB. Then, I check if this AABB overlaps with any of the obstacle AABBs using a simple intersection test.
           *   **Rotation:** I'm considering different rotations for object 6, using a series of angles distributed evenly across the full rotation space. The rotated half-side is then calculated, using the appropriate trigonometric functions to consider the shape of the bounding box.
           
           **Placement Algorithm:**
           
           1.  **Angle Iteration:** I'll loop through a set of predefined angles, generating distinct half_S6_rot values for each iteration.
           2.  **Valid Position Calculation:** For each angle, I calculate the maximum valid object center positions within the surface boundaries.
           3.  **Grid-based Positioning:** Within this valid area, I use a grid-based approach. I will consider an evenly spaced grid. I can use a similar approach to the previous projects.
           4.  **Collision Check (Intersection Testing):** For each grid point, I check for potential collisions with existing objects by calculating the bounding box and testing if it overlaps with any of the pre-calculated obstacle bounding boxes.
           5.  **Placement Selection:** Valid placements are added to the list, and the algorithm terminates once the list is filled to 50 elements.
           
           **Enhancements:**
           
           If I can't find 50 valid placements with the initial grid, I can refine the grid spacing or explore different strategies for angle sampling. Given the simplicity of the geometry, a 5x5 grid with some rotation angles will work fine. I'll test the output!
