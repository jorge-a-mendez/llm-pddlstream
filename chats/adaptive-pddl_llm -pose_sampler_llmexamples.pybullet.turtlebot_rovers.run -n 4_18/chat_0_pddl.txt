User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by four walls: x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. Many smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the scene. My strategy is to select points that are within range of the target point and try to avoid being too close to the known obstacles. I will prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.5)
           (1.0 1.5)
           (0.5 0.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:
           
           ```
           Target point: (0.29827335476875305, 2.108670711517334, 0.20100000500679016), Proposed position: (1.5, 0.5) -- no line of sight to target

My strategy is to select points that are within range of the target point and try to avoid being too close to the known obstacles. The previous attempt failed because (1.5, 0.5) did not have line-of-sight to the target (0.29, 2.10). This indicates there's an obstacle between them. Given the central wall at x=0, and the target's high y-value, positions with positive x and lower y are more likely to be occluded. I will try positions closer to the target and potentially on the other side of the central wall.
