           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are not in collision with these fixed obstacles and are within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize positions that offer a clear line of sight to the target and try to diversify them as much as possible, for example, by picking positions at different angles and distances from the target.
           
           Given the target point (-0.54224021 0.45781612), I will attempt to place the robot in various locations around it. The max range is 2.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was (-2.0792315006256104, 2.0813159942626953).
           The position (0.5, -0.5) collided with obstacle 18: ((0.6659923727846349, -0.5218746428155696), (0.7737398211622035, -0.41412719443800095)). This is a small obstacle in the positive x, negative y quadrant.
           The positions (-0.5, -1.0) and (-1.5, 0.5) had no line of sight to the target. The target is in the upper-left quadrant. This suggests there might be obstacles between these proposed points and the target. Specifically, the central wall at x=0 might be occluding. Also, there are obstacles 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, 20 in the vicinity of the target.
           Given the new target point (-0.54224021 0.45781612), which is in the upper-left quadrant, I will try to find positions nearby. I need to be careful of the central wall at x=0 and other obstacles.

Model:     The previous target points were (-2.0792315006256104, 2.0813159942626953) and (-0.3034225106239319, 2.0652644634246826). The current target point is still (-0.54224021 0.45781612).
           
           It seems that the target point for the last request was actually (-0.3034225106239319, 2.0652644634246826), which is in the upper left quadrant. All my proposed positions for this target had no line of sight. This indicates that there are significant occlusions when trying to view a target in the upper part of the environment from lower positions or positions further to the left. The central wall (obstacle 5) at x=0 is a major factor. Obstacles 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, 20 are also in that region.
           
           Given the current target point (-0.54224021 0.45781612), which is in the upper-left quadrant, I need to be more careful. Since previous attempts to place the robot further away or to the "left" (more negative X) did not work, I will try to place the robot closer to the target and potentially to its right, making sure to avoid the central wall and known obstacles. I will also try different angles around the target.

           The target for the previous feedback was (-2.0792315006256104, 2.0813159942626953). My proposed position (-0.5, 2.0) collided with obstacle 10 and 20. Obstacle 10 is ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and obstacle 20 is ((-0.34102219604037226, 2.0276647780082424), (-0.2658228252074915, 2.102864148841123)). These are both in the upper-left quadrant and close to the top wall. This confirms that the upper-left area is quite cluttered.
           
           The current target is (-0.54224021 0.45781612), which is in the upper-left quadrant, but further down and to the right than the previous target points.
           Given the failures, I need to be very careful. My attempts to place the robot closer to the target (like (-0.5, 2.0)) have resulted in collisions with existing small obstacles. Attempts to place the robot further to the left or lower have resulted in occlusions.
           I will try to place the robot in the corridor between x = -2.5 and x = 0, avoiding the vertical wall at x = 0 and staying within the max_range of 2. I need to be mindful of obstacles 6, 8, 11, 15 in this area. I will also try positions that are somewhat to the right of the target, but still to the left of x=0.
