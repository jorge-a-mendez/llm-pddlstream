           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment, many of which appear to be concentrated in the upper-right, upper-left, and lower-middle regions. Given the target point is (-0.2, 0.5), I need to find positions within a circle of radius 2 centered at this point. I will try to find diverse positions that are not too close to the obstacles, and I will try to stay away from the central wall at x=0 if possible, to allow for a better line of sight to the target.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.2 0.5)
           (-0.2 2.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (2.0588, 1.9946) were not successful. The position (-1.2, 0.5) failed due to no line of sight, likely because of the central wall at x=0. The position (-0.2, 2.0) collided with several obstacles, including the central wall and some smaller boxes in the upper-left quadrant. The position (1.0, 0.5) was not tested with the previous target point.
           
           For the new request, the target point is (2.0588, 1.9946). This point is in the upper right quadrant. I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point, so x should be within roughly [0.0588, 4.0588] and y within [-0.0054, 3.9946]. However, the x and y limits are [-2.5, 2.5]. I will focus on the area around the target, avoiding the known obstacles and the central x=0 wall. I will try to place the robot to the right of the central wall, and below the target to avoid many of the obstacles in the upper-right area.

Model:     I see that for the previous target (2.0588, 1.9946), my proposed positions (-1.2, 0.5) and (-0.2, 2.0) were incorrect. Also, for the target (-0.3246, 2.0332), the position (1.0, 0.5) had no line of sight, likely due to the central wall. This confirms that crossing the central wall at x=0 is generally a bad idea for line of sight.
           
           The new target point is (2.0588364601135254, 1.9946517944335938). This is in the upper-right quadrant. I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point, so approximately x in [0.05, 2.5] (due to scene limits) and y in [-0.005, 2.5] (due to scene limits). I will aim for positions relatively close to the target, but slightly offset to avoid existing obstacles. I'll focus on the area to the right of the central wall (x > 0). I will also try to stay below obstacles 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 22 and near the target.

Model:     It's clear from the previous failures that attempting to view a target on one side of the central x=0 wall from the other side is not viable due to the "no line of sight" errors. The new target point is (-0.3246912956237793, 2.0332179069519043). This point is in the upper-left quadrant, just to the left of the central wall. I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this target. This means x can be between roughly -2.3246 and 1.6753, and y between 0.0332 and 4.0332. Considering the scene limits, x is between -2.5 and 1.6753, and y is between 0.0332 and 2.5. I must also avoid the obstacles in the upper-left, such as obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), obstacle 10 ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), obstacle 16 ((-1.56, 1.36), (-1.42, 1.5)), obstacle 18 ((-0.38, 1.44), (-0.28, 1.55)), obstacle 19 ((-0.37, 1.98), (-0.27, 2.08)), and obstacle 21 ((-2.09, 1.79), (-1.99, 1.89)).
           
           I will attempt positions to the left of the central wall (x < 0). I need to be careful with the cluster of obstacles near the target point.

Model:     My attempts for target (-0.3246, 2.0332) were not tested in the previous run. Now I have a new target: (-2.0421361923217773, 1.8470276594161987). This target is in the upper-left corner of the environment, near obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and 21 ((-2.09, 1.79), (-1.99, 1.89)).
           
           I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this target point. This means x is roughly between -4.0421 and -0.0421, and y between -0.1529 and 3.8470. Considering the scene limits, x is between -2.5 and -0.0421, and y between -0.1529 and 2.5. I should aim for positions to the left of the central wall at x=0, and keep in mind the obstacles in the upper-left region. I'll try to position the robot slightly below or to the left of the target to avoid obstacles 8 and 21.
