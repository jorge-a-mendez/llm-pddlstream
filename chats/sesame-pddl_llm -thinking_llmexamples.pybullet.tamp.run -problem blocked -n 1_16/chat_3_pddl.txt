           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom canmove()
           Atom arm(v4)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base #o3 #o3 #o0))
           ((pick v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v15 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((pick v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ((place v4 v15 v16 #o1 #o3 #o4))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Goal Unreachable Due to Unmet Precondition**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having `v12` `on` `v18` and `type(v12, v17)`. Luckily, the initial state gives us `type(v12, v17)`. Now, I just need to get `v12` `on` `v18`. I see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, meaning `#o2` is a suitable pose. So, I need to get `v12` to `atpose(#o2)`. Currently, it's at `atpose(v12, v13)`.
           
           To move `v12`, I'd need to use a `pick` and a `place` action.  I see available actions, `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4` and `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. But here's the problem: both `pick` and `place` require `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition.  This means the robot's base configuration must be at `#o3`. However, `atbconf(#o3)` is *not* present in the initial state. In fact, no `atbconf` predicate is true for any configuration in the initial state.
           
           The only way to achieve `atbconf` is through a `move_base` action. But, the `move_base` action requires that the base be *already* at some configuration, `atbconf(?q1)`, to *move* to another, `atbconf(?q2)`. Since no `atbconf` facts are in the initial state, there's *no* way to satisfy the `move_base` action. Since the `move_base` is needed to enable `pick` and `place`, and it can't be executed, I conclude that it's *impossible* to move `v12` and, therefore, the goal `on(v12, v18)` and `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given initial state and action set. The robot's base configuration cannot be moved to a configuration that satisfies the pick and place actions, and therefore, the entire plan fails.
