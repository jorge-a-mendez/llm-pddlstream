           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to achieve several conditions to satisfy it.  Specifically, I need to get images of three objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) and send them, and I need to analyze rocks and soil (specifically rocks of type `v2` and soil of type `v6`) and send those analyses.
           
           I started by looking at the initial state and how I can achieve those goals. I know the rovers (`v12`, `v14`), the cameras (`v10`), the store (`v16`), and the various objects (rocks, soil, objectives, lander, and mode).  But then I focused on the *available* actions.  
           
           Crucially, the prompt states that I can *only* use the actions in the provided list.  And that list is extremely limited, just `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions directly contributes to taking images, analyzing samples, or sending them.
           
           Looking deeper, I identified the actions I *need*: `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`.  These are missing from the action list.  `drop_rock` also requires `full(rover, store)` which is false in the initial state. The `move` actions are basically no-ops because they keep the rovers at the same configuration.
           
           Given the rigid constraint that only provided actions are allowed, I'm forced to conclude that this goal is **unreachable**.  Without the necessary actions to collect data and send it, I cannot fulfill the conditions of `new-axiom@0()`.  The actions I *can* use don't contribute to achieving the conditions.  The prompt explicitly says that if the goal is unreachable, I shouldn't provide a plan.
