User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has a large central empty space with some smaller obstacles scattered around, especially near the top and bottom edges. There are also boundaries at x and y = +/- 2.5, which are mostly covered by rectangular obstacles (0-4). A long, thin obstacle (5) blocks the view across x=0. There are also a lot of smaller obstacles near the edges of the allowed area (6-22). I will try to place the robot in open areas, generally avoiding the edges and the central x=0 line, to maximize the chances of a clear view. I will prioritize positions that are closer to the target point and try to vary the angle around the target point.

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (0.37738072872161865, 1.869032382965088) failed due to no line of sight. This suggests that there might be an obstacle between the previous proposed positions and the target. The target is in the upper right quadrant (y close to 2), and my previous positions were in the bottom left or left part of the environment, which means the large obstacles like obstacle 5 (x=0) or perhaps obstacles like 6, 14, 16, 17, 18 were blocking the view. The new target point is different, so I will apply the same reasoning as before, focusing on open areas and varying positions around the target, but I will try to stay further away from the x=0 line and the very edges if possible for the new target.

Model:     For the previous target point (-1.9138448238372803, 1.892627239227295), all proposed positions failed. One position collided with obstacle 5 (the vertical bar at x=0), which is understandable given its location. Another collided with obstacle 15, which is a small rectangle in the lower right, again indicating that positions too close to known obstacles are bad. The third failed due to no line of sight.
           
           The new target point is different, but I will incorporate the learning from previous failures. I will be more cautious about the x=0 line and also avoid small obstacles that are clearly defined. I'll still aim for diversity around the target.

Model:     For the previous target point (-0.48301878571510315, 1.8784433603286743), all proposed positions failed due to no line of sight. This target is in the upper-left quadrant (near y=2), and my proposed positions were to its right and lower, in the right half of the environment. This strongly suggests that the central x=0 obstacle (obstacle 5) is a major obstruction, or there are other obstacles (like 9, 10, 19, 21) in the upper region that I need to be more mindful of.
           
           The new target point is different, but I will adjust my strategy. I will try to stay on the same side of the x=0 line as the target point to avoid obstacle 5. I will also try to keep a reasonable distance from other known obstacles and prioritize positions within the "open" areas.
