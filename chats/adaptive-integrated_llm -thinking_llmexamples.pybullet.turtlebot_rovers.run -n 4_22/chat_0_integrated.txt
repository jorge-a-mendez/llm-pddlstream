           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Achieving the Goal: A Breakdown of My Reasoning**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several conditions. My primary focus is to craft a plan that ensures each condition is met. I’ll start by analyzing these conditions and then map out the steps to achieve them.
           
           **Understanding the Target:**
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` demands several tasks. First, I need to obtain `receivedimage` for four specific objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) using mode `v11`. Second, I have to get `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and a soil of type `v6`. Many of these conditions are already true in the initial state.
           
           The key challenges are obtaining the images and analyses. Let's tackle them one by one.
           
           **Getting the Images (Task A):**
           
           The method to get a "receivedimage" is through the "send_image" action. This requires using the "take_image" and "calibrate" action.
           
           **Constraints & Dependencies:**
           *   **Calibration:** The "calibrate" action is the first step.
           *   **Image Visibility:** The "take_image" requires that the object is in view of the rover.
           *   **Communication:** "send_image" demands that a communication channel is open.
           
           Since there are only two `move` actions, I will have to ensure that the rover can still reach `#o3` and `#o0`.  Since I have no `move` actions that actually move the rover, this limits me! The values of `#o3` and `#o0` must match with the rovers initial position.
           
           Since there are no actions for moving to `#o3` or `#o0`, my plan needs to work around that the rovers are static. I can use their initial `conf` location which are `v13` for rover `v12` and `v15` for `v14`.
           
           Here’s the plan:
           
           *   For each objective (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`):
               1.  Calibrate `v12` to `#o3`.
               2.  Take an image of the objective.
               3.  Send the image to the base station using a send image.
           
           *   To accomplish that I need the following configurations for each rover:
               *   `#o0`: To commucate
               *   `#o3`: To take the image.
               *   `#o5`: To obtain the sample and the analysis.
           
           **Handling Analysis (Tasks B & C):**
           
           *   First, I need a 'sample\_rock' action to collect a sample, then the rover will get to analyze that sample. The goal is to obtain `receivedanalysis` for rocks and soil.
           *   The same constraints apply in all cases, I need to make the target `above` for the rover, ensuring communication is available and no objects `blocked` the rover.
           
           So the plan becomes:
           *   For rock of type `v2` (using `v1`):
               1.  Perform `sample_rock(v12, v13, v1, v16)`. Rover should be at `v13`.
               2.  Analyze sample using `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v1)`
           *   For soil of type `v6` (using `v5`):
               1.  Perform `sample_rock(v14, v15, v5, v16)`. Rover should be at `v15`.
               2.  Analyze sample using `send_analysis(v14, v15, #o1, v9, v5)`
           
           **Coordinating the Rovers:**
           
           *   My current plan uses one `v12` to take pictures and collect a rock. Then uses `v14` for soil collection. Each will remain at its respective pose.
           
           **Handling Configuration Details:**
           
           *   I need to provide continuous values for the configurations. These are the locations of the rovers to satisfy the image and analysis preconditions. Since the rovers cannot move, the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for the configurations must be their respective initial locations:
               *   `v13` for rover `v12`.
               *   `v15` for rover `v14`.
           
           **Final Considerations:**
           
           *   **Obstacles:** Fortunately, the initial state doesn’t have any `blocked` conditions

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a major constraint – all the actions I previously considered are invalid because they weren't in the provided list. That's a fundamental oversight on my part. I need to completely re-evaluate my approach, sticking *only* to these very limited allowed actions: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           Let's break down the goal `new-axiom@0()` and see if it's even remotely achievable under these constraints. It expands to a conjunction of atoms, including `atconf` and `free` predicates which are thankfully *True in the initial state*, as well as a bunch of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These latter predicates are where the problem lies.
           
           The `receivedimage` predicates necessitate the `send_image` action, and the `receivedanalysis` predicates need `send_analysis`. However, neither `send_image`, `send_analysis`, nor any of the other high-level actions I'd usually reach for – like `calibrate`, `take_image`, or `sample_rock` – are even *in* this restricted set. The only options are effectively `move` (which does nothing meaningful in this context, since the source and destination are the same) and `drop_rock`.
           
           `Drop_rock` is typically used to clear a storage unit, but the storage units `v16` for both rovers `v12` and `v14` are already `free` in the initial state! So, using `drop_rock` wouldn't change anything relevant to the goal.
           
           In short, given that the crucial actions `send_image` and `send_analysis` are unavailable, I'm absolutely certain that the goal is unattainable with this severely limited action space. The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are simply unachievable. It's a dead end. Time to inform the user of this impasse.

Model:     **Analyzing the Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a major constraint – all the actions I previously considered are invalid because they weren't in the provided list. That's a fundamental oversight on my part. I need to completely re-evaluate my approach, sticking *only* to these very limited allowed actions: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`.
           
           Let's break down the goal `new-axiom@0()` and see if it's even remotely achievable under these constraints. It expands to a conjunction of atoms, including `atconf` and `free` predicates which are thankfully *True in the initial state*, as well as a bunch of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These latter predicates are where the problem lies.
