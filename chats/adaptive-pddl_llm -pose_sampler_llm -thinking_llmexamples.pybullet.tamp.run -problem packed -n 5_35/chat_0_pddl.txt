(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions 0.08906499062980988 x 0.08906499062980988) on a square surface (surface 0) with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Essentially, I'm working with a square inside another square.  The object has to be fully contained within the surface, meaning I need to ensure the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of the rotated object stays within the surface boundaries.
           
           I've got the dimensions down: the object's side is 's' = 0.089... and the surface has side length of 0.27 (0.135 - (-0.135)).  The key is figuring out the impact of rotation (`theta`).  Since it's a square, the effective dimensions change in a predictable way. I defined `effective_half_size = (s/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This simplifies things as the bounds on x,y are the same when using the bounding box.
           
           Let's break it down: for containment, the object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within the boundaries: `surf_min_x + effective_half_size <= x <= surf_max_x - effective_half_size` and the same applies to `y`.
           
           The strategy I'm thinking is this: Generate enough distinct (x,y) locations for a few theta's.
           
           First, I'll calculate the bounds for different rotations.  For `theta = 0`, it's easiest - I just need to move the center slightly in from the surface boundaries by `s/2` which will be 0.0445. If the range to pick x is reduced to `0.135-0.044` which is `0.0905`. For rotation of `pi/4`, it’s `s/2 * sqrt(2) = 0.0629`, and the range is smaller. Since (0,0) is valid in all rotation instances, it is included.
           
           So, I’ll generate a 7x7 grid of x,y coordinates when `theta=0`, which gives me 49 placements. I will space the grid in a range of -0.08 to 0.08.  The last placement will be at (0, 0) with `theta=pi/4`. That is 49 + 1 = 50 placements. That will give me distinct and stable placements.  That should be good to go.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan for placing the new object, considering its stability and avoiding collisions with the existing object:**
           
           First, I need to place 50 instances of object ID 4 on surface 0, and ensure these placements are stable. I have to avoid collisions with the previously placed object, ID 6. Object 6 is a square with its center at (-0.08, -0.08) and side length 0.089065. Its bounding box (AABB) will extend from -0.1245 to -0.0355 in both x and y.
           
           The new object (ID 4) is also almost a square, with dimensions 0.074569 x 0.074569. For simplicity, I will consider it a perfect square with side length 0.074569. Surface 0 is a square area with corners (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). I will first find the valid space available for stable placements of this new object.
           
           I will start by placing the new object with a rotation of 0. For this, I can calculate its half extents and valid placement range. For rotation 0, I can use a grid with points that would provide suitable space for the new objects.
           
           To avoid collision, it is imperative to compute object 4's AABB for different rotations and compare it with object 6's AABB to calculate which position is collision free.
           
           *   **For `theta=0`:** I'll place the new object in a grid, avoiding the space occupied by Object 6.
           *   **For `theta=π/4`:** I'll use the AABB of the rotated object, which is now almost a diamond with half extents `0.052737`. I can place this at the center of the surface, as long as it doesn't collide with object 6.
           
           To calculate collision I will use the established formula that determines whether bounding boxes overlap, to make sure there are no collision for each of the placements.
           
           **Here's the placement strategy:**
           I will generate a grid with spacing of 0.015 centered around the origin, covering from -0.09 to 0.09 in x and y (the valid range for centers is from -0.0977 to 0.0977). This generates 169 points. I will test these grid points for collision and select the first 49 that do not intersect with object 6. The 50th instance I will place at (0.05, 0.05) with rotation `π/4` (45 degrees), which I have already validated as non-colliding.
           
           I've tested the logic with the available code and it seems to work. The number of non-colliding points generated in the grid is 120. I will select the first 49 as placements. After this, I will add the last point.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable positions for this new square object (ID 5) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two existing objects (ID 6 and ID 4) already placed there. Both objects are also squares. Surface 0 is a square with side length 0.27.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. I've got the sizes and positions of the existing objects. I'll start by calculating their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to make collision detection easier.  I know I have to deal with the existing objects' positions.
           
           Next, I have to figure out the valid range of locations for object 5. Because I'm dealing with a square and a flat surface, placing it with zero rotation is my default; I'll figure out what works for rotation later if needed.  I'll calculate the bounds for my new object's center point (x,y) to keep it within the surface, and ensure it's fully contained.  I'll account for both theta=0 and theta=pi/4 rotations of the new object.
           
           Then, the heart of the matter: I have to check for collisions. I'll use a standard AABB collision check.  I'm basically creating a collision detection function to efficiently determine if there is an overlap.
           
           I'm starting by generating a grid of potential (x, y) placements for the new object and its default theta=0 rotation. I'll set up a 12x12 grid to cover the valid space.  
           
           For each point on this grid, I calculate the AABB of the new object (ID 5) at that location and check for collisions with the AABBs of the existing objects (ID 6 and ID 4). If there's no collision, that's a valid placement, and I add it to my list. I do this for each grid location. I plan to use the AABB check with a function called `aabb_overlap`.
           
           If I find 50 of these valid placements from the grid, great! If not, I will then add the final one at the recommended position with rotation, if possible to fill up the required 50 placements. To add some diversity, if that still doesn't get me 50, I'll randomly fill in the remaining spots with additional theta=0 placements. I have an internal function that ensures there are no duplicate placements as well.
           
           I've already tested the logic and checked the calculations, which should give me the 50 stable, collision-free placements that I need. This should give me a very thorough approach, ensuring that all 50 spots are actually available given the location of the existing objects.
