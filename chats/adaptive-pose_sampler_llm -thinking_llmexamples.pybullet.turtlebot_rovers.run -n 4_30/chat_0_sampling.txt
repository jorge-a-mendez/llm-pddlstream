User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through Robot Base Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 25 valid locations for a robot's base, near a target point.  This boils down to a few key constraints:  first, I need to stay within the room's boundaries, which are defined as x and y coordinates between -2.5 and 2.5. Second, the base needs to be within a distance of 4 units from the target. Finally, and this is crucial, the robot can't collide with any of the fixed obstacles already in the room.
           
           To tackle this, I'm thinking of a multi-step approach.  First, I'll generate a bunch of potential candidate points around the target, kind of like throwing a net.  To make sure I get a good variety, I'll use a mix of strategies: first using radial sampling around the target, and then if needed, move to grid sampling across the valid space. Next, I'll filter these potential locations using a few criteria:  are they within the room's limits, are they close enough to the target (within the max_range), and are they *not* colliding with any of the obstacles.
           
           The most challenging part of this is the collision check.  I have a list of all the fixed obstacles represented as AABBs, and I need to check each candidate point against each AABB to make sure there's no overlap.  The obstacles include the room's actual walls, a central vertical divider, and a few smaller objects scattered around. So, I have constructed an `is_point_in_aabb_collision` function for that.
           
           Since the prompt indicates the goal is to *find* the positions and that I should not "give up" the general strategy is to start with radial sampling, using several radii and many angles. I'll increase the radial sampling, and then start with larger grid steps, and move to finer ones to generate more points and *guarantee* at least 25 positions.
           
           Finally, I also have to handle the potential for duplicate points. To ensure unique locations, any two points that have coordinates similar to each other by a small tolerance are the same point (in order to prevent possible issues with rounding and float comparisons).
           
           By combining this geometric reasoning with a robust obstacle-checking system, I can systematically generate 25 collision-free robot base positions.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Refined Collision Detection and Position Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've re-evaluated the feedback and my collision detection logic, and I need to clarify a few things. The core of my approach remains the same: generate 25 unique positions around the target point, making sure they're within the valid bounds and distance constraints, and avoiding collisions with fixed obstacles. However, some refinements are needed, primarily driven by interpreting the feedback effectively.
           
           First, the key point is the feedback about the previous failed position, and it provides specific negative examples. While I've double-checked my point-in-AABB logic, the feedback "collides with" might include other factors, like line-of-sight issues or even an implicit robot body size. I'll take it as a negative constraint and add all *feedback* positions into my set of *known_bad_positions*. It is very possible the feedback gives a binary "collides with" rather than a more nuanced reason for failure.
           
           Second, for the current scenario (target point: (-1.9, -2.0)), I need to consider that the target itself is within obstacle 6. That means positions directly *on* the target are immediately invalid. Since a robot can't be *in* an obstacle, it must be somewhere close by. This requires my position generation strategy to be more robust around obstacles and find valid places from which it can *see* the target.
           
           I will use my existing sampling approach, which combines radial and grid sampling, but with a refined `check_validity` function. I ensure that all the generated positions:
           
           1.  Stay within the global bounds of the scene.
           2.  Are within the maximum distance range from the target.
           3.  Do *not* collide with any known obstacle *or* any `known_bad_positions` given by the feedback.
           
           My collision detection is based on the point-in-AABB method and I will keep a small *epsilon* to handle boundaries. I am confident that is correct, so I will now treat feedback collisions as potentially indirect explanations for the failure and avoid those positions.
           
           I've updated my code to integrate these improvements, increasing robustness and making sure that I deliver a complete set of valid proposed base positions. My priority is finding these base positions, and then, the feedback from the system will let me know if those positions will *see* the target. If my collision check identifies it as being within an obstacle, it will be skipped. Otherwise, they're marked as good candidates.
           
           The goal is to provide a diverse set of potentially good robot base positions, using all the information I have in the best way possible.
