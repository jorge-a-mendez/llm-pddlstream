           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unachievable Due to Limited Rover Mobility**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My goal is `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several atoms.  The initial state satisfies the first few conditions involving `atconf` and `free`.  However, achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` is proving to be a serious problem.  The key issue stems from the rovers' limited movement capabilities.
           
           To achieve `receivedimage`, I need to use the `send_image` action, which requires `haveimage`, obtained via `take_image`. The latter demands the rover be in a specific configuration (`atconf(?v, ?q)`) corresponding to the imaging location. Similarly, to get `receivedanalysis` through `send_analysis`, I need `sample_rock`, which also has a configuration-specific precondition.
           
           Now, the initial state gives me `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`.  However, to perform imaging at location `#o3` or sampling at `#o5`, these rovers need to *be* at those locations. The only move actions available, however, are essentially "do-nothing" actions: `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))` and `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`.  This fundamentally means the rovers are fixed in their initial configurations, unable to reach the configurations needed to complete image capture and analysis.
           
           I've carefully re-examined the `blocked` axiom, which initially seemed like a potential obstacle. However, even with the possibility of being blocked due to the initial rays, the `take_image` and `sample_rock` actions *still* require `atconf` at the target location. This is an absolute deal-breaker. No movement, no actions that lead to the final goal.
           
           Therefore, because the rovers cannot change their configurations, the parts of the goal relating to `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are completely unreachable. Since the overall goal is a conjunction and a single unreachable goal makes it impossible to achieve, the entire `new-axiom@0()` goal is unachievable given the current action instances. I need a plan B with mobile rovers, or I can safely state that I can't achieve that goal.
