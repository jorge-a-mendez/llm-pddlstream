           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. I started with a clear understanding of the goal `new-axiom@0()` and broke it down into its constituent parts: things like the rovers' positions, whether they have free storage, the need to receive images and analyses, and some rock types. I checked the initial state, seeing that some conditions are already met.
           
           Then I focused on the core problem: getting those images and analyses.  To receive them, I need to *send* them. That led me to the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions. But here's the rub: those actions have preconditions. For example, rovers must be *comvisible* to a communication device to send. Also, they need to be at certain positions, `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, to perform the required tasks.
           
           The initial state showed that the rovers are located at two fixed points, `v13` and `v15`, and the *only* allowed `move` actions are basically "do nothing" moves, keeping the rovers at their initial configurations. This is a huge constraint.
           
           So, here's the kicker: the rovers cannot reach any of the required positions like `#o0`, `#o3` or `#o5` because the `move` actions are useless in changing their positions. This means I can't calibrate, take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses, which are all preconditions to achieving the goal.
           
           Even if all the other conditions, like having rocks of the correct types, are satisfied, I simply cannot *get* the required images and analyses with the current constraints and available actions. The goal is unreachable given the current state and action set because the rovers are locked into positions that prevent them from doing the core work. My expert opinion is that this problem is impossible to solve with the given configuration.
