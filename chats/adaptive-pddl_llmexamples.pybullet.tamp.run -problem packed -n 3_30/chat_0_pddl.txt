           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v14) currently supported by an unknown surface (v11). The goal is to place all three objects on surface v16.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`.
           - `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v11`.
           - `v14` is at `v15` and supported by `v11`.
           - The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both handempty.
           - The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm configurations `v5` (for v4) and `v7` (for v6).
           
           The available action instance `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` is a no-op base motion that keeps the robot at `v3`. This implies the robot cannot change its base position.
           
           The goal requires placing `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. To achieve the `on` predicate, the `supported` and `atpose` predicates must be true. For example, to have `on(v8, v16)`, we need `supported(v8, ?p, v16)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.
           
           Looking at the initial state and derived facts, we have:
           - `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`. This means if we can move `v8` to `atpose(v8, #o2)`, then `on(v8, v16)` will be true.
           - `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`. This means if we can move `v12` to `atpose(v12, #o2)`, then `on(v12, v16)` will be true.
           - `pose(v14, #o2)` and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`. This means if we can move `v14` to `atpose(v14, #o2)`, then `on(v14, v16)` will be true.
           
           However, the provided action instances only include `move_base`. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the list of valid action instances. Without the ability to pick up and place objects, the robot cannot change the `atpose` of `v8`, `v12`, or `v14`. Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the given allowed actions.
