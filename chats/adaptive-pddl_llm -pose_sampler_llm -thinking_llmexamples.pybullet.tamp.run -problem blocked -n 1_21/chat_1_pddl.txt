           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type on `v18`. I've determined that two objects, `v8` and `v12`, meet the type requirement (`type(?obj, v17)`).  Both objects are candidates.  Crucially, I also confirmed they are `stackable` on `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, `v8` is currently on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. To satisfy the goal, I need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. This would entail `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           After evaluating the necessary preconditions and effects of `pick` and `place`, I formulated a plan to pick the object and place it on v18.
           
           However, a strict constraint limits me to *only* the action instances explicitly provided. The sole available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action manipulates the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) but does *not* directly affect the placement of objects, nor does it impact the goal's requirements (`on` and `type`).
           
           Therefore, since I am restricted to a single action that does not advance the goal, achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *impossible*. Without access to `pick` and `place` actions, I cannot modify the placement of objects to satisfy the `on` predicate.
