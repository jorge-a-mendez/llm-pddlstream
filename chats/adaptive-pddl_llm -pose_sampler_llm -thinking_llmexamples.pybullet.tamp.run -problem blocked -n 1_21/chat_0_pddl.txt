(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Object Placement on Surface**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.07x0.07) on surface 0, which is a rectangle bounded by (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A placement is defined by (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate).  Since the object's dimensions are given, and rotations are relevant in determining if the object fits, I need to make some assumptions about the object to ensure a valid and safe placement strategy.
           
           The problem describes the object's dimensions as its *axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)*. Because the problem statement implies these dimensions describe the object itself, I'll treat the object as axis-aligned.  This is a safe assumption for the first request. Any rotation *of an AABB* would increase its bounding box. So to be completely within the surface boundary and make the problem as simple as possible, I'll stick to a theta of either 0 or pi/2 (90 degrees).
           
           Let's do the math to make sure.  The surface's dimensions are 0.6x0.6 (width and height).  The object is 0.07x0.07.  For it to fit, the object's center must be within a rectangle that's 0.07/2 smaller on each side of the surface (4.235 <= x <= 4.765 and -0.565 <= y <= -0.035).
           
           Now, let's generate 50 distinct placements. Since this is the first request and I can assume the surfaces are empty, I can space the objects along a grid, making sure the object's borders do not overlap. The surface allows approximately 8 by 8 positions. That's more than enough.  I'll start at the minimum X and Y values, increasing X and then Y by 0.07. I'll take the first 50 placements.
