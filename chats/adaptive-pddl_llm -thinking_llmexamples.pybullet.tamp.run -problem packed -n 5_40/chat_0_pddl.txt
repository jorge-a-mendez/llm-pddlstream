               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Frustrating Constraint**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get all these objects, v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, onto v20.  Easy enough, theoretically: pick them up from v11 and place them on v20.  I've got the basic plan down. The goal predicate `on(?o, ?r)` translates to being both supported by and at a particular pose. I can see from the available facts that all the objects are currently on v11, and that, thankfully, I *can* place them on v20 (with all of them going on pose #o2).  I've also confirmed the robot has the right starting configuration at v3 and two empty hands, v4 and v6.
           
           Now, normally, I'd just start planning a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions, using the `kin` facts and all that to guide the robot's movements. But here's where it gets dicey. I've got a limited set of allowed actions—a really limited set. The *only* action I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This moves the robot's base from v3 to v3, which, in effect, does nothing! It's like having a car with only a neutral gear.
           
           The rules explicitly state that I can *only* use actions from the given list. And that list? Just the meaningless `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, because I can't actually pick up or put down anything, I can't move these objects at all. I have the facts about where the objects *can* go, and I have the knowledge of how to move them, but I lack the means to do so. The goal is provably unachievable within the given constraints. It's a classic case of being bound by the rules, and a prime example of a problem designed to fail. I've exhausted my possibilities. No plan can exist.
