           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Goal and Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a PDDL planning problem. My objective is straightforward: to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) *on* another object (v20).  The *on* predicate is defined as requiring an object to be *supported* in a particular *pose* (i.e., `supported(o, p, r)` and `atpose(o, p)`).  Digging in, I see that these objects are *already* supported, but they're in the *wrong* poses.  They're currently supported by v11, and *atpose* predicates have them at poses like v9, v13, v15, v17, and v19.
           
           To reach the goal, I need to get each of these five objects to pose `#o2`, which is where they're *supported* by v20.  Effectively, I've got to move these objects from their current locations to this new pose.
           
           **Constraints: The Crucial Bottleneck**
           
           This is where things get tricky. I've got a limited set of actions available: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Given the problem, the last two are irrelevant, and I'm left with the actions to *pick* and *place* the objects. However, *and this is key*, there's a huge restriction. The only *instance* of these actions that are allowed is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. And that's all.
           
           I dive into the preconditions for the `pick` and `place` actions, because they are the means to alter an object's location and pose. Both actions rely on the `atpose` predicate changing. However, the problem statement *explicitly forbids* any action instances that aren't *in the given list*. The given list consists *only* of  `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.
           
           This means I'm stuck. I can't move the objects using `pick` and `place` actions;  only a `move_base` action is available, but that doesn't change anything about `atpose`.
           
           **Conclusion: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Because the planning system does not permit the actions that are required to change the `atpose` predicates, the goal is unachievable. No object can be moved to the correct pose because the necessary *pick* and *place* actions are simply not permitted.
