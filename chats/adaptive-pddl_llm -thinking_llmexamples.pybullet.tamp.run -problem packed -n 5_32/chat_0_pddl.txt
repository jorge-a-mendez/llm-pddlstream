           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable: Limited Action Set in `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a `pr2-tamp` planning problem. My objective is straightforward: get objects `v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18` onto surface `v20`.  Initially, they're all piled on `v11`.  Standard stuff, right?  The "on" predicate is defined by supporting an object at a certain pose. I can see the various poses and support relationships are initially defined, but they all have the objects on `v11`.
           
           The initial state is there, and I can see the pose definitions, like `pose(v18, #o2)`, as well as support relations like `supported(v18, #o2, v20)`, and similar facts for all the objects of interest, which is all as expected.
           
           Now, the problem. The only available action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This does *nothing* to change the spatial relationships between the objects and their surfaces. It just shuffles the robot base between configurations. The preconditions and effects of this base-moving action are irrelevant to my goal, which is manipulating objects.
           
           To achieve my goal of `on(?o, ?r)`, I'd need `pick` and `place` actions at the very least.  These actions are the standard movers. `pick` lifts, and `place` puts the object down.  Since these actions are not provided, it's immediately obvious that the plan is impossible to realize. The problem statement explicitly states that the list of allowed action instances is the *only* set I can use, which reinforces the impossibility.
           
           This is a constraint of the problem domain. Because I'm restricted to only `move_base`, I can't move any objects.  The goal condition cannot be achieved because the necessary actions for manipulating the objects are missing. The problem specification is clear, and the conclusion is inescapable: the goal is unreachable given this severely limited action set.
