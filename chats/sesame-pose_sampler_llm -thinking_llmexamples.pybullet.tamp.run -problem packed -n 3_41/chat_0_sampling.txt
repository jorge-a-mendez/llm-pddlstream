(Thoughts: **Geometric Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size: 0.0966 x 0.0966) on a square surface (surface 0, bounds: -0.135 to 0.135). The goal is to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface for all placements.
           
           To achieve this, I've considered the geometry of the situation: both the object and the surface are squares, which simplifies the analysis. The core of my approach centers around understanding how rotating the object affects its effective "bounding box" relative to the surface's boundaries.
           
           I've determined that the critical parameter is `R`, the effective half-width/height of the object after rotation by an angle `theta`. Due to the object's square shape, `R` can be calculated as  `R = 0.04828875186914222 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. Importantly, `R` is periodic with a period of `pi/2`.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I will select ten angles (`theta`) ranging from 0 to 2*pi at increments of pi/5 and for each angle generate 5 different (x,y) positions inside the feasible region.  For each `theta`, I'll calculate the corresponding `R` value.  This allows me to determine the valid range for the object's center `(x, y)`: it must lie within the bounds defined by the surface bounds plus or minus `R`. The object must be placed with its center point (x,y) inside an area where x and y can range from  [surf_lower_bound + R, surf_upper_bound - R] for the valid range of placements.
           
           To diversify the placements within the valid region, I will strategically place the center point at locations that cover different regions. The placements will include (0,0), the extreme corners (min_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y), etc. This will ensure coverage.
           
           I'll iterate through these angles, calculate R, then calculate the positions and generate 5 (x,y) pairs. With 10 angles and 5 placements per angle, this approach will give 50 valid placements as required.

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Impossibility of Collision-Free Placement**
           
           I've received a request to place Object 4 (ID 4) onto Surface 0, but there's a problem: a previously placed object, Object 5 (ID 5), is already present and occupies a region that precludes any collision-free placement for the new object. My analysis, which I've meticulously checked, reveals that, given Object 5's position at the center of the surface (`0, 0, 0, 0`) with zero rotation, and its relative dimensions to the given Surface 0 `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, any stable placement of Object 4 on the surface will inevitably result in a collision with Object 5.
           
           I must provide 50 placements, even though collision avoidance is impossible. I will generate positions where the Object 4 object is fully stable on the surface, choosing a diverse set of locations that fill it. The rotation is also changing from 0 to 2pi. I will generate the list of values to be as "far" from object 5 as possible given the size constraints, in the hopes that some amount of collision minimization might be possible.
           
           I will explicitly note that the placements will collide, as this is the only option given the current scene geometry. This will be my interpretation of the prompt's instruction to "never give up."

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to place 50 stable instances of object ID 6 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with previously placed objects (ID 5 and ID 4) which are now considered fixed obstacles. I have object extents for object ID 6, `size_x = 0.08562499362122816` and `size_y = 0.08562499362122811`, which make it nearly square.  I'll use half of these extents, `h6 = 0.04281249681061408`. The surface dimensions are defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'm aware that a previous attempt to place object ID 4 may have collided with object ID 5. This is based on the instruction "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene". Instead of attempting collision calculations, I have decided to trust the successes from the previous placement to define the fixed obstacles. Thus, object ID 5 with half-extents of `h5 = 0.04828875186914222`, and object ID 4, which had two successful placements, are now fixed obstacles.
           
           To simplify the collision avoidance, I will consider a single AABB that contains both objects, centered at the origin, with a half-width of `h_center_obstacle = 0.04837992557241767`.  I also consider the placement of the second instance of object ID 4, which is in the positive quadrant, specifically in the area of AABB `[0.03824014885516466, 0.135]` in both the x and y dimensions.
           
           I've determined that due to the fixed obstacles, there are only small strips available for placing object ID 6.  My strategy will be to place `theta=0`, which results in `h6 = 0.04281249681061408` as the bounding box. The center of object 6, must be located within these strips to avoid collisions. I will then use `theta` as `pi/2`, `pi`, or `3pi/2`, but only at points already determined to not collide with obstacles at `theta = 0`.  I will place a number of points, at theta 0, and not rotate the points.  This will reduce the computation time.  I generate 5 x coordinates and 5 y coordinates for the left half of the surface, such that no collisions occur. The x-coordinates will have the format `-0.092...`, while the y-coordinates are generated in an identical fashion. These coordinates define the `x,y` center of the bounding box.
           
           A strategy to generate 50 points uses two sets of coordinates.
           I define the points `X_coords_neg_strip`  and `Y_coords_neg_strip` that are the x and y coordinates in negative space.
           I define the points `X_coords_neg_strip`  and `Y_coords_pos_strip` that are the x coordinates in negative space and y coordinate in the positive space, such that no collisions occur.
           
           The valid set of points for placement is then
           - All points in the set, where x and y in negative space are used for each component.
           - All points in the set, where x is a negative value, and y is positive.
           For theta=0, this results in two `5 x 5` grids, for a total of 50 points. This strategy will allow the completion of the 50 placement requirement.
