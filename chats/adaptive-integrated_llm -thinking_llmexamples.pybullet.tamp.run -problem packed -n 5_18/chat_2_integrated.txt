           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this, as an expert in planning:**
           
           Okay, so I need to get five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a surface, specifically v20.  All of them start on v11 (with v16 also resting on v17), but the goal state wants them all *on* v20. That means I need to make sure each object is *supported* by v20 and is *atpose* on the surface.  Since the initial state *already* has each object supported by v20, my job is to get them all to the appropriate *poses* on that surface.
           
           I've got a robot arm (v4) and it's the only tool I have, and I see from the plan that it supports all of the objects.  Since all the objects are already supported (as part of the initial state), placing them at their target locations can be done one by one sequentially using *pick* and *place* actions with the robot.  The *pick* cost and *place* cost are the same, and I should only have to move the robot base once.
           
           The target surface, v20, has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  I need to figure out where to put each object on v20.  The main challenge is that the poses are represented by '#o2', so each pose is a variable that the solver will need to determine for each object. The key insight is that since all the initial *kin* predicates (that control motion of the arm) use a base configuration `#o3`, it's best to move the base there once and stay there for the duration.  `kin` stands for kinematics, so it's all about how the arm is capable of physically moving. The robot arm is currently at `v3`, which is *atbconf*.
           
           I need to make sure my poses on v20 are collision-free.  I'll want to avoid any `unsafe` predicates. I have some freedom in arranging the objects. For simplicity and to fit within the table's AABB, I'll place them in a line along the x-axis, using y=0.02 to slightly offset them, and a z-coordinate of 0.781 (since this has been successful on previous trials) for all the objects and let each have a 0 rotation (theta=0). I'll also want to make sure the x coordinates will be different for each object to make sure each is at its intended location.
           
           The planning structure is pretty straightforward: move the base, then pick and place for each object.  And based on the actions that are given, this appears to work perfectly.  No unexpected consequences, everything should be able to move and collide.
           
           So, the plan looks like this:
           
           1.  **Move the base** from its initial configuration (v3) to base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick** up object v8 from its initial location v9, and then...
           3.  **Place** v8 at the pose named `#o2` with the provided coordinates on surface v20.
           4.  **Pick** up object v12 from its initial location v13, and then...
           5.  **Place** v12 at the pose named `#o2` with different coordinates on surface v20.
           6.  **Pick** up object v14 from its initial location v15, and then...
           7.  **Place** v14 at the pose named `#o2` with different coordinates on surface v20.
           8.  **Pick** up object v16 from its initial location v17, and then...
           9.  **Place** v16 at the pose named `#o2` with different coordinates on surface v20.
           10. **Pick** up object v18 from its initial location v19, and then...
           11. **Place** v18 at the pose named `#o2` with different coordinates on surface v20.
           
           All of the object positions are on the surface, and I'm confident in this plan.
