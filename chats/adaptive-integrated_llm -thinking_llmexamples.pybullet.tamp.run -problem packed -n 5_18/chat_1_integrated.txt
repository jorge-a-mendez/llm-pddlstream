           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Task at Hand**
           
           My goal is to devise a plan to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current position on surface v11 to a smaller surface, v20.  This involves picking each object up from v11 and placing it onto v20.  The robot has two arms, but the available "kin" (kinematic) facts indicate that I can only use arm v4 for this task.  The base of the robot remains fixed at configuration v3.
           
           **The Situation**
           
           The target surface, v20, is defined by its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), suggesting it's likely a relatively small table or tray.  The plan requires each object to be *on* v20. Since the problem explicitly states to provide specific coordinates for poses starting with `#`, and the `kin` facts point to the same pose `#o2` used for all placements, I need to create unique placement points *within* the confines of v20 for each object while using the placeholder `#o2` for each placement action.
           
           **Constraints and Assumptions**
           
           *   **Fixed Base:** The robot's base will not move; all pick and place actions must be within its reach from configuration v3.
           *   **Arm Usage:** Only arm v4 is usable for picking and placing due to the provided `kin` facts.
           *   **Surface v20:** I assume surface v20 is a small tray or table resting on v11, which will give a height of the tray's bottom + tray's height. Object placement height will be 0.791. The AABB data, suggests that this surface is centered at the origin, therefore I'll need to specify coordinates such that each object fits within the 0.27m x 0.27m surface.
           *   **Object Placement:** Object AABBs have been re-calibrated. By taking a pose as the center, the objects can be placed without collision onto the v20 surface.
           
           **The Plan**
           
           The plan will consist of a sequence of pick and place actions for each object:
           
           1.  Pick v8 (using arm v4) from its initial pose on v11.
           2.  Place v8 onto a specific pose on v20.
           3.  Pick v12 (using arm v4) from its initial pose on v11.
           4.  Place v12 onto a specific pose on v20.
           5.  Pick v14 (using arm v4) from its initial pose on v11.
           6.  Place v14 onto a specific pose on v20.
           7.  Pick v16 (using arm v4) from its initial pose on v11.
           8.  Place v16 onto a specific pose on v20.
           9.  Pick v18 (using arm v4) from its initial pose on v11.
           10. Place v18 onto a specific pose on v20.
           
           **Pose Details**
           
           Here's the planned configuration for placing the objects on surface v20. The pose coordinates represent the origin (center) of the object's AABB. `z` represents height of table `v11` + tray height. The values are within the area defined by v20's AABB:
           
           *   **v8 on v20:** x=-0.07, y=0.07, z=0.791, theta=0
           *   **v12 on v20:** x=0.07, y=0.07, z=0.791, theta=0
           *   **v14 on v20:** x=-0.07, y=-0.07, z=0.791, theta=0
           *   **v16 on v20:** x=0.07, y=-0.07, z=0.791, theta=0
           *   **v18 on v20:** x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.791, theta=0
           
           This plan should successfully move all objects to the target surface in a collision-free manner. The costs and plan length are both minimized since `move_base` actions are not necessary.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan that's clearly flawed because it uses actions I'm not allowed to use. Let's re-evaluate this. The goal is to get five objects, v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, all *on* v20. That means each object needs to be *supported* by v20 and *atpose* at some point on v20.
           
           The initial state shows all the objects *supported* by v11 at their starting poses.  The only action I can take is `move_base`. But `move_base` doesn't change *supported* or *atpose* predicates. It's essentially useless for achieving this goal. It just toggles some internal robot configuration flags that are irrelevant.
           
           To actually get those objects *on* v20, I need `pick` and `place` actions. I need to pick up each object from its pose on v11, move it, and place it *on* v20 in a new pose. However, since the allowed action instances don't include those actions, the goal is simply unreachable with the constraints I've been given. The current configuration has each object supported on the desired platform, but the poses are incorrect.
