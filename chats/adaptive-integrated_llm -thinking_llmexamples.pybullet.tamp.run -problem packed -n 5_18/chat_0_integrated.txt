User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.141, -0.515), (-0.056, -0.43)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.131, -0.338, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.909, -0.416).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.04, -0.546), (0.122, -0.463)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.123, 0.316, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.705).

           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.045, 0.539, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.003, 1.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.099, -0.473, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.992, -0.129).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.081, -0.504, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.636, 0.772).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.081, -0.387), (0.18, -0.288)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.088, 0.281), (0.159, 0.351)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.01, 0.504), (0.08, 0.575)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Detailed Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this task, keeping in mind I'm dealing with a very specific problem domain: moving a set of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a target surface (v20). I need to generate a plan that's both efficient and executable, and I'm treating the instructions as a very detailed specification.
           
           The primary goal is clear: get those five objects *on* v20, which essentially translates to ensuring they're at specific poses supported by v20.  I'm interpreting "on" using the standard "supported" and "atpose" predicates.  I've got the initial state, the target surface dimensions, and the target placement of v20. This will be the backbone of my plan.
           
           The available actions are pick, place, move_base, clean, cook. I'm focusing on pick and place because the others aren't relevant to just moving these objects.  There's a single move_base action that effectively keeps the robot's base stationary. This significantly simplifies things. I can assume that all picking and placing can be performed from the robot's initial base configuration, v3. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6.
           
           The problem specifically calls out that I need to provide "continuous values" for certain parameters that are initially represented by '#' symbols. This means I'll need to compute these values in my plan. Crucially, even though all objects are initially described as being "at" pose `#o2` on v20, I must use distinct poses for *each* object on v20. That means I need to define the unique positions like `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, etc., and define the continuous values for all of them. This is the core of how I'll achieve an executable solution.
           
           My basic plan will be a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions. For each object, the process will look like this:
           1.  **Pick:** Use an arm (I'll likely use v6 to keep it simple, though either would work) to pick up the object from its starting position.
           2.  **Place:** Use the same arm to place the object on v20 at its assigned pose.
           
           Since the base doesn't move, and there are no apparent constraints on the order, I can just perform pick and place operations for each object. The geometry of the scene needs analysis to ensure collision-free motion and to choose stable poses on the surface (v20).
           
           I'll start by looking at each object's initial position on the table, which seems to be v11. And then identify placement locations on v20 that do not collide with each other.  I'll place them at evenly spaced points around the center of v20 to keep them well within the bounding box ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I need to ensure the poses on the surface are all within the bounds, and consider object dimensions.
           
           I've determined a basic plan:  Pick object, then place object, repeat for all five objects, using the right arm (v6).
           
           Based on this plan, I'll generate the precise sequence, computing each continuous value to avoid collisions and keep the plan executable. The continuous values are:
           *   Poses on v20, represented by `#o2` and the specific poses like `#o2_v8`, which represent an offset from the center of v20 at a height of 0.791.
           *   Trajectories for the pick and place motions (these can also be computed based on robot kinematics, and will be based on arm motions using `#atraj_v8_pick`, and `#atraj_v8_place`).
           
           In all, I can generate a plan that *should* be executable, because I'm following the constraints provided and ensuring collision free pick and place poses. The estimated cost of this plan is minimal, since there are no movements of the base and the cost for each pick and place is 1.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v6 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #atraj_v8_pick) , (place v6 v8 #o2 v8 v20 #o1 v3 #atraj_v8_place) , (pick v6 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #atraj_v12_pick) , (place v6 v12 #o2 v12 v20 #o1 v3 #atraj_v12_place) , (pick v6 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #atraj_v14_pick) , (place v6 v14 #o2 v14 v20 #o1 v3 #atraj_v14_place) , (pick v6 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #atraj_v16_pick) , (place v6 v16 #o2 v16 v20 #o1 v3 #atraj_v16_place) , (pick v6 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #atraj_v18_pick) , (place v6 v18 #o2 v18 v20 #o1 v3 #atraj_v18_place)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossible Goal**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. The user pointed out that my previous plan was completely off-base because I didn't stick to the explicitly defined actions. I was given a very specific action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's it. No picking, no placing, no cleaning, no cooking... just moving the base from `v3` to `v3`. That means *no* object manipulation.
           
           My goal is to get those five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) *onto* surface `v20`.  We know `on(?o, ?r)` means `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` *and* `atpose(?o, ?p)`. Let's quickly review the initial state: all five objects *are* already *on* something (`v11`), they're just on the wrong thing! They're supported and at their current poses.
           
           The challenge is getting them *onto* `v20`. To do that, I'd need to change their `atpose` predicates.  Logically, this *always* requires a combination of `pick` and `place` actions, or some variation of those.  But I *don't* have those actions available! My only tool is `move_base`. That action only affects the robot's own configuration and movement predicates, nothing to do with the *objects* and their poses.
           
           Given these constraints, it's immediately clear that this goal is completely *unreachable*.  I can't change any `atpose` predicate of the objects. They're stuck where they are, and there's no path to getting them onto `v20`. I'm completely stymied by this ridiculously restricted set of allowed actions. It's a fundamental conflict between the desired outcome and the limited means available. I need to make sure I am working with the correct set of actions next time.
