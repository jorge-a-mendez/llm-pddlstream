           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy and Findings**
           
           My initial goal is to achieve the new-axiom. This involves satisfying a conjunction of conditions: I need to get four images received, and I need an analysis of a stone and soil sample received.  I began by examining the initial state and realized that several conditions are already true, like being "at configuration" and the store being "free." I'm working under the constraints of a restricted set of *allowed* actions. I quickly recognized that "move" actions in the list are no-ops; they don't change any relevant state.
           
           My plan revolves around the available actions and available rock samples in the initial state. The initial state and the allowed move instances make this task challenging, and the problem specifically states that *only* the provided actions are to be used. The task is to form a valid list that solves the problem.
           
           I needed to make a plan to achieve the necessary `receivedimage` predicates and the required `receivedanalysis` predicates. To receive the images, I would need a `take_image` and `send_image`.  To receive the analysis, I need to `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. However, only two actions can be used - `move` and `drop_rock`. To achieve my sub-goals (four `receivedimage` predicates and two `receivedanalysis` facts), I cannot use the `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_analysis`, and `sample_rock` actions because they are *not* provided in the allowed list, which makes this plan not workable.
           
           Furthermore, I noted that the `drop_rock` action instance in the allowed list requires a "full" condition, which isn't true in the initial state. The plan should work from the initial state only, so if a precondition of an allowed action isn't true in the initial state, that action is impossible.
           
           **Conclusion**
           
           With the given action instances, this goal is *unachievable*.  My analysis concluded that none of the goal predicates—`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`—can be fulfilled because the necessary actions—such as "take image" and "send analysis"—are *not* in the allowed actions. The only actions that *are* available, `move` and `drop_rock`, can't facilitate the required changes. Since `drop_rock`'s precondition isn't initially satisfied, the problem cannot be worked from the starting state and is hence unachievable.
