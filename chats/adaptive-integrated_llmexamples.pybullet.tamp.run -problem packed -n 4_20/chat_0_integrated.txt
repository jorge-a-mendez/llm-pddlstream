User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.012, -0.528), (0.066, -0.45)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.197, -0.451), (-0.119, -0.373)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.272, 0.269), (-0.176, 0.365)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.042, 0.494), (0.122, 0.574)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.027, -0.489, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.998, -0.062).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.158, -0.412, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.662, 0.749).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.224, 0.317, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.501, 0.865).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.082, 0.534, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.655, 0.756).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene involves several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) that need to be moved from their current locations on surface v11 to surface v18. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are currently empty. The robot's base is at configuration v3. There are precomputed poses for each object on the target surface v18 (represented by #o2). All objects are graspable.
           
           The goal is to place all objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on surface v18. Since there are no pick and place actions provided, it's impossible to move the objects to their desired locations. The only action available is `move_base`, which doesn't change the state of the objects in a way that helps achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
