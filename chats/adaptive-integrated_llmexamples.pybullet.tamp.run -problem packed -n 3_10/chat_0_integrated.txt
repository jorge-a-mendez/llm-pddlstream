User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.119, -0.269), (-0.043, -0.194)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.1, 0.492), (0.179, 0.572)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.14, 0.532, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.076, 0.997).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.205, 0.258, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.989, 0.145).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.081, -0.232, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.045, 0.999).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.161, 0.214), (0.248, 0.301)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` that need to be placed on surface `v16`. Currently, `v8` is at pose `v9` and supported by `v11`, `v12` is at pose `v13` and supported by `v11`, and `v14` is at pose `v15` and supported by `v11`. All objects are graspable. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are empty. The base is at `v3`.
           
           The goal is to place `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Since `v16` is a surface where all three objects can be stacked, we can pick and place each object individually.
           
           The problem only provides one action instance, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies that the only action that can be performed is to move the base from `v3` to `v3` (i.e. not move). This is not enough to achieve the goal of moving the objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` from their current poses to new poses on `v16`. Since pick and place actions are not available, the goal is not achievable.
