(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a 0.07x0.07 object (ID 5) on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A "stable" placement means the object's AABB is fully contained within the surface's AABB.  The format I need is `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.  Given the object's square shape, I can safely set `theta` (rotation) to 0, since the AABB remains the same regardless of rotation.
           
           The surface bounds are straightforward:  x ranges from 4.2 to 4.8 and y ranges from -0.6 to 0.0.  To guarantee stability, I need to place the object's center `(x, y)` such that its AABB doesn't spill over the edges.  Since the object's dimensions are 0.07, I'll calculate the valid ranges for `x` and `y`.  This involves subtracting half the object's size (0.07/2 = 0.035) from the upper bounds and adding it to the lower bounds.
           
           For `x`, the range is 4.235 to 4.765. For `y`, the range is -0.565 to -0.035.  The surface is a 0.6 x 0.6 square, and the object is a 0.07 x 0.07 square; it's clear there's plenty of space.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll create a grid within these valid ranges. I'm choosing a grid with 7 steps in x and 8 steps in y. The calculations for the increments in x and y are straightforward: `delta_x = (4.765 - 4.235) / 6`, and `delta_y = (-0.035 - (-0.565)) / 7`.
           
           I'll iterate through the grid, calculating each (x, y) coordinate, always with `surf_idx = 0` and `theta = 0.0`. I can make sure that I generate exactly 50 placements by iterating in this way. I will start with a valid `x` and increment by the `delta_x` value. This ensures I get distinct placements and fully utilize the available space on the surface while maintaining stability.

(Thoughts: **Placing Object ID 10 Strategically**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request: find 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with the existing placements of object ID 5. Object 10 is almost square, with dimensions roughly 0.095 x 0.095. Surface 0 is a rectangle from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  
           
           First, I analyzed the existing placements of object 5. They are all centered along a line at y=-0.565 and -0.489, with AABBs that mostly span the lower part of the surface. Based on the geometry of these existing objects, object 5 has a fixed AABB of 0.07 x 0.07.
           
           The key is to determine a safe zone for object 10 that avoids any overlap. Given the object size, valid placement locations will be restricted by their dimensions, and the surface extents. I calculated a collision-free y-range, noting that the object 5 instances have varying bottom and top edge y coordinates. By analysing the object 5 coordinates, the safe y-level can be determined. After calculating the surface bounds for the object, x coordinates are determined. Using the y-coordinates the placements were determined, and it was ensured that the object did not collide.
           
           Based on this, I've constructed a grid of potential locations, ensuring a y range above the highest point of object 5 and the other surface bounds. This way I know the placements don't collide. By picking values in the grid, 50 valid placements are determined.
           
           Here are the 50 resulting placements, ready to be deployed:
