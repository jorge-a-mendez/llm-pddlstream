User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with an open center. The walls are at x = +/- 2.5 and y = +/- 2.5. There's a vertical partition at x = 0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered around the room. I need to find a position for the robot base that is within a 2-unit radius of the target point (-0.8 0.1), avoids collisions with the known obstacles, and has a line of sight to the target. I will try to place the robot in open areas and avoid being too close to the obstacles. I should also consider placing the robot from different directions around the target to increase the chances of finding an occlusion-free spot.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.8 0.1)
           (-0.8 2.1)
           (1.2 0.1)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (2.0455188751220703, 1.8532824516296387). My previous attempts were far off, as they were generated for a different target. I need to generate positions within a 2-unit radius of the *new* target.
           One of the previously proposed positions (-0.8, 2.1) for the *previous* target would collide with obstacle 10, which is `((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25))`. This is not relevant to the current target point.
           The other position (-1.8, 0.1) had no line of sight to the *previous* target, which is also not relevant here.
           
           Given the new target point (2.0455188751220703, 1.8532824516296387), I will try positions close to the target, avoiding the known obstacles near it, such as obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20, 21. Specifically, there's obstacle 7 `((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))` which the target is inside. I cannot be at the target. Also there is obstacle 21 `((1.996446012627989, 1.8042095891355574), (2.0945917376161516, 1.90235531412372))` which is very close to the target. I need to be careful with these. I'll try positions slightly outside of this region.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0455188751220703 1.8532824516296387)
           (2.0455188751220703 0.8532824516296387)
           (0.0455188751220703 1.8532824516296387)
