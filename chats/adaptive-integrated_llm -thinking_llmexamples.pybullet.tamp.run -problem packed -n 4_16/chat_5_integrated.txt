           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal: get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* `v18`. Initially, I thought this might be trivial, but upon closer inspection, it's clear I need to move each object to a specific pose on `v18`.
           
           My initial analysis was based on the *current* facts and the definition of `on`. I initially missed a crucial detail: while `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` both appear in the initial state, they were associated with *different* poses. So, an object initially supported and *not* at the pose of being placed on the platform has to be *placed*. Therefore I was incorrect in thinking that the goal was met immediately.
           
           I need to use the robot arm (`v4`) to pick and place each object. Currently, they are positioned on `v11` at distinct locations, and their target placements are *also* on distinct locations on `v18`. The goal `on(object, v18)` requires that an object be *at* a position, given that the object is supported at a given position to be *on* that surface.
           
           Here's the plan, broken down:
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** First, I must move the robot's base from its starting configuration `v3` to a suitable base configuration `#o3`. This is crucial because all the pick-and-place actions specified in the problem statement are defined relative to the base configuration `#o3`. I'll do this using a `move_base` action. Cost for this is based on the distance between the starting and ending bases, specifically `distance(v3, #o3)`. I'll have to *assume* a viable path for the base between configurations to execute it.
           2.  **Object Manipulation:** Next, I'll execute the four pick-and-place actions, one for each object:
               *   Pick `v8` from pose `v9` and place it at pose `p4` on `v18`.
               *   Pick `v12` from pose `v13` and place it at pose `p5` on `v18`.
               *   Pick `v14` from pose `v15` and place it at pose `p6` on `v18`.
               *   Pick `v16` from pose `v17` and place it at pose `p7` on `v18`.
           
               Each of these pick-and-place actions has a cost of 1.
           
           The critical assumption I'm making here is that the specified grasps and trajectories in the *kin* facts are valid and collision-free, ensuring the plan's executability. I'm also assuming that, in the provided kin facts, `!unsafeapproach`, `!unsafeatraj`, and `!unsafepose` conditions are always met. So for this, I do not have to check any collision conditions.
           
           I don't need to specify *any* continuous pose coordinates for the objects because they all initially have a discrete pose in the initial state. The *target* poses on `v18` are all provided as concrete, discrete values: `p4`, `p5`, `p6`, and `p7`. The only thing I have to work with is the coordinate of `#o3`. However, the problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `pose(obj, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `obj`, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose such that, given the geometry of the scene, the pose is a collision-free stable placement for the object on a surface for which `supported(obj, #<name> surf)` is in the initial state.", so I do *not* have to provide a coordinate for `#o3` since no `pose(obj, #o3)` exists in the initial state.

Model:     **Strategic Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal: get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* `v18`. Initially, I thought this might be trivial, but upon closer inspection, it's clear I need to move each object to a specific pose on `v18`.
           
           My initial analysis was based on the *current* facts and the definition of `on`. I initially missed a crucial detail: while `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` both appear in the initial state, they were associated with *different* poses. So, an object initially supported and *not* at the pose of being placed on the platform has to be *placed*. Therefore I was incorrect in thinking that the goal was met immediately.
           
           I need to use the robot arm (`v4`) to pick and place each object. Currently, they are positioned on `v11` at distinct locations, and their target placements are *also* on distinct locations on `v18`. The goal `on(object, v18)` requires that an object be *at* a position, given that the object is supported at a given position to be *on* that surface.
           
           Here's the plan, broken down:
           
           1.  **Base Movement:** First, I must move the robot's base from its starting configuration `v3` to a suitable base configuration `#o3`. This is crucial because all the pick-and-place actions specified in the problem statement are defined relative to the base configuration `#o3`. I'll do this using a `move_base` action. Cost for this is based on the distance between the starting and ending bases, specifically `distance(v3, #o3)`. I'll have to *assume* a viable path for the base between configurations to execute it.
           2.  **Object Manipulation:** Next, I'll execute the four pick-and-place actions, one for each object:
               *   Pick `v8` from pose `v9` and place it at pose `p4` on `v18`.
               *   Pick `v12` from pose `v13` and place it at pose `p5` on `v18`.
               *   Pick `v14` from pose `v15` and place it at pose `p6` on `v18`.
               *   Pick `v16` from pose `v17` and place it at pose `p7` on `v18`.
           
               Each of these pick-and-place actions has a cost of 1.
           
           The critical assumption I'm making here is that the specified grasps and trajectories in the *kin* facts are valid and collision-free, ensuring the plan's executability. I'm also assuming that, in the provided kin facts, `!unsafeapproach`, `!unsafeatraj`, and `!unsafepose` conditions are always met. So for this, I do not have to check any collision conditions.
           
           I don't need to specify *any* continuous pose coordinates for the objects because they all initially have a discrete pose in the initial state. The *target* poses on `v18` are all provided as concrete, discrete values: `p4`, `p5`, `p6`, and `p7`. The only thing I have to work with is the coordinate of `#o3`.
