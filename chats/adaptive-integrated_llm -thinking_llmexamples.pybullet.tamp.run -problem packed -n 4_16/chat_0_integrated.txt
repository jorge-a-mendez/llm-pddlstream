User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.197, -0.545), (-0.099, -0.447)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.216, 0.277), (-0.132, 0.361)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.005, 0.387), (0.089, 0.482)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.148, -0.496, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.317, 0.948).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.195, 0.343), (0.271, 0.42)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.174, 0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, -0.11).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.042, 0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.235, 0.972).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.233, 0.381, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.67, 0.742).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the situation. My objective is to place four specific objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, onto a target surface, `v18`. I need to achieve the goal `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. The current state finds these objects scattered on another surface, `v11`. There's an added constraint: my base can't move, as the only provided `move_base` action doesn't allow any change from my starting position, `v3`. This limits my reach, but I'll make it work.
           
           The situation involves two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently empty. I will choose to use arm `v4` for this task. All of the objects are graspable, and I can pick and place with the grasp configuration `#o1`. My strategy is straightforward: sequentially pick each object from its initial pose on `v11` and place it onto a new, strategically chosen position on `v18`.
           
           Here's the plan, step by step:
           
           1.  **Pick `v8`**: I'll grasp `v8` at its current pose, `v9`, using grasp `#o1`. A new arm trajectory, `#atraj_pick_v8`, will be required.
           2.  **Place `v8`**: I'll place `v8` onto a new pose, `#p_v8_v18`, on `v18`. Here, I'm introducing a new continuous pose, and I'll carefully select the coordinates for stable placement. I have a continuous value for the position on surface `v18`. The `on` predicate is satisfied. Another new arm trajectory, `#atraj_place_v8`, is needed.
           3.  **Repeat for remaining objects:** I'll execute the same pick-and-place sequence for `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. Each requires their unique continuous poses for placement on `v18`, with corresponding trajectories.
           
           The key to the plan hinges on properly defining the target poses on `v18` and assuming that the appropriate arm trajectories are available and safe. There's no need to move the base because the object arrangement is manageable from a fixed base position. Given the geometry, I can strategically position the objects without collision on `v18`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v8) , (place v4 v8 #p_v8_v18 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v12) , (place v4 v12 #p_v12_v18 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v14) , (place v4 v14 #p_v14_v18 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v14) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #atraj_pick_v16) , (place v4 v16 #p_v16_v18 #o1 v3 #atraj_place_v16)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Constraints and Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the user's input, and the core issue is crystal clear. I need to get four objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, and v16, onto v18, resulting in the conditions `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. The starting state describes these objects as being on v11 currently.
           
           Now, the user pointed out something critical - the only valid action available is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This means the robot *can only* move its base between v3 and v3 using a specific trajectory.  Any attempt at picking, placing, or interacting with the objects is immediately invalid because the system has *explicitly* ruled out those actions. 
           
           Essentially, I'm facing an insurmountable obstacle. To achieve the desired `on` conditions, I'd need to somehow move the objects from v11 to v18.  That necessitates a `pick` action and a `place` action. These actions, however, are *not* defined as valid. My analysis of the valid action list confirms this. There's no possible manipulation of the objects.
           
           Given this severe constraint, the goal is definitively unachievable. There's simply no valid sequence of actions that can transform the initial state into the desired final state.
