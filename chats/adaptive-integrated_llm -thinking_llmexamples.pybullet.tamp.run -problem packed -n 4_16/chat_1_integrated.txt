           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.197, -0.545), (-0.099, -0.447)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.216, 0.277), (-0.132, 0.361)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.005, 0.387), (0.089, 0.482)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.148, -0.496, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.317, 0.948).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.195, 0.343), (0.271, 0.42)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.174, 0.319, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, -0.11).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.042, 0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.235, 0.972).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.233, 0.381, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.67, 0.742).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto v18:**
           
           My analysis has led me to a simple, sequential plan. I'll need to use the available pick and place actions since the base robot base `v3` is fixed and not capable of moving.  I will pick up each object from their initial poses on `v11` and place them onto the designated platform, `v18`.  
           
           Here's the planned sequence for each object, assuming kinematics exist:
           
           1.  **Object v8:**
               *   Pick from pose `v9`
               *   Place at pose `#o2` with the coordinates (0.07, 0.07, 0.781) and rotation 0.643 rad (from object).
               
           2.  **Object v12:**
               *   Pick from pose `v13`
               *   Place at pose `#o2` with the coordinates (-0.07, 0.07, 0.781) and rotation 1.47 rad (from object).
           
           3.  **Object v14:**
               *   Pick from pose `v15`
               *   Place at pose `#o2` with the coordinates (-0.07, -0.07, 0.781) and rotation -0.472 rad (from object).
           
           4.  **Object v16:**
               *   Pick from pose `v17`
               *   Place at pose `#o2` with the coordinates (0.07, -0.07, 0.781) and rotation -2.92 rad (from object).
           
           **Why this Approach?**
           
           *   **Fixed Base:** Since the robot base cannot move from configuration `v3`, the plan leverages the arm to execute the pick and place actions.
           *   **Sequential Placement:** Placing them one-by-one is the most straightforward approach given the initial conditions, since the base can't assist with parallel moves.
           *   **Clearance:** I've carefully considered the AABBs of each object and the target platform (`v18`) to ensure all the placements are collision-free and on the target surface, `v18`.
           *   **Coordinate system is the same for all objects.**
           
           **Assumptions:**
           
           *   The kinematics (`kin` predicates) required for picking from the initial poses and placing them on `v18` are valid, as indicated in the initial state.
           *   The `canmove()` predicate is restored by each pick and place, so it does not block the consecutive steps.
           *   The target poses on `v18` are collision-free and valid.  The provided `kin` predicates indicate the locations `v18` could be safely placed.
           
           With these steps, I can achieve the desired goal: `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I've looked over the previous plan, and I had to reject it. The plan utilized `pick` and `place` actions, and the explicit constraints state that the only valid action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, I'm stuck with a no-op base movement – not very helpful.
           
           The desired state is clear: `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.  I've double-checked the initial state.  Right now, objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 are supported by v11 based on their poses and supports.  They're *not* currently on v18.
           
           The only way to achieve the goal, as far as I can see, is to relocate these objects from v11 to v18. However, given the action constraints, this is impossible. The constraints explicitly forbid any action instance involving picking or placing objects, such as pick and place. Since I can't manipulate objects, I can't change their `on` states.  It's a classic case of an unachievable goal with a severely limited action space.
           
           My conclusion is that the specified goal is simply not reachable under the given constraints. I need to explain to the system that the plan, as it stands, is fundamentally impossible to execute.
