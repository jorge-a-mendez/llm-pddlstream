           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Deep Dive**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object that is both "on" a specific target (`v18`) and of a particular type (`v17`). I immediately see that the objects `v8` and `v12` satisfy the type requirement.  Therefore, I need either `v8` or `v12` to be "on" `v18`.  
           
           The "on" predicate requires two things: an object being supported by something and that object being at a specific pose.  Looking at the facts, both `v8` and `v12` are supported by `#o2` on `v18`.  Thus, my real objective is to get either `v8` or `v12` into the `atpose(#o2)` state.
           
           To move an object, I'd have to use a `pick` and `place` action sequence. The `pick` action has a critical precondition: `atbconf(?q)`.  This means the robot needs to be at a specific base configuration, determined by the `kin` facts.  However, here's where the problem arises: all the `kin` facts I have, those required to make the `pick` action possible, specify a base configuration of `#o3`.  But the *initial* base configuration is `v3`.
           
           I have only *one* allowed action: `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This action, however, doesn't change the base configuration! It keeps the robot at `v3`.  Consequently, the robot cannot achieve `atbconf(#o3)`. Therefore, since all the available kinematic information is predicated on the robot being in the `#o3` configuration, no `pick` or `place` action can be initiated.
           
           Since I can't pick up or place any object (because I can't satisfy the `atbconf` precondition), I can't change the `atpose` of `v8` or `v12`.  Since I can't get either object to `#o2`, I can't achieve `on(?o, v18)`. Without `on(?o, v18)`, I *cannot* satisfy the original goal `new-axiom@0()`. Given the constraints and the initial state, this goal is simply unreachable.
