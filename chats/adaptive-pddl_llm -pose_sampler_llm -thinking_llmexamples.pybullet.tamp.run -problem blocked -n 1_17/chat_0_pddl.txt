           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 10) on surface 0. The object is nearly square with dimensions approximately 0.091 units by 0.091 units. Surface 0 is a rectangular area bounded by ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement (surf_idx, theta, x, y) is stable if the object's AABB is entirely within the surface bounds.
           
           Since the object is very close to a square, the rotation angle *theta* will have little impact on whether it fits inside the surface; even rotated, its AABB remains nearly a square.  However, to adhere to the prompt, I will still include *theta* in my placement description, ensuring that it still makes sense in terms of the AABB being considered.
           
           Based on the information given, I will calculate for a worst-case scenario: For all rotations, the object must *always* fit on the surface without collision.
           
           Given the dimensions (0.091, 0.091), the maximum effective AABB side length, accounting for rotation, is approximately 0.129 (0.091 * sqrt(2)).
           The safe region to place the center of the object is within a smaller rectangle, so I have to calculate the valid placement area for *x* and *y*
           
           - For *x*: (4.2 + 0.0645) to (4.8 - 0.0645) -> 4.264 to 4.735
           - For *y*: (-0.6 + 0.0645) to (0.0 - 0.0645) -> -0.535 to -0.064
           
           I will divide this safe area into a grid, aiming for diversity, using these ranges. I will choose a 7x7 grid to get a base of 49.
           
           For the placements, I will assign the rotation angle *theta* in the set  [0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi, 5pi/4, 3pi/2, 7pi/4], in a pattern across the 49 points. These assignments will vary the angles.
           
           To reach 50, I will use one more point (i, j) = (3,3) in the center, and assign a theta to it.
           
           The plan looks solid!
