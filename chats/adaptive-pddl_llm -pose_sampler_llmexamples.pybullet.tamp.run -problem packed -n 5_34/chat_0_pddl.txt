           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.0982729498187867, 0.09827294981878665)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions 0.098 x 0.098. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on the given surface. Since the object is much smaller than the surface, there's a lot of room for various placements. I will vary the position (x, y) and the orientation (theta) of the object.
           
           To ensure the object is contained within the surface, I need to consider the object's extent and the surface's boundaries. For a square object of size `s_x` by `s_y` and an orientation `theta`, the maximum extent from its center is `sqrt((s_x/2)^2 + (s_y/2)^2)`. When rotated, the bounding box of the object will change. However, since the object is a square, its bounding box when rotated by 45 degrees will be `sqrt(2) * s_x / 2` by `sqrt(2) * s_x / 2`. The maximum half-dimension of the object will be `s_x / 2` when aligned with axes.
           
           Let `obj_half_x = 0.0982729498187867 / 2 = 0.04913647490939335` and `obj_half_y = 0.09827294981878665 / 2 = 0.049136474909393325`.
           The surface is from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           So, `surf_half_x = 0.135` and `surf_half_y = 0.135`.
           
           For an unrotated object, the center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surf_lower_x + obj_half_x <= x <= surf_upper_x - obj_half_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.049136... <= x <= 0.135 - 0.049136...`
           `-0.085863... <= x <= 0.085863...`
           
           And similarly for `y`:
           `-0.085863... <= y <= 0.085863...`
           
           For a rotated object, the maximum extent from its center to any of its corners is `sqrt(obj_half_x^2 + obj_half_y^2) = sqrt(0.049136^2 + 0.049136^2) = 0.06949...`.
           However, this is not the right way to determine the allowed center positions for arbitrary rotations, as the smallest enclosing axis-aligned bounding box of a rotated rectangle can be larger. The half-width of the bounding box of a rotated rectangle with half-dimensions `hw` and `hh` at angle `theta` is `hw * abs(cos(theta)) + hh * abs(sin(theta))`. Since `hw` and `hh` are very close for this object, let's just use `hw = hh = 0.049136`.
           So, the effective half-width of the rotated object's bounding box will be `0.049136 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This value varies between `0.049136` (at `theta = 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2`) and `0.049136 * sqrt(2) = 0.06949` (at `theta = pi/4, 3pi/4`, etc.).
           
           Let `effective_half_size(theta) = obj_half_x * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_half_y * abs(sin(theta))`.
           Then the allowed x range is `(-0.135 + effective_half_size(theta), 0.135 - effective_half_size(theta))`.
           And similarly for y.
           
           I'll generate a variety of `x`, `y`, and `theta` values within these limits. I will use a mix of centered placements, edge placements, and rotated placements to ensure diversity.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene remains the same, with a single square surface centered at the origin: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           The new object (ID: 4) is also square, with dimensions very similar to the previous object (ID: 5).
           `obj_4_size_x = 0.09827450969100548`, `obj_4_size_y = 0.09827450969100543`.
           `obj_4_half_x = 0.04913725484550274`, `obj_4_half_y = 0.049137254845502715`.
           
           I have information about a previously placed object (ID: 5) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This means object 5 is centered at `(0,0)` with no rotation. Its half-dimensions are approximately `0.049136`.
           The new object (ID: 4) cannot collide with object (ID: 5). Since object 5 is at `(0,0)` and its half-dimensions are `0.049136`, its bounding box is `(-0.049136, -0.049136)` to `(0.049136, 0.049136)`.
           
           To avoid collision with object 5, the center `(x, y)` of object 4 (assuming no rotation for simplicity for now) must satisfy:
           `abs(x) > obj_4_half_x + obj_5_half_x = 0.049137 + 0.049136 = 0.098273`
           `abs(y) > obj_4_half_y + obj_5_half_y = 0.049137 + 0.049136 = 0.098273`
           
           However, the surface limits for object 4 are `surf_lower_x + obj_4_half_x <= x <= surf_upper_x - obj_4_half_x`, which is `-0.135 + 0.049137 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.049137`, so `-0.085863 <= x <= 0.085863`.
           This means that for an unrotated object 4, it's impossible to place it without colliding with object 5 because the required minimum distance (`0.098273`) is greater than the maximum allowed distance from the center (`0.085863`).
           
           This implies that object 4 *must* be rotated such that its effective half-width/height is smaller than `0.049137` *or* that object 5 has a different effective bounding box when considering rotation, or that I misunderstood the collision rule (e.g. they can touch edges). Assuming the AABB collision for fixed objects: The only way to fit two objects of size ~0.098 on a surface of size 0.27 such that their centers are more than 0.098 apart is if the objects are rotated.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision of two axis-aligned boxes. If object 5 is at `(0,0)` with no rotation, its extent is from `(-0.049136, -0.049136)` to `(0.049136, 0.049136)`.
           For object 4 (unrotated) with center `(x, y)` and half-extents `(h4x, h4y)`, it collides if:
           `abs(x) < h4x + h5x` AND `abs(y) < h4y + h5y`.
           To avoid collision, it must be that `abs(x) >= h4x + h5x` OR `abs(y) >= h4y + h5y`.
           
           Given `h4x = 0.049137` and `h5x = 0.049136`, then `h4x + h5x = 0.098273`.
           The allowed x range for object 4 is `[-0.085863, 0.085863]`.
           This means `abs(x)` for object 4 cannot exceed `0.085863`.
           Since `0.085863 < 0.098273`, it is impossible to satisfy `abs(x) >= h4x + h5x`.
           And similarly for `y`.
           
           This means that for objects 4 and 5, *if they are both axis-aligned*, they will always collide.
           This strongly suggests that at least one of them must be rotated.
           
           Let's re-check the definition of "stable placement" and "collision". The problem statement says "the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface" and "whether it collides with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene". It also states that "if a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of, and you should try a different placement." The previous successful placement for ID 5 was `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This implies that object 5 is now a fixed obstacle at this location and orientation.
           
           My previous reasoning for collision avoidance considered the axis-aligned bounding boxes of *both* objects. The condition `effective_half_size(theta) = obj_half_x * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_half_y * abs(sin(theta))` determines the half-width of the *axis-aligned bounding box* of the rotated object.
           
           So, if object 5 is fixed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`, its AABB is `(-0.049136, -0.049136)` to `(0.049136, 0.049136)`.
           Let `hw_4(theta)` be the half-width of the AABB for object 4 at angle `theta`.
           `hw_4(theta) = obj_4_half_x * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_4_half_y * abs(sin(theta))`
           `hh_4(theta) = obj_4_half_x * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_4_half_y * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           The allowed range for the center `(x,y)` of object 4 is:
           `-0.135 + hw_4(theta) <= x <= 0.135 - hw_4(theta)`
           `-0.135 + hh_4(theta) <= y <= 0.135 - hh_4(theta)`
           
           To avoid collision with object 5's AABB, for object 4's AABB (with center `(x,y)`):
           `abs(x) >= hw_4(theta) + obj_5_half_x` OR `abs(y) >= hh_4(theta) + obj_5_half_y`
           
           Let's try a rotation of `pi/4` (`0.785398`).
           For object 4: `obj_4_half_x = 0.04913725`, `obj_4_half_y = 0.04913725`.
           `cos(pi/4) = sin(pi/4) = 0.70710678`.
           `hw_4(pi/4) = 0.04913725 * (0.70710678 + 0.70710678) = 0.04913725 * 1.41421356 = 0.0694998`.
           Similarly, `hh_4(pi/4) = 0.0694998`.
           
           Allowed range for `x` (and `y`) for object 4 at `pi/4` rotation:
           `-0.135 + 0.0694998 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0694998`
           `-0.0655002 <= x <= 0.0655002`
           
           Collision condition with object 5 (AABB from `-0.049136` to `0.049136`):
           `abs(x) >= hw_4(pi/4) + obj_5_half_x = 0.0694998 + 0.049136 = 0.1186358`
           OR
           `abs(y) >= hh_4(pi/4) + obj_5_half_y = 0.0694998 + 0.049136 = 0.1186358`
           
           Again, the maximum allowed `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` is `0.0655002`, which is less than `0.1186358`.
           This means it is impossible to place object 4 on surface 0 without colliding with object 5, *if the collision check is done using AABBs of both objects, and object 5 is considered an axis-aligned rectangle at (0,0) and object 4 uses its rotated AABB*.
           
           This suggests either:
           1. My understanding of the collision mechanism for fixed objects is wrong. Maybe it's not AABB collision. Or perhaps it's object geometry collision, and not AABB collision, making it possible for them to fit. However, typically in these problems, AABB collision is assumed unless specified.
           2. The problem implies that fixed obstacles are only considered fixed *obstacles* if they are explicitly mentioned as such in the initial setup, not just by being successfully placed previously. But the second request mentions "fixed obstacles" in the context of previous successes. The wording "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" makes it clear I have to consider existing objects.
           
           Let's assume the collision detection is based on the object's *actual geometry*, not its AABB. If both objects are squares of side length `s = 0.09827`, and object 5 is at `(0,0)` and unrotated. Its corners are at `(+-s/2, +-s/2)`.
           If object 4 is also unrotated, it cannot be placed.
           If object 4 is rotated by 45 degrees, its corners are `(0, +-s*sqrt(2)/2)` and `(+-s*sqrt(2)/2, 0)`.
           Its actual geometry is a square. Can two squares fit on this surface without overlapping?
           The total width needed for two side-by-side unrotated squares is `2 * s = 2 * 0.09827 = 0.19654`.
           The surface width is `0.27`.
           The centers would need to be `s` distance apart. `0.09827`.
           The maximum allowed center `x` is `0.135 - s/2 = 0.135 - 0.049135 = 0.085865`.
           If object 5 is at `(0,0)`, then object 4 cannot be at `(x,0)` because `abs(x)` needs to be at least `s = 0.09827`, but `0.09827 > 0.085865`. This confirms they cannot be placed side-by-side if they are unrotated.
           
           If object 4 is rotated by `pi/4`, its width (along x or y axes) is `s * sqrt(2) = 0.09827 * 1.414 = 0.13897`.
           This means `half-width = 0.06948`.
           Allowed center `x` for object 4 rotated `pi/4`: `0.135 - 0.06948 = 0.06552`.
           So `abs(x)` must be `0.06552` or less.
           
           Consider the narrowest placement. If the objects are actual squares, not AABBs for collision.
           Object 5 (square, side `s`) at `(0,0)`, `theta=0`. Occupies region `[-s/2, s/2] x [-s/2, s/2]`.
           Object 4 (square, side `s`).
           To avoid collision, they need to be separated.
           The smallest distance between the centers of two squares of side `s` such that they don't overlap (even if one is rotated) is complex. If they are both rotated by `pi/4`, their 'width' becomes `s*sqrt(2)`.
           
           Let's assume the 'collision' is AABB based. The only way this is possible is if my calculations are off, or if the problem has a trick.
           The problem statement "find a stable placement for the object ... fully contained within the bounds of the surface" means the object's bounding box must fit.
           "avoid collision between objects i and j" implies AABB collision of the current object with the previously successfully placed objects.
           
           Given the constraints, no such placement seems possible if object 5 occupies its full AABB at `(0,0)` and object 4 must avoid it using its own AABB.
           `surf_half_x = 0.135`
           `obj_half_x = 0.049137` (for both objects, for simplicity, as they are very close)
           
           Max coordinate for center of object 4 (unrotated) `x_max = surf_half_x - obj_half_x = 0.135 - 0.049137 = 0.085863`.
           Min distance required between centers to avoid collision `x_dist_min = obj_half_x + obj_half_x = 0.049137 + 0.049137 = 0.098274`.
           Since `x_max < x_dist_min`, no axis-aligned placement is possible.
           
           Max coordinate for center of object 4 (rotated by `pi/4`) `x_max_rot = surf_half_x - (obj_half_x * sqrt(2)) = 0.135 - 0.049137 * 1.41421 = 0.135 - 0.069489 = 0.065511`.
           Min distance required between centers for collision avoidance for object 4 (rotated `pi/4`) and object 5 (unrotated). The AABB of rotated object 4 has half-width `0.069489`.
           `x_dist_min_rot = 0.069489 + 0.049137 = 0.118626`.
           Again, `x_max_rot < x_dist_min_rot`.
           
           This implies that with two objects of this size, they cannot be placed on this surface without collision, if AABB collision is used.
           This must mean I need to find a placement that is *technically* not colliding, or there's a different interpretation of "stable placement" or "collision".
           Perhaps the "stable placement" means I should only consider the object's actual geometry for placement within the surface bounds, but collision with other fixed obstacles is also based on object geometry.
           If so, two squares can fit if their corners are allowed to touch, or if they are arranged diagonally.
           
           If two squares of side `s` are aligned such that their corners meet, their centers are `s * sqrt(2)` apart.
           `s * sqrt(2) = 0.09827 * 1.41421 = 0.13897`.
           The maximum distance from origin where a center can be placed, to be contained within the surface, is `0.135 - s/2 = 0.085865`.
           This distance `0.085865` is too small.
           
           The only remaining option is that the collision logic is not AABB, but rather that the problem expects me to assume that object 5 being at `(0,0)` means only a *point* collision should be avoided, or that I must place object 4 extremely close to object 5 without overlap using some specific rotation.
           
           I will attempt to place object 4 at an extreme corner of the surface, as far as possible from the origin. This would be `(0.0858, 0.0858)` if unrotated. The center of object 5 is at `(0,0)`. The distance from `(0,0)` to `(0.0858, 0.0858)` is `sqrt(0.0858^2 + 0.0858^2) = 0.1213`.
           This is greater than the sum of half-diagonals of the objects `0.06948 + 0.06948 = 0.13896`. So they would still collide if the objects are rotated.
           However, if both are unrotated, the corner of object 4 `(0.0858 - 0.049137, 0.0858 - 0.049137) = (0.0366, 0.0366)` would be the closest to the origin. The corner of object 5 is at `(0.049136, 0.049136)`. Since `0.0366 < 0.049136`, they don't collide. This is the correct AABB non-collision check.
           So, if object 5 is at `(0,0,0)`, and object 4 is at `(x_c, y_c, 0)`, the condition for collision avoidance (AABB) is that `abs(x_c) > h4x + h5x` OR `abs(y_c) > h4y + h5y`.
           No, this is wrong. To avoid collision, `x_c_lower > x_5_upper` OR `x_c_upper < x_5_lower` OR `y_c_lower > y_5_upper` OR `y_c_upper < y_5_lower`.
           Let object 5 be `[x5l, x5u] x [y5l, y5u] = [-0.049136, 0.049136] x [-0.049136, 0.049136]`.
           Let object 4 be `[xc - h4x, xc + h4x] x [yc - h4y, yc + h4y]`.
           Collision if `xc - h4x < x5u` AND `xc + h4x > x5l` AND `yc - h4y < y5u` AND `yc + h4y > y5l`.
           No collision if `xc - h4x >= x5u` OR `xc + h4x <= x5l` OR `yc - h4y >= y5u` OR `yc + h4y <= y5l`.
           
           Let `h = 0.049137` for both for simplicity.
           `x5u = 0.049136`, `x5l = -0.049136`.
           If `xc - h >= 0.049136`, then `xc >= 0.049136 + h = 0.049136 + 0.049137 = 0.098273`.
           If `xc + h <= -0.049136`, then `xc <= -0.049136 - h = -0.098273`.
           So `abs(xc) >= 0.098273`.
           However, the maximum allowed `abs(xc)` is `0.085863`.
           This is still a contradiction.
           
           This indicates that my interpretation of "fixed obstacles" (i.e. object 5 at its successful placement) and "avoid collision" (i.e. standard AABB overlap) leads to no possible solution.
           Given the instruction "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement... you will always try to find a new placement", I must try some placements anyway.
           The only way this could work is if the bounding boxes for collision are *tighter* than the AABB of the rotated object, or if the success for object 5 simply means it *could* be placed there, but is not necessarily a fixed obstacle there *for collision purposes* in this request. But the prompt is explicit: "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           Let me consider the total effective space.
           Surface is `0.27 x 0.27`.
           Object size is `0.098 x 0.098`.
           `0.27 / 0.098 = 2.75`. So, a maximum of 2 objects can fit along one dimension if they are separated by `0.098` for their centers.
           If I place one object at `(0,0)`, the remaining area for center placement of the second object is `x > 0.09827` or `x < -0.09827`.
           But available center placement range is `[-0.0858, 0.0858]`.
           
           Could it be that the object 5 is *not* at `(0,0,0)`? The success was `0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0`. This means `surf_idx=0, theta=0.0, x=0.0, y=0.0`. So, yes, it is.
           
           The only way for this to be possible is if the problem setter has a specific interpretation of collision or fixed obstacles that I am missing.
           Perhaps "fixed obstacles" only refers to obstacles provided in the `Surfaces` list, and successfully placed objects are not immediately treated as fixed obstacles for *this specific request's* collision detection, but rather as "non-fixed" obstacles whose positions are used to learn the scene. The phrasing "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" implies they are always obstacles.
           
           I will generate placements that are as far as possible from the center `(0,0)` of object 5, and also vary angles, hoping that some unknown condition makes them valid. I'll prioritize positions near the edges of the surface.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Two objects have been successfully placed and are now considered fixed obstacles:
           Object 5 (ID: 5): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0)`. Its dimensions were `(0.0982729498187867, 0.09827294981878665)`. Half-extents: `(0.049136, 0.049136)`. AABB: `[-0.049136, 0.049136] x [-0.049136, 0.049136]`.
           Object 4 (ID: 4): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.08, y: 0.0)`. Its dimensions were `(0.09827450969100548, 0.09827450969100543)`. Half-extents: `(0.049137, 0.049137)`. AABB: `[0.08 - 0.049137, 0.08 + 0.049137] x [-0.049137, 0.049137] = [0.030863, 0.129137] x [-0.049137, 0.049137]`.
           
           The new object (ID: 6) has dimensions `(0.09857270347167707, 0.09857270347167713)`. Let's denote its half-extents as `h6x = 0.049286` and `h6y = 0.049286`.
           
           Now I need to place object 6 such that it does not collide with object 5 *and* object 4, and is contained within surface 0.
           Let's analyze the fixed obstacles:
           Object 5 (AABB): `[-0.049136, 0.049136] x [-0.049136, 0.049136]`
           Object 4 (AABB): `[0.030863, 0.129137] x [-0.049137, 0.049137]`
           
           The space occupied by the two fixed objects along the x-axis, considering their y-extents overlap (both cover `[-0.049..., 0.049...]`), effectively creates a larger blocked region.
           The union of their x-intervals is `[-0.049136, 0.049136] U [0.030863, 0.129137]`. This simplifies to `[-0.049136, 0.129137]`.
           This means any new object (unrotated) with center `(x_c, y_c)` and half-extents `(h6x, h6y)` will collide if its x-interval `[x_c - h6x, x_c + h6x]` overlaps with `[-0.049136, 0.129137]` AND its y-interval `[y_c - h6y, y_c + h6y]` overlaps with `[-0.049136, 0.049137]`.
           
           For a non-collision in the y-direction, `y_c - h6y >= 0.049137` OR `y_c + h6y <= -0.049137`.
           `h6y = 0.049286`.
           So, `y_c >= 0.049137 + 0.049286 = 0.098423` OR `y_c <= -0.098423`.
           This means object 6 must be placed either significantly above or significantly below the existing two objects.
           
           Let's test placing object 6 (unrotated) with its center `y_c = 0.098423`.
           The overall surface limits are `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           For `y_c = 0.098423`, the object's lower y-bound is `0.098423 - 0.049286 = 0.049137`. This is okay.
           The object's upper y-bound is `0.098423 + 0.049286 = 0.147709`. This `0.147709` is greater than `0.135` (surface upper bound).
           So, an unrotated object 6 cannot be placed at `y_c >= 0.098423`.
           Similarly, `y_c <= -0.098423` would lead to `y_c - h6y <= -0.147709`, which is also outside the surface.
           
           This means placing object 6 requires rotation, or it cannot be placed at all if the collision detection is strictly AABB of the actual bounding boxes.
           If object 6 is rotated, its half-extents for AABB collision detection would be `hw_6(theta) = h6x * abs(cos(theta)) + h6y * abs(sin(theta))`.
           For `theta = pi/4`, `hw_6(pi/4) = h6x * sqrt(2) = 0.049286 * 1.41421 = 0.06969`.
           So, for a `pi/4` rotation, the AABB of object 6 would be `width = 2 * 0.06969 = 0.13938`.
           The maximum allowed center `y_c` would be `0.135 - 0.06969 = 0.06531`.
           The required `y_c` to avoid collision with objects 4 and 5 (which have unrotated AABBs) would be `abs(y_c) >= 0.06969 + 0.049137 = 0.118827`.
           Again, `0.06531 < 0.118827`.
           
           This is the same situation as before. With 3 objects of this size, it seems impossible to place them on this surface with strict AABB collision detection. The maximum extent for center placement for object 6, even when rotated, is too small to escape the combined AABB region of objects 4 and 5.
           
           Given that the previous request failed for *all* placements but one `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)`, this suggests that the collision reasoning must be extremely precise, and the first "success" for object 5 was either an outlier or there is a very subtle rule.
           The previous object 4 was placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)`.
           Object 5 is at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           Object 5 x-interval: `[-0.049136, 0.049136]`
           Object 4 x-interval: `[0.030863, 0.129137]`
           These two intervals clearly overlap (`[0.030863, 0.049136]`). This means object 4 and object 5 *collided* in terms of their AABBs.
           Yet `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0` was listed as a success.
           
           This is a critical piece of information! The collision logic is *not* standard AABB overlap.
           If object 5 at `(0,0)` and object 4 at `(0.08, 0.0)` (both unrotated) are considered *not colliding*, then there must be a different definition of collision.
           For two identical squares with side `s`, if one is at `(0,0)` and the other at `(s,0)`, they would share an edge. This would be `0.09827`.
           The x-center of object 4 is `0.08`. The x-center of object 5 is `0.0`. The distance between centers is `0.08`.
           The sum of half-widths is `0.049136 + 0.049137 = 0.098273`.
           Since `0.08 < 0.098273`, their AABBs *do* overlap.
           
           This implies that the collision check is either:
           1. Point-in-polygon (or point-in-AABB) for the actual geometry, where a minimal overlap is allowed (e.g. only if interiors overlap).
           2. The distance between centers needs to be `> some_threshold`.
           3. There's a specific, non-obvious, fixed offset or allowed overlap.
           
           Given that `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)` was a success for object 4, this suggests that if the x-coordinates of the centers are `0` and `0.08`, and the half-widths are about `0.049`, then a collision is NOT registered.
           `center_dist_x = 0.08`.
           `sum_half_widths = 0.049136 + 0.049137 = 0.098273`.
           `center_dist_x < sum_half_widths`. So AABB overlap.
           
           This must mean that the system considers objects colliding only if their *actual geometry* overlaps, and maybe only their *interiors* (so touching is not a collision). Or it allows for a certain buffer.
           If squares are side-by-side, their centers need to be `s` distance apart. `s = 0.09827`.
           If object 5 is at `(0,0)`, object 4 at `(0.08, 0.0)`.
           Object 5 x-range: `[-0.049136, 0.049136]`.
           Object 4 x-range: `[0.08-0.049137, 0.08+0.049137] = [0.030863, 0.129137]`.
           The overlap region is `[0.030863, 0.049136]`. The width of this overlap is `0.049136 - 0.030863 = 0.018273`. This is a significant overlap.
           
           This means my previous reasoning about collision for fixed obstacles was based on a wrong understanding of the collision mechanism. The successful placement of object 4 *is* an AABB overlap with object 5, but it was not reported as a collision.
           
           I will try to place object 6 such that its center is close to object 5 or 4, but without overlapping their actual extents as much as possible, if that is the implied rule.
           If `(0,0)` and `(0.08,0)` are non-colliding for two identical squares, it might mean that actual shape collision is considered, and they are barely touching or not quite overlapping based on their interior/border distinction.
           This means I can place objects very close.
           
           Let's assume the rule is "no interior overlap for object's true square shape".
           Object 5: `x in [-0.049136, 0.049136]`, `y in [-0.049136, 0.049136]`
           Object 4: `x in [0.030863, 0.129137]`, `y in [-0.049137, 0.049137]`
           
           Object 6 needs to be placed. Half-extents `h6 = 0.049286`.
           If `(0.08, 0.0)` is okay, then maybe `(-0.08, 0.0)` is also okay for object 6 relative to object 5.
           Center `(-0.08, 0.0)`. AABB for object 6: `[-0.08 - h6, -0.08 + h6] = [-0.129286, -0.030714]`.
           This `[-0.129286, -0.030714]` does not overlap with Object 4's AABB `[0.030863, 0.129137]`.
           It overlaps with Object 5's AABB `[-0.049136, 0.049136]` in the region `[-0.049136, -0.030714]`. This is similar to the overlap between 4 and 5.
           This placement `(0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0)` for object 6 would be plausible under the observed collision rule.
           
           I should also try placing it on the 'other side' of object 4.
           If `(0,0)` and `(0.08,0)` are non-colliding, then it means objects are allowed to be quite close.
           What if I place object 6 at `(0.16, 0.0)`? This would be `0.08 + 0.08`.
           Object 6 AABB: `[0.16 - h6, 0.16 + h6] = [0.110714, 0.209286]`.
           This upper bound `0.209286` is outside `0.135`. So `(0.16,0)` is too far for center placement for surface limits.
           The maximum `x` for center placement (unrotated) is `0.135 - h6 = 0.135 - 0.049286 = 0.085714`.
           So a placement like `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.0)` is maximum possible to the right for center.
           Object 6 AABB: `[0.085 - h6, 0.085 + h6] = [0.035714, 0.134286]`.
           This overlaps with object 4's AABB `[0.030863, 0.129137]`. And also overlaps with object 5's AABB.
           But given `(0.08, 0.0)` worked for object 4, maybe such an overlap is allowed if the centers are sufficiently far.
           `0.085` is greater than `0.08`. Let's try placing object 6 there.
           
           I will prioritize locations that create similar overlap patterns to the previous successful placements, and explore the extremities of the surface.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has the single surface `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Now, three objects are successfully placed and form fixed obstacles:
           Object 5 (ID: 5): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0)`. Half-extents `h5 = 0.049136`. AABB: `[-0.049136, 0.049136] x [-0.049136, 0.049136]`.
           Object 4 (ID: 4): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.08, y: 0.0)`. Half-extents `h4 = 0.049137`. AABB: `[0.030863, 0.129137] x [-0.049137, 0.049137]`.
           Object 6 (ID: 6): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: -0.08, y: 0.0)`. Half-extents `h6 = 0.049286`. AABB: `[-0.129286, -0.030714] x [-0.049286, 0.049286]`.
           
           The new object (ID: 7) has dimensions `(0.09808172647407704, 0.09808172647407698)`. Its half-extents are `h7x = 0.04904086` and `h7y = 0.04904085`. For simplicity, I'll use `h7 = 0.04904`.
           
           Analyzing the successful placements from the previous round is crucial for understanding the collision rule.
           Object 5 (center 0,0) and Object 4 (center 0.08,0) *both* have their x-intervals overlap: `[-0.049, 0.049]` and `[0.03, 0.129]`. This implies that AABB overlap along one axis is not a collision if centers are separated by some distance.
           Object 5 (center 0,0) and Object 6 (center -0.08,0) also overlap in x-intervals: `[-0.049, 0.049]` and `[-0.129, -0.03]`.
           
           This confirms that the collision detection is *not* a standard AABB overlap.
           The pattern of successful placements for objects 4, 5, and 6 suggests that objects can be placed side-by-side with their centers offset by `0.08` even though their nominal half-widths are about `0.049`. This means the objects are actually physically "touching" or nearly touching without being considered a "collision".
           The objects are laid out horizontally at `y=0`:
           Object 6: center `(-0.08, 0)`, AABB: `[-0.129, -0.03]`
           Object 5: center `(0.0, 0)`, AABB: `[-0.049, 0.049]`
           Object 4: center `(0.08, 0)`, AABB: `[0.03, 0.129]`
           
           The critical region along the x-axis, at `y=0`, now appears to be fully occupied:
           From `x = -0.129` (left of obj 6) to `x = 0.129` (right of obj 4).
           The surface boundaries are `x = -0.135` to `x = 0.135`.
           The current occupied region `[-0.129, 0.129]` is very close to the surface boundary `[-0.135, 0.135]`.
           
           The combined y-interval for these three objects (since they are all at `y=0` and unrotated) is approximately `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
           So, for object 7, its y-interval `[y_c - h7, y_c + h7]` must not overlap with `[-0.049, 0.049]` if its x-interval `[x_c - h7, x_c + h7]` overlaps with the combined `x`-region `[-0.129, 0.129]`.
           
           To avoid collision with the existing `y=0` strip of objects, object 7 must be placed either above `y = 0.049 + h7 = 0.049 + 0.04904 = 0.09804` or below `y = -0.09804`.
           Let's check the surface containment for these y-coordinates.
           `y_max_center = 0.135 - h7 = 0.135 - 0.04904 = 0.08596`.
           `y_min_center = -0.08596`.
           The required `abs(y_c)` to avoid the central strip is `0.09804`.
           Since `0.08596 < 0.09804`, it means an *unrotated* object 7 cannot be placed above or below the existing three objects without colliding in the y-direction. This is the same contradiction as before, but the previous successes tell me the interpretation of collision is different.
           
           What if the actual geometry for collision means that the "effective width" is `0.08` between centers?
           Object 5: `(0,0)`
           Object 4: `(0.08,0)`
           Object 6: `(-0.08,0)`
           This forms a line of objects along `y=0`.
           `x_center_5 = 0.0`
           `x_center_4 = 0.08`
           `x_center_6 = -0.08`
           
           The available space seems to be very limited, forcing me to think outside the linear arrangement.
           I must place object 7 such that it avoids the line of objects. This means either significantly positive or negative `y`.
           The maximum y-coordinate for the center of an unrotated object 7 is `0.135 - h7 = 0.08596`.
           The minimum y-coordinate for the center of an unrotated object 7 is `-0.08596`.
           So, I can place objects at `y = 0.08` or `y = -0.08`.
           Let's try `(x=0, y=0.08, theta=0)`.
           Object 7 (center `(0, 0.08)`, unrotated, `h7=0.04904`):
           AABB: `[-0.04904, 0.04904] x [0.08 - 0.04904, 0.08 + 0.04904] = [-0.04904, 0.04904] x [0.03096, 0.12904]`.
           This AABB does not overlap with any of the x-intervals of objects 4, 5, 6, as their x-intervals effectively form `[-0.129, 0.129]`.
           However, its y-interval `[0.03096, 0.12904]` overlaps with objects 4, 5, 6's y-interval `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
           Specifically, the overlap is `[0.03096, 0.049]`. This is similar to the x-overlap observed between objects 4,5,6.
           
           Given the success of the previous placements, the collision logic seems to be:
           Two axis-aligned objects `A = [x_al, x_au] x [y_al, y_au]` and `B = [x_bl, x_bu] x [y_bl, y_bu]` are considered NOT to collide if:
           `max(x_al, x_bl) >= min(x_au, x_bu)` AND `max(y_al, y_bl) >= min(y_au, y_bu)` (this is the standard non-overlap condition)
           OR
           if they overlap, but the overlap amount is "small enough" (e.g. they only share boundaries or a small interior region). The fact that `(0,0)` and `(0.08,0)` are non-colliding for `~0.098` width objects suggests that the overlap is allowed if the distance between centers is `0.08` or more.
           
           If centers are separated by `0.08` along one axis and they are unrotated, it seems to work.
           Object 5: center `(0,0)`
           Object 4: center `(0.08,0)`
           Object 6: center `(-0.08,0)`
           
           Let's try placing object 7 such that its center is `(0, 0.08)`. This creates a similar "overlap" along the y-axis, but not along the x-axis with the previous objects.
           This means its AABB (if unrotated) would be `[-0.049, 0.049] x [0.031, 0.129]`.
           Compared to Object 5: `x`-intervals `[-0.049, 0.049]` overlap, `y`-intervals `[0.031, 0.129]` and `[-0.049, 0.049]` overlap. This is a double overlap.
           No, that's not right. The x-interval for Obj7 (centered at `(0, 0.08)`) is `[-0.049, 0.049]`. This overlaps with Obj5's x-interval.
           The y-interval for Obj7 is `[0.031, 0.129]`. This overlaps with Obj5's y-interval `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
           So, Object 7 at `(0, 0.08)` and Object 5 at `(0,0)` will *collide* if a collision implies overlap in both x and y.
           The only reason objects 4,5,6 didn't collide with each other when aligned on the x-axis, is that their *y-intervals are identical* and *x-intervals overlap*.
           But for Obj7 at `(0,0.08)` and Obj5 at `(0,0)`, *both* x-intervals and y-intervals overlap. This is a head-on collision.
           
           This means object 7 cannot be placed at `(0, 0.08)`.
           It cannot be placed at `(0, -0.08)` either.
           It cannot be placed at `(0.08, 0.08)` or `(0.08, -0.08)` because it would collide with obj 4 (or obj 6) and obj 5.
           
           The interpretation of the collision must be: a collision occurs if the *interior* of the geometric shapes overlap.
           If squares are side-by-side, their centers `(0,0)` and `(0.08,0)` means they *do* overlap.
           The fact that it was successful means either:
           a) The problem uses a different object model for collision than the AABB extents provided.
           b) The collision is not AABB.
           c) There's a tolerance for collision that is exactly `0.018` for `0.08` separation.
           d) The "collision between objects i and j" implies actual physical collision between their true geometries, and two squares can be offset by `0.08` while their side is `0.098` without interior overlap. This is geometrically impossible.
           `0.09827 / 2 = 0.049135`. So one object covers `[-0.049135, 0.049135]`.
           The other object at `x=0.08`: `[0.08 - 0.049135, 0.08 + 0.049135] = [0.030865, 0.129135]`.
           The intersection is `[0.030865, 0.049135]`. This is non-empty, so they overlap.
           
           This situation is highly confusing. The only way to move forward is to guess based on previous successes.
           The objects are laid out in a row `(-0.08, 0), (0,0), (0.08,0)`.
           The available space is `x in [-0.135, 0.135]` and `y in [-0.135, 0.135]`.
           The objects are `0.098` wide.
           
           I will try placing object 7 at the maximum `y` and maximum `x` positions, away from the established `y=0` line.
           This means `y` should be at `0.08` or `-0.08`.
           Let's try `(0.08, 0.08)` and `(-0.08, 0.08)` and similar, and `(0, 0.08)` but with a rotation this time.
           If the collision detection is based on the actual object's occupied space (not AABB), rotating an object by 45 degrees changes its effective 'width' (along its own axes) but not necessarily how it occupies a square region.
           However, I will use rotation for diversity.
           
           I will use coordinates `(x,y)` that are not `0` and not `0.08` or `-0.08` if possible, to probe for where non-collision occurs.
           The maximum `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` for the center of an unrotated object 7 is `0.135 - h7 = 0.08596`.
           The maximum `abs(x)` or `abs(y)` for the center of an object 7 rotated by `pi/4` (half-width `0.04904 * sqrt(2) = 0.06935`) is `0.135 - 0.06935 = 0.06565`.
           
           I need to place object 7 such that it avoids the horizontal band of objects `[-0.129, 0.129]` x `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
           So `y` for object 7 must be such that `y_center - h7 >= 0.049` or `y_center + h7 <= -0.049`.
           This implies `y_center >= 0.049 + 0.049 = 0.098` or `y_center <= -0.098`.
           This value `0.098` is greater than `0.08596` (the maximum allowed y-center for an unrotated object).
           And it's also greater than `0.06565` (maximum allowed y-center for a `pi/4` rotated object).
           This means that, strictly by my understanding of AABB containment and "no collision", object 7 *cannot be placed* on this surface.
           
           However, since the previous requests yielded successful placements which *did* involve AABB overlaps, I'll assume there is an implicit "tolerance" or non-standard collision rule. The most likely scenario is that two objects only collide if their true rectangular interior geometry overlaps. And the previously placed objects (`(0,0)`, `(0.08,0)`, `(-0.08,0)`) are considered not to collide.
           
           If they don't collide when their centers are 0.08 apart and their widths are 0.098, it must mean that they are considered to be "touching" at their edges. This means their bounding boxes' effective 'width' for collision is actually closer to `0.08`, not `0.098`.
           Let's assume a "slot" model: one object occupies `x` from `C_x - 0.04` to `C_x + 0.04`.
           This means object 5 occupies `[-0.04, 0.04]`.
           Object 4 occupies `[0.08 - 0.04, 0.08 + 0.04] = [0.04, 0.12]`.
           Object 6 occupies `[-0.08 - 0.04, -0.08 + 0.04] = [-0.12, -0.04]`.
           Under this model, they form a non-overlapping sequence: `[-0.12, -0.04]`, `[-0.04, 0.04]`, `[0.04, 0.12]`.
           This means the region `[-0.12, 0.12]` along `y=0` is now "full".
           
           The total `x` extent occupied is `0.12 - (-0.12) = 0.24`.
           Surface width is `0.27`.
           Remaining space at edges `0.135 - 0.12 = 0.015`. Not enough for `h7 = 0.049`.
           The total `y` extent occupied by these three is `0.049`.
           So, I need to place object 7 outside the `y in [-0.049, 0.049]` region.
           As previously calculated, required `y_c >= 0.098` or `y_c <= -0.098`.
           And allowed `abs(y_c) <= 0.08596`.
           Still no solution with this interpretation.
           
           This problem must rely on an extremely subtle interpretation. "If a placement fails multiple times, it is likely that there is a collision that you are not aware of".
           My previous placements had many failures, but the one successful placement allowed me to infer the collision rule. But even with that inference, I can't find a solution for this step.
           The only scenario where this is possible is if the objects are allowed to stack, or if object geometry can be fit diagonally in a way that AABBs don't capture.
           But objects on a surface are typically assumed to lie flat.
           
           I will try to place objects slightly off-center along the y-axis, for example `y = 0.05` or `-0.05` (which overlaps with the current objects by my AABB calculation, but might be fine under this system's collision rule).
           If `(0, 0.08, 0)` caused a collision because of overlap in both X and Y with `(0,0,0)`, then I cannot use `(0, 0.08, 0)`.
           What about `(0.08, 0.08, 0)`? This would overlap with Obj4 on X and Obj5 on Y. That's likely a collision.
           
           I will assume that the available "slots" are `x in [-0.12, -0.04]`, `x in [-0.04, 0.04]`, `x in [0.04, 0.12]` along `y=0`.
           I need to find a space for an object of half-width `0.049`.
           I will place it at maximum `x` in the available `y` space, and also vary angles.
           Let's reconsider the max `y` for an unrotated object: `0.08596`.
           If I place object 7 at `(0, 0.085)`, this gives:
           AABB: `[-0.04904, 0.04904] x [0.085 - 0.04904, 0.085 + 0.04904] = [-0.04904, 0.04904] x [0.03596, 0.13404]`.
           This `y`-range `[0.03596, 0.13404]` has substantial overlap with `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
           But the x-range `[-0.04904, 0.04904]` means it overlaps with Object 5.
           If the distance between centers along one axis is `0.08` and the other is `0`, it's not a collision. If distances are `0` and `0.08`, it's a collision. This is the only inference from the previous successes.
           So I need `abs(x_c) >= 0.08` OR `abs(y_c) >= 0.08`. And this condition needs to hold for all three obstacles.
           
           Let's try:
           1. `(0.0, 0.08, 0)` is a bad idea due to direct overlap with Obj5 on x-axis.
           2. `(0.08, 0.08, 0)` is a bad idea due to direct overlap with Obj4 on x-axis.
           3. `(-0.08, 0.08, 0)` is a bad idea due to direct overlap with Obj6 on x-axis.
           
           This means object 7's x-coordinate must be such that it does not align with `0`, `0.08`, or `-0.08`.
           Let `x_c = 0.04`. Then for `(0.04, y_c)`:
           For object 5 (center `0,0`): `abs(0.04) < 0.08`, so I need `abs(y_c) >= 0.08`.
           For object 4 (center `0.08,0`): `abs(0.04 - 0.08) = abs(-0.04) < 0.08`, so I need `abs(y_c) >= 0.08`.
           For object 6 (center `-0.08,0`): `abs(0.04 - (-0.08)) = abs(0.12) >= 0.08`. This is okay on x-axis. So no condition on `y_c` here regarding obj 6.
           
           So if `x_c = 0.04`, then `y_c` must be `0.08` or more.
           The problem is still `abs(y_c) >= 0.08` is too large for container `0.08596` vs required `0.098`.
           The only way I can place it is if the definition of "avoid collision" for "objects i and j" doesn't consider the already existing objects as "fixed obstacles" in the same strong sense as in the initial setup, which seems to contradict the prompt.
           
           I will try to place it at the edges of the surface, with a variety of rotations. It's the only logical approach left given the strange collision rules.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has the single surface `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           Four objects are now placed and form fixed obstacles:
           Object 5 (ID: 5): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.0, y: 0.0)`. Half-extents `h5 = 0.049136`. AABB: `[-0.049136, 0.049136] x [-0.049136, 0.049136]`.
           Object 4 (ID: 4): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.08, y: 0.0)`. Half-extents `h4 = 0.049137`. AABB: `[0.030863, 0.129137] x [-0.049137, 0.049137]`.
           Object 6 (ID: 6): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: -0.08, y: 0.0)`. Half-extents `h6 = 0.049286`. AABB: `[-0.129286, -0.030714] x [-0.049286, 0.049286]`.
           Object 7 (ID: 7): `(surf_idx: 0, theta: 0.0, x: 0.085, y: 0.085)`. Half-extents `h7 = 0.04904`. AABB: `[0.085 - 0.04904, 0.085 + 0.04904] x [0.085 - 0.04904, 0.085 + 0.04904] = [0.03596, 0.13404] x [0.03596, 0.13404]`.
           
           The new object (ID: 8) has dimensions `(0.07403949856587966, 0.07403949856587966)`. Its half-extents are `h8x = 0.0370197` and `h8y = 0.0370197`. For simplicity, I'll use `h8 = 0.037`.
           This object is smaller than the previous ones (approx 0.074 vs 0.098). This is good, it means more space.
           
           The critical insight from previous rounds: The collision detection is not a standard AABB overlap.
           The successful placements imply a more lenient collision rule:
           - Objects 5, 4, 6 are laid out horizontally at `y=0`. Their centers are `(-0.08,0)`, `(0,0)`, `(0.08,0)`. Even though their AABBs overlap, they are not considered colliding. The x-interval occupied by these three is roughly `[-0.129, 0.129]`. The y-interval is roughly `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
           - Object 7 is at `(0.085, 0.085)`. Its AABB is `[0.03596, 0.13404] x [0.03596, 0.13404]`.
             - Collision with Object 5: Obj7's x-interval `[0.03596, 0.13404]` overlaps with Obj5's `[-0.049, 0.049]`. Obj7's y-interval `[0.03596, 0.13404]` overlaps with Obj5's `[-0.049, 0.049]`. This is an overlap in both x and y. So, *this pattern is allowed*.
             - Collision with Object 4: Obj7's x-interval `[0.03596, 0.13404]` overlaps with Obj4's `[0.030863, 0.129137]`. Obj7's y-interval `[0.03596, 0.13404]` overlaps with Obj4's `[-0.049137, 0.049137]`. Again, overlap in both x and y. *This pattern is also allowed*.
             - Collision with Object 6: Obj7's x-interval `[0.03596, 0.13404]` does not overlap with Obj6's `[-0.129286, -0.030714]`. No collision here.
           
           The crucial finding is that *overlapping AABBs in both x and y directions IS allowed by the system*.
           The only time a collision must be avoided is if the overlap is "too much".
           What constitutes "too much"? The successful placements indicate that if objects are "stacked" or "aligned" such that their centers are directly on top of each other (like `(0,0)` and `(0,0.08)` was guessed to be a collision), that would be an issue. But if they are offset diagonally, it seems fine.
           
           Let `surf_half = 0.135`.
           For object 8 (unrotated), max `abs(x_c)` or `abs(y_c)` is `surf_half - h8 = 0.135 - 0.037 = 0.098`.
           For object 8 (rotated by `pi/4`), its AABB half-width `hw8_rot = h8 * sqrt(2) = 0.037 * 1.41421 = 0.05232`.
           Max `abs(x_c)` or `abs(y_c)` for `pi/4` rotated object 8 is `0.135 - 0.05232 = 0.08268`.
           
           There is a lot of space for object 8. I can try placing it in the remaining "corners" of the surface that are not heavily occupied.
           The existing objects are mostly concentrated around `y=0` and `(0.085, 0.085)`.
           The regions `(x, y)` such that `x < 0` and `y < 0`, and `x < 0` and `y > 0` are less occupied.
           Specifically, `(-0.085, 0.085)` and `(-0.085, -0.085)` and `(0.085, -0.085)` seem like good candidates.
           
           Let's try `(x_c = -0.085, y_c = 0.085, theta = 0)`.
           AABB for Obj8: `[-0.085 - h8, -0.085 + h8] x [0.085 - h8, 0.085 + h8] = [-0.122, -0.048] x [0.048, 0.122]`.
           Check collision with existing objects:
           - Obj5 `(0,0)`: AABB `[-0.049, 0.049] x [-0.049, 0.049]`.
             Obj8 x-interval `[-0.122, -0.048]` overlaps with Obj5 x-interval `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
             Obj8 y-interval `[0.048, 0.122]` overlaps with Obj5 y-interval `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
             This is an overlap in both x and y, similar to Obj7 and Obj5. Should be okay.
           - Obj4 `(0.08,0)`: AABB `[0.03, 0.129] x [-0.049, 0.049]`.
             Obj8 x-interval `[-0.122, -0.048]` no overlap with Obj4 x-interval `[0.03, 0.129]`. No collision.
           - Obj6 `(-0.08,0)`: AABB `[-0.129, -0.03] x [-0.049, 0.049]`.
             Obj8 x-interval `[-0.122, -0.048]` overlaps with Obj6 x-interval `[-0.129, -0.03]`.
             Obj8 y-interval `[0.048, 0.122]` overlaps with Obj6 y-interval `[-0.049, 0.049]`.
             Again, overlap in both x and y, similar to Obj7 and Obj6 (which was no collision). Should be okay.
           - Obj7 `(0.085, 0.085)`: AABB `[0.036, 0.134] x [0.036, 0.134]`.
             Obj8 x-interval `[-0.122, -0.048]` no overlap with Obj7 x-interval `[0.036, 0.134]`. No collision.
           
           So `(-0.085, 0.085, 0)` seems like a very good candidate.
           Also, `(0.0, 0.0, 0)` could be tried, as the object is smaller.
           Obj8 AABB `[-0.037, 0.037] x [-0.037, 0.037]`.
           This is fully contained within Obj5 AABB `[-0.049, 0.049] x [-0.049, 0.049]`. This is a classic containment collision.
           However, since previous overlaps were allowed, maybe containment is also allowed? This is usually not the case. It's more likely that overlapping "touching" is allowed, but full containment is not. I will avoid `(0,0,0)`.
           
           I'll try filling the corners `(-0.085, 0.085)`, `(0.085, -0.085)`, `(-0.085, -0.085)`. And also points around the periphery.
