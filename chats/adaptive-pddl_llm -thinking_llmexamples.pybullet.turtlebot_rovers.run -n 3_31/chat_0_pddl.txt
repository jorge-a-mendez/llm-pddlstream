           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate objective is `new-axiom@0()`, and I need to come up with a plan to make it happen. Based on the axiom, it boils down to achieving two things: getting images of objects (`receivedimage`) and analyzing samples (`receivedanalysis`). My immediate thought is, let's look at what needs to be in place to achieve both those goals.
           
           First, I examined the conditions in the initial state to see if any parts of the goal were already met. The initial state already satisfies the first few conditions. No problems there.
           
           Now, let's tackle getting images and sending those analyses back. For `receivedimage`, I'll need to use the `send_image` action. To do that, I'll first need to take those images, which is where the `take_image` action comes in. To successfully take images, the rovers have to be calibrated. Calibration can be handled using the `calibrate` action. These actions require certain preconditions. The rovers need to be at the correct configuration and the objects of interest must be visible.
           
           Looking at what's in place, I have two rovers (`v12`, `v14`), a camera (`v10`) on both, and a lander (`v9`). Both rovers have the ability to see the objects, but the configuration of these rovers is what's tricky. Both rovers are *at* a configuration different from the configurations where they can *see* these objects, and the actions I have don't allow me to move the rovers to these key configurations.
           
           With that I realized that the precondition to `take_image` required the rover to be at `#o3` configuration, but the rover *is* at another one (`v13`). There is no option to *move* the rover to that `#o3` from `v13` or `v15`.
           
           The same logic applies to `receivedanalysis` too. I need to get analysis of two types: soil and stone. This would require the `sample_rock` action and then the `send_analysis` action. The challenge comes again from the rover configurations. I *can* take a sample as both rovers are above the rocks, but there is no mechanism to have the rovers move to a different configuration.
           
           I'm starting to see a pattern here. The available actions – moving the rovers and dropping rocks – are not sufficient to achieve the overall goal.
           
           I've carefully re-read the available moves, and my conclusion is that the preconditions for taking the necessary images and samples will never be satisfied given the initial state and the permitted actions. Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal with these restrictions.
           
           The rovers are stuck at their initial configurations, and, given their fixed positions, I cannot meet the necessary preconditions. Therefore, I can't construct a plan to achieve the desired goal. It seems I am stuck here.
