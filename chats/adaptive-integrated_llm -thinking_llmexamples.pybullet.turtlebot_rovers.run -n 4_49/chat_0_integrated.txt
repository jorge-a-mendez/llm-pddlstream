           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this `new-axiom@0()` goal, and it's looking pretty tough.  The core of it revolves around getting these rovers to take images and analyze rocks – specifically, achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  I need a plan, but first, I'm going to carefully dissect the setup.
           
           From the problem, it's clear I can't just dive in. The initial state is crucial. I start by checking the preconditions for the actions I'd need to achieve these. I see that things like `imagevisible` and `comvisible` are key, along with the `atconf` condition: `atconf(?v, ?q)` – the rover needs to be at a specific configuration, right?
           
           Now, the problem immediately hits a wall.  I've got `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15` initially.  That's locked down.  The issue is that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` facts, critical for grabbing images and sending data, all have these '#' objects as their second argument: `#o3`, `#o0`, and such.  The `conf` facts show these are *possible* configurations, but the rovers aren't actually *at* them.  I've got the `move` actions, but they only shuffle the rover *back to the same location!*
           
           The challenge? The only `move` actions keep the rovers at their current positions.  No `move` action takes a rover from `v13` or `v15` to `#o3`, `#o0` or `#o5`. This means that `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`, the actions I *need* to achieve the goal, are blocked because I can never get the rovers to the right configurations.
           
           I've reread the problem statement, specifically the bit about '#' configurations, just to be *doubly* sure. It reinforces that the *initial* `atconf` positions are the starting point, and that the moves *must* obey them unless specifically altered.
           
           Therefore, since the only `move` actions provided keep the rovers at `v13` and `v15`, and the `imagevisible` predicates require the rover to be at `#o3` or `#o0` to observe or communicate with the target, the key action `take_image` and, consequently `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are *impossible* to execute.  Without image reception and rock analysis, the entire goal is a no-go.
           
           So, yeah, after examining all of the initial conditions, I've got to conclude: this goal is not achievable. There's no possible sequence of actions that can satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` conditions, given the constraints of the provided `move` actions.
