(Thoughts: **A Plan for Object Placement**
           
           I've been tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5, size: 0.098x0.098) on a square surface (surface 0, defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). This is the initial request, so there are no constraints from previous placements.
           
           My approach will be to leverage the object's square shape and the surface's geometry. Stability requires the object's AABB to be fully within the surface's AABB. Since the object is square, its AABB changes with rotation angle. I'll consider five key rotation angles: 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, and π/2.
           
           For each angle, I will determine the effective dimensions of the rotated square. This will involve calculating the effective width/height of the AABB as a function of the rotation angle. Then, I'll calculate the bounds of possible (x, y) coordinates for placement, ensuring the object's AABB remains within the surface's boundaries. Since the object is quite small, there's ample space for multiple placements on the surface. I'll then generate 10 placements for each of the five angles, spread systematically across the available area.
           
           For each angle, I'll calculate the bounds within which the center of the square object may reside and remain within the surface. I'll utilize a linear space distribution for the (x,y) locations within these bounds. The output will be a list of 50 placements, each described as a tuple: (surf_idx, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement for Object 5, a square, and now it's time to find suitable spots for Object 4, another square with similar dimensions, on the same surface. The key is to make sure Object 4 doesn't overlap with Object 5.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 5 is already in place, and its position gives me the "forbidden" zone on the surface. Object 4 is the new square, and it can rotate freely. I will perform calculations to determine valid coordinates.
           
           I'm aiming for 50 valid placements for Object 4.  The strategy involves iterating through a few angles and for each one, calculating a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates.  Then, for each possible center point (x,y), I will perform collision checks with Object 5.
           
           For each angle, I will first calculate the effective dimensions of Object 4, taking rotation into account. Next, I define the region where Object 4's center *could* be.  Then, I calculate the rectangular "forbidden" region within that bounding box due to Object 5.  Coordinates in the forbidden region will be considered to collide with Object 5.
           
           I will iterate through some angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           The core of the collision check is to make sure Object 4's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) does not overlap with Object 5's AABB.  This is a simple intersection test.
           
           I've defined a grid of valid coordinates and then filtered it, this approach is the most efficient. I then check each (x,y) within the bounding box to check for no intersection between AABBs. I will generate several points per angle.
           
           The bottom-line is that I iterate through potential (x,y) coordinates within the surface bounds, perform collision checks, and keep the placements that are not collisions. I then trim down to the first 50 valid solutions.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on a Surface**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 6) on a square surface (Surface 0). I need to make sure these placements don't cause any collisions with two existing square objects (ID 5 and ID 4) already on the surface.
           
           **Scene Details:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** This surface is a square with an area of `0.27 x 0.27`.
           *   **Object 5:** This square is positioned at `(x=-0.0857, y=-0.0857)` with an edge length of approximately `0.098`. It occupies a region of the surface.
           *   **Object 4:** This square is placed at `(x=-0.088, y=0.024)`. It's dimensions are approximately `0.094`. It occupies a region of the surface.
           *   **Object 6:** The new object (ID 6) is also a square, with an edge length of about `0.085`.
           
           **My Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Rotation:** I'll test the new object at 5 different angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3\*pi/8, pi/2). This will help me assess a range of orientations.
           2.  **Effective AABB:** For each angle, I need to figure out the "effective" square size of the object to see the size it takes up. It's `s6 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           3.  **Valid Center Range:** For each angle, I'll calculate the valid x and y coordinates where the center of object 6 can be.
           4.  **Grid of Points:** I will create a grid of points within those valid center ranges. I will aim for a 15x15 grid of placement points for each angle.
           5.  **Collision Check:** At each grid point and for each angle, I will calculate the AABB of the new object and check to see if it collides with the AABB of Objects 5 and 4.
           6.  **Valid Placements:** I will then collect all placements that *don't* collide. I will stop after I find 50 valid locations.
           
           I have double checked the calculations to be certain the AABB boundaries are accurate. I am ready to implement the strategy.
