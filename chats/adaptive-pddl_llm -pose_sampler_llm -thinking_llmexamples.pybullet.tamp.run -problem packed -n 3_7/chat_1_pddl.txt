           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Provided Actions**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this planning problem with the goal of getting `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  Simple enough, right?  The catch is, I'm extremely limited in what actions I can actually use.
           
           First, I analyzed the initial state.  Right now, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all sitting on `v11`.  Perfect! They are all supported by `v11`.
           
           Now, the plan. I need to get these objects on `v16`. That means using `pick` and `place` actions to move them.  I checked the preconditions for these actions, making sure things like `atpose`, `handempty`, and the appropriate collision-free tests are satisfied.  There are a lot of negative conditions and I am assuming they are all false as they are not explicitly specified. These checks all seem to work in theory.
           
           Here's the problem: The *only* action instance I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This does nothing useful. It simply changes the base configuration, which doesn't help me pick up or place any objects.
           
           Since I'm restricted to that one essentially pointless action and the goal is to place objects, I can't move anything, and therefore, I can't achieve the goal.  I don't have the tools I need to do the job.  I can't instantiate any `pick` or `place` actions, which are crucial. The goal state is therefore *not* reachable given the available action instances.
