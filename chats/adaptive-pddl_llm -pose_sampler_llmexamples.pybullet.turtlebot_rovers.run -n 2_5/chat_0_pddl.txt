User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5, with some small variations. There's a vertical obstacle at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the environment. Some of these are near the walls (obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 19, 20), and some are more central (obstacles 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18).
           
           The target point is (1.2016335359737978 0.4727181057404455). I need to find 3 base positions within a distance of 2 from this point. I will try to find positions that are not too close to the x=0 wall (obstacle 5) and also not too close to other obstacles. I'll prioritize positions with good line of sight.
           
           Positions:
           (1.2016335359737978 2.4727181057404455)
           (2.2016335359737978 0.4727181057404455)
           (0.2016335359737978 0.4727181057404455)
