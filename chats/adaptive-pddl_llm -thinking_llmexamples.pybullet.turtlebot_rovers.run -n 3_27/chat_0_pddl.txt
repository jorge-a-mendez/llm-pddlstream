           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of various conditions related to rover configurations, image reception, and rock analysis.  The initial state provides us with the starting positions of the rovers (`v12` at `v13`, `v14` at `v15`), storage availability (`free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`), and the existence of images and rock types.  Crucially, the goal requires the reception of images for objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) and the analysis results of both a stone and soil.
           
           Now, here's the rub. I'm limited to a specific set of actions: `move` and `drop_rock`.  The core of the issue lies in how to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` without the actions which directly result in those predicates being true.
           
           To receive an image, I need to use `send_image`.  To get an image to be sent, I need to `take_image` it. To analyze a rock, I need to use `sample_rock`. To send the analyzed results, I need to use `send_analysis`. These operations are *not* permitted.
           
           The allowed actions, `move` and `drop_rock`, simply cannot make progress towards reaching the goal. The actions *are not applicable* for achieving either image reception or analysis reporting.
           Based on the restrictions provided, the goal is definitively unachievable. There is no plan that can be assembled with the provided set of valid action instances to achieve the desired state.
