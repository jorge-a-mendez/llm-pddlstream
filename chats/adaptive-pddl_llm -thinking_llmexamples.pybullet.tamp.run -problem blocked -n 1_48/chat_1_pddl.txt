           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Immovable Goal: A Deep Dive into the PR2-TAMP Domain**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to figure out how to satisfy this `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `pr2-tamp` domain.  Breaking it down, it's about making sure something is `on` another thing, and there's a type constraint in there too.  The axiom tells me I need to find an object, let's call it `?green`, that's both `on` something (`v18`) and has a specific `type`.
           
           I started by scanning the initial state to see if anything already fits the bill.  I found that both `v8` and `v12` have the correct `type` predicate.  So, the challenge boils down to getting one of them, or possibly both, `on` `v18`.  The definition of `on` is crucial here: it implies the object needs to be both *supported* and *at a specific pose*.
           
           I dug into the initial state, looking at `v8` and `v12`.  Both are at some pose, but they're not *supported* by `v18`.  Essentially, to satisfy the `on` predicate, I have to figure out how to *move* one of these objects to get it both in the right pose and supported by `v18`.
           
           That's where the `place` action comes in. This is the only action that, crucially, allows an object to *become* supported and *in the correct pose*.  But, before you can *place* something, you have to *pick* it up.  To pick, the robot has to *kinematically* be in the correct position for grasping.
           
           This is where things went sideways.  All the `kin` predicates have `q = #o3`, which means the robot base has to be in the configuration `#o3` for all pick and place actions. *However* the initial state says that `atbconf(v3)` is true. There's only one move base action available, which moves the base from `v3` to `v3`. It does nothing.
           
           Essentially, the robot's base is in `v3`, but the planning system expects `#o3` for all pick-and-place actions. The robot *cannot* move to `#o3`, therefore the preconditions for *pick* are never satisfied. It looks like a classic precondition violation.  
           
           A *pick* action requires the base configuration to be at `#o3`. However, the base is currently at `v3`, and there's no way to reach `#o3`.  This creates a critical impasse, as all *pick* and *place* actions need this.  No *pick* means nothing can be held. No *place* means I cannot change the `atpose` of objects.
           
           Since *pick* and *place* are impossible, the goal, which demands a change in `atpose`, is effectively unachievable. This makes the goal unreachable given the limitations. The current state doesn't allow me to move anything. So, no object can ever be put `on` `v18` in this configuration.  It's a dead end. Therefore, I conclude the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It's a fundamental conflict between the base's position and the kinematic requirements of the actions.
