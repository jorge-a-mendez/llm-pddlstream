           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Deep Dive into Plan Execution**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to figure out how to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to ensuring an object of a specific type is placed on another object. I've broken down the conditions, and it looks like I need to get either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Both are suitable candidates based on their type and stackability.
           
           Now, here's where things get interesting. The key to moving them is *picking* and *placing* them, which hinges on having specific kinematic information (kin facts) and base configuration control. Unfortunately, the only allowed action instance I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It seems incredibly limited. This `move_base` simply moves the base from its current position to the exact same position and makes the `canmove()` predicate false.
           
           Now I am at an impasse. The required pick and place actions, crucial for repositioning the objects, are not allowed. Furthermore, the `move_base` action does *nothing* to alter the positions of the objects or the supporting facts.
           
           I've re-examined the initial state and the goal. The relationships between objects are clear: `v8` is on `v11`, and `v12` is on `v14`. To get either of them on `v18`, I’d need to use `pick` and `place` actions that I am not allowed to utilize.
           
           My conclusion is: given the incredibly restrictive set of allowed action instances - the single `move_base` action does not provide any ability to alter the object positions and hence cannot achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the currently provided actions. It is a mathematical impossibility given the constraints.
