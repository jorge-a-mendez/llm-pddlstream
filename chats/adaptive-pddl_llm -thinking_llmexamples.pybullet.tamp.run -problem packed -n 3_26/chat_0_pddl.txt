           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

           Okay, so the task at hand is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` neatly stacked on `v16`. Specifically, I need to achieve the following: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Seems straightforward enough: pick them up, put them down.
           
           Let's break down the current situation. Right now, `v8` is perched on `v9` and held up by `v11`, `v12` is situated on `v13` supported by `v11`, and `v14` is found at `v15` held up by `v11`.  And importantly, `v16` seems like a solid receptacle.  Given the goal, I know I must move `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` from their current positions (currently each supported by `v11`) to `v16`.
           
           My strategy? Simple: 1) Pick each object up from its supporting object `v11`, and 2) Place them on `v16`.
           
           The actions I've got at my disposal: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This can modify the `atbconf` state and some other internal states, but nothing useful for this particular stacking task. Looks like I'm lacking the essential `pick` and `place` actions that I need.
           
           To achieve my goal I'd need the following: 
           1.  `(pick v8 v11)`
           2.  `(place v8 v16)`
           3.  `(pick v12 v11)`
           4.  `(place v12 v16)`
           5.  `(pick v14 v11)`
           6.  `(place v14 v16)`
           
           Without these critical actions, this goal is currently unattainable with this particular set of available action instances.  We're stuck.
