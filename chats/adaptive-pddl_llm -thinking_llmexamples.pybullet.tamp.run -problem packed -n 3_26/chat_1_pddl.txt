               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Analysis: An Impossible Task**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on v16, specifically in a "supported" configuration, meaning they must be at a specific pose. Currently, these objects are supported by v11 at distinct poses (v9, v13, v15, respectively) and I have an empty hand.
           
           My initial thought process zeroes in on identifying the crucial 'place' pose - the supported pose on v16, which is #o2 for all three objects.  Based on my knowledge, I need to pick up each object and place it. This requires the robot to have its base at the right configuration, and its arm to be in a valid kinematic state for each pick and place operation.
           
           Now, the plan seems straightforward. I see that the `kin` facts indicate that arm `v4` can pick and place these objects, provided the base is at configuration `#o3`.  This is where the problem emerges.  The initial state indicates the robot base is at configuration `v3`. The *only* available `move_base` action doesn't actually *move* the base; it merely re-enables the robot's ability to move without changing the configuration.  There is no way to transition the base from its initial configuration `v3` to the required configuration `#o3`.
           
           Given this crucial limitation, I conclude that there is no valid sequence of actions to transition the objects from their initial support (v11) to the desired support (v16) due to the constraint on the robot's base configuration. The `move_base` actions that would be required to enable the required pick-and-place operations are simply not available, rendering the goal unachievable.
