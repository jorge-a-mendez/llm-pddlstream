           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Understanding and Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to place three robot bases, given a target point, ensuring they're within a certain distance (2 units) and inside the arena boundaries (a square from -2.5 to 2.5).  The robot needs to face the target automatically, so the angle part is handled.  The tough part is avoiding collisions and ensuring a clear line of sight to the target, considering all these fixed obstacles.
           
           First, I looked at the scene's setup, a room (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There are walls (obstacles 0-4), but they mainly just serve as boundaries, so I have to make sure my generated points are inside this walkable area. Then there is a crucial central, vertical "wall" obstacle (5) that is very important to consider, a thin rectangle dividing the space down the middle. Lastly, I've got a list of smaller AABBs.
           
           The goal is to pick points that are some distance away from the target, up to a maximum distance, 2.0. So, I will need to substitute the placeholder "target_point" with an actual coordinate like (tx, ty). I need to generate three valid positions (bx, by) that satisfy distance constraints, room boundaries, and obstacle avoidance.
           
           The strategy involves finding points "behind" the target. For a target point, I'll calculate several positions. Then, I need to check if those positions are valid. The main challenge will be the central wall (AABB 5) because if the target is on one side, then the robot must be on that same side to have line of sight.
           
           Let's assume the target point has been substituted.
           
           I need to make sure:
           
           1.  The point is in distance.
           2.  The point is within the room.
           3.  The point is not inside an obstacle AABB.
           4.  The line of sight between the base point and target doesn't intersect any obstacles.
           
           So, I devised a set of tests to validate each position, including the "no-go zones". The most challenging is line of sight (LOS) as I need to test for line/AABB intersections. Specifically, it must not intersect the central wall to view the target.
           
           I will take the target point, generate potential positions with varying distance/angle. I will then test those generated points against known fixed obstacles and the rule with same-side logic around the central wall (with some checks for line-of-sight too). I need to generate diverse points by varying distance and angle, and filtering for invalid positions. The final test will also incorporate the obstacles 6-22 to avoid collisions.
           
           If the target happens to be *inside* the central wall - in theory, my method might not find a solution, but I need a way to deal with that. I will assume it's unlikely to happen in test data and the code.
           
           For this to all work I've created the function `is_valid_candidate` and a few helper methods. Now let's try this against real target positions!

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I've gathered. The previous attempts failed due to some discrepancies. My initial assumption about simple bounding boxes for obstacle checks was flawed. The critical piece of information I was missing was the implicit "robot radius" *r* = 0.15.  This radius dramatically alters the effective obstacle geometry. It expands the bounding boxes and narrows the navigable space. For instance, the central vertical wall now has an effective "fat" width, and the robot needs to stay clear of it. I need to consider this radius, which significantly influences my collision detection.
           
           **Identifying and Addressing the Robot Radius Issue**
           
           The first major clue was the collision feedback stating that (0.17, 0.05) "collided with" the central wall, which is impossible without padding or an implicit radius.  Also, the (0.17, 2.45) colliding with the top wall. Both required the radius.  After thorough examination, I deduced that the feedback was correctly reporting collisions against a robot with the radius. This requires expanded AABBs for collision checks (e.g., now the walls extend an extra 0.15 around them). My algorithm needs a radical adjustment for the new model, especially related to central wall.  
           
           **New Strategy and Collision Logic**
           
           Based on this, a revised strategy is needed. A solid position should be determined based on:
           1.  **Valid Position**: robot must be within bounds: `x: [-2.3, 2.3], y: [-2.3, 2.3]`.
           2.  **Distance**: the distance from the target must be <= 2, given the information provided.
           3.  **No Collision**: collision must be avoided with any AABB *after* expansion based on the radius.  I will handle this with expanded_obstacles_data.
           4.  **Line of Sight**: the key test is the line of sight for the central wall, specifically ensuring `rx > 0.2` or `rx < -0.2` if necessary.
           
           I defined a concise function: `is_valid_position(px, py)` to implement and ensure these collision and valid area checks.
           
           **Candidate Position Analysis**
           
           I tested a number of positions using the function to ensure the logic was in the correct space. The positions are:
           - (1.44 2.18)
           - (1.30 1.68)
           - (0.94 1.31)
           
           They all meet the criteria. There is no collision with walls, no collision with the 'expanded' obstacle (central and local) using a radius of 0.15 and are within reach of the distance from the target.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Suitable Robot Positions**
           
           Given the new target point, `(0.20163359642028809, -2.3174240589141846, 0.20100000500679016)`, I've re-evaluated the problem based on past failure data and determined the robot's radius is likely `R = 0.15`. This means all obstacles need to be inflated by this amount for collision detection.
           
           My approach is as follows:
           
           1.  **Establish Boundaries:** The robot's center must be within `x: [-2.3, 2.3]` and `y: [-2.3, 2.3]` to stay within the environment.
           2.  **Central Wall:** The central wall, represented by `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, creates a crucial constraint. With the expanded obstacle (radius of 0.15), any suitable position must have an x-coordinate greater than 0.2 to avoid collision and maintain a clear line of sight.
           
           3.  **Obstacle Checks:** I've systematically checked the robot's potential positions against all the other obstacles, ensuring that the inflated AABBs don't overlap with the robot's proposed location.
           
           I've generated several candidates:
           
           *   **(0.2016 -1.8174)**: Located directly above the target, this position is at a distance of 0.5 and satisfies all constraints.
           *   **(0.7016 -1.4514)**: Situated to the right and above the target with a distance of 1.0, this candidate also meets the established criteria.
           *   **(1.2623 -1.2568)**: Located even further right and above with a distance of 1.5, I ensure the position also meets all criteria.
           All three satisfy the necessary `x > 0.2` requirement.
           
           These are the 3 points I'm going to propose.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Robot Placement for New Target Point**
           
           Based on the feedback, I've confirmed that the robot's radius of 0.15 is accurate for collision detection.  The key takeaway from previous failures is the central wall (obstacle 5) and its inflated range of [-0.2, 0.2]. I've learned that the robot's x-coordinate (rx) must be on the same side of this wall as the target's x-coordinate (tx).  A collision will happen if this isn't the case.
           
           Now, I have a new target: (2.1396, 0.2872). Since the target's tx is 2.1396 (greater than 0.2), rx must also be greater than 0.2. I also need to make sure the robot stays within the room's limits of x: [-2.3, 2.3] and y: [-2.3, 2.3], and that the robot is no more than 2 units away from the target.
           
           I've examined the relevant obstacles, inflating them by 0.15 for safety. I then looked at possible robot positions and picked three candidates.  These are generated by finding points a distance of 1 away from the target, and checking they satisfied the requirements:
           
           1.  **(1.1396, 0.2872)** -  This is to the left of the target, and seems safe based on the obstacle checks.
           
           2.  **(2.1396, -0.7128)** -  This is below the target.  All collision checks have been passed.
           
           3.  **(2.1396, 1.2872)** - This is above the target.  Checks also passed here.
           
           These are the candidates that I think are possible solutions.

Model:     **Analyzing Robot Placement for New Target Point**
           
           Based on the feedback, I've confirmed that the robot's radius of 0.15 is accurate for collision detection.  The key takeaway from previous failures is the central wall (obstacle 5) and its inflated range of [-0.2, 0.2]. I've learned that the robot's x-coordinate (rx) must be on the same side of this wall as the target's x-coordinate (tx).  A collision will happen if this isn't the case.
           
           Now, I have a new target: (2.1396, 0.2872). Since the target's tx is 2.1396 (greater than 0.2), rx must also be greater than 0.2. I also need to make sure the robot stays within the room's limits of x: [-2.3, 2.3] and y: [-2.3, 2.3], and that the robot is no more than 2 units away from the target.
