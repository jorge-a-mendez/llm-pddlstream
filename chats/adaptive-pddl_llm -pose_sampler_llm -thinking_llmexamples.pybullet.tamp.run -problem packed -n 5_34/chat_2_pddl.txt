(Thoughts: **Planning to Move Objects**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The task is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current positions on surface v11 to a new surface, v20.  My goal is `on(?o, v20)` for each of these objects, which translates to `supported(?o, ?p, v20)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. It looks like the robot's arm, specifically arm v4, is going to handle this.
           
           Breaking it down, each object needs to be picked up from v11 and placed on v20. It's a straightforward sequence: pick-and-place, repeated for each object.  The key is that I need to make sure each object is *supported* on v20 after it is placed.
           
           I see that the robot's arms, v4 and v6, are available.  v4 is controllable and handempty, and importantly, it's the only one with the necessary `kin` predicates to interact with the objects.  v6 is handempty, too, but apparently useless for this particular task. This confirms the plan will revolve around `v4`.  The robot has to move to base config `#o3` to pick and place. So, I will need to move the base.
           
           The available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. `move_base` changes the robot's base configuration. The `pick` and `place` actions require the robot to be in the right base configuration (#o3) and the right pose with respect to the objects.
           
           Now, let's nail down the specifics of each action:
           
           1.  **`move_base`**: Initially, I'm at `v3`. I need to get to `#o3` to use the available `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           2.  **`pick`**: This requires `kin` info, that the object is `atpose`, that the arm is `handempty`, and that the robot is at base configuration `#o3`.
           
           3.  **`place`**: This requires the `kin` info, that the robot is in a good place to grasp it, that the robot is at base configuration `#o3`.
           
           Based on my analysis of the `kin` predicates, I know that for placing objects, I am given a pose `#o2` supported on `v20`. So the `supported` predicate is already met.
           
           Here's the plan I've constructed:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` - Get to the right base configuration.
           2.  **For each object:**
               *   `pick` the object from its current location on v11.
               *   `place` the object on v20, using the available pose `#o2`.
           
           The key here is that since `place` will result in the `atpose` of `#o2` (which is `supported` by `v20`), all that needs to happen is to repeatedly pick and place. There doesn't appear to be any need to move the base configuration again.
           
           Finally, regarding the plan, it's pretty clear and straightforward. The order in which I move the objects shouldn't matter as long as I get them all to v20. The cost, based on my understanding of similar systems, is going to be the cost to `move_base` the robot, plus the cost of each `pick` and each `place`.  The specifics of *that* are a separate question.
