(Thoughts: **Placing an Object 4: A Comprehensive Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a surface. The surface is defined by an AABB, Surface 0, which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  The object's base AABB dimensions are `(0.09893090744515973, 0.09893090744515975)`, which I'll call `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y`. "Stable" means the object is fully within the surface boundaries. I interpret the problem statement to mean that the given `x`, `y`, and `theta` define the *center* of the *rotated* object's AABB.
           
           Since the object's width and height are so close (meaning the object is almost a square), the approach is as follows. I'll make sure to account for rotation.
           
           1.  **Rotation = 0**:  I'll start by generating a grid of placements with the object axis-aligned with the surface.  I calculate the valid range for the object's center based on half of object size, making sure I don't go outside the bounds of Surface 0.
           
           2.  **Rotation = pi/2**:  I'll include placements for the object rotated 90 degrees. Given the object's AABB being nearly square, this is essentially the same as rotation = 0.
           
           3.  **Rotation = pi/4**:  For a bit of diversity, I'll add a few placements where the object is rotated 45 degrees. The valid range for the center is the smallest. I place the center plus several corner and edge locations, if possible.
           
           To be precise, I calculate the `W` and `H` of the *rotated* object AABB using `abs(obj_size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * sin(theta))` and `abs(obj_size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * cos(theta))` respectively. Then, I subtract `W / 2` and `H / 2` from the surface limits. In the code, I added extra checks to handle special cases to make sure valid placements exist for each rotation.
           
           My code then loops and adds placements, with added checks to ensure a grid layout. The correct ranges have been generated and applied, now I can output the list of stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions with Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, here's my plan to place the new object (ID 7) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into the already-placed Object ID 4. I've got to ensure the object's square footprint fits within the surface constraints and around Object ID 4, which is currently taking up space in the bottom-left corner of the area.
           
           Based on the measurements, Object 4's dimensions are roughly 0.099 x 0.099, and it's placed with a center at (-0.0855, -0.0855), making its approximate AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) area:  [-0.135, -0.036] x [-0.135, -0.036]. I have those values cached, I won't recalculate those.
           
           I've got the dimensions for Object 7, with each side measuring 0.096, and I'll need to account for it's rotation during placement.
           
           Here’s the step-by-step approach:
           
           1.  **Placement Constraints:** The surface has a width and height of 0.27, so I can place Object 7 to be in the valid range of [-0.0868696, 0.0868696] x [-0.0868696, 0.0868696]. I've accounted for its size and its rotation with respect to the bounds of the surface.
           2.  **Avoidance Zones:** I've calculated the no-go zone, because that space is taken by the already placed object.
           3.  **Optimal Points:** I will distribute the point by generating 45 points in the valid regions for theta = 0, and generate 5 points for theta=pi/4, that result in 50 points.
           
           In summary, I'll generate the valid points.
