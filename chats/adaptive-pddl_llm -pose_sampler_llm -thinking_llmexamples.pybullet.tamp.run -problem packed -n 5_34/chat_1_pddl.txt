               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is straightforward: to get objects `v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18` all sitting on object `v20`.  My understanding of how this works is through the `on` predicate, which is true when an object is `supported` by another *and* is at a particular `atpose`.  I immediately looked at the initial state and noticed that all the objects are currently perched on `v11`, a surface.  The key here is that to get them onto `v20`, I need to change their `atpose`.
           
           **Initial State Assessment:**
           
           *   **Objects:** Each of the target objects is currently "on" `v11` at a specific `atpose`. They also have alternative poses where they *could* be "supported" by `v20` (`supported(?o, #o2, v20)` is true for each). It's evident that I'll need to move them.
           *   **Actions:**  I've been given a list of valid action instances, which is crucial.  There's only one allowed action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This seems... useless, it does not achieve anything. This means I can't directly manipulate the objects using the usual `pick` and `place` actions I'd typically consider.
           
           **The Crucial Constraint:**
           
           Here's the problem.  The *only* allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  I need to move objects. I can't do that with the given action. This is the blocker.
           
           **The Inevitable Conclusion:**
           
           With only `move_base v3 v3`, I cannot change the `atpose` of any object. I cannot use `pick` or `place`.  Therefore, *the goal is unreachable*.  I'm stuck, and there's no path to getting those objects on `v20` with these constraints.
