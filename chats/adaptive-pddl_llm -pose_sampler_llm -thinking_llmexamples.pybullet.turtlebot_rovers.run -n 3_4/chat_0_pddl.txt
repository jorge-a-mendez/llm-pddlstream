User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Position Selection for Robot Base Points**
           
           Okay, so I need to find three suitable base positions for the robot, all within a maximum distance of 2 units from the target point *(2.1311, -0.6080)*, which I'll call `T`.  The robot has to maintain a clear line of sight to the target and avoid collisions with any fixed obstacles, while staying within the room's boundaries (`x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]`).
           
           First, I looked at the scene layout, understanding that there's a big rectangular room defined by the given AABBs, with a vertical partition in the middle, and a few smaller obstacles near the target point. The target is located relatively close to the right wall, which made the placement more tricky. There are two small obstacles right around the area of the target too, so the placement had to be very precise.
           
           Given the room layout and the constraint of maintaining line-of-sight, the most crucial considerations are: avoiding the right wall and the smaller obstacles directly around `T`, while maximizing the reachable area.
           
           I defined a circle of radius 2 around the target point. Using this, I formulated three potentially good locations:
           
           *   **P1: (0.6311, -0.6080)**:  This point is to the *left* of the target, offering a clear path from the target's point of view, away from the right wall, and behind the central partition. This location seems great since it can observe through an area that is generally open to the target.
           
           *   **P2: (1.6311, -1.6080)**:  This point is *below and left* of the target. This offers a clear path as well. I ensured that there was no collision with the adjacent small obstacles.
           
           *   **P3: (2.1311, 0.8920)**:  This point is *directly above* the target. This location is further away from the small obstacles, and the robot can still see the target with no obstacles in the line of sight.
           
           I'm confident these three positions are good starting points. They are a good balance of diverse positions to cover various angles with the target and do not have any collisions and maintain line-of-sight. They are also valid within the room dimensions and range requirement.
