           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v12, v15, v8) and two arms (v4, v6). The objects are at specific poses, and the arms are handempty. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a derived axiom that requires `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Looking at the initial state, we have `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. Also, `type(v12, v17)` is given. However, there is no direct link to `v18` for `v12`. We also have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, as well as `type(v8, v17)`. Again, no direct link to `v18`. Finally, we have `atpose(v15, v16)` and `supported(v15, v16, v11)`. No type is given for `v15` that matches `v17`.
           
           However, the axiom `new-axiom@0()` actually has a typo, it refers to `?green` as an object, which is not present in the scene. The correct axiom is `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` and `type(?o: object, ?t: object)`. This means we need an object `?o` such that `on(?o, v18)` and `type(?o, v17)`.
           
           Let's re-examine the initial state for objects that can be `?o`.
           - `v12`: `type(v12, v17)` is true. We need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`. Currently, `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. If we can place `v12` at `#o2` on `v18`, the goal will be achieved.
           - `v8`: `type(v8, v17)` is true. We need to achieve `on(v8, v18)`. Currently, `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. If we can place `v8` at `#o2` on `v18`, the goal will be achieved.
           
           The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of objects or their support. Since no actions are provided that can change the `on` state of an object (like pick and place), and the goal requires an object to be `on v18`, and no object is initially `on v18` with type `v17`, the goal is not achievable with the given actions. The `move_base` action doesn't allow for any manipulation of objects.
           
           Thus, based on the provided initial state and available actions, it's impossible to satisfy the goal.
