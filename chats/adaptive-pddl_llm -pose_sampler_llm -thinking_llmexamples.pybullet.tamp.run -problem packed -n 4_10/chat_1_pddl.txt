               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.  Easy enough, in theory: pick them up from `v11` and place them on `v18`. I see the `on(vX, v18)` facts as the crucial piece.
           
           My initial thought is to simply go through and define a basic plan where I use the available `pick` and `place` actions repeatedly until the goal is achieved. I see a `move_base` action that may come in handy to manipulate the robot base configuration if needed to move the robot between pick and place locations.
           
           However, a closer look reveals a critical issue. The `pick` and `place` actions all share a common precondition: `atbconf(?q)`.  In other words, the robot base configuration must be at the correct position before any object manipulation can happen. The critical piece I noticed is that all the relevant `kin` facts - the "knowledge" of how the robot's arm works - are parameterized by `#o3`. These facts *require* `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Unfortunately, the initial state *only* states `atbconf(v3)`.  The only `move_base` instance available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *move* the base, it's more like a "no-op" that simply consumes the `canmove()` precondition.  It does not allow us to move the robot from `v3` to `#o3`.
           
           If `#o3` is a "continuous" parameter and I had more actions it could potentially represent any base configuration. But in this specific setup, `#o3` is presented as a discrete parameter and because there's no way to reach `atbconf(#o3)` from `atbconf(v3)`, all the preconditions for the `pick` and `place` actions are unsatisfied.  No valid plan can exist and the problem is unsolvable. I need to communicate this very clearly.
