(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 6, with dimensions roughly 0.0773 x 0.0773, on a square surface defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  
           
           My approach hinges on understanding the object's geometry and how rotation impacts its bounding box.  Since it's basically a square, the most critical case is a 45-degree rotation (π/4 radians) because that's when its AABB has the largest dimensions, effectively fitting the largest rotated square in the designated surface area. My goal is to maximize the object coverage within surface bounds.
           
           Let's break it down:
           
           *   **Surface:** We have a 0.27 x 0.27 square centered at (0, 0).
           *   **Object:**  Nearly a square, so its AABB is roughly `0.0773 x 0.0773` when not rotated.  
           
           The core concept is to figure out the acceptable ranges for the center point (x, y) of the object, depending on the rotation angle (θ).  I'll consider a few key angles to generate diverse placements.
           
           *   **θ = 0 (No Rotation):** The bounding box is still `0.0773 x 0.0773`.  The object's center must be within [-0.09635, 0.09635] for both x and y.
           *   **θ = π/4 (45 Degrees):** Now, things get interesting.  The rotated AABB's diagonal becomes approximately 0.1093.  The center must now be within [-0.08035, 0.08035] for both x and y.
           
           To ensure sufficient diverse placements (50 total, covering both rotated and unrotated), I'll use a grid-based method with a variety of coordinates:
           
           *   For rotations of 0 radians, the range will be [-0.08, 0.08] for both x and y.
           *   For rotations of pi/4 radians, the range will be [-0.06, 0.06] for both x and y.
           
           I'll select a grid of x and y values within these ranges for each of the two different rotations. That will result in two diverse sets of placements within the defined surface area.
           
           Given this strategy, I should be able to efficiently generate the required stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Planning: Avoiding Collision**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object 6, and now it's time to work on object 4. Object 4 is essentially a square, just like object 6, and it's also on surface 0. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 4 on that surface without any collision with object 6.
           
           First, I need to understand the space object 6 currently occupies. It's placed at (-0.08, -0.08) with zero rotation. Its effective dimensions are a bit over 0.07, so its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is easily determined. I'm going to approximate this AABB for easier planning. Now, for the critical step: I need to characterize this new object, object 4: it's also a square, a little smaller, same surface.
           
           Now, my strategy is to first define the bounds of the surface and then account for object 6's placement to work out its AABB. Using the square properties and considering different orientations - 0 and pi/4 radians - I'll determine how to position the object safely.
           
           I need to make sure that the placements fit the surface bounds. Next, and this is the core of the problem, I need to avoid collision with object 6. The approach is to ensure that the AABB of object 4 doesn't overlap object 6's AABB. I'll make sure to work with the given square properties to compute the coordinates for avoiding collision.
           
           Since it's a square, its orientation doesn't change much. I'll need to define ranges to pick points without overlapping object 6's space. To make things simpler, I'll divide the surface into a grid and select points that are far from object 6's bounding box. For a theta = 0 placement, the x and y coordinates are given between a range, I will use coordinates such that I avoid collision. After careful calculations, I will pick points where the object is clear. I'm going to create placement in such a way that it won't collide with the bounds.
           
           Using grid points to create a set for `theta = 0` placements, and using the same points rotated by pi/4. I'll apply exclusion filtering rules - the collision zone - to ensure that the objects do not collide. This will give me a set of x, y coordinates and `theta`.
           
           Then, I'll calculate the dimensions, collision filter, and get more precise bounds.
           For `theta=0` I will have grid coordinates, and if there is a overlap with a grid, that will be avoided.
           I will generate those for all values, so the object placements don't result in any collision.
           I have a list of all positions with the `theta = 0` and `theta= pi/4`.
           I have 40 good placements for `theta = 0` without overlap, which is a good set.
           So I add the valid placement coordinates with their orientations, and I will be able to place 50 objects in a collision-free manner.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, here's the deal: I've got to find 50 stable spots for this new, almost-square object (ID 5) on surface 0. But, there's a catch - I need to avoid collisions with two other objects already in place: Object 6 and Object 4.
           
           I start by understanding the new object's dimensions and the surface limits. Then I break the problem down. First I check what the collision limits are for the objects. Then I will see what valid placements there are for the new object. I analyze the size of the objects to get the min/max limits on placement and rotation.
           
           I will try two possible orientations - no rotation (theta=0) and a 45-degree rotation (theta = pi/4).
           For each orientation, I have to figure out the "forbidden zones" where the new object would collide with Object 6 or Object 4. I use the object's dimensions to get their AABB limits. I use a grid approach (x and y) for quick filtering of positions. I use a grid for x and y.
           
           For theta = 0, the forbidden zones are:
           - A square quadrant - where the new object would collide with Object 6.
           - A long rectangle in the negative y area - where it would collide with Object 4.
           
           For theta = pi/4, the collision areas are:
           - Square in a quadrant near the center.
           - Long rectangle in the negative y area.
           
           I have set the grid from -0.09 to 0.09.
           I have set the grid from -0.07 to 0.07.
           
           After a lot of detailed calculations using the AABB of each object, I figure out that with the original grid I get 31 (theta=0) and 18 (theta=pi/4) valid placements. Adding these I get 49, so I added another grid. So the best solution that I can do is that I will take the 50 best spots from the theta = 0 grid.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's see what I've got here.** My goal is to find 50 stable placements for this new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into any of the already-placed obstacles (IDs 6, 4, and 5).
           
           First things first: Surface 0 is a square, centered at (0,0) with sides of 0.27, so I have to keep my placements within that.
           
           Object 7 itself is also a square, with side length of about 0.0956.  That means the effective "half-dimension" (half-width or half-height) is about 0.0478. I have to factor that in.
           
           **My Plan:**
           1.  **Placement Space:** To start, I calculate the allowable center coordinates for the object, by taking into account its dimensions and the available surface. To check containment, I test if the center can move freely from -0.087 to 0.087 in both x and y. If I rotate it by pi/4, I need to use the rotated "half-dimension" and recalculate.
           2.  **Obstacle AABBs:** For the obstacles, I calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). Essentially, I determine the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates that each obstacle occupies.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I'll use the AABBs to quickly check for collisions, by checking if the AABBs intersect.
           4.  **Placement Generation:** I'll generate a grid of potential (x, y) placements within the valid range, and check each placement for collisions. I'll test at least two rotations (0, and pi/4), and pick the non-colliding locations for valid placement positions.
           
           **Here's the Breakdown:**
           *   **Object 6:** Its AABB occupies the space approximately `[-0.119, -0.041]` by `[-0.119, -0.041]`.
           *   **Object 4:** Its AABB is approximately `[-0.037, 0.037]` by `[-0.127, -0.053]`.
           *   **Object 5:** Its AABB is approximately `[-0.130, -0.050]` by `[-0.030, 0.050]`.
           
           To avoid collisions I have to stay clear. Let's start by listing the general no-go-zones.
           
           Using a finer grid helps, and that should be good enough to get 50 placement values.
