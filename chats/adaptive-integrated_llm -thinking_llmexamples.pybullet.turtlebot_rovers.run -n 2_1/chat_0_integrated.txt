           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Given Actions**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to: getting images from two locations, analyzing a stone, and analyzing some soil. I've dissected the initial state and identified these subgoals.  I see that I need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, and then I also need to make sure I analyze at least one of these: a stone (`receivedanalysis(?stone)`) and at least one soil (`receivedanalysis(?soil)`).
           
           The plan is going to be a problem. The only actions at my disposal are essentially no-op movements: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`.  These are useless for anything other than sitting where they are. They are only there to satisfy the requirement that a `move` must be present.  Rover `v12` is stuck at location `v13` and `v14` is stuck at location `v15`.  I'm limited to what I can do from those two configurations, and I can't leave them.
           
           To get the images and analyses, I need to do the following:  `send_image`, `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_analysis`, and `sample_rock`.  Each of these actions requires that the rover is at a specific location, denoted by the fact `atconf(?v, ?q)`.  The facts in the initial state about what the rover can see or sample (`imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above`) reference locations like `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`. But my rovers are stuck at `v13` and `v15`.
           
           There are no `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, or `above` facts for `v13` and `v15`. The `imagevisible` facts are present for the #o3 and #o0 positions, and the `above` facts use the `#o5` position. Thus, I can't *see* the locations, because I can't *be* at the locations the actions need me to be.  Therefore, I cannot satisfy the precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)` needed for all the core actions that would allow me to take or send images and analyses.
           
           I can't accomplish the goal, because the available action instances do not permit the necessary interactions with the objects and locations needed to achieve any of my sub-goals.
           
           Essentially, I am incapable of achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` and so can not meet my objective. It seems I am locked in, which does not bode well.
