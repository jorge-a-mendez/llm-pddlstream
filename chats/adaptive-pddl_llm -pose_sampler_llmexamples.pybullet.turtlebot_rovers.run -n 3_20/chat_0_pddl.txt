User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller rectangular obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some of which are very thin, indicating they might be ledges or other narrow structures. I need to find 3 positions within a radius of 2 from the target point that avoid collisions with these obstacles and maintain line-of-sight. My strategy will be to try a few distinct positions around the target point, ensuring they are within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. I will aim for positions directly to the left, right, top, and bottom of the target, and also some diagonal positions to provide diversity. I'll prioritize positions that are slightly further away from potential clutter.
           
           Target point: (-1.6025, -0.605)
           Positions:
           (-1.6025 -0.605)
           (-0.6025 -0.605)
           (-2.5 -0.605)
