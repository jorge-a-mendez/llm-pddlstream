User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm approaching this problem:** I've been tasked with finding 25 different spots for a robot base to stand near a specific target point.  The robot has to stay within 4 units of the target and within the bounds of the room, which is a square space from -2.5 to 2.5 in both the x and y directions.  A key challenge is avoiding the fixed obstacles already mapped out for me, and making sure the robot can "see" the target.  Since no previous failures were provided, I'm assuming it's the first time and starting fresh.
           
           **The Room's Layout:**  The area is shaped like a square with a few obstacles inside, described by rectangular bounding boxes (AABBs). There's a big central "wall" running vertically at x=0, which splits the space and is the main obstacle to line-of-sight. There are also smaller rectangular obstacles in the room.
           
           **My Strategy:**
           1.  **Understand the Target:**  First, I'll figure out where the target is located in the room. In this instance it's `(-1.625, 0.5)`.
           2.  **Define the Area:**  I'll start with all the points within a 4-unit circle around the target and within the room's boundary.
           3.  **Eliminate Obstacles:** I'll cross-reference these points with the provided list of fixed obstacles to remove any that would result in the robot base being within an obstacle.
           4.  **Line of Sight:** I'm assuming that the robot base must have line-of-sight to the target given direct unobstructed sight.  The x=0 vertical wall presents the biggest challenge. The target in this case is to the left of x=0. Therefore, the robot must be located to the left of this vertical wall.
           5.  **Generate and Filter Points:** I'll generate a diverse set of positions around the target using polar coordinates and grid sampling and filter them, keeping positions that satisfy all requirements.
           6.  **Ensure Diversity:** I'll use both polar coordinate sampling (circles) and a grid search to try and get a good spread of different positions.
           
           **Addressing Line-of-Sight:** Given that the target point is at `(-1.625, 0.5)`, which means it's to the *left* of the x=0 vertical wall, I'll favor positions for the robot base that are also on the left side of this wall.
           
           **Implementation Details:** I'll use Python and the NumPy library to help with calculations and point generation.  I'll create a function to check if a proposed point collides with any of the fixed obstacles. Since I'm starting from scratch, I'll need to generate points until I find 25 that meet all the criteria.
