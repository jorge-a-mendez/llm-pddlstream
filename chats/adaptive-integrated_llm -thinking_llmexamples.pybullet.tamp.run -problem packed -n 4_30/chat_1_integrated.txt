User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, 0.148), (-0.203, 0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.222, -0.356, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, -0.215).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.047, 0.382), (0.051, 0.48)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.002, 0.241, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.927, 0.375).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, 0.191), (0.048, 0.29)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.25, 0.195, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.851, 0.525).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.002, 0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.9, -0.436).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, -0.402), (0.268, -0.309)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Stack Objects**
           
           My objective is clear: place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto a target surface, v18.  I'm armed with the necessary actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. However, for this task, I'll only need `pick` and `place`. The core of the problem lies in achieving the goal state: `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.
           
           I've internalized that the 'on' predicate relies on 'supported' and 'atpose'.  Therefore, I'll strategize to first "pick" each object and then "place" them on v18 at suitable poses, ensuring all four objects are supported.
           
           Initial conditions reveal: The objects I intend to use are graspable and currently 'atpose' on `v11`.  My robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both 'handempty,' and the robot's base config is `v3`. Key to the plan is finding suitable poses for v8, v12, v14, and v16 that satisfy the 'supported' predicate. The provided facts identify `v18` as the target surface and indicate the initial positions of the objects using a pose on the surface v11.
           
           Given the initial positions and the target surface's constraints, I've identified four suitable poses, one for each object.  The plan involves a sequence of 'pick' and 'place' actions, utilizing the robot's arm, v4.
           
           I've meticulously assessed the 'kin' facts, confirming the feasibility of picking and placing each object using arm v4. Each 'kin' predicate specifies object positions, grasps, and base configurations.
           
           The central plan structure is:
           1.  Pick v14 from v15.
           2.  Place v14 at a specific pose on v18.
           3.  Pick v12 from v13.
           4.  Place v12 at a specific pose on v18.
           5.  Pick v16 from v17.
           6.  Place v16 at a specific pose on v18.
           7.  Pick v8 from v9.
           8.  Place v8 at a specific pose on v18.
           
           To solidify my plan, I have calculated specific pose values. The surface v18 is a square, centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27m x 0.27m. The objects will be placed on v18, at the height of 0.781. The height of the poses seems correct, as the height information is present and consistent in the provided data.
           
           The positions will be placed in a grid on v18 to minimize collision. The x, y positions for each object will be:
           *   v14: (-0.06, 0.06)
           *   v12: (0.06, 0.06)
           *   v16: (-0.06, -0.06)
           *   v8: (0.06, -0.06)
           
           I am confident that these placements are collision-free and that the planned actions will lead to the desired goal state.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem. The user is right, my initial attempt at planning is flawed. They pointed out that all the `pick` and `place` actions I generated are invalid, and the only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This *immediately* raises a red flag.
           
           My objective is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto location `v18`.  Right now, the initial state shows they are all on `v11`.  My natural inclination was to use `pick` and `place` actions to move these objects. But that's a non-starter, as I only have `move_base`.
           
           Now, looking closely at `move_base`: it seems to be solely concerned with the robot's base configuration – `atbconf` and `canmove`.  The preconditions and effects confirm this. It can move the base, sure, but it doesn't even *touch* the `on(?o, ?r)` predicate that governs the object's location, the exact thing that I need to change to achieve the goal state.
           
           Specifically, the given action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is a no-op as the start and end configurations are identical. It essentially does nothing to help me!
           
           Given this, I must conclude that the goal state of getting these objects onto `v18` is *unachievable* with only the `move_base` action. There's no way to manipulate object positions with this action, and the problem constraints essentially define an impossible plan. I need to clearly state that the user's goal is unreachable and concisely explain the reasoning related to the `move_base` action's scope.
