           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, 0.148), (-0.203, 0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.222, -0.356, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, -0.215).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.047, 0.382), (0.051, 0.48)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.002, 0.241, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.927, 0.375).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, 0.191), (0.048, 0.29)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.25, 0.195, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.851, 0.525).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.002, 0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.9, -0.436).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, -0.402), (0.268, -0.309)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Arrange Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I've got a clear goal: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. Currently, they're all piled up on `v11` at various positions (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`). The robot's got two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but `v4` seems like the relevant one right now since it's `handempty` and its current pose, `v5`, doesn't matter for the initial planning.  The base is at `v3`, but I'll need to move it for actions.
           
           The actions I can use are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. No cleaning or cooking here, just placement.  The core of this problem is about spatial relationships and making sure the objects aren't colliding.  My primary strategy is to pick each object and place it on `v18`.
           
           So, the current situation:
           *   `v8` at `v9` on `v11`, target is `on(v8, v18)`.
           *   `v12` at `v13` on `v11`, target is `on(v12, v18)`.
           *   `v14` at `v15` on `v11`, target is `on(v14, v18)`.
           *   `v16` at `v17` on `v11`, target is `on(v16, v18)`.
           
           Each needs to end up on `v18`.  Luckily, I have `supported(obj, #o2, v18)` for each, which means `#o2` is a valid pose on the surface for each object.  Because the `on` predicate requires an `atpose` predicate and I'm using `pose(v8, #o2)` in the initial state, I'll provide a specific numerical pose.
           
           I'll build the plan like this: pick, move base if necessary and place, rinse, and repeat for each object. Let's break down the logic with one object, `v8`:
           
           1.  **Pick:** Get `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`.
               *   I need `kin` facts related to arm configuration and object position. I also need `handempty(v4)`, which is good to go, and I have `atbconf(#o3)`. That means I'll have to have base at pose #o3, so I will have to move the base if I am not in it.
               *   This sets up the preconditions for a valid pick.
           2.  **Place:** Move `v8` at `#o2` on `v18` with arm `v4`.
               *   This action needs me to satisfy preconditions of `kin` again, plus that I should have the object in hand through `atgrasp`
           
           Because all the placement goals are identical, I'll need to define distinct poses on `v18` for each object using that `#o2` parameter.  
           
           `v18` is a square with an AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I'll place the items in a collision-free manner on `v18`. The objects have these AABB poses to get an idea of sizes:
           * v8: `v9`
           * v12: `v13`
           * v14: `v15`
           * v16: `v17`
           
           I'll also have to calculate each object placement pose `#o2` on `v18`. I will use the approximate size to ensure that the robot does not collide each object as well.
           
           Here are the poses I've calculated (assuming the surface is at 0.781 in the Z-axis, which is consistent with the initial conditions):
           *   `v8` on `v18` at `(-0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   `v12` on `v18` at `(0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   `v14` on `v18` at `(-0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
)
