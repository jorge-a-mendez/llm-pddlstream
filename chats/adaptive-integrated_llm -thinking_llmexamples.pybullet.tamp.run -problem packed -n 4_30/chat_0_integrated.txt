User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.297, 0.148), (-0.203, 0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.222, -0.356, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.977, -0.215).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.047, 0.382), (0.051, 0.48)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.002, 0.241, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.927, 0.375).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.051, 0.191), (0.048, 0.29)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.25, 0.195, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.851, 0.525).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.002, 0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.9, -0.436).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.175, -0.402), (0.268, -0.309)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Stack**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is clear: to get v8, v12, v14, and v16 all perfectly situated *on* v18.  That means each object needs to be supported by v18 and in the correct position. Looking at the initial state, I see they're currently chilling on v11 at different poses.  Each of these objects can, in theory, be stacked on v18 (that's the `stackable` predicate) and has a valid target pose, `#o2`, as a placement location.
           
           The problem, as I see it, boils down to the actions available. All I've got is `move_base`.  I need to get these objects *from* their starting positions *to* `#o2` on top of v18.  That screams for `pick` and `place` actions, which are, unfortunately, not in my action instance list.
           
           I started to dig into the preconditions for `pick` and `place` just to double-check.  They involve `atpose` and `atgrasp`, which are what I need to modify to achieve the goal state. But without the ability to physically *pick up* and *place* the objects, I'm completely stuck.
           
           Given the constraints – the limited action set – this goal is simply unachievable. I can't manipulate the objects to get them where they need to be. It's a dead end.
