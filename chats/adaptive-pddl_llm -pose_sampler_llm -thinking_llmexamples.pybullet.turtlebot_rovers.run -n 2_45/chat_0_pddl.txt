           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable Due to Configuration Constraints**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of satisfying the conditions laid out by `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I see it boils down to achieving two things: getting images and getting analyses.  I've got the initial conditions: rovers are *at* specific locations, and they're *free*. Great. But now for the meat of it: the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve those, I need the actions `send_image` and `send_analysis`. Both require *communication* configurations.
           
           Here's the rub: those actions require the rovers to be in specific configurations, `q` which allows for communication, specifically `#o0` for images, and `#o5` for sampling.  However, my initial analysis and the available actions don't allow for this.  My actions are limited to "move" actions which, in essence, do *nothing* since the `q1` and `q2` are the same.  The rovers start at locations `v13` and `v15`, and the "move" actions keep them there, maintaining their `atconf` to `v13` and `v15` respectively.  I see a problem!
           
           Since the only available "move" actions keep the rovers' `atconf` where they are, I *cannot* satisfy the crucial `atconf(?v, ?q)` precondition for any of the more interesting actions.  Therefore, I cannot satisfy `receivedimage` (or `haveimage` or even `calibrated`) through `send_image`, nor can I satisfy `receivedanalysis` through `send_analysis`. 
           
           After re-reading all the available actions, they all have a `atconf(?v, ?q)` precondition that can't be made true! `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock` are equally hampered by this configuration issue. The lack of a true "move" action makes the whole thing a dead end. I am, in short, stuck.  The goal as stated is simply unreachable, a logical impossibility given the present actions.
