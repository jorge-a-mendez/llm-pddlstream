           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)

           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I'm faced with a problem. My goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`. Currently, they're on `v11`.  My understanding is that to get something *on* something else, I need to ensure `supported` and `atpose` conditions are met according to the provided axiom. In short, to achieve my on conditions, I would need to find supporting poses and kinematic info to be able to pick and place objects.
           
           I've examined the available actions.  `move_base` is the only action instance I have, which is useless here. It can't directly alter object positions. The plan of course is to pick the objects and then place them at the appropriate locations. I need kinematic information. I don't have this. My other actions `pick` and `place` require `kin` predicates, `atpose` or `atgrasp`, `handempty`, and `atbconf`. While I *have* `handempty` and `atbconf`, I'm sorely lacking the kinematic info. It's the key to making `pick` and `place` possible. 
           
           I *do* know that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` can potentially be *supported* on `v16`. However, I have no way to *get* them there. Without being able to pick and place, I'm stuck. The current state and the available action instances simply don't allow for the necessary manipulation.  So, based on the current situation, the goal is unattainable.
