           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has a large central square obstacle (0), with thin rectangular obstacles forming a frame around the outer edge (1, 2, 3, 4). There's a thin vertical obstacle (5) in the middle, effectively dividing the central area into two halves. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around, some in clusters near the top corners (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21), and some in the lower-central and right-central areas (12, 14, 15, 18).
           
           My strategy is to generate positions in a circle around the target point, at a distance that allows for flexibility while also being close enough. I will try to space them out to increase the chance of finding a collision-free spot. I'll prioritize locations that seem less cluttered based on the obstacle list.

Model:     The previous target point was (1.8667, 1.962). The positions I chose were quite far and in a different quadrant. The first position (-0.3117, -2.4849) collided with obstacle 2 (the bottom wall). The third position (-2.45, -2.45) collided with obstacle 2 (bottom wall), obstacle 4 (left wall), and obstacle 6 (a smaller internal obstacle). The second position (-1.875, -0.5) had no line of sight, which is understandable given the target is in the top right quadrant and this position is in the bottom left, likely occluded by the central obstacle (0) or the vertical divider (5).
           
           For the new target point, I will focus on positions closer to the target and try to avoid the known obstacles, especially the walls and the central divider. The new target point is near the center, so I will try to find positions that are also near the center.

Model:     The previous target point was (-1.967, 2.199). My first proposed position (-0.05, 2.25) collided with obstacle 5, the central vertical divider. This is good to know, as it confirms that the divider is a significant obstacle. The other two positions, (-2.05, 0.25) and (1.95, 0.25), both failed due to no line of sight. This makes sense given the target is in the top-left corner and these positions are much lower. The central obstacle (0) and vertical divider (5) likely caused the occlusions. I need to be careful with the max_range=2 constraint, as being too close to the target can also lead to collisions if the target is near an obstacle, or if the robot is too big.
           
           For the new target point, which is at (0.2 0.3), I'll try to find positions around it within the max_range. Given the central vertical divider (5) at x=0, and a small obstacle (12) near the target, I will try to place the robot in the quadrant where the target is located, or in adjacent quadrants carefully.

Model:     The previous target point was (-0.322, 1.991). My first proposed position (0.2, 2.299) collided with obstacles 1 (top wall), 5 (central vertical divider), and 9 (a small obstacle near the top-right). This is very informative, as it highlights that the region near the top wall and the central divider is highly constrained. The other two positions, (2.2, 0.3) and (-1.75, 0.3), both failed due to no line of sight. This confirms that for a target in the upper part of the scene, positions significantly lower are likely to be occluded by the main central obstacle (0) or the vertical divider (5).
           
           For the new target point, (0.05 1.7), I need to be careful to avoid the central vertical divider (5) and the top wall (1) which have caused collisions recently. Also, there are small obstacles (9, 10, 11) in this vicinity. The target is in the upper central area, slightly to the right of the vertical divider. I will try to find positions within max_range=2 that are not directly on the divider and try to maintain line of sight by being at a similar y-level.
