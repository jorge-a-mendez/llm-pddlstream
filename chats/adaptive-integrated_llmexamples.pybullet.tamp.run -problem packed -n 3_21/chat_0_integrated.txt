           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.045, -0.3), (0.03, -0.226)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.186, -0.339, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.22, 0.976).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.239, 0.508, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.827, 0.561).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.232, -0.386), (-0.139, -0.293)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.285, 0.462), (-0.194, 0.553)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.008, -0.263, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.683, 0.73).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. They are currently located at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15`, respectively, all supported by `v11`. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`. Since `v16` is a dummy surface (its continuous value is not provided), we need to find suitable placements for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on another surface whose continuous value is provided, like `v11`. However, the problem statement says "if the continuous value for a surface is not provided, then it is a dummy surface. When placing objects supported at dummy surfaces, choose any other surface whose continuous value is provided and provide a placement on that surface." This means we are to assume that `v16` is a valid surface and we need to provide a new pose `o2` for it. However, the available action instances list only contains `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This means that no `pick` or `place` actions are available. Therefore, it is impossible to move any object to any new location. Since the goal requires objects to be `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`, and these conditions are not met in the initial state, and there are no actions to change the state, the goal is unreachable.
