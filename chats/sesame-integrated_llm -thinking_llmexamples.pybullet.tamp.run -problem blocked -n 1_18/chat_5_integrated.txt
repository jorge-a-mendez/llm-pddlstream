           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.452, 0.512), (-4.368, 0.596)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.41, 0.554, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.114, 0.994).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which means I need to make sure that a specific object is *on* a specific surface and also has a certain *type*.  Based on the problem statement, I've identified that `v12` is the object in question and `v18` is the surface it needs to be *on*, with `v17` being its type.  I can tell from the initial state that `v12` already has type `v17`.
           
           My plan is straightforward: I need to pick `v12` up from its current location, which is `v13`, and place it *on* `v18`.  The problem provides a support relationship, `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`, and I can see from an axiom about *on* that I'll achieve the goal if I can get `v12` to `atpose(#p1)`, since `v18` already supports the object at that pose.
           
           From the available actions, it's clear I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions involving the robot arm (`v4`) and grasping `g2`.  To execute these, I'll also have to use `move_base` actions to get the robot to the appropriate base configuration (`q4` to pick at `v13`, `q5` to place at `#p1`).
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** The robot moves from its initial base config, `v3`, to `q4`. This will place the robot base such that the arm can perform pick.
               *   Action: `(move_base v3 #q4 #t9)`
           
           2.  **Pick up the object:** The robot arm (`v4`) picks up `v12` from its current pose at `v13`.
               *   Action: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g2 #q4 #t8)`
           
           3.  **Move to the placing position:** The robot base moves from `q4` to `q5` to enable placement.
               *   Action: `(move_base #q4 #q5 #o0)`
           
           4.  **Place the object:** The robot arm (`v4`) places `v12` at the desired location, `#p1`, on surface `v18`.
               *   Action: `(place v4 v12 #p1 #g2 #q5 #t10)`
           
           I need to come up with a collision-free placement pose for `#p1` so that the object is stable. `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is in the initial state, so I know a pose exists.  Based on the object's surrounding environment, I will calculate the point `#p1`. I checked some of the initial values and they have z-positions around 0.8, which seems reasonable. `v18` seems to be a table-like surface. So the point should be within the range of `v18`. I know from the initial state, the robot has the kinematics to execute the actions. Now,  I'll just calculate a good `z` and `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)` should work, with 0 degrees rotation. The final continuous value for the plan is then  `(4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)` for the pose `#p1`.
