User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a vertical wall (obstacle 5) in the middle along the y-axis, dividing the room into two halves. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including some near the corners and some in the middle of each half. There are also thin obstacles along the edges of the room which are part of the main 5x5 square (obstacles 1, 2, 3, 4).
           
           Given the target point (2.0 0.0), which is in the right half of the room, I need to find 25 positions within 4 units distance from it. I should avoid the central vertical wall (obstacle 5: (-0.05, -2.5) to (0.05, 2.5)), and other smaller obstacles, especially those in the right half of the room. The maximum x and y coordinates are 2.5 and minimum are -2.5.
           
           I will try to distribute positions around the target point, varying the radius and angle, while ensuring they are within the room boundaries and outside of known obstacles.
