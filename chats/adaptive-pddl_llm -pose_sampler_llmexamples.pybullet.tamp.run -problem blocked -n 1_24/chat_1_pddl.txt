           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (`v12`, `v15`, `v8`) which are stackable and graspable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and arm configurations `v5` (for `v4`) and `v7` (for `v6`). Objects `v8`, `v15`, and `v12` are at specific poses (`v9`, `v16`, `v13` respectively).
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies that `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` must be true for some object `?green`. From the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. Therefore, `?green` could be `v12` or `v8`. The goal condition `on(?green, v18)` translates to `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.
           
           Let's consider `v12` as `?green`. The initial state has `supported(v12, v13, v14)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. This means `v12` is on `v14`, not `v18`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` but `atpose(v12, #o2)` is not true.
           
           Let's consider `v8` as `?green`. The initial state has `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`. This means `v8` is on `v11`, not `v18`. We also have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` but `atpose(v8, #o2)` is not true.
           
           The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This action does not change the position of any object, nor does it affect whether an object is supported or cleaned/cooked. It simply moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, which is effectively no movement at all. Since the goal requires an object to be on `v18`, and no pick/place actions are available to move objects, it is impossible to satisfy the goal.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.
