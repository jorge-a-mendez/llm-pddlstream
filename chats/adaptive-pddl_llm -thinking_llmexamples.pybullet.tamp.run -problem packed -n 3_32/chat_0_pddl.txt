           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  My understanding is that this means ensuring each object, v8, v12, and v14, is supported by and at a specific pose on v16. I can derive that I need to manipulate the `supported` and `atpose` relations for each of these.
           
           Currently, I can see that v8, v12, and v14 are *already* on v11 based on their initial state.  The challenge lies in moving them to v16. My expertise immediately tells me that to do this, I'll need `pick` and `place` actions. However, a deeper inspection of the `supported` facts reveals I'll need to use a pose labeled as `#o2` on v16 as the goal configuration.
           
           Now, the crucial issue. I'm limited to using only a `move_base` action. There are no `pick` or `place` instances available.  The absence of these is a showstopper. I cannot reconfigure the scene without the ability to physically manipulate the objects.
           
           I've confirmed this by examining the preconditions for `pick` (e.g., `handempty`, `atpose`, `kin`) and `place` (e.g., `atgrasp`, `kin`). These actions are essential, but they aren't authorized for use. So, I must conclude that the robot, with only `move_base` available, is unable to pick up, move, or place any of the objects, thereby rendering the goal unattainable. It’s physically impossible to change those `on` relations with the given constraints.
