           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.233, 0.439), (-0.142, 0.531)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.182, 0.215), (-0.083, 0.314)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.161, -0.301), (-0.077, -0.217)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.226, -0.513, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.582, 0.813).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.008, 0.362), (0.09, 0.445)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.188, 0.485, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, 0.19).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.133, 0.264, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.925, -0.38).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.119, -0.259, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.783, 0.621).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.049, 0.403, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.103, 0.995).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.27, -0.557), (-0.181, -0.468)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis and Unsolvability**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto surface `v20`.  The initial state has these objects on `v11`, each at a specific `atpose`.  The goal is defined using `on` predicates, which require `supported` and `atpose` to be true. I know from the initial state that each object *can* be placed on `v20` at a pose named `#o2`.  The initial state also has facts about picking and placing the objects, using arm `v4` and a grasp `#o1`.
           
           It appears I'd need a sequence of pick-and-place actions: pick an object from its current pose, and place it at a pose on surface `v20`.  To illustrate, let's look at getting `v8` onto `v20`. It starts `atpose(v8, v9)`. I'd need to `pick v8` from `v9` and then `place v8` at the designated pose on `v20`.  
           
           The problem gets tricky when I consider the **actions I'm allowed to use**. The problem statement is very clear: *only actions in a specified list are valid*. The only action *instance* I'm given is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move base is a no-op which means the base doesn't move.
           
           Since I don't have access to the `pick` and `place` actions that I need to manipulate the objects and satisfy the goal, the goal is **unreachable**. The `move_base` action does nothing, so it's impossible to change the configuration of the objects. It's a constrained problem.
