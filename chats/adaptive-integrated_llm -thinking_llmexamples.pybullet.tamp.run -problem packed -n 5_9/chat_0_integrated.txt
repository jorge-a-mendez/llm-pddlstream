           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.27, -0.557), (-0.181, -0.468)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Plan and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` onto `v20`. Currently, these objects are all on `v11`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both handempty, and is initially at base configuration `v3`. The only available `move_base` action is a no-op: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           To achieve the goal, I'll use a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions. Each object needs to be picked from its current position on `v11` and placed onto `v20`. Since `v20` is the target, and given the problem instructions, I'll need to specify distinct continuous values for the `#o2` pose associated with each object placement on `v20`.
           
           The key is that I *cannot* rely on any additional *precomputed* `pick` and `place` actions, since only `move_base` is given. Instead, I need to create my own action instances based on preconditions and effects that make this work. Each action must be collision-free. I will use the `kin` predicate to define arm kinematics and trajectories. The robot's base will remain at `v3`, which means no `move_base` is required.
           
           **Action Sequence**
           
           The core idea is to pick each object from `v11` and place it onto `v20` using arm `v4`. I will construct the following actions:
           
           1.  Pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2_v8` on `v20`.
           2.  Pick `v12` from `v13` and place it at `#o2_v12` on `v20`.
           3.  Pick `v14` from `v15` and place it at `#o2_v14` on `v20`.
           4.  Pick `v16` from `v17` and place it at `#o2_v16` on `v20`.
           5.  Pick `v18` from `v19` and place it at `#o2_v18` on `v20`.
           
           **Poses and Continuous Values**
           
           The key to placing all objects on `v20` is specifying distinct poses for each object. I will define the continuous values for the poses like this:
           
           -   `(#o2 v8 v20): (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v12 v20): (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v14 v20): (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v16 v20): (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v18 v20): (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)`
           
           These positions are within `v20`'s AABB (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`) and assume a common height `z = 0.781`. This height is consistent with the initial poses and assumed placement.
           
           The specific actions will involve `pick` and `place`. The assumption is valid kinematics are discoverable for robot tasks. Since no specific trajectories are provided, it is assumed each trajectory can be computed, and no invalid trajectories are found.

           -   `(#o2 v12 v20): (0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v14 v20): (-0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v16 v20): (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2 v18 v20): (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0)`
           
           These positions are within `v20`'s AABB (`((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`) and assume a common height `z = 0.781`. This height is consistent with the initial poses and assumed placement.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan's Limitations**
           
           Okay, so the provided plan was rejected because it included `pick` and `place` actions, which are, unfortunately, off-limits. We're restricted to using only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This immediately throws up a red flag.
           
           The objective is clear: get all these objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18` – onto `v20`.  We know `on(?o, ?r)` means an object is both supported and at the correct pose. Currently, these objects are *supported* on `v11` at their respective initial poses.  The goal necessitates them being *supported* on `v20` at their new poses.
           
           The crux of the issue boils down to the *move_base* action.  It changes *atbconf* and *canmove* but doesn't touch the all-important `atpose` predicate. We *need* to change the poses of these objects, but the only allowed action can't do that.  `pick` and `place` would have worked perfectly to directly alter `atpose`, but they're not available.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of only using `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I'm forced to conclude that this goal is currently unreachable.  There's no way to manipulate the necessary `atpose` predicates.  We need to revisit the action set.
