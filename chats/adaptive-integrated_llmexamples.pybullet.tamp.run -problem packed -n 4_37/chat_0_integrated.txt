User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.154, 0.401), (-0.055, 0.5)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.19, -0.087), (0.268, -0.01)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.067, -0.58), (0.024, -0.489)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.128, -0.32), (-0.05, -0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.105, 0.451, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.927, -0.376).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.229, -0.048, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.054, 0.999).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.022, -0.535, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.188, 0.982).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.089, -0.281, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.663, 0.748).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) on object v18.
           Looking at the initial state:
           - All four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) are currently on object v11.
           - All four objects have `#o2` as a possible pose on `v18`.
           - The `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is available. However, since the start and end configurations are the same, this action doesn't change the robot's base position. The only effect of `move_base` is to set `canmove()` to false and `atbconf(v3)` to true, and it has a cost. Since we are already at `v3`, this action is not necessary. It would only increase the cost without providing any benefit. In fact, it would remove `canmove()`, which is a precondition for pick and place, so it would prevent future actions if not immediately followed by other actions that set `canmove()` to true.
           - There are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances.
           
           Given the goal and the available actions, it seems there are no pick or place actions available to move the objects. The only available action is `move_base`, which doesn't help in moving objects from one surface to another. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal of having `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` on `v18`. The goal requires changing the `on` predicate, which can only be achieved by `place` actions that are not provided.
