(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request: Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to provide 50 stable and contained placements for object ID 5 on a square surface. The surface is an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) centered at (0, 0) with extents of -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object's dimensions are almost square: size_x = 0.08681146309811016 and size_y = 0.08681146309811011. A valid placement is defined by a surface index, rotation angle (theta), and center coordinates (x, y) for the object's AABB.  The key challenge is ensuring the object, when rotated and centered at (x, y), remains entirely within the surface's AABB.
           
           To do this, I need to compute the effective half-extents of the object's AABB after rotation. The object is nearly square, so these extents vary minimally with rotation. I can't consider the case where I encounter an obstacle. The placement means that I only need to consider stability and containment. With my expert knowledge, I calculated these effective half-extents using the formula derived from geometric principles. I know the effective half extents and compute the surface bounds.
           
           My approach involves selecting a representative set of rotation angles and then generating a grid of positions within the valid x and y bounds for each angle. Because the object is almost square, I choose a minimal set of angles spanning from 0 to π/2 to capture the primary orientations, using `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`, and then exploit the symmetry to easily find the rest of the 50 possible locations. The 10 position values for x and y are [0, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0.75].
           
           With the parameters set, I now only need to provide the 50 (surf_idx, theta, x, y) placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Object Placements**
           
           Okay, here's my plan. I've got to place a new, nearly square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, which already has a similar object (ID 5) at (0, 0). The catch is, ID 4 *can't* collide with ID 5. I've already confirmed the placement (0, 0, 0, 0) for ID5 worked.
           
           First, I need to calculate some critical geometry based on the surface size and object dimensions. Object 4’s size is `0.0856`, near a square, which, at 0 deg, means the AABB (axis aligned bounding box) has `hx, hy = 0.0428` and is largest when rotated by 45 degrees, which has a half extents of `0.0605`. And ID5 is a bit bigger, and located at (0, 0), and so also has a minimum x value to avoid collision.
           
           The surface bounds are -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. Then I need to generate 50 distinct object placements that obey the collision condition and the surface conditions.
           
           The best strategy is to iterate though different angles and candidate object centers, and check for collisions.
           
           A key point is I have to handle rotation. Since there are 2 points of a square, and I cannot collide. I will try the angles 0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, π/2.  I will take the most conservative box which is the maximum when the object is rotated by π/4 (0.0605) and make sure the placement does not overlap with the existing AABB of the original object, and is also on the surface.
           
           To check for collision, I will iterate through 5 different angles for object 4 (0, π/8, π/4, 3π/8, π/2) for object rotation. For each: calculate bounding boxes using each angle for Object 4.  Then calculate valid x/y center coordinates on the surface that avoid collision using the AABB. Collision only occurs if the two AABBs overlap. The AABB of Object 5 is simply -0.0434 < x < 0.0434, -0.0434 < y < 0.0434, since it's centered and has no rotation.
           
           Let's do the calculations for each case.  I have pre-calculated the necessary bounds and AABB calculations.  If the AABB overlaps, there is a collision.
           
           I discovered that at 45 degree rotation, there's *no* way to avoid a collision with Object 5. So, I will only consider the 0, π/2, π/8, 3π/8 angles.  Object 5 is at 0, 0, and has hx and hy of 0.043. The available space on the surface is a box.
           
           If the rotation is at 0 degrees, the object's center has to be outside of the circle defined by obj5's radius.
           
           The best approach seems to be to choose points *along the surface edges* where I can make sure they don't collide.
           
           The plan is to generate points that do *not* intersect with a box centered at 0 and of width and height 0.0864. 
           
           To ensure complete coverage, let’s pick the angles 0, π/8, π/2, 3*π/8. For each I will generate 50 points by systematically placing the bounding box on the perimeter of the surface, but skipping the intersection with the area around the original object (Object 5).
           
           So let's do this: I can place an object in any quadrant outside the center collision box, as long as it's within the surface bounds.  I'll define some zones and pick coordinates inside the zones.
           
           I know I *must* avoid the central area around Object 5, but I can place inside the box outside the central area. The only available places for the object is along the border of the surface.  Since I'm dealing with a square, and it's 0.0428 away from the edge, I can be on the edge, or be inside, but not in the central rectangle.
           
           My strategy is the following: Generate a grid and choose the first 25 points, ensuring that there is a good distribution of points. Then generate 25 more for the same set of valid values, but using the other value for the angle. So, generate and fill.
