           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three graspable and stackable objects (v8, v12, v15) and several poses and supports. The robot has two arms (v4, v6) and is at a base configuration (v3). The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing the state where object `green` is on `v18` and `green` is of `type` `v17`. In our current problem, `v12` is of `type` `v17`. The axiom for `new-axiom@0()` is:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom on(?green, v18)
               Atom type(?green, v17)
           ```
           Looking at the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)`. So, to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, we need to achieve `on(v12, v18)`.
           From the axioms, `on(?o, ?r)` means `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           In the initial state, we have `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. We also have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v10)`.
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, we need `atpose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. The initial state already contains `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. So, the remaining sub-goal is to get `v12` to `#o2`.
           However, the robot cannot directly move an object to a specific pose. It can `pick` an object and then `place` it.
           The available action instances only contain `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of `v12` or its pose. Therefore, it's impossible to move `v12` to `#o2` using the given actions, and thus, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action does not change the location of any object, nor does it affect the `on` predicate, or `type` predicate for `v12`. The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `on(v12, v18)` (since `type(v12, v17)` is already true), which means `atpose(v12, ?p)` and `supported(v12, ?p, v18)`. Currently, `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. While `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state, there is no way to achieve `atpose(v12, #o2)` with the given actions. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
