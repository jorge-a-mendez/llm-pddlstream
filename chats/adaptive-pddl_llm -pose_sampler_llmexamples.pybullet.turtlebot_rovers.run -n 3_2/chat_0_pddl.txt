User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is an enclosed square area with obstacles within it. The outer walls are defined by obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4. Obstacle 0 defines a large central area. Obstacle 5 is a vertical wall in the middle of the arena. Obstacles 6 through 21 are various smaller boxes scattered throughout the arena. My strategy is to choose points on a circle of radius 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 around the target point. This provides a good distribution of points. I will avoid the areas occupied by the fixed obstacles. I am particularly concerned about obstacle 5, the central vertical wall, which could block line-of-sight if the target is on one side and the robot on the other. Given the target point, I will prioritize points on the same side of this wall.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempts all collided with obstacle 8, which is at `((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25))`. The target point is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`. This implies that I need to be careful with the y-coordinate when the x-coordinate is between -2.25 and -1.75. Given the target point's low y-coordinate, it is likely that many high y-coordinate positions will be occluded by obstacle 5, the central vertical wall, or by obstacle 6 which is located at `((-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305), (-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693))`. I should focus on points with low y-coordinates or points close to the target point. I will still use the strategy of trying points on circles of various radii around the target, but I will adjust the angle and quadrant to avoid previously identified collision zones and account for occlusions. I will now prioritize positions on the same side of obstacle 5 as the target point, and also try to avoid obstacle 6.
