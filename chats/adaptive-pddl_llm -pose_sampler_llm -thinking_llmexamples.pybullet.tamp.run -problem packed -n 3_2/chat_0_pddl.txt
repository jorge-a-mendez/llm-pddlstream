(Thoughts: **Stable Object Placement Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, which is a square region centered at the origin. The key is that this object is *almost* square, with its dimensions being very close. This means that when it's rotated, its effective bounding box remains nearly square. I've broken down the problem by considering the maximum possible rotation, 45 degrees, and the axis-aligned position.
           
           First, I calculated the effective bounding box dimensions for various rotation angles using standard trigonometric formulas. The surface has dimensions 0.270 x 0.270, and I need to determine the maximum size of the object's rotated bounding box that will fit. Due to object dimensions being almost identical, the maximum rotated bounding box occurs at the 45-degree angle. Even at this maximum rotated size, the object still fits within surface 0.
           
           Based on this, I've calculated two sets of placements: one at 0 degrees and the second set at 45 degrees, both with `5 x 5` grid-like points, for a total of 50 placements. This gives a range of positions for the object, rotating it or leaving it in its original orientation, whilst maintaining stability and containment.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. I've successfully placed object ID 5 on surface 0, and that placement hasn't collided with *fixed* obstacles. This is key for future object placement.
           
           Now, I'm tasked with placing a *new* object, ID 4, on the same surface. It's a square with sides of approximately 0.081. Here's the catch: I must avoid collisions with the previously placed object, ID 5. The instruction "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j" makes this clear.
           
           First, I need to define the surface bounds and ensure the new object falls within.
           Surface dimensions and the object dimensions themselves determine safe coordinate locations.
           
           My process starts with calculating object 5's AABB using the previous placement coordinates, including the AABB extents. Then, I check for collision with the calculated AABB with the new object.
           
           I calculated an AABB of object 5, occupying the region roughly `[-0.135, -0.039] x [-0.135, -0.039]`.
           I am going to rotate the new object to maximize coverage. The object is a square of size `0.081`, so the maximum rotated dimensions are `0.057`.
           
           Then, I identified valid surface regions for placement of the new object.
           From there I calculate the collision zone for the AABB intersection of two objects.
           
           Given the bounds of surface 0, these will serve as initial conditions. The object will also need to be placed so that there are no overlaps. The regions which cause overlap will be excluded.
           
           So, for object 4, I will generate 50 candidate placements: 25 at `theta = 0` and 25 at `theta = pi/4`.
           For `theta=0`: x and y coordinates from `0.0025 to 0.09449456`, which are 0.0025 increments.
           For `theta=pi/4`: x and y coordinates from `0.0192 to 0.0777`, which are 0.019 increments.
           
           This should give me a good set of valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6) on a surface, avoiding two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4) that are now considered obstacles. The surface and obstacle dimensions are known. My strategy is to generate a set of candidate placements and then filter them based on collision checks.
           
           First, I define the surface boundaries and the AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes) for the two obstacles.  I'll be using four key orientations for object 6: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3pi/4 radians.  For each orientation, I'll define the relevant half-dimensions of the rotated object, which is needed to compute the AABB of the rotated object.
           
           The next step involves generating potential placement coordinates (cx, cy) for the object's center. I'll create a 5x5 grid of points within the surface for each orientation.  I need to calculate the limits of each angle. These will be used to generate my candidate points.
           
           After generating, I'll then check each candidate point. I will compute the rotated AABB for object 6, given its center point and the chosen angle.  This will be done to check for containment, by checking if object 6's AABB is fully inside the surface's AABB. Then, I'll test for collisions with each obstacle's AABB. If it's within the surface and doesn't collide with the obstacles, it's a valid placement. If the placement list reaches 50 valid solutions, I'll stop searching. Otherwise, I will use a larger grid if necessary, or check the existing placement, one last time.
