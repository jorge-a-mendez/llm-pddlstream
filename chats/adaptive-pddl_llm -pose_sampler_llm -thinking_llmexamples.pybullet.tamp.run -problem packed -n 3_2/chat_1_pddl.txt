           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: Placing Multiple Objects on a Receptor**
           
           Okay, so the objective is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto receptor `v16`. Specifically, they need to be *supported* by `v16`, which means they have to be placed on it at pose `#o2`. The current state has those objects supported by `v11` at their initial poses.
           
           My initial thought was to use a simple "pick-and-place" strategy.  Grab each object from `v11`, and place it on `v16` at pose `#o2`. Standard stuff, right?  The facts seem to align with this plan. I have `kin` facts indicating a grasp, bconf, and atraj for all the necessary objects and poses, along with arm configurations. Furthermore, I have the  `atpose`  and `supported` facts to correctly apply the preconditions for these actions.  However, this plan falls apart when I look at what actions *are* available.
           
           The only action instance I'm allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That moves the base but doesn't do *anything* useful for actually manipulating objects. It doesn't allow me to *pick* or *place* anything, meaning I can't modify the support relationships, and thus I can't achieve the goal. No matter how much I analyze those available facts about kin, I cannot create an achievable plan with the provided actions.  Therefore, the problem is *impossible* to solve within the constraints.
