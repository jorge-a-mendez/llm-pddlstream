(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to create 50 stable placements of object ID 7, a square with side `s = 0.08965070226237037`, on surface 0, an AABB centered at (0,0) with bounds from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). A placement is stable if the object remains entirely within the surface. I need to consider various orientations (`theta`) and positions (x, y).
           
           First, I need to understand the relationship between the object's rotation (`theta`) and the effective bounding box dimensions. Since it's a square, its effective width and height when axis-aligned are equal to `s`.  As the square rotates, the effective dimensions change, which I calculate using `eff_dim = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. The maximum `eff_dim` happens at `pi/4` and is `s * sqrt(2)`.
           
           I then calculate the allowed center position range for x and y for different angles, knowing the surface bounds and `eff_dim`, which is `surf_min_x + eff_dim/2 <= x <= surf_max_x - eff_dim/2` and similar for y.
           
           I'll generate placements in a structured way:
           1.  **Select Orientations:** I pick several orientations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2, pi).  Due to symmetry, these should cover most distinct cases.
           2.  **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** I calculate `eff_dim` and half `eff_dim` and use this for the allowed position ranges for each orientation.
           3.  **Create a Grid:** I determine the valid range of centers and divide the range into a grid (using 3 x 3, but the last case gets 5 placements on a line to make up the 50 total).
           
           This will give me the 50 placements. I make sure to verify the number of placements is correct (50).

(Thoughts: **The 50 Placements Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with figuring out 50 stable positions for object 4, which is that pesky square with a side length of 0.093926. The surface is still the same: a nice little rectangle from -0.135 to 0.135. The real challenge, of course, is avoiding collisions, especially with object 7, the one that's already comfortably nestled in the bottom left.  I've got its exact position and that AABB information.
           
           First, I need to get the placement strategy straight.  It's all about playing with `theta` - the rotation - and `x` and `y` - the position. The fundamental concept is fairly simple - I need to place object 4 without it overlapping with the established AABB of object 7.  I calculate object 4's effective dimension for any given `theta`. Then, given `x` and `y`, I construct object 4's AABB.  If there's overlap between the AABBs of objects 4 and 7, I discard that placement.
           
           Now, because object 7 sits in the lower-left, it's pretty clear that I'm going to concentrate on the top and right sides of the surface. To ensure that 50 stable placements, I will use some systematically generated x,y coordinates, to make sure I am covering the surface to my liking.
           
           Here’s the plan:
           
           I'm going to start with 5 evenly spaced angles (0, pi/4, pi/2, 3*pi/4, pi) because those are the easy ones. For each of these angles, I'll generate a grid of 3 x 3 positions within the surface area.  The grid coordinates will be centered on `x` and `y` position for a square rotated `theta` to create those 3 x 3 AABB's on a coordinate system.  As always, if the AABB overlaps object 7 I'll throw it away. I'm going to skip the very first one, for each theta, because, with `theta = 0`, I found the object was being placed right on the corner of the surface and collision was detected in the AABB analysis.  Since my goal is to find 50 stable positions.
           
           That’ll give me 40 placements, and for the remaining 10, I'll spread those out across my selection. 
           
           All this is fine, but it really comes down to the collision detection function and being precise with those `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` coordinates. The function that returns `True` for `is_colliding` means the collision is detected and placement is discarded, and for `False` it’s good to go!

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a square object (ID 5) with side length *s5* on a surface (Surface 0). Surface 0 is defined by the coordinates ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I must also account for previously placed objects: object 7 and object 4. I've already calculated their AABBs and know their positions.
           
           My approach will be to systematically generate potential placements for object 5 across the surface, considering its rotation (theta). I need to ensure that the object doesn't collide with the existing objects, either the AABBs overlap. The strategy will be to use different angles of rotation for the object.
           
           I begin by focusing on the `theta = 0` scenario, which means the object remains square. I establish the valid X and Y ranges based on the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries. Then, I define a grid of potential centers within these ranges and check each position for collisions with the existing objects' AABBs.
           
           After detailed calculations and testing, I moved through the rotations, checking different angles from 0 to pi/4. I calculated the AABB size for each rotated object, determined valid placement ranges, and systematically checked points within these ranges for collisions against the AABBs of objects 7 and 4. This detailed filtering process ensures no overlap and stable placement.
           
           This method successfully located 50 unique positions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tackling the problem of placing 50 stable instances of object ID 6 (a square of side length 0.0766) on a surface defined by the range (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The challenge is to avoid collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 7, 4, and 5) and to determine stable positions.
           
           My approach involves calculating the required space needed for a new object based on the current angle theta.  I need to find the effective size of each object depending on its rotation.  To prevent collision I'm using the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of each object.  The AABB is the smallest rectangle aligned with the axes that fully encloses the object.  I've defined a clear way to check for overlap between AABBs.
           
           Given existing objects' positions and sizes, I will iterate through angles at a set increment and generate a grid of potential (x, y) placements on the surface, from a set of angles, using np.linspace. For each angle I'll calculate the 'effective dimension' of the new object to ensure it is collision-free. I then transform my new angle into a new set of dimensions to check for collision.  After that, I will evaluate the collision by checking for any overlap with the existing AABBs. If no overlap is detected, I'll count this a valid placement.  This continues until 50 valid placements are found.
           
           I'm using numpy to generate the x and y coordinates. The angles are being incremented at steps of π/10, starting with 0. I'll test 10 angles in total. Within these different angles, I am generating 100 candidate placements per angle.
           
           By increasing the number of points and angles, I hope to increase the chances of getting enough placements to meet the objective.
