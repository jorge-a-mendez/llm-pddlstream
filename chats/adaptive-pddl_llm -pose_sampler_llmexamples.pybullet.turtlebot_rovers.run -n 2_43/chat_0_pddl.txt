           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a specific configuration (v13 and v15 respectively) and equipped with a camera (v10) that supports a mode (v11). There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and two objectives (v17, v18). Both rovers have a free store (v16). There is a lander (v9) for communication. Various `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates indicate that the rovers can communicate and take images of objectives and are positioned above several rocks for potential sampling.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is an axiom that evaluates to true if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are true (which they are initially).
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true (which they are initially).
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` are true. This means images of objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11 need to be taken and sent.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` are true. This means at least one rock of type v2 needs to be sampled and its analysis sent.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are true. This means at least one rock of type v6 needs to be sampled and its analysis sent.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the goal:
           
           *   **`receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:**
               *   This requires taking an image of v17 and v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and then sending it.
               *   To take an image, the camera needs to be calibrated.
               *   Rover v12 can take an image of v17 with camera v10 at #o3 using ray #o4.
               *   Rover v14 can take an image of v17 with camera v10 at #o3 using ray #o4.
               *   Rover v12 can take an image of v18 with camera v10 at #o3 using ray #o4.
               *   Rover v14 can take an image of v18 with camera v10 at #o3 using ray #o4.
               *   Both rovers can communicate with the lander v9 at #o0 using ray #o1.
           
           *   **`receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where stone is of type v2):**
               *   Rocks v1, v3, v4 are of type v2.
               *   Both rovers v12 and v14 are above these rocks at #o5.
               *   A rover needs to `sample_rock`, which will set `analyzed(rover, rock)`.
               *   Then, the rover needs to `send_analysis`.
           
           *   **`receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where soil is of type v6):**
               *   Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
               *   Both rovers v12 and v14 are above these rocks at #o5.
               *   Similar to the stone analysis, a rover needs to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           
           Since we only have `move`, `drop_rock` as allowed actions, and the `new-axiom@0()` essentially says "the final state has to have these conditions achieved", but no actions are given to achieve those conditions from the initial state (like taking images, sampling, sending data), the goal is not achievable with the provided list of allowed actions. The allowed actions only permit moving the rovers or dropping rocks from a full store, neither of which directly contributes to the goal of having received images or analyses.
           
           The problem states "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The given list of allowed actions is `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13)) ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15)) ((drop_rock v12 v16)) ((drop_rock v14 v16))`. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates required by the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
