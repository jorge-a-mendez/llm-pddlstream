           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, I need to ensure a few things are true: rovers in certain configurations, rovers with free stores, and then I need to receive images of specific objectives and receive analyses of stone and soil samples.
           
           The initial state satisfies the rover configuration and store availability conditions. The challenge lies in achieving the image and analysis receipts. To get an image, I'd typically need a sequence: calibrate, take_image, send_image. For the analysis, it's sample_rock, then send_analysis.
           
           Now, here's the kicker: the *only* actions I'm allowed to use are `move` and `drop_rock`.  These actions just move rovers and free up stores by dropping rocks.  They absolutely *cannot* produce the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates required by my goal.
           
           I've checked the initial state, and those predicates are definitely false. I've re-read the problem statement several times, emphasizing the "only" actions rule.  It's clear:  no take_image, no send_image, no sample_rock, no send_analysis.  I'm stuck.
           
           The problem also mentions some details about objects starting with '#'. This is related to their continuous configurations. Since these are configurations with a '#' prefix, and image/com visibility constraints, I need to consider these objects.  If I could use actions like `take_image`, then I could manipulate the object and make the goal true.
           
           This strict limitation on action instances makes the goal impossible to achieve given the initial state. The existing `atconf` and `free` predicates are already true.  However,  `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are false.  The allowable actions (move and drop_rock) cannot make them true.
           
           I have come to the conclusion, I need to tell the user that the goal is unattainable with the given constraints and available actions.
