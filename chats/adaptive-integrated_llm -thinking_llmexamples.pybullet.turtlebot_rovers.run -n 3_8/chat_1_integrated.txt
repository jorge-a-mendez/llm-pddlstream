           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **A Comprehensive Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the conditions defined by `new-axiom@0()`, which requires a combination of image acquisition, image transmission, rock analysis, and analysis transmission.
           
           I've broken down the problem into smaller, achievable steps.  The initial state provides some key information: rovers `v12` and `v14` are at specific configurations, `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`, respectively.  They both have the necessary equipment: a camera (`v10`) and a store (`v16`). The crucial unmet conditions are receiving images of objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`, as well as analyzing and receiving analysis of a stone (`type(v2)`) and soil (`type(v6)`).
           
           The plan involves using rover `v14` for image acquisition and rover `v12` for rock sampling and analysis transmission. Rover `v14` will move to a specific configuration `#o3` near the objectives, and perform image acquisition of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using the `take_image` action after calibration. Rover `v12` will move to configuration `#o5` for sampling rocks to prepare the conditions for sending and analysis to the lander. The lander, `v9`, requires all data received in the form of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           A key challenge is the fact that `calibrate` will un-calibrate the rover. Therefore, I've constructed a plan that re-calibrates for each image. This can perhaps be improved by carefully ordering actions.
           
           The next steps involve communication. Both rovers move to a designated communication configuration, `#o0`. Then, `v14` sends the acquired images and `v12` sends the rock analysis to `v9` using the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively.
           
           After fulfilling image and analysis transmission, the plan involves returning each rover to their initial configuration.
           
           In summary:
           
           *   **Move:**
               *   `v14` to image pose `#o3`.
               *   `v12` to sample pose `#o5`.
               *   `v12` and `v14` to comm pose `#o0`.
               *   `v14` back to its initial config
               *   `v12` back to its initial config
           *   **Image:**
               *   `v14`: Calibrate, take image of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           *   **Sample & Analyse:**
               *   `v12` Sample one stone and soil sample with the `sample_rock` action.
               *   Drop the sample so the store is free to use
           *   **Transmit:**
               *   Send the images to `v9`.
               *   Send the analyses to `v9`.
           
           To complete this plan I need to specify the coordinates for the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`:
           *   `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-0.0, -1.75)`
           *   `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-0.0, -1.75)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (0.6, 2.0)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (0.6, 2.0)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v19): (0.6, 2.0)`
           *   `(#o5 v12 None None): (-0.1, -0.2)`
           *   `(#o5 v12 None None): (-0.1, -0.2)`
           
           These coordinates will enable the rovers to carry out the necessary actions, enabling the solution of new-axiom@0() to be satisfied.

           The plan involves using rover `v14` for image acquisition and rover `v12` for rock sampling and analysis transmission. Rover `v14` will move to a specific configuration `#o3` near the objectives, and perform image acquisition of `v17`, `v18`, and `v19` using the `take_image` action after calibration. Rover `v12` will move to configuration `#o5` for sampling rocks to prepare the conditions for sending and analysis to the lander. The lander, `v9`, requires all data received in the form of `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           A key challenge is the fact that `calibrate` will un-calibrate the rover. Therefore, I've constructed a plan that re-calibrates for each image. This can perhaps be improved by carefully ordering actions.
           
           The next steps involve communication. Both rovers move to a designated communication configuration, `#o0`. Then, `v14` sends the acquired images and `v12` sends the rock analysis to `v9` using the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively.
           
           After fulfilling image and analysis transmission, the plan involves returning each rover to their initial configuration.
           
           In summary:
           
           *   **Move:**
               *   `v14` to image pose `#o3`.
               *   `v12` to sample pose `#o5`.
               *   `v12` and `v14` to comm pose `#o0`.
               *   `v14` back to its initial config
               *   `v12` back to its initial config
           *   **Image:**
               *   `v14`: Calibrate, take image of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`.
           *   **Sample & Analyse:**
               *   `v12` Sample one stone and soil sample with the `sample_rock` action.
               *   Drop the sample so the store is free to use
           *   **Transmit:**
               *   Send the images to `v9`.
               *   Send the analyses to `v9`.
           
           To complete this plan I need to specify the coordinates for the configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`:
           *   `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9): (-0.0, -1.75)`
           *   `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-0.0, -1.75)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17): (0.6, 2.0)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v18): (0.6, 2.0)`
           *   `(#o3 v14 #o4 v19): (0.6, 2.0)`
           *   `(#o5 v12 None None): (-0.1, -0.2)`
           *   `(#o5 v12 None None): (-0.1, -0.2)`
           
           These coordinates will enable the rovers to carry out the necessary actions, enabling the solution of new-axiom@0() to be satisfied.

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so after a lot of analysis, I've re-evaluated the collision reports and crafted a plan that should avoid all the problems I encountered previously. The key here is to find new, collision-free configurations for the communication (#o0), imaging (#o3), and sampling (#o5) tasks.
           
           **Communication and Rover Positioning:**
           
           Firstly, communication. My initial plan failed because the robot's planned pose at (0.0, -1.75) for `#o0` clashed with a vertical wall (`v20`) at x=0. So, I need to get the rover out of the way. I've re-positioned the communication point to (-1.0, -2.0) for both rovers, which is away from x=0 and near the lander (v9), and within range.
           
           **Imaging:**
           
           Then there's the imaging problem. Rover `v14` needs to capture images of three targets, `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`. My initial choice of pose (0.6, 2.0) for `#o3` caused collisions with `v21` (a general obstacle) and the imaging target `v18`. I've now chosen a single pose `(0.7, 1.5)` for `#o3`. This position gives good line-of-sight to the imaging targets while staying clear of the obstacle.
           
           **Sampling:**
           
           As for the sampling, I needed a good sampling point for rover `v12` to grab the rocks. I have now chosen a sampling location `(-0.8, -0.4)`. This is roughly between the two rocks `v1` and `v5` so that rover can approach the rocks, and it is a safe position away from identified obstacles.
           
           I also revised the rover operations:
           
           1.  **Rover v14 (Imaging):**
               *   Move to the imaging pose.
               *   Take images.
               *   Communicate those image.
           2.  **Rover v12 (Sampling):**
               *   Move to the sampling pose.
               *   Sample *v1* rock, send analysis to earth. Drop rock to be `free` and `full` after `sample_rock`.
               *   Move to sampling location to sample *v5*, send analysis to earth, then drop rock to be `free`.
           
           This revised flow ensures that I account for the `free` store variable.
           
           **Final Actions:**
             * v14: v15 -> #o3 -> #o0 -> v15
             * v12: v13 -> #o5 -> #o0 -> v13
           
           This new approach avoids the problems of collision and ensure that the goals are met. This will give a good solution to the problem.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Rover Success**
           
           Alright, the feedback is in, and it's clear: my initial choices for the communication and imaging configurations weren't cutting it. Time to get back to the drawing board and find new, workable positions for the rovers.
           
           I've got a set of criteria to meet: the configurations have to be reachable, collision-free, have clear lines of sight, and adhere to those distance limits. I need to make sure the rovers can reach their goals, without crashing and ensure they can "see" what they need to see.
           
           **Rover Starting Points and Objectives**
           *   **Rover 12** starts at (1.0, -1.75).
           *   **Rover 14** starts at (-1.0, -1.75).
           The lander *v9* is over near (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           **Key Tasks:**
           
           I need to analyze stone and soil samples and image three objectives, all while ensuring the rovers start and end in their initial positions, and all objectives are free at the end of the plan.
           
           I'm thinking about how the rovers can work together efficiently, trying to position them for minimal travel and direct communication with *v9*.
           
           **Revised Configurations:**
           
           **1. Communication Pose (#o0)**
           
           *   To talk to the lander, I'm now thinking Rover 14 should move to (-1.5, -1.75) from (-1.0, -1.75). This is close to *v9*. The distance is about 0.47, well within the 4-meter comm limit, and on the same side of the wall at x=0.
           *   Rover 12 must also communicate, so it will also travel from (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, -1.75). Assuming that crossing the thin wall at x=0 is traversable.
           
           **2. Imaging Pose for Rover 14 (#o3)**
           
           *   For imaging, I need a position that can "see" all three objectives. Previous collision issues means I must find a new configuration from Rover 14 starting at  (-1.0, -1.75).
           *   Considering a rough average, I'm placing the imaging pose at (0.6, 1.0) because the objectives are high on the Y-axis. This position appears to provide line-of-sight to the objectives and is collision-free.
           *   Distance from (0.6, 1.0) to (-1.0, -1.75) is reachable from the starting point of Rover 14 at (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           **3. Sampling Pose for Rover 12 (#o5)**
           
           *   I need Rover 12 to get to rocks *v1* and *v5*. From (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.8, -0.4). This position is close to both rocks, about 0.42 to 0.45 meters.
           *   The only obstacle between Rover 12's starting point and this position is the wall at x=0.

           3.  Move to (0.6, -1.75) to communicate
           4.  Send Images
           5.  Move back to original position (-1.0, -1.75)
           
           **Rover 12 (Sampling and Communicating)**
           1.  Move to sample location (-0.8, -0.4)
           2.  Sample and analyze objects *v1* and *v5*
           3.  Move to (-1.5, -1.75) to communicate
           4.  Send analysis
           5.  Move back to original position (1.0, -1.75)
           
           These revised configurations meet the criteria for accessibility, line-of-sight and communication. I'm going to run this now to see if the rovers can carry out the tasks.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for the Mission**
           
           Okay, so I've hit a roadblock. The previous suggestions for communication (`#o0`) and imaging (`#o3`) aren't working because they either cause collisions or are simply unreachable for the rovers. I need to take another look at the spatial constraints, particularly the robot bases and those pesky fixed obstacles.
           
           Let's recap the mission's requirements: We need to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down into:
           
           1.  Rovers at their starting spots (v12, v13) and (v14, v15).
           2.  Empty stores (`v16`) for both rovers.
           3.  All three objectives imaged and transmitted (`receivedimage`).
           4.  Analysis of one stone and one soil sample received (`receivedanalysis`).
           
           Now, here's the current situation:
           
           *   Rover `v12` is at (1.0, -1.75, 3.142), `v14` is at (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0), and both stores are empty.
           *   We've got objectives `v17, v18, v19`, the lander `v9`, and rocks `v1, v5` (stone and soil).
           *   The main problem is this wall, `v20`, at `x=0`. Previous attempts to set up communication and imaging positions either collided with it or were "not reachable."
           
           So, the issue: how do I arrange for communication and imaging? It seems that my proposed coordinates were either too close to obstacles or physically inaccessible by the robot base. Let's start with communication.
           
           1.  **Communication (`#o0`)**: I initially tried (-1.0, -2.0) and (-1.5, -1.75) for the communication point. However, these were either in collision with the wall at x=0 or with the lander `v9` itself!  The lander is roughly at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). It needs to be within 4m of the rover, have a line of sight, and not collide with the lander.  A good candidate could be (-1.5, -1.0) for both.
           
               *   `v14` goes from (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, -1.0). That seems reachable, and the distance to the lander seems okay.
               *   `v12` would need to travel from (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, -1.0), crossing x=0. This distance is longer but reachable, provided I can find a path around the wall. So, I will try (-1.5, -1.0).
           
           2.  **Imaging (`#o3`)**:  My previous `(0.6, 2.0)` hit obstacles. `(0.6, 1.0)` was also deemed unreachable for the robot base. The rovers start at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and, from the looks of it, it needs to be on the `y > 1` area.
           
               *   Objectives are around `(2.17, 2.07), (0.42, 2.15)`, and `(-0.68, 2.16)`. The "problem" is the blocking object is `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`.
               *   I need a position that can see all three objectives.
               *   Trying out a point like `(0.6, 1.5)`. This clears the obstacle. From my calculations and reasoning, I've got my coordinates for the imaging action set at `(0.6, 1.5)`.
           
           3.  **Sampling (`#o5`)**: The coordinates from the previous step were deemed incorrect. The stone is at `(-1.239, -0.323)` and the soil is at `(-0.377, -0.46)`. Let's try `(-0.8, -0.4)`.
           
           Now, if I try and incorporate the updated information. Here is the revised plan:
           
           -   `v14`: Move to `#o3 (0.6, 1.5)` -> Image `v17, v18, v19` -> Move to `#o0 (-1.
