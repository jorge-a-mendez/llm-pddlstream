(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, a square with side 0.0939 units) on a square surface (surface 0, side 0.27 units) centered at (0,0). My primary concern is ensuring the object's bounding box stays within the surface's boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I recognized that the square object simplifies my calculations.  Rotating a square simply changes the effective width and height. When rotated by 45 degrees, the object's apparent size increases to 0.1328 units. However, this rotated dimension remains less than the surface dimension (0.27), meaning *any* rotation is feasible, given the surface is large enough for all rotations of this small square object.
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I'll leverage a grid-based approach. Since both the object and the surface are centered, I need to focus on where the rotated bounding boxes fit. I've calculated the boundaries for the x and y coordinates that keep the object stable for both unrotated (`theta = 0`) and rotated (`theta = pi/4`) positions. I will vary the rotation by only two angles, 0 and pi/4, as 0 and pi/2, pi, 3pi/2 are equivalent in the final AABB dimensions.
           
           For `theta = 0` (unrotated): I'll choose x and y coordinates within the range [-0.088, 0.088], as this ensures the object fits without overlap. I will divide this range into 5 points, providing fine control for x and y.
           
           For `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees): The range shrinks slightly. I will choose x and y coordinates in the range of [-0.068, 0.068]. Again, I will divide this range into 5 points.
           
           This 5x5 grid in both rotations will ensure adequate diversity and coverage of the stable placement space, for a final count of 50 stable placements. I will not have to check for collisions, as there are no other objects to consider.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down.  I've got the feedback on Object 5's successful placement, which gives me the location: it's in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Now I need to tackle Object 4.
           
           First things first: I know Object 4 is a square, just like Object 5. I also know that the overall surface of `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and that Object 4 has the dimension of `0.09330025820803606, 0.093300258208036`. My goal is to find *50 stable placements* for it, but critically, *avoiding any collisions* with Object 5.
           
           I've determined that the valid range for placing Object 4 in surface zero is: `-0.08834987089598197, 0.08834987089598197]` when the rotation is `theta = 0`. If `theta = pi/4` is applied, the range is then `-0.06902950755, 0.06902950755]`.
           
           Object 5's position is fixed: `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.041108004063164385, -0.041108004063164385)]`. So, `B5 = [-0.135, -0.0411, -0.135, -0.0411]`. I'll use `B5` as my collision region.
           
           To place object 4 at any position `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` I must consider the AABB of object 4: `B4 = [B4_min_x, B4_max_x, B4_min_y, B4_max_y]`. This is easy to calculate for any `theta`.
           
           Now the challenge: collision avoidance! Two AABBs don't overlap if one's max is less than the other's min, or vice versa, on either axis. I'll need to check every placement against that.
           
           Here's my plan:  I'll focus on `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` because the calculations are straightforward. I'm especially interested in finding placements above and to the right of Object 5, or more generally, any region that's clearly away from the bottom-left corner.
           
           Now, considering the collision, I've calculated the critical `B5_max_x` region to be `-0.0411` and therefore the collision box of object5 must be avoided. Considering the area to the right, to avoid collision, `x` must be greater than 0.005542125. The AABB box of object 4 will collide if:
           
           If `x + half_s_rot_obj4 < B5_min_x` (object 4 is to the left of 5)
           If `x - half_s_rot_obj4 > B5_max_x` (object 4 is to the right of 5)
           If `y + half_s_rot_obj4 < B5_min_y` (object 4 is below 5)
           If `y - half_s_rot_obj4 > B5_max_y` (object 4 is above 5).
           
           I've determined that only the following centers will *not* result in a collision for the two rotation parameters of 0 and `pi/2`:
           
           All placement for a 5x5 grid except the very first placement at the bottom left-hand corner. These are 24 stable placements.
           
           And the next 2 stable positions are:
           For `i=0`, `j=3`: `(-0.06902950755, 0.034514753775)`.
           For `i=0`, `j=4`: `(-0.06902950755, 0.06902950755)`.
           
           This makes 24 + 24 + 2 stable placements. These total

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking: My goal is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (Object 6) on a flat surface (Surface 0). I need to account for the current positions and sizes of two existing fixed obstacles (Object 5 and Object 4) to ensure these new placements are stable and won't collide.
           
           First, I've got the lay of the land: Surface 0 is a 2D area, and I know its dimensions. I also have the dimensions and fixed placements of the obstacles. Object 5 is located in the bottom left corner, and object 4 is somewhat below object 5.
           
           I've calculated the valid center ranges for the new square object (Object 6) on the surface, considering two primary orientations: `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`) and `theta = pi/4`.  For `theta = 0`, the center of Object 6 must be within a rectangle `[-0.097, 0.097]`. For `theta = pi/4`, it must be within a smaller rectangle `[-0.081, 0.081]`. These calculations ensure that the object remains within the surface boundaries.
           
           Now, the crucial part: I need to check for collisions with the fixed obstacles. I will use the AABB collision detection method for this purpose. I’ve determined the ranges where Object 6's AABB would overlap with Object 5 and Object 4 for the different orientations. For `theta = 0`, I have to check for X ranges of `-0.1725, -0.00357`, and Y ranges `-0.1725, -0.00357`. For `theta = pi/4`, it is similarly computed.  These ranges represent the ‘exclusion zones’ around the obstacles that I need to avoid.
           
           With those calculations in place, I decided to generate placements systematically. For orientations 0 and pi/2, I used a 5x5 grid (total of 50). I then filtered out positions within the exclusion zones. I found there were 22 possible placements for `theta = 0`. After adding the placements for `theta = pi/2`, I had 44 stable placements in total.
           
           For the missing six placements, I checked a grid with `theta = pi/4` and determined the available positions. I selected the first 6 non-colliding placements to meet the total count of 50.
