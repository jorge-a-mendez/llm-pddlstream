User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.217, -0.169), (0.297, -0.088)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.077, 0.444), (0.018, 0.539)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.216, 0.332, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.407, 0.913).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.001, 0.328), (0.099, 0.426)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.257, -0.129, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.646, 0.763).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.03, 0.492, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.51, 0.86).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.05, 0.377, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.951, 0.308).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.166, 0.282), (0.265, 0.381)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan to get v8, v12, v14, and v16 all placed on surface v18:**
           
           My goal is clear: get all four objects onto v18.  I've assessed the initial state.  Each object is currently on surface v11, supported by surface v11, and has a target pose, `#o2`, on v18. Crucially, all my actions have to happen from the robot's base configuration, v3, which the task constrains me to.
           
           The robot has an arm, v4, and starts with an empty hand, `handempty(v4)`.  The only available base motion, and it's a no-op action, is `move_base v3 v3 #o0` so the base config cannot move. The base must stay at `v3`.
           
           The arm can pick and place based on the `kin` facts, which I've reviewed. Notably, all the `kin` facts relevant to moving these objects *from* their initial poses *to* `#o2` on v18 are available. The action sequence will be Pick, then Place, repeat for all objects.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1.  **Pick** v8 from v9 and **Place** it at (#o2 v8 v18): (-0.05 0.05 0.781 0.0).  Make sure the trajectory and the approach are safe and collision-free.
           2.  **Pick** v12 from v13 and **Place** it at (#o2 v12 v18): (0.05 0.05 0.781 0.0).  Collision-check to avoid previous placed v8 on v18.
           3.  **Pick** v14 from v15 and **Place** it at (#o2 v14 v18): (-0.05 -0.05 0.781 0.0). Avoid any overlaps.
           4.  **Pick** v16 from v17 and **Place** it at (#o2 v16 v18): (0.05 -0.05 0.781 0.0).  Final object on the table, v18.
           
           This should place all objects on v18 in a collision-free manner.
           The total cost of this plan is 8, (4 pick and 4 place actions).
           The output parameters of the continuous poses are generated by the algorithm and are generated based on the AABB information for the problem space.
           The key to getting this right is ensuring the poses defined by `#o2` are distinct.  And, I have considered the collision-checking needs and how to define non-overlapping positions on `v18`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem. The user was correct to point out the flawed action selection. I was operating under the assumption of `pick` and `place` actions, but the provided list of valid actions only includes `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a significant constraint!  Essentially, the robot is immobile with respect to object manipulation.
           
           Given the goal state - `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)` - I can see that this inherently necessitates changing the support structure of the objects. Currently, the objects are `atpose` and `supported` by `v11`, not `v18`.  Achieving the goal requires the objects to be `supported` by `v18`.
           
           However, the only action available, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does *nothing* to alter the spatial relationships between the robot and the objects, or the objects themselves. It's simply a movement action, and it cannot be used to reposition objects from `v11` to `v18`.  Without the fundamental ability to `pick` and `place`, this problem is fundamentally unsolvable.  Therefore, I'm compelled to conclude that the goal state is unattainable given the limited action set.
