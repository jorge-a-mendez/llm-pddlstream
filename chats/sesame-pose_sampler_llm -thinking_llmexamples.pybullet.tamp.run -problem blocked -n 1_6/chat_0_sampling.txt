(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to generate 50 stable placements for a 0.07x0.07 object on surface 0, which is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object is *fully* contained within the surface, and doesn't collide with anything else.  Since this is the first request, I don't have to worry about previously placed objects.
           
           First, I've got to figure out the valid placement area. The surface is 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high.  The tricky part is that the object's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) *changes* size depending on its rotation (theta). Even though the object is a square and is always 0.07x0.07 in local dimensions, when rotated, the world-aligned AABB's dimensions will vary, with a maximum size of about 0.099x0.099 at a 45-degree angle.
           
           To ensure stability for *any* rotation, I need to use the *maximum* possible AABB size to determine the *safe* placement area. I'll consider the object's local dimensions as the input AABB size, regardless of the angle. Then I'll calculate the half-extents using the formula derived, which takes rotation into account.
           
           Here's the approach:
           
           1. **Calculate the Maximum "H"**:  I'll calculate the maximum half-extent (h) for any rotation. With obj_width = obj_height = 0.07,  the maximum h is approximately 0.04949.
           
           2. **Define the Placement Space**:  Given surface 0's bounds, I'll carve out the placement space within:
              *  min_x + h <= x <= max_x - h
              *  min_y + h <= y <= max_y - h
              This results in a smaller rectangle that accounts for the widest possible AABB.
           
           3.  **Create a Grid and vary theta**:
                *  I'll create a 7x7 grid of x,y placements within the safe rectangle.
                *  The resulting placements will cycle through 7 different theta values.
           4. **Generate the 50 placements**: The result will create 49 placements. The final placement will be the central (x, y) with rotation pi (180 degrees).
           
           This grid method ensures that the placements are evenly distributed across the valid area, while the `theta` values cover a good range of rotations, making sure that there is an even distribution. By using the *most* restrictive AABB extents, I know these placements will *always* be stable no matter the orientation. The output will be well-defined, and the strategy is robust. I will deliver the placements as (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Placement of Object ID 10 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my strategy. I've got to place a new object, ID 10, on Surface 0, but I *must* avoid colliding with the previously placed ID 5 objects. The crucial part is to use the existing successful ID 5 placements to define exclusion zones for object 10.
           
           First, I'll figure out the valid placement region for object 10 on surface 0, just like I would for any other placement, using its maximum half-extent (0.057297). This gives me the safe bounds for the object's center: `4.257297 <= x <= 4.742703` and `-0.542703 <= y <= -0.057297`.
           
           Now, the trick is to account for the ID 5 objects. I have a list of their successful placements, including their positions and rotations (theta). For each ID 5 instance, I'll calculate its effective AABB using its half-extent, which varies with rotation. Then I will "buffer" it by the radius of ID 10 to include collisions. Specifically, the amount the two objects could overlap before the collision could occur. This gives me an *exclusion zone* around each placed ID 5 object.
           
           To avoid collisions, object 10's center has to be outside of the *buffered* AABB of each placed ID 5 object. Using this check, for *each* proposed object 10 placement, I need to check for collision with *all* the known instances of object ID 5.
           
           In order to simplify the collision checks, I can do a conservative check for collisions. I'll approximate each object by a circle with a radius equal to its maximum half-extent and add the two radii and check for that distance.
           
           Finally, to make sure I get a good variety of placements and cover the surface efficiently, I will start by placing object 10 in the top-right and work my way down and to the left. This will ensure they are placed far from the other objects. I will start by iterating through (x,y) coordinates from largest to smallest and then by iterating through a pre-calculated table of angles (thetas).
