User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x=0, and several smaller box obstacles scattered throughout the scene, some of which are quite small. My strategy is to first calculate a set of candidate points on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target point. This radius allows for a good balance between being close enough to the target and having some clearance. I will then filter these candidate points to ensure they are within the overall environment boundaries and do not collide with any of the known fixed obstacles. I will select the first 3 valid positions.

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x=0, and several smaller box obstacles scattered throughout the scene. The previously proposed positions all failed either due to collision with fixed obstacles or no line of sight. This indicates that the target point is in a somewhat constrained area, specifically around (0.35, 1.79). The collisions indicate the presence of obstacles near the boundaries and in the bottom left quadrant. I will try to find positions on a circle of radius 1.5 around the target point, ensuring they are within the overall environment boundaries and do not collide with any of the known fixed obstacles. I will specifically avoid the areas that caused collisions or line-of-sight issues in the previous attempt.

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x=0, and several smaller box obstacles scattered throughout the scene. The previous attempts for a similar target point showed numerous collisions and line-of-sight issues, indicating a very constrained space. The target point is (1.8768424987792969, 2.006103992462158). Previous attempts collided with (1.75, 1.75) (2.25, 2.25), and also indicated no line of sight from the left side (negative x values) and from far below (low y values). This means the robot needs to be relatively close to the target, and from the top, right, or close to the target's y-level. I will try positions that are close to the target, avoiding the known obstacles and focusing on areas that should have a clear line of sight, such as directly to the right or slightly above and to the left/right of the target. I will try a smaller radius initially around the target and adjust if needed.

Model:     The environment is bounded by a square from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There's a vertical wall in the middle at x=0, and several smaller box obstacles scattered throughout the scene. The target point is (1.8768424987792969, 2.006103992462158). Previous failures indicate a very constrained area. We've seen collisions with the obstacle at `((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))` when trying to place the robot very close to the target, and also `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` and `((0.3153393298696245, 1.754124107987758), (0.39272701439154495, 1.8315117925096784))` when attempting positions further left. Line-of-sight has been an issue from low y values and negative x values. This suggests we need to be to the right of x=0 and generally above y=0, and careful about the specific obstacles in the upper right quadrant. I will try positions on a smaller radius (0.5 to 1.5) around the target, specifically exploring the top and right quadrants relative to the target to maintain line of sight and avoid the known obstacles.
