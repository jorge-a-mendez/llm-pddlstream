           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem: I'm trying to figure out how to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially requires me to get some images and analyses of certain rocks and soil. I've got a list of conditions and initial states to work with. The initial state tells me that the rovers are at their base configurations (`v13` and `v15`), some objects are visible, and certain conditions are true.
           
           My main challenge lies in the rovers' mobility, or rather, their lack thereof. The *only* actions I'm allowed to use for movement are the ones provided: `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions essentially *do nothing* in terms of changing the rovers' locations or configurations. The rovers are stuck at their starting positions!
           
           The plan hinges on getting the rovers to certain configurations (like `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`) to take images, sample rocks, and send data.  However, all these actions rely on the `atconf(?v, ?q)` predicate, and I can't satisfy this for any `?q` other than `v13` and `v15` because the `move` actions don't allow it.
           
           To receive an image, for example, I need to take the image. But to take an image, I need to be in the `#o3` configuration. But I can't get there because I can't move. The same applies to sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analyses: all those require the rovers to be at configurations that they cannot reach.
           
           I've carefully reviewed all the relevant predicates and the allowed actions. Since the rovers cannot change their configurations, the preconditions for crucial actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `calibrate`, and `send_analysis` can *never* be met. Specifically, the required configurations are unreachable, meaning the rovers cannot complete the primary tasks in this scenario.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints of the problem, and the limitations on rover movement, I have to conclude that the goal is *unreachable*. It's a logistical roadblock, and no amount of clever planning will overcome it.
