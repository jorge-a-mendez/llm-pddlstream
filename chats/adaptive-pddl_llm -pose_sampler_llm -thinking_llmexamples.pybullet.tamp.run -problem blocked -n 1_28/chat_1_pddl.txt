           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type *on* another object, specifically something of type `v17` *on* `v18`. From the initial facts, I see I have `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. Both *could* be the `?green` object I need.
           
           **Analyzing the `on` Predicate and Initial State**
           
           The `on` predicate is the key here. It depends on `supported` and `atpose`. So, to get something "on" `v18`, it needs to be *supported* by `v18` and *at* some particular pose (location). Looking at my initial state, both `v8` and `v12` *are* supported by `v18`, but they're *at* different poses initially: `v8` at `v9` and `v12` at `v13`.
           
           **Constraints and Available Actions**
           
           The wrinkle is the action I'm allowed to use: `move_base`. It merely moves the base, and in this case, it just "moves" the base to the same location. It won't change the position of `v8` or `v12`. I need to change an object's location to satisfy the `atpose` condition. I need "pick" and "place" actions.
           
           **Re-Evaluating the Goal in Light of Constraints**
           
           I'm now realizing that `v8` and `v12`, with their initial `atpose` locations, *cannot* directly be "on" `v18` in the initial state. My goal depends on `on` which, I understand, requires an object to be *at* a certain place, in this case, supported by v18. Unfortunately, the current allowed action will only move the base which will not impact either object's place in the present scenario.
           
           **Conclusion: Unreachability**
           
           Since I'm limited to just this useless `move_base` action, I *cannot* manipulate `v8` or `v12` to satisfy `on(?green, v18)`. Without "pick" and "place" actions, this goal is simply unreachable with my existing facts and actions. I need the ability to directly modify the *atpose* predicate for `v8` or `v12` to ensure the overall axiom is true.
