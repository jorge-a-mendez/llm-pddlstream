(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, size 0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface (AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)).  Essentially, I'm looking for (surface index, rotation angle, x-coordinate, y-coordinate) tuples. The key is that the object needs to be fully *inside* the surface boundaries after rotation, and the object is axis aligned when its rotation `theta` is 0, pi/2, pi, or 3pi/2.
           
           Let's break down the surface: It's 0.6 units wide and 0.6 units high.  The object is small enough that there's plenty of room. The challenge comes from the rotation. A square object's bounding box changes size when it rotates. I'll need to figure out the maximum bounding box size. 
           
           The effective width/height of the bounding box is `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This means the smallest bounding box dimension is 0.07 (at 0, pi/2), and the largest is about 0.099 (at pi/4).  I can simplify and assume the bounding box is always the largest size to be safe.
           
           To find placements, I need to define the center coordinates' ranges.  For a given rotation `theta`, the object's center `x` needs to be within `min_x + side_bb / 2` and `max_x - side_bb / 2`.  Same goes for `y`. This gives me some constraints.
           
           My strategy: Create a set of positions and then use a few different angles. The goal is 50 placements. I will generate a 5x5 grid of positions, so the total number of positions is 25. Then I will test at two angles `0` and `pi/4`, because these give the minimum and maximum bounding box sizes.  I will generate the range of x and y coordinates so that the object is stable.
              
           For each angle, I will calculate `side_bb` based on the rotation `theta`.  I'll then determine the ranges for the center coordinates (x, y) based on `side_bb`.
           For theta = 0, bounding box = 0.07. Then
           `x_coords = [4.235, 4.5, 4.765]`
           `y_coords = [-0.565, -0.3, -0.035]`
           
           For theta = pi/4 (which is the case where we can have max side_bb = 0.099, so:
           `x_coords = [4.2495, 4.37475, 4.5, 4.62525, 4.7505]`
           `y_coords = [-0.5505, -0.42525, -0.3, -0.17475, -0.0495]`
           
           Now I will pair all coordinates with two angles to generate 50 stable placements.
