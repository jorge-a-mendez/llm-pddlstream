           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know that `type(v8, v17)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. The goal axiom implies that the object `?green` must be `v8` to satisfy `type(?green, v17)`. Therefore, the goal simplifies to `on(v8, v18)`. We know that `on(v8, v18)` can be derived from `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. We already have `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v8, #o2)`, as well as `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. If we can achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`, then the goal will be met. However, `atpose(v8, v9)` is true and there is no action provided that changes the pose of `v8` to `#o2`.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal axiom:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0() Conjunction Atom on(?green, v18) Atom type(?green, v17)`
           
           From the initial state:
           - `type(v8, v17)`: This means `?green` could be `v8`.
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`
           - `supported(v8, v9, v11)` which implies `on(v8, v11)`
           - `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`
           
           If we want to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, we need `atpose(v8, #o2)`. However, currently `atpose(v8, v9)` is true. There are no `pick` or `place` actions available for `v8` to change its pose from `v9` to `#o2`. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not affect object poses. Therefore, the goal `on(v8, v18)` cannot be achieved.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           From the initial state, we have `type(v8, v17)`, so `?green` must be `v8`.
           Therefore, the goal simplifies to `on(v8, v18)`.
           The `on(?o, ?r)` axiom is satisfied if `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` are both true.
           We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` in the initial state.
           So, to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, we need to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           However, the initial state shows `atpose(v8, v9)`, and there are no `pick` or `place` actions provided in the `action instances` list that could move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           The only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the pose of any object.
           Since there is no action available to change the pose of `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`, the goal is unreachable.
