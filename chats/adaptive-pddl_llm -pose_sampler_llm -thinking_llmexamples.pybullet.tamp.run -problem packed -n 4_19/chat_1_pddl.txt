           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to achieve the goal state:**
           
           My objective is to move objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` to be `on v18`. I've analyzed the initial state, the available actions (`pick`, `place`, etc.), and the given facts. My main strategy involves a sequence of *pick* and *place* actions using the robot arm `v4`, which is currently `handempty`. The current location of the objects is `v11`, and all of them are already `on` that particular surface.
           
           I've checked the preconditions for `pick` and `place`, and confirmed that relevant `kin` facts are available for arm `v4`. Specifically, this arm can reach the objects from their present locations (`v9`, `v13`, `v15`, `v17`) on surface `v11` and the target location (`#o2`) on `v18`. All four objects can be supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`. The grasping action `kin` always takes base configuration `#o3` and it currently is `atbconf(v3)`. I've identified that the *bconf* continuous parameter `#o3` used in the `kin` facts must be resolvable to `v3` for the plan to be valid. The only `move_base` action instance available doesn't change `atbconf`, so this seems logical.
           
           The plan involves the following sequence of *pick* and *place* actions:
           
           1.  **Pick v8 from v9 and place it at #o2 on v18.**
           2.  **Pick v12 from v13 and place it at #o2 on v18.**
           3.  **Pick v14 from v15 and place it at #o2 on v18.**
           4.  **Pick v16 from v17 and place it at #o2 on v18.**
           
           The plan assumes that any *unsafe* constraints related to approaching the object or trajectory are initially false, as these are not defined explicitly. Grasping is `#o1`, base configuration is `v3`, and trajectories are `#o4`, all of which are continuous parameters that the system should be able to resolve with the given facts. The `canmove()` predicate will be satisfied by using `pick` and `place` actions, and no further base movements are needed or possible given the available `move_base` actions, since the current base configuration must be maintained.
           
           I've ensured that each action in the plan meets its preconditions, and I am confident that this plan will successfully achieve the desired goal state. The reasoning is sound, and I have addressed all potential obstacles given the context.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. The previous plan I formulated, sadly, is no good. I was using actions that aren't permitted.  The only thing I'm allowed to do is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's my only tool.
           
           Let's re-examine this.  The *goal* is to have all these objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, "on" object `v18`. Specifically, it wants `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`.
           
           Now, I know from the axioms that "on" means `supported` and `atpose` are true. I'm starting with these objects `atpose` on `v11`. If that is true, then `on` is true for each object with respect to `v11`.
           
           To get to `on` with `v18`, I need to change each of those objects' `atpose`.  Specifically, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)`,  `atpose(v12, #o2)`,  `atpose(v14, #o2)`, and `atpose(v16, #o2)`.
           
           This requires the `pick` and `place` actions, because those are what change the `atpose` values. But, this `move_base` action... it *only* changes the robot's configuration.  It doesn't touch the objects!  It doesn't do anything about their positions relative to each other or `v18`.
           
           Given that, and knowing the allowed actions, this goal is *impossible*.  There's no way to reach it with the given constraints. I'm stuck.
