(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement for Maximum Coverage**
           
           Given the object's dimensions and the surface constraints, my focus is on generating 50 stable placements. I recognized the object's almost-square shape simplifies the problem significantly.  The plan is to leverage this property to create a diverse set of placements.
           
           Since the object's effective size doesn't drastically change with rotation, I'll use two key orientations: 0 radians and pi/2 radians.  For each, I'll compute the allowable x and y ranges for the object's center, ensuring the object is fully contained within the surface, taking into account the rotation. With two orientations and the allowable range, the resulting number of generated positions are 2 * 25 = 50.
           
           I will create a 5x5 grid of (x, y) coordinates. These positions and orientations will maximize the placement coverage within the given surface. Due to the minor difference in the object's dimensions, I will ensure they will be distinct positions, therefore creating 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I've got this. The task is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a nearly square object, on surface 0, while avoiding collision with the previously successfully placed object ID 4.  ID 4 is positioned at the bottom-left corner of the surface.  I've already analyzed the surface dimensions, the bounding box of object ID 4, and now I need to figure out where to place object ID 5.
           
           First, I defined the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object ID 4. Its position means it's pretty much hugging the bottom-left corner of the surface.  The critical constraint is *no collisions*. I need to stay away from the space occupied by object ID 4.
           
           My strategy?  Generate placements by ensuring that the *minimum* bounding box x-coordinate for object ID 5 is greater than or equal to the *maximum* x-coordinate of the AABB for object ID 4, or the *minimum* bounding box y-coordinate for object ID 5 is greater than or equal to the *maximum* y-coordinate of the AABB for object ID 4.  This means placing the new object either to the *right* or *above* the previously placed object.  Also, I'll generate points such that I am strictly contained within the surface, and ensure that I generate some at both 0 and 90 degrees.
           
           I calculated the allowable x and y ranges for object ID 5 at both 0 and 90 degrees rotation, then created a collision avoidance zone. The safe zone is to the right and above.
           
           So, for object ID 5 with theta=0, I am going to have a 5x5 grid in the x range of `[0.000693239118028305, 0.08686337394309325]` and the full y-range of `[-0.08686337394309322, 0.08686337394309322]`. Similarly, for theta=90, I will use a 5x5 grid in the x range of `[0.000693239118028335, 0.08686337394309322]` and y range `[-0.08686337394309325, 0.08686337394309325]`. These two sets will generate 25 positions.
           
           This approach guarantees that the 50 placements will be stable, avoid collision, and provide a good coverage of the available space, considering all constraints.  Let's get this done!

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: placing Object 6 on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into Objects 4 and 5, which are already in place. My initial thought is to analyze the geometry and identify collision-free zones.
           
           First, I need to figure out where I *can't* put Object 6.  Object 4 is nestled in the bottom-left corner of the surface and Object 5 is next to it along the bottom edge.  I've got their extents and AABBs handy, so I'll calculate those to be sure.  It looks like Object 4 is placed from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.047, -0.047) and Object 5 is placed from (-0.047, -0.135) to (0.049, -0.039).  They're side-by-side. I'll combine the area they take up.
           
           My strategy?  I'll consider Object 6 at two different rotations: 0 degrees (aligned with the axes) and 90 degrees (rotated).  I'll then determine the valid center point ranges on Surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects 4 and 5.
           
           Given the size of Object 6, which is nearly square, I will try placing it completely above the combined objects, or to the right of them.
           
           First, half-extents for Object 6: `hw6_x = 0.048759785010708045` and `hw6_y = 0.048759785010708075`.
           
           For Object 6 at 0 degrees, the max x position of its center must be 0.0862 and the min must be -0.0862, and the min y must be 0.0100. Similarly, the max y position must be 0.0862.
           
           For Object 6 at 90 degrees, it has similar constraints to when it is at 0 degrees.
           
           This is my basic plan:
           1. I calculate the half-extents for object 6 and its rotation.
           2. I check the surface bounds for different rotations.
           3. I identify collision-free regions based on the AABB of the obstacle objects 4 and 5.
           4. I try placing the object above or to the right of the obstacle objects.
           5.  I calculate and place a 5x5 grid in the area above the existing objects for each rotation.

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis & Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 7) on surface 0, ensuring no collisions with existing objects (IDs 4, 5, and 6) while remaining within the surface boundaries.
           
           The surface is a square region: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've analyzed the current occupied space by these three objects, calculating their axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs), their extents, and the free space regions. I observed that the bottom-left of surface 0 is densely populated.
           
           Based on the AABB calculations, I determined the smallest rectangle completely containing the existing objects, effectively defining the area considered "occupied". The remaining space for potential placements would be outside this composite AABB.
           
           Since fully above the combined AABB is not possible, I focused my strategy on the top-right corner, specifically the area to the right of object 5. The calculations, though initially promising, revealed a very narrow corridor of available space on the right edge of the surface.  Because of the limited space, and with the object dimensions in mind, I determined the best approach would be placing the object in a thin strip on the right side of the surface with two orientations: 0 degrees and 90 degrees. This will allow the object to fit into this slim space and give the desired number of placements. After careful analysis, I found the placement solution in this fashion for the required 50 placements.
