           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, each at a known configuration (v13 and v15, respectively). Both rovers have a camera (v10) onboard and a store (v16) for samples, which is currently free. There are several objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of different types. There is also a lander (v9) for communication.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if several conditions are met, including having images received for specific objectives, and analyses received for specific rocks. Looking at the definition of the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, it requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`
           3. `free(v12, v16)`
           4. `free(v14, v16)`
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           8. `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           9. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (where `?stone` refers to objects of type `v2`)
           10. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (where `?soil` refers to objects of type `v6`)
           
           From the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           
           This means we need to focus on achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           For `receivedimage`:
           We have `objective(v17)`, `objective(v18)`, `objective(v19)`, `objective(v20)`.
           We need to `take_image` of these objectives and then `send_image`.
           Both rovers v12 and v14 have camera v10 onboard, which supports mode v11.
           They also have `imagevisible` predicates for these objectives from configuration `#o3` using ray `#o4`.
           They also have `comvisible` predicates from configuration `#o0` using ray `#o1` to lander `v9`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis`:
           We need to analyze rocks of type `v2` and `v6`.
           Rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           Rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           We need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           Both rovers have `above` predicates for all these rocks from configuration `#o5`.
           They also have `comvisible` predicates from configuration `#o0` using ray `#o1` to lander `v9`.
           
           Since no `calibrate` actions are given in the allowed action instances, it implies that the camera `v10` is already calibrated for the rovers, or that we should ignore the `calibrated` precondition because no actions that could make it true are available. However, `calibrated(?c, ?v)` is an explicit precondition for `take_image`. If we cannot calibrate the camera, we cannot take images. The problem statement says "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*". `calibrated(v10, v12)` and `calibrated(v10, v14)` are not in the initial state. This means we cannot take images without first calibrating.
           
           Let's re-examine the available actions. Only `move` and `drop_rock` are available. No `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions are available. This means that if the goal requires actions not listed as available, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. These predicates are only set as effects by the `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. Since `send_image` and `send_analysis` are not in the list of valid action instances, it is impossible to achieve these predicates. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The only available actions are:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action moves rover v12 from v13 to v13 (effectively a no-op).
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action moves rover v14 from v15 to v15 (effectively a no-op).
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Rover v12 drops a rock from its store v16, assuming it's full.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Rover v14 drops a rock from its store v16, assuming it's full.
           
           The initial state includes `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`, meaning the stores are empty. So, `drop_rock` cannot be executed as `full(?v, ?s)` is a precondition, and it is false.
           
           Since the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates can only be achieved by actions that are not in the allowed list, the goal is unreachable.
