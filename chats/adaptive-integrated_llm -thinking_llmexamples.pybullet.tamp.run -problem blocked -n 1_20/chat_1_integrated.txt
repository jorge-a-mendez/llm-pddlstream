User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.4, -0.235), (-4.307, -0.142)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.354, -0.189, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.843, 0.537).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Achievement Plan: Placing an Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`, which basically means getting an object of a certain type *onto* a specific surface. Specifically, I need to get an object, `?green`, which is of a certain type, onto `v18`. From the initial state, I know there are two possible candidates for `?green`: `v12` and `v8`.
           
           My instinct is to try placing `v12` on `v18`, since it seems like a straightforward approach. To make that happen, I need to use the `pick` and `place` actions. 
           
           First, I need to *pick* `v12` from its current location, `v13`. I check the preconditions for `pick` and they seem to be satisfied based on the given facts. Importantly, the robot arm, `v4`, needs to be empty, and it is.  I can't fully check the safety assumptions (`NegatedAtom unsafeapproach`, `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj`) right now, but I'll assume they're safe for the moment. The key *kin* relationship also seems valid. The `pick` action then *grabs* `v12`.
           
           Next, I need to *place* `v12` *on* `#o2`. Again, the preconditions for `place` look good, assuming the safety assumptions. 
           
           After those actions, I can confirm that `v12` is on `#o2`, which in turn would satisfy `on(v12, v18)`.
           The key is to *define* a continuous parameter for `#o2`, its pose (position and orientation). I'll place it on the center of `v18` with some height.
           I need to make sure the AABB for `v12` is fully contained in the AABB of the surface to ensure stability and collision avoidance. Given that `v12` is small, it should fit. I will use (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0) where (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) is an x, y, z coordinate on the surface of `v18`, and 0.0 is the theta rotation. 
           
           Let's double-check the plan using `v8`, and it shows that can also work. But because `v12` is the first object I considered, I decided to proceed with `v12`.
           
           Regarding the cost, each pick and place has a cost of 1. So total cost is 2. The cost for `move_base` action would be 0 because I would move base from and to the same location, if that is the action needed at all.
           
           **Final Plan:**
           
           1.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           2.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           
           And, of course, the `--Poses--:`:
           `#o2 (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Impasse: The Goal is Unachievable**
           
           Okay, so the user pointed out a critical flaw: the initial plan was using 'pick' and 'place', which aren't even defined as *valid* actions in the instance list. The only action at my disposal is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means that I can't actually change the state of the world to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal.
           
           Let's break it down: `new-axiom@0()` translates to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Luckily, I know `type(v12, v17)` is true from the start. That means I just need to get `on(v12, v18)`.  
           
           Now, `on(v12, v18)` requires that `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true. Currently, `v12` is at `atpose(v12, v13)` and it's `supported(v12, v13, v14)`.  
           
           To get to `on(v12, v18)`, I need to move `v12` to a pose where `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` is true.  Looking at the initial state, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is also true. The pose I want, then, is `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           But, here's the rub: I'm stuck with `move_base`. `move_base` doesn't change the pose of `v12`. All it does is change base configuration. Without 'pick' and 'place' instances to manipulate objects, I can't even get `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Therefore, I cannot achieve the necessary state of  `on(v12, v18)`. Since that state is necessary for the goal, the final goal is also out of reach. In other words, I'm at an impasse.
