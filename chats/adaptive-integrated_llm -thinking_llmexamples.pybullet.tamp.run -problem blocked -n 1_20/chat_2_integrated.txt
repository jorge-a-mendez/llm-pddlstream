           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning to Achieve the Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to establish `new-axiom@0()`, which requires proving that an object `?green` is both *on* a specific object (`v18`) and has a particular *type* (`v17`). My expert knowledge of the domain immediately suggests I need a plan to achieve this state.
           
           I examined the available objects, focusing on those that could potentially be `?green`.  I found that both `v12` and `v8` have the necessary `type` attribute.  To determine which object to choose, I considered the *on* condition. I determined that `on` is an axiom that depends on the *supported* and *atpose* predicates. The initial state provided some *supported* facts for `v12` and `v8`, including the crucial fact that they *could* be supported on `v18`.
           
           My expert insight told me that to minimize cost, it was better to pick the object closer to the target surface. Considering the robot base configuration and the initial positions, I then decided to place `v8` onto the surface `v18`. Therefore, the plan would focus on making `on(v8, v18)` true. My expertise suggests that using `v8` will result in the smallest trajectory.
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to ensure `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` are true. The *supported* fact is given in the initial state, indicating that `v8` can be supported on `v18` at a certain pose (`#o2`). Therefore, the problem reduces to achieving `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           I assessed available actions (based on the robot arm being `v4`, the initial base conf `v3` and the objects' kinematics).  Currently, `v8` is at another pose (`v9`). To achieve the new pose (`#o2`), I need to use a plan with `move_base`, `pick`, and `place` actions, in that order.
           
           In detail, my plan is:
           1.  **Move the robot base from `v3` to a base configuration `#o3`.**
           2.  **Pick `v8` from its initial pose `v9`.**
           3.  **Place `v8` onto the pose `#o2` on `v18`.**
           
           I must carefully determine the continuous values for the `#o` objects. I reasoned that, as per problem instructions, I only needed to specify a continuous value for `#o2`. I determined the stable pose for `#o2` by carefully reviewing the AABBs and surface characteristics. Using my knowledge, I chose `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for the pose of `v8` on `v18`.
           
           The preconditions for the actions were validated by checking against the facts provided in the initial state. I took extra care to ensure any *negated* predicates (like *unsafeapproach*) were assumed false, which is reasonable given the lack of collisions for the problem definition. All actions seemed logically consistent, thus ensuring the plan would satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal.
           
           After the plan, it guarantees `on(v8, v18)` by ensuring `v8` is in the correct pose and `supported` on `v18`. It also ensures `type(v8, v17)` given by the initial state. The plan achieves the goal.
