User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.4, -0.235), (-4.307, -0.142)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.354, -0.189, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.843, 0.537).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)

           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom graspable(v12)

           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unattainable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to realize the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which, fundamentally, requires placing an object of a particular type (let's call it 'green') onto a specific surface labeled 'v18'.  The initial state provides two candidates: objects `v8` and `v12`, both sharing the required type.
           
           Upon examining the scene, 'v18' appears to be a segment of a larger surface ('v11'), more specifically the front half of a table/counter. The initial state confirms that `v8` rests on `v11` and `v12` is located on a separate surface. Therefore, the task boils down to positioning either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           The standard approach to achieving this would necessitate a `pick` action to grasp the object and a `place` action to deposit it onto 'v18'. This naturally leads to the need for a mobile base to enable the robot to perform these actions. Unfortunately, the problem statement limits us to utilizing *only* the provided actions. The only permitted action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is a *move_base* action where the robot moves from `v3` to `v3` (so it does not move), a curious constraint.
           
           The critical stipulation here is that any action not explicitly listed is forbidden. Since `pick` and `place` actions are not given, the goal is definitively unattainable. The lone `move_base` action instance is insufficient to manipulate objects and achieve the desired configuration. Even if the 'move_base' action was to be used, it would still fail to satisfy the requirement as the `pick` and `place` actions are needed.
           
           The conclusion is this task is simply not solvable with the given limitations.
