           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.665, 0.505), (-4.578, 0.592)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t1'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t3'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t2'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v15. Objects v8 and v15 are currently at poses v9 and v16, respectively, both supported by v11. Object v12 is at pose v13, supported by v14. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which means that there must be an object `?culprit` such that it is graspable and `?culprit` is not equal to `?o`. However, `new-axiom@0()` can also refer to `new-axiom@0(?o: object)`, and the goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which indicates that `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)` are true. The `green` object and `v17` type are not explicitly given in the objects. However, examining the domain and axioms, `new-axiom@0()` is also defined as `Conjunction: Atom on(?green, v18), Atom type(?green, v17)`. The objects `v8`, `v12`, `v15` are of type `v17`. The object `v18` is a surface. So the goal is to place any of the objects `v8`, `v12`, or `v15` on `v18`.
           
           The previous plan failed because `pick(v4, v8, v9, #g0, #q0, #t0)` was not collision-free due to `v15` at `v16`. This means that picking `v8` from `v9` while `v15` is at `v16` is not possible. To avoid this, we should pick `v15` first if we are going to interact with `v8` at `v9` or `v16`. Since the goal is to place an object on `v18`, and `v15` is currently on `v11` at `v16`, we can try to pick `v15` and place it on `v18`.

           (#o2 v15 v18): (4.5 0.3 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous plan attempted to place `v15` on `v18` at pose `#o2`. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is defined as `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Since `v15` is of `type(v15, v17)`, placing `v15` on `v18` at pose `#o2` should achieve the goal `on(v15, v18)` and thus `new-axiom@0()`. The error message states that the fact `Atom new-axiom@0()` is not satisfied, which means that `on(v15, v18)` was not achieved. This could be because the provided pose for `#o2` was not valid for `v15` to be considered "on" `v18`.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the placement for `#o2`. The object `v18` has AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. `v15` has AABB `((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335))`. The previously suggested pose `(4.5 0.3 0.8 0.0)` for `#o2` would place `v15` with its center at x=4.5, y=0.3. The object's x-range would be from `4.5 - (0.07/2) = 4.465` to `4.5 + (0.07/2) = 4.535`, and its y-range would be from `0.3 - (0.07/2) = 0.265` to `0.3 + (0.07/2) = 0.335`. This places `v15` outside the y-range of `v18` (which is between -0.6 and 0.0).
           
           Therefore, a new pose for `#o2` needs to be chosen such that `v15` is within the bounds of `v18`. Let's pick a pose that centers `v15` on `v18` in the x-direction and within the y-range of `v18`. A suitable y-coordinate for the center of `v15` could be around -0.3, which is within the y-bounds of `v18`. The x-coordinate could be the center of `v18`, which is `(4.2+4.8)/2 = 4.5`. The z-coordinate should be on top of `v18`. Assuming `v18` is at z=0.8, and `v15` has a height, a z-value slightly above 0.8 would be suitable.

           (#o2 v15 v18): (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The plan has again failed to satisfy `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which means that even with the adjusted pose for `v15` on `v18`, the `on` predicate is not being registered. This might be due to a misunderstanding of the `supported` predicate's relationship with `on`.
           
           The `on` predicate is an axiom: `Atom on(?o: object, ?r: object) <- Conjunction: Atom supported(?o, ?p, ?r), Atom atpose(?o, ?p)`. This means that `supported` must be true for the object and the proposed pose and surface, and the object must be at that pose.
           
           Looking at the initial state and available kinematic information, the only `supported` facts given for `v18` are `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. There is no `supported(v15, #o2, v18)`. This implies that `v15` might not be a "stackable" object on `v18` in the sense the domain expects, or at least that the `supported` relation is not given in a way that allows `v15` to be placed on `v18`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` (the one without arguments) is `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Since `v8` and `v12` are of `type(v_object, v17)`, and we have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, these are the objects that can be placed on `v18` to satisfy the goal.
           
           Let's try to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` and place it on `v18` using the pose `#o2`. The previous failure was picking `v8` from `v9` because `v15` at `v16` was causing a collision. This means that if `v15` is moved, `v8` can be picked. However, we also have `supported(v8, #o2, v10)`. And `v10` is an object, not a surface. `supported(v15, #o2, v10)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v10)` are also present. There is no surface `v10` given. The `v18` surface is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           Let's use `v8` as the object to place on `v18`.
           `v8` is at `v9` (`(4.5, 0.3, 0.8)`). `v15` is at `v16` (`(4.35, 0.3, 0.8)`). These are very close in y and z.
           
           The action `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` failed due to `v15` at `v16`. It is more likely that `v15` is blocking `v8` because it's closer to the robot arm's path. We should try to pick `v8` from `v9` if it's not blocked or pick `v12` from `v13` since `v12` is far from `v8` and `v15`.
           
           The current robot base position is `v3` `(2.5, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           `v8` is at `v9` (`(4.5, 0.3, 0.8)`). `v15` is at `v16` (`(4.35, 0.3, 0.8)`).
           `v12` is at `v13` (`(-4.621, 0.548, 0.801)`).
           
           It's clear that `v12` is on the other side of the workspace from `v8` and `v15`. So, picking `v12` will not have a collision with `v8` or `v15`.
           
           Let's pick `v12` and place it on `v18`.
           `v12` is of `type(v12, v17)`. We have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`.
           The surface `v18` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           `v12` has AABB `((-4.665, 0.505), (-4.578, 0.592))`. It's a small object.
           Let's choose a pose for `#o2` on `v18`. A good center for `v12` would be `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`.
