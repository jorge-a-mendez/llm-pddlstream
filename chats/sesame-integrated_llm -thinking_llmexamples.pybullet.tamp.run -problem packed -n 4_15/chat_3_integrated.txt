           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.028, -0.474, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.128, 0.992).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q5', '#t12'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q5', '#t5'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q1', '#t20'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p4', '#g2', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q2', '#t15'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g0', '#q2', '#t2'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q0', '#t17'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p5', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q3', '#t16'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g1', '#q3', '#t3'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q4', '#t19'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p6', '#g1', '#q4', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q7', '#t18'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v16', 'v17', '#g3', '#q7', '#t14'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q7', '#q6', '#t21'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v16', 'p7', '#g3', '#q6', '#t6'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-approach-pose:('v16', 'p7', '#g3', 'v14', 'p6')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v16', 'v17', '#g3', '#q7', '#t14').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

(Thoughts: **Revisiting the Block Stacking Problem**
           
           My primary goal here is to devise a plan to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current locations to specific poses on a surface, v18. The desired arrangement is: v8 on v18 at pose p4, v12 on v18 at pose p5, v14 on v18 at pose p6, and v16 on v18 at pose p7. I've been given information about the initial and final states of the objects, as well as an AABB for each, which is useful for checking and visualizing potential collision.
           
           The previous plan failed because it attempted to place v16 at p7 while v14 was already positioned at p6. The planning system detected that the robot's arm, during its approach to p7 to place v16, would collide with v14 at p6. The AABBs indicate that placing the objects at the poses p4-p7 should not cause a collision, which suggested that there was a problem with the arm trajectory. The error points to "test-cfree-approach-pose" indicating it's the approach *before* placing, not the object *itself*, that causes the problem.
           
           Given the existing constraints and available actions, I'm proposing a strategy that involves reordering the placement of v14 and v16. Previously, v14 was placed *before* v16, and the system indicated that the arm was colliding during the *approach* to p7, not the object *at* p7. Therefore, the best course of action is to make sure v16 is placed *before* v14, thereby preventing the collision by changing the approach path for the arm.
           
           The reordered plan will proceed as follows:
           
           1.  Move the robot's base to a suitable location (#o3).
           2.  Pick v8 from its initial location (v9).
           3.  Place v8 at the target pose (p4).
           4.  Pick v12 from its initial location (v13).
           5.  Place v12 at the target pose (p5).
           6.  Pick v16 from its initial location (v17).
           7.  Place v16 at the target pose (p7).
           8.  Pick v14 from its initial location (v15).
           9.  Place v14 at the target pose (p6).
           10. Return the base to its original position (v3).
           
           The key change is placing v16 *before* v14. The rest is standard motion planning.
           
           Since the goal is to *place* the blocks in the new poses, I've checked and double-checked the logic and the poses, confirming that the objects in themselves don't collide if placed on p4-p7. The issue, as far as I can see, is related to the arm trajectory. By reordering the placement sequence, I'm hoping to avoid that collision.

           10. Return the base to its original position (v3).
           
           The key change is placing v16 *before* v14. The rest is standard motion planning.
           
           Since the goal is to *place* the blocks in the new poses, I've checked and double-checked the logic and the poses, confirming that the objects in themselves don't collide if placed on p4-p7. The issue, as far as I can see, is related to the arm trajectory. By reordering the placement sequence, I'm hoping to avoid that collision.
