           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Planning Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I've got a goal: get v8, v12, and v14 all *on* v16. Simple enough in principle.  Looking at the initial state, those three objects are currently all sitting on v11.  My instinct is to pick each object up, and place it on v16. Classic move!
           
           Thinking through the steps, it's clear: Pick up v8, place v8 on v16. Pick up v12, place v12 on v16. Pick up v14, place v14 on v16. Boom, done.
           
           Now, let's see what tools I have.  I know *move_base* is available. But that just lets the base stay where it is and doesn't do anything for object manipulation.  I'd need *pick* and *place* for this. Unfortunately, I'm finding that the only *action instance* given is *move_base*. This means I'm stuck with what I've got in my toolbox. *Clean* and *Cook* are options but don't seem applicable here.
           
           Here's the problem: The *on* predicate that I'm trying to achieve is derived from *supported* and *atpose*. To change *atpose*, I need *pick* and *place*.  And I don't have them!  No *pick* or *place* action instances are provided. This is a problem since the list of allowed actions does not provide a pick or a place.
           
           I can't change the *on* predicate with just *move_base*.  My plan is dead in the water. The goal is *unreachable* with the given set of available actions. I should try to revise the goal or acquire the necessary actions for manipulating objects.
