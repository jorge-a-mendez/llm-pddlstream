           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Problem Analysis: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting objects v8, v12, and v14 all "on" object v16.  This translates directly to supporting them on v16 at a specific pose.  Looking at the initial state, those three objects are currently supported by v11.  My plan needs to involve picking them up from v11 and putting them on v16.
           
           The good news is that I have the kinematic facts (kin) for arm v4 to pick and place these objects.  I have facts for the pick and place actions for each object. The "supported" facts tell me that the place operation will work on v16.
           
           However, things start to fall apart when I consider the robot's base. The `kin` facts for pick and place require the robot's base configuration to be `#o3`.  This is a critical precondition. Now, I do have one available action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't actually *move* the base; it essentially confirms its current state, keeping it at v3. Unfortunately, the initial state *is* `atbconf(v3)`, and the provided action *does not* provide a path to the required `atbconf(#o3)`.
           
           Therefore, the `pick` and `place` actions which require  `atbconf(#o3)` are impossible because I have no way to reach the required base configuration.  Given the constraints of the problem - specifically, that I'm only allowed to use the actions and facts provided - the goal is unachievable. I simply cannot meet the preconditions for the pick and place actions.  I've double-checked my work. There is no other path possible.
