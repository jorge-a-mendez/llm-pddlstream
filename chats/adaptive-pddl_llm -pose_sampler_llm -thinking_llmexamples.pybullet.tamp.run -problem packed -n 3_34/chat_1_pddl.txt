           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Plan's Unreachability**
           
           Okay, I've got a goal: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Currently, they're sitting on `v11`.  My usual approach would be to decompose this: I'd need to establish `supported(v8, ?p, v16)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`, and similarly for `v12` and `v14`.
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see the current support relationships are all `on(v11)`.  So, I need to move these objects.  My mind immediately jumps to the available actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Since I'm just manipulating objects' positions, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant.
           
           Now, here's the catch: the only *allowed* action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a no-op! It just moves the base to the *same* location.  It doesn't change anything about the objects' support relationships.
           
           To achieve my goal, I'd need `pick` and `place` actions.  Those would require checking for preconditions like `atpose`, `atgrasp`, `handempty`, safety conditions and the robot's configuration. However, as the rules are currently set, those actions aren't allowed. The system states: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Therefore, since the only action permitted is a base movement that doesn't affect the goal state, the goal is fundamentally unreachable with the given constraints. I need to explicitly state that the robot cannot manipulate the objects because no "pick" or "place" actions are authorized. That's the core of the problem.
