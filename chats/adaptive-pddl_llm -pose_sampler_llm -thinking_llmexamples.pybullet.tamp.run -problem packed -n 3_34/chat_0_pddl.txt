(Thoughts: **Planning Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I need to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, a square area.  The object is essentially square, which simplifies things to some extent.  The surface is a square of side 0.27m centered at the origin. The object's size is roughly 0.0792m x 0.0792m, so I've calculated the bounding box.  Since I'm dealing with squares,  I'll want to include a variety of orientations, even though the AABB doesn't change due to the shape.
           
           First, I need to figure out the valid range for the object's center (x, y) on the surface. For the axis-aligned case (theta = 0), that's straightforward: I calculate the offsets from the surface's edges based on the object's half-size. This ensures the object's AABB is contained within the surface's.
           
           Next, I'll generate a grid of x and y coordinates. Given the available area on the surface, I can generate approximately 7 points along each axis for a total of ~49. To get the required 50th placement, I'll add one more, maybe with a different orientation.
           For the initial x,y and theta values, I decided to use the following to produce the desired 50 placements:
           *   I will place the object at 15 distinct positions on the surface rotated by an angle of 0.
           *   I will place the object at 15 distinct positions on the surface rotated by an angle of pi/2.
           *   I will place the object at 10 distinct positions on the surface rotated by an angle of pi/4.
           *   I will place the object at 10 distinct positions on the surface rotated by an angle of 3*pi/4.
           
           Now, I calculate the precise x and y coordinates for each orientation, taking into consideration the increased AABB extent at rotations other than multiples of pi/2. The rotations will generate a total of 50 different positions. Given the nature of the object and surface, that should provide a robust set of valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Generation of Valid Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 4. Now, I need to figure out where to put Object 5 without them overlapping.  I've got the dimensions of Object 5 (a square) and I know its rotation angle can be 0, pi/2, pi/4 or 3*pi/4. I've also defined the surface dimensions, which is a square.  My initial calculation indicates Object 4 occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           First, I calculated the effective AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) half-dimensions of Object 5 for each rotation (0 and pi/4).  I found I'll have to take into account these effective AABB half dimensions as the placement center of Object 5.
           
           I worked out the constraints to make sure the AABB of Object 5, regardless of its rotation, does not overlap the AABB of Object 4.  I have two threshold conditions to avoid collision for the placement of Object 5 (with theta = 0 or pi/2) : I need x > -0.00845 or y > -0.00845.  For rotation of 45 degrees, the threshold coordinates are (0.011,0.011).
           
           I will now generate 50 potential placements.  For the main rotations (0, pi/2),  I'm using a grid-based approach. The grid points are calculated with some values (5 x 5). Each grid point is evaluated, and the points outside the collision zone are retained. I've chosen more points for negative or positive coordinates to get a good spread, because Object 4 lies on the bottom-left.  For the 45-degree rotations (pi/4, 3*pi/4), I'm generating less points (and checking the validity in a smaller grid, to take into account the 45-degree rotation.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning for Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing Object ID 6 onto Surface 0, but I need to ensure it doesn't collide with the existing objects, specifically IDs 4 and 5. This is a standard geometric constraint problem, and I'll approach it systematically.
           
           **First, I've got all the basic setup:**
           
           *   **Scene Geometry:** Surface 0 is a square, defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           *   **Existing Objects:**
               *   **Object 4:** Located at approximately (-0.095, -0.095), with dimensions L4 = 0.079. Its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is the square: \[ -0.135, -0.056\] x \[ -0.135, -0.056].
               *   **Object 5:** Located at approximately (-0.088, -0.044), with dimensions L5 = 0.095. Its AABB is the rectangle: \[ -0.135, -0.040] x \[ -0.091, 0.003].
           *   **New Object (ID 6):**  It's a square with size L6 = 0.082.
           
           **Key Calculations**
           
           The half-extent (half-width or half-height) of Object 6 is h6_0 = L6 / 2 = 0.041.  However, this changes with the rotation. The surface bounds must also change based on the rotation as well as the non-collision conditions with the existing objects, so I have to calculate the bounding boxes for different rotations. To handle collision, I have to ensure that for an existing object AABB `[ox_min, ox_max]` x `[oy_min, oy_max]`, and new object AABB `[nx_min, nx_max]` x `[ny_min, ny_max]`:
           `nx_max <= ox_min` OR `nx_min >= ox_max` OR `ny_max <= oy_min` OR `ny_min >= oy_max`
           
           This collision condition requires considering the overlaps between object 4 and object 5
           
           *   **h6_45 (rotated by 45 degrees) = 0.058 (h6_0 \* sqrt(2))**
           *   **Surface bounds:** These will also change based on the rotation of the objects. I have to make sure to calculate this properly
           
           **Defining the Free Space**
           
           The surface is `[-0.135, 0.135]` x `[-0.135, 0.135]`. The occupied regions are `R4` and `R5`.
           
           To avoid collisions with Object 4 or 5, I've determined that any new object's center must be positioned such that:
           
           1.  For `theta = 0, pi/2`, the center x value must be greater than 0.0006, or the center y value must be greater than 0.044.
           2.  For `theta = pi/4, 3*pi/4`, the center x value must be greater than 0.018 or the center y value must be greater than 0.061.
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           I'll generate a set of potential placements, focusing on these areas. I can use the surface bounds and these non-collision conditions. The goal is to choose a set of distinct, non-overlapping points within the available free space.
           
           *   I'll generate 15 valid (x,y) coordinates for theta = 0, which I'll use for both theta = 0 and pi/2 placements,
           *   I'll generate 10 valid (x, y) coordinates for theta = pi/4 and 3pi/4.
           *   Total, I should be able to produce 50 placements, each guaranteed to meet the surface limits and non-collision constraints.
           
           Then I can give these points to the user.
