User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.652, 0.152, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.952, 0.307).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.701, 0.103), (-4.603, 0.201)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal Breakdown and Potential Actions**
           
           Okay, the task is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked to mean getting an object of type `v17` onto `v18`.  Thinking about it, I see that two objects in the initial state could be `v17`: `v12` and `v8`. The initial state also specifies that I must achieve `supported(?o, ?p, v18)` for an object `?o`. So, I'm focusing on either making `v12` or `v8` 'on' `v18`.  Since they already have their types established, I just need to get them "on" `v18`.  'On' means the object must be supported by `v18`, and at a particular pose. Let's see what the actions are and consider what must happen. I have `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. Looks like only `pick` and `place` are relevant here.
           
           **Developing a Plan: Focusing on v12**
           
           Let's focus on `v12`. I need to move it to a supported pose on `v18`.  From the initial state,  `v12` is at `v13`. I'll try to find a way to place it at some position where it's supported by `v18`. To be on `v18`, an object must be supported by it and at a specific pose.  The initial state contains `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. That means I have to get it to `#o2`.
           
           **Action Details and Preconditions**
           
           To move `v12`, I'm looking at `pick` and `place` actions. The preconditions are crucial here, and the robot has an arm (`v4`), which seems key.  For `pick`, I need:
           -   `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`: True initially
           -   `atpose(v12, v13)`: True initially
           -   `handempty(v4)`: True initially
           -   `atbconf(v3)`: True initially
           -   `~unsafeapproach(v12, v13, #o1)`:  I'm assuming this as no contrary information given
           -   `~unsafeatraj(#o4)`:  I'm also assuming this for the same reason.
           
           And the effects of a pick operation are to set `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`, to make `canmove()` true, and to negate `atpose(v12, v13)` as well as `handempty(v4)`. So now,  I will need to `place` it. The preconditions for `place` are:
           -   `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`: True initially.
           -   `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`: Achieved by the pick action.
           -   `atbconf(v3)`: True initially.
           -   `~unsafepose(v12, #o2)`: Assuming true
           -   `~unsafeapproach(v12, #o2, #o1)`: Assuming true
           -   `~unsafeatraj(#o4)`: Assuming true
           
           The effects of a place operation set `atpose(v12, #o2)`, make `handempty(v4)` true and make `canmove()` true, and negate `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`.
           
           **Analyzing Collision Avoidance**
           
           Collision avoidance is handled by assuming that all the `~unsafepose` facts are true. No conflicting facts exist, and the preconditions check for collision. So, I will proceed assuming everything is safe.
           
           **Continuous Parameters and Plan Refinement**
           
           Now, I'm down to selecting values for the continuous parameters. I need to figure out `pose` `#o2`, which will be the pose for `v12` on `v18`. The key is that `v12` must fit within the bounds of `v18`.  I'll use `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)` for the coordinates of `#o2`.  The x, y coordinates places `v12` in a feasible region on `v18`.
           
           So, the plan is:
           1.  `pick(v4, v12, v13
)

           -   `atbconf(v3)`: True initially.
           -   `~unsafepose(v12, #o2)`: Assuming true
           -   `~unsafeapproach(v12, #o2, #o1)`: Assuming true
           -   `~unsafeatraj(#o4)`: Assuming true
           
           The effects of a place operation set `atpose(v12, #o2)`, make `handempty(v4)` true and make `canmove()` true, and negate `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`.

           So, the plan is:
           1.  `pick(v4, v12, v13

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I see the problem. The user is right; the previous plan won't work. The only allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which is pretty restrictive. My goal is `(on(v12, v18) AND type(v12, v17))`, but that simplifies to `on(v12, v18)`. To make that happen, I need to get `v12` to `atpose(#o2)` and have it be *supported* by `v18`. Right now, `v12` is at `atpose(v13)`.
           
           The crucial thing is, the `move_base` action *only* affects the robot's position and the `canmove()` predicate. It doesn't allow me to pick up and move *objects* like `v12`. To get `v12` where it needs to be, I'd need to use `pick` and `place` actions. But those aren't in the list of what I'm *allowed* to use.
           
           If I *can't* use `pick` and `place`, then I'm essentially stuck. There's no way to manipulate `v12` into the desired configuration using only `move_base`. Therefore, the user is correct, and I conclude that the goal is currently unreachable with the constraints placed on me. It's a fundamental limitation of the allowed actions.
