           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable: No Available Actions to Manipulate Objects**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate objective is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. This translates to placing these four objects, initially on `v11`, onto `v18`. Each `on(o, v18)` requires the object 'o' to be `supported` by a pose (`#o2` in this case) on `v18` and `atpose` the target pose.
           
           I've examined the initial state for each object. They're all on `v11` currently. The problem is I'm missing the fundamental building blocks: the `pick` and `place` actions necessary for object manipulation. I can see the potential target poses for the objects (all at `#o2`), and I have the knowledge needed to understand the relationships. But I need tools to actually implement these relationships.
           
           I only have the `(move_base)` action, which is, in essence, a no-op concerning my goal. Without `pick` and `place` actions, I'm stuck. I can't change the `atpose` of these objects or the `supported` relationships. I'm essentially paralyzed.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, the goal is unreachable.
