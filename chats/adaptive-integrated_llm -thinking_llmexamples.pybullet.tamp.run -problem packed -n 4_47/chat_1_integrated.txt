User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```

           v15: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.061, -0.324), (0.029, -0.234)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.134, 0.426), (0.212, 0.504)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.098, 0.302), (0.175, 0.38)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.163, -0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.239, 0.971).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.016, -0.279, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.818, 0.575).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.173, 0.465, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.751, 0.66).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.137, 0.341, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.665, 0.747).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.116, -0.398), (0.211, -0.304)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, the objective is to arrange four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) onto another object, `v18`. I've got the current poses and supports for each object, and I need to figure out a plan. The robot has two arms, but only one is relevant to this task (`v4`), as it's the one with kinesthetic reachability (`kin`). No base movement is allowed.
           
           The core of this problem lies in understanding the permitted actions. The available actions *only* include `move_base`. This is a crucial constraint that drastically affects the plan. My first thought is that I need a pick and place action, but those aren't available. All target poses are meant to be on `v18`.
           
           **Detailed Examination of the Task**
           
           Breaking down the goal for a single object, let's say `v14`. I need to make `on(v14, v18)` true. This means, I need to make sure that the object has the `supported` predicate and the `atpose` predicate. The initial state gives me `atpose(v14, v15)` and `supported(v14, v15, v11)`. The plan requires changing `v14` from `v15` to some unique pose on `v18`.
           
           The `kin` predicates indicate arm `v4`'s ability to reach each object's current pose and intended poses on `v18`.  `kin` functions require a `grasp` and a base configuration, which seems to imply that `kin` is usable to pick and place. Since I only have `move_base` I will need to consider that the base configuration is a constraint for my solution, and I can't move it.
           
           **Placement Considerations**
           
           Given the restriction, I must assess if placing is still possible. Since I only have `move_base`, this means that I'm restricted to a static base configuration, and I have no way of achieving the stated goal.
           
           For each object, I've to find collision-free poses on `v18`. I consider `v18`'s size and the approximate size/dimensions of each object. A key observation is that all the placement poses will have the same base configuration of the robot, the placement poses have the same z-height. To avoid collisions, and make sure that each object fits entirely within `v18`, I must place each object in a quadrant of `v18`.
           
           **Obstacles and Constraints**
           
           Unfortunately, the available action instances only contain `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means that I can not pick and place any objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           **Conclusion: Unreachable Goal**
           
           The core of the issue is the restriction to *only* `move_base`. Without the ability to pick and place, it is impossible to move the objects onto `v18`. The absence of `pick` and `place` actions, despite their apparent necessity, makes the goal of `on` predicates impossible to achieve.
