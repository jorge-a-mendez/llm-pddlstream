User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.061, -0.324), (0.029, -0.234)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.134, 0.426), (0.212, 0.504)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.098, 0.302), (0.175, 0.38)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.163, -0.351, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.239, 0.971).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.016, -0.279, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.818, 0.575).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.173, 0.465, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.751, 0.66).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.137, 0.341, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.665, 0.747).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.116, -0.398), (0.211, -0.304)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Due to Action Restriction**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal of placing objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto object `v18` is unachievable given the very limited set of allowed action instances.
           
           I initially recognize that achieving the `on(object, v18)` goal necessitates moving each object from its current location (currently `v11`) to a pose on `v18`. This requires actions that manipulate the objects' `atpose` facts. The axioms dictate that an object is `on` another if it is supported by that object at a specific pose.
           
           My standard approach would be to devise a series of `pick` and `place` actions using either arm `v4` or `v6`. However, the provided list of allowed actions solely contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, a no-op that only changes the status of `canmove()` if executed.  The action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` does not include a real motion, and only makes a change when `canmove()` becomes false and then true. 
           
           The task's specification explicitly forbids the use of any action not present in the allowed list. Because I cannot pick up or place any object, I am inherently unable to modify the initial `atpose` facts.  Therefore, since none of the objects are initially on `v18`, and no actions that could move them to `v18` are available, I conclude that the goal state is unreachable with the given constraints.
