User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, -0.402), (0.004, -0.303)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.281, -0.546), (-0.21, -0.476)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.389, 0.921).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.046, 0.266), (0.12, 0.34)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.245, -0.511, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.002, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.083, 0.303, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.029).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked on `v16`.  Essentially, I need to pick them from their current locations on `v11` and place them on `v16`. I have a robot arm, `v4`, and the available actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Since there's no mention of sinks or stoves, I can safely ignore `clean` and `cook`.  Also, `move_base` doesn't seem necessary since `canmove()` is already true, and `pick` and `place` keep it that way.
           
           The problem requires a specific interpretation of poses and the `supported` predicate, especially regarding dummy surfaces and the use of the `#o2` symbol. The trick is that if I have a situation where the same `#o2` pose is used for multiple objects (as the initial state suggests), and one of those objects is supported by a dummy surface initially (like `v8` is on `v10`), I can define new placement coordinates for the `#o2` symbol for *each* object on the final surface `v16`. This means I can place all objects at a unique location on `v16`.
           
           To make the problem simpler, I'll provide distinct coordinates for each object's placement on `v16`.  This is key to overcoming the "dummy surface" issue.  I can ensure that all objects fit safely on `v16` by using the provided AABBs (axis-aligned bounding boxes). The objects' geometries and their current poses are the key inputs.
           
           Given the object geometries and placement constraints, here's the planned placement strategy on `v16` (target table):
           
           *   **v14**:  Placed at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`.  This corresponds to the initial state pose `pose(v14, v15)`, and now it's being placed at a specific value of `#o2`.
           *   **v12**: Placed at `(0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`. I've assigned this to a distinct pose value `#o2` (again, to work around dummy surface logic), which I'm naming `#o5` in this summary.
           *   **v8**:  Placed at `(-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)`. I've also assigned this to a distinct pose value `#o2` and named it `#o6`. This will also work around the dummy surface logic of the problem, allowing us to still use the provided kinematic relations.
           
           The plan will be implemented with these steps:
           
           1.  **Pick v14 from v15.**  This is the initial state pose, where `kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)` is true, along with `atpose(v14, v15)` and `handempty(v4)`.
           2.  **Place v14 at #o2.**  The new placement is given as coordinates above. I am calling this value `#o2` even though it's distinct for all. This will use a `kin` relation for placement on the table.
           3.  **Pick v12 from v13.**  Using the initial state information `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           4.  **Place v12 at #o5.** I'm defining a new pose named `#o5`. This poses `v12` within the table boundaries with `#o5: (0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0)`.
           5.  **Pick v8 from v9.**  Using initial state `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           6.  **Place v8 at #o6.** Again I've defined a unique pose value, named `#o6` with coordinates. The new coordinate values are `#o6: (-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0)`.
           
           That should do it!  All three objects are placed on the target surface, within their respective placement constraints on `v16`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Problem is Fundamentally Unsolvable**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new plan and the user rightly pointed out a glaring issue. The plan uses `pick` and `place`, but those actions *aren't* in the list of valid actions. And let's be clear about what we *do* have: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That's it. Nothing else.
           
           Let me break this down. The problem statement explicitly says, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." So, the single allowed action, `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, basically tells the robot to do... nothing! It moves from a position to the *same* position. The effect, `NegatedAtom canmove()`, is immediately cancelled out in the initial state. In essence, it does absolutely nothing useful.
           
           The goal, though... that's a different story. I need to get objects onto `v16`. To do that, I'd need to *move* them. That *always* involves picking them up and placing them down, right? So, `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Yeah, those goals are impossible without picking things up and placing them down.
           
           Since the *only* action I'm allowed to use is the pointless "move to self" action, and the goal *requires* object manipulation, the whole thing is a dead end. There's no way to reach the desired state. I must conclude: the goal is unachievable given the severely limited actions.
