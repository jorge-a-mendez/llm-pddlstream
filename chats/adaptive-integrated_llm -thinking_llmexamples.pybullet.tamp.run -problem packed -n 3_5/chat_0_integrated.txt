User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, -0.402), (0.004, -0.303)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.389, 0.921).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.046, 0.266), (0.12, 0.34)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.245, -0.511, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.002, 1.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.281, -0.546), (-0.21, -0.476)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.083, 0.303, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.029).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this TAMP problem, and my goal is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  This means I need to use the `place` action. These objects are currently supported by `v11` and their `atpose` facts.  I can see there are a few possible placement poses on `v16`.
           
           The problem is, I only have one action instance allowed: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a self-loop, which doesn't actually *do* anything useful.
           
           My initial thought process to achieve the goal would look like this:
           
           *   **For `v8`**: Pick it up from `v9` (its current pose) and place it on a suitable pose on `v16`.
           *   **For `v12`**: Pick it up from `v13` and place it on a suitable pose on `v16`.
           *   **For `v14`**: Pick it up from `v15` and place it on a suitable pose on `v16`.
           
           To make that plan work, I need to generate `kin` facts and choose the arm.  And, I have to ensure that placement poses don't cause collisions.
           
           But here's the kicker: I can't do any of that because the rulebook says I *only* have one permitted action - `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.   That leaves me high and dry. I can only call that and *nothing else*.   It doesn't change `atpose` facts, and it can only make `canmove` false which means I'd be stuck quickly!
           
           I've got a grasp of the problem, and while I can *formulate* a potential plan with `pick` and `place`, I can't actually *execute* that plan because the single permitted move base operation simply will not cut it. The goal is unreachable.
