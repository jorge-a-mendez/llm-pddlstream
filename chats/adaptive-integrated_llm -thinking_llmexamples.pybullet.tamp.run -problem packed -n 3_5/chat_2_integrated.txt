User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.095, -0.402), (0.004, -0.303)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.281, -0.546), (-0.21, -0.476)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.045, -0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.389, 0.921).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.046, 0.266), (0.12, 0.34)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.245, -0.511, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.002, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.083, 0.303, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.029).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Plan to Stack Three Objects on a Table**
           
           My goal is to place three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, onto a square object `v16`. They're currently on table `v11`. The robot has a single arm, `v4`, and I need to use it to pick and place each object. Since the robot's base configuration is already valid (`atbconf(v3)`), and the pick and place actions use base config `o3`, I can avoid unnecessary base movement, assuming `#o3` is `v3` and requires zero cost actions. The basic plan is:
           
           1.  **Pick `v8`** from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  **Place `v8`** onto `v16`.  I'll give the target pose as (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0).  Z-value: 0.781
           3.  **Pick `v12`** from its current pose `v13`.
           4.  **Place `v12`** onto `v16`. I'll place it at a new pose with values  (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           5.  **Pick `v14`** from its current pose `v15`.
           6.  **Place `v14`** onto `v16`. The pose will be (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0).
           
           The poses for each object's placement on `v16` need to be distinct to avoid conflicts.  I've selected positions that will keep them within the bounds of `v16` while ensuring they don't collide.  I am leveraging initial state given data points where the z values of current object location are the same.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions rely on specific continuous poses. Here's a breakdown:
           
           *   For `v8`, when placed, its continuous pose is `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   For `v12`, when placed, its continuous pose is `(0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           *   For `v14`, when placed, its continuous pose is `(-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           These poses place each object within the bounds of the support surface, as required. My total cost will be the minimum cost possible: 6.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v30) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the Revised Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've re-examined the initial failure and the plan I proposed earlier. The key issue was the `atbconf` predicate, specifically the requirement for the robot's base to be at configuration `#o3` for the `pick` and `place` actions using the given `kin` predicates. The initial state had `atbconf(v3)`, which required a `move_base` action.
           
           Therefore, the revised plan is:
           
           1.  **(move\_base v3 #o3 #o0):** This action resolves the precondition mismatch and sets the base configuration to `#o3`.
           2.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4):** Assuming no `unsafe` conditions, the preconditions (kinematics, object pose, handempty, and `atbconf(#o3)`) are met.  The action picks object v8.
           3.  **(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4):** Preconditions include `kin` predicates with `#o3`,  `atgrasp`, and `#o3` for base, and no `unsafe` conditions. This places v8 on the surface at `#o2`. This fulfills the goal `on(v8, v16)`.
           4.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4):** Same logic as the `pick` action, picking v12.
           5.  **(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4):** Similar to the previous `place`,  placing v12 on the surface at `#o2`. This fulfills the goal `on(v12, v16)`.
           6.  **(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4):** Picks v14, same logic.
           7.  **(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4):** Places v14 on the surface at `#o2`, fulfilling the goal `on(v14, v16)`.
           
           Each action appears sound with the given information and initial state.  I've double-checked all preconditions. The goal conditions are met by the placements.
           
           **Addressing the Pose Requirement:**
           
           The problem requested that I provide continuous values for pose objects. In this case, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are assigned different continuous values within the bounds of  `v16` (the surface the objects must be placed on).
           
           *   **v8:** Placed at (0.0 0.0 0.781 0.0), center of `v16`.
           *   **v12:** Placed at (0.08 0.08 0.781 0.0), near the top right of `v16`.
           *   **v14:** Placed at (-0.08 -0.08 0.781 0.0), near the bottom left of `v16`.
           
           These positions ensure the goals are met. These pose values are valid placements, considering object sizes and AABBs.
           
           **Cost:**
           
           The plan's cost will be the distance for `move_base(v3, #o3)` plus 3 x `pickcost()` plus 3 x `placecost()`. It is difficult to assess if this is truly optimal without a cost metric of `distance(v3, #o3)`, but, assuming the use of `#o3` is necessary, I believe it is.
