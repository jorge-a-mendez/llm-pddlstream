           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.374, -0.134), (-4.294, -0.054)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.334, -0.094, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.76).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Achieved: Placing `v8` on `v18`**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to making both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I analyzed the initial state and realized that `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`, both of which satisfy `type(?green, v17)`. The core challenge lies in satisfying `on(?green, v18)`. This predicate requires an object to be placed *on* `v18`.
           
           Initially, I got stuck because the geometry of `v8`, `v12`, and `v18` didn't seem compatible, especially the way their axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) are currently positioned. `v8`'s existing location `v9` made it look impossible to contain within `v18`'s AABB (`v18` has a smaller Y extent than `v8`'s current location).  Also, `v12` could not be on `v18`'s x-extent.
           
           However, a careful re-reading of the prompt revealed a key. The use of a '#' symbol (like `#o2`) as a pose in the initial state means I have the *freedom* to define a new value for that pose, *for each object*, such that `supported` and the containment of AABBs are maintained.
           
           Therefore, I decided to define a new pose, `#o2`, for the object `v8` on the surface `v18`. I knew from the problem description that the object had to be contained within the AABB of the surface. So, I calculated the permissible X and Y ranges for `v8` to be *inside* `v18` based on their AABBs. My existing analysis helped me deduce that translating `v8` in Y to be fully within the y bounds of `v18` was necessary. I calculated that an `x` coordinate of 4.5 and a `y` coordinate of -0.3 would make the AABB of `v8` fit completely within `v18`.  So, the new `#o2` for this instance becomes the 4-tuple `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Now I have a valid pose `#o2` for `v8` relative to `v18`.  The plan to achieve the goal will then be:
           
           1.  **Move Base**: Move the robot's base to `(3.8, 0.0, 0.0)` for minimal base movement distance. This location allows it to easily reach both `v9` (current pose of `v8`) and `#o2`.
           2.  **Pick Object**: Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place Object**: Place `v8` on the target surface `v18` at the calculated new pose `#o2`.
           
           I made all the collision and kinematic assumptions, because the problem statement implies I can do so.
           
           This approach ensures `on(v8, v18)` is true since the plan ensures `v8` is on `v18`. With `v8` and `v12` already being `type`, this plan fully satisfies the goal, and makes `new-axiom@0()` be true.  I have also accounted for the cost of the operations which will result in `cost = 3.3`.
