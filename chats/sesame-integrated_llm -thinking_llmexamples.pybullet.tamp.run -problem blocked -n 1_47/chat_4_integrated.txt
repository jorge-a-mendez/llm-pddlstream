           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.462, -1.432), (4.604, -0.297)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.374, -0.134), (-4.294, -0.054)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object p3 is a pose with position (4.5, -0.3, 0.802) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.334, -0.094, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.65, 0.76).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.  I can quickly verify that `type(v12, v17)` is already true from the initial state, as `v12` is the object in question. Thus, the real challenge is achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I understand I need a pose `?p` for `v12` such that `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are both satisfied.  Thankfully, the initial state provides `supported(v12, #p0, v18)`, meaning `?p` is likely `#p0`. This suggests I need to ensure `atpose(v12, #p0)`.
           
           Considering the initial state, `v12` is currently at a different pose (`v13`).  Therefore, I'll need a "pick and place" sequence of actions: first, pick `v12` from `v13`, then place it at `#p0`.
           
           To successfully execute this plan, I first need to move the base, since my `pick` action has `atbconf(#q2)` as a precondition. Thus, I need to execute `move_base(v3, #q2, #t6)` to get the base in the correct configuration. The `move_base` action sets `canmove()` to false, which is then reset by subsequent `pick` and `place` actions to true.
           
           Next, I'll use the available action `pick(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t5)` to pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`). This picks from the robot hand, `v4`, with the base configuration `#q2` and grasp `#g1` via trajectory `#t5`.
           
           Now that `v12` is held by the robot, to move it from the held hand to the table surface `v18`, I need another base movement with the `move_base` and then I'll use  `place(v4, v12, #p0, #g1, #q3, #t7)` to place the object `v12` at the target pose `#p0`.
           
           To satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, I need the robot to have the base in position so I'll also move the base configuration as follows:
           - `move_base(#q2, #q3, #o0)`
           
           The resulting plan is:
           1.  `move_base(v3, #q2, #t6)`
           2.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t5)`
           3.  `move_base(#q2, #q3, #o0)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #p0, #g1, #q3, #t7)`
           
           To fully specify `#p0` I have to assign a proper value. The object `v12` is supported by surface `v18`. I'll place the object at (4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0), considering the bounds of `v18` and object geometry so the object is stable. With this target position `v12` has reached a stable state `on(v12, v18)`. Finally, `type(v12, v17)` is true in the initial state. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is finally achieved.
