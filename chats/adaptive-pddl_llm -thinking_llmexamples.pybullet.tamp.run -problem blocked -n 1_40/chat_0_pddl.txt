           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined means getting an object `?o` to be *both* `on(?o, v18)` and `type(?o, v17)`.  I've identified that `v8` and `v12` could potentially satisfy this, as they both have `type(?, v17)`.
           
           The crucial part here is the `on(?o, v18)`. This requires the object to be supported by v18 and atpose at the pose used by v18 to support.  Inspecting the initial state, I see that for both objects, v8 and v12, they're currently at different poses than #o2 where we know they would be supported by v18.
           
           Now, my strategy would normally be to leverage `pick` and `place` actions to move one of these objects to the correct position. I carefully examined the preconditions for these actions, confirming that they should work *if* I could actually *use* them. However, here's where the critical problem arises: the *only* action I'm allowed to use is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This is a clear roadblock.
           
           Since I am restricted to the single `move_base` action, I *cannot* manipulate the `atpose` of any object.  Therefore, I cannot change the position of `v8` or `v12` to satisfy the requirements of `on(?o, v18)`. Since both the preconditions for `pick` and `place` include preconditions for continuous parameters, I'd have to use their values to satisfy the kinematic constraints. Given that `pick` and `place` are *not* available actions, I cannot meet the goal.  The goal as stated is simply unachievable with this limited action set.
