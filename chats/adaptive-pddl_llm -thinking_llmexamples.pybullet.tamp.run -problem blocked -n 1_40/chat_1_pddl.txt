           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Immovable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` onto object `v18`. I immediately recognize that both `v8` and `v12` fit the type requirement. However, neither are initially positioned on `v18`. To satisfy the `on` predicate, I need to manipulate the `atpose` of either `v8` or `v12` to `#o2` – a known supported pose on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought is to simply pick and place one of these objects. This requires a `pick` and `place` sequence using the robot's arms, `v4` and `v6`. I choose `v4` and, examining the preconditions, I encounter a critical obstacle: the `kin` facts demand that the robot's base be at configuration `#o3` for all `v4` actions. Unfortunately, the only permitted base movement is `move_base(v3, v3, #o0)`, a no-op that maintains the base at `v3`.
           
           The core of the problem lies in this severe limitation. I can't move the base to the required configuration, making all `pick` and `place` actions involving `v4` impossible. Since all necessary `pick` and `place` actions involving `v4` require `#o3` but the base can't move to `#o3`, this renders `pick` and `place` impossible. I've re-examined the facts and the axioms, including any possible hidden connections. Ultimately, there is no way to achieve the necessary `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)` conditions, rendering the goal unattainable. The severely restricted action list and conflicting `kin` facts effectively create an unresolvable situation.
