           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Essentially, that means I need to get v8, v12, and v14 all stacked on v16.  Based on the current state, all three objects are supported by v11.
           
           Now, my initial thought is that this requires a classic pick-and-place strategy. I'd need to pick each object from v11 and carefully place it on v16.  This implies a series of `pick` and `place` actions, using an arm, obviously.
           
           However, the action instance list I've been given is incredibly limiting. The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This boils down to "move the base from base configuration v3 to base configuration v3", which is essentially a no-op, a placeholder. It's indicating that the base doesn't need to move.
           
           My analysis now hinges on the available actions.  I've confirmed that the 'pick' and 'place' actions are not in the list. To achieve the goal, I would *need* 'pick' and 'place' actions to move those objects.  Since they're not available, and I'm constrained by what's allowed, I can't modify the `atpose` of any object. I cannot move v8, v12, or v14 from v11 to v16.
           
           Given the rigid constraint of only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` available, the plan is entirely unachievable. There is no way to manipulate the objects from their current locations, and no way to change the *state* in a meaningful way to achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal is infeasible with the provided action instances.
