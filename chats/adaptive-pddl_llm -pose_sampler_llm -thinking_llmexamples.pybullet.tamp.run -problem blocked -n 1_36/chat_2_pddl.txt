(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking, walking through this. My goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, which I'll call `?green`, that is both `on` `v18` and of `type` `v17`. This means I need to manipulate the environment to satisfy these two conditions.
           
           First, I break down `on(?o, ?r)`. This means finding an object `?green` supported on `v18`. From the given initial state, `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)` indicate that both `v8` and `v12` are candidates.
           
           I assess each candidate. Let's start with `v8`. The facts support it being on `v11` at pose `v9`, as denoted by `atpose(v8,v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. However, there's also the fact `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. The challenge lies in having it placed at `#o2` on `v18`. Since `v8` is currently at pose `v9`, I'd need to pick it up and place it on `v18`.
           
           Moving onto `v12`. I see that it is also supported, at pose `v13`, where `supported(v12,v13,v14)`. Like `v8`, `v12` can also be placed on `v18` at pose `#o2`. I could see that `supported(v12,#o2,v18)`.
           
           Since both `v8` and `v12` are valid, and there are explicit kinematic facts for `v12`, I'll choose `v12` as my object.
           
           My plan then becomes: Pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) using arm `v4`, and then place `v12` onto `v18` at pose `#o2` using the same arm.
           
           Now, let's verify my preconditions. I confirm `kin(v4, v12, v13, ...)` (kinematic relation), `atpose(v12, v13)`, `handempty(v4)`, and assume safety (`NegatedAtom unsafe...`) holds. However, I need to address `atbconf(#o3)`, and this may be different from the current `atbconf(v3)`. So, I'll incorporate a base motion if necessary.
           
           This leads to a three-step plan:
           
           1.  **`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`**: If my initial state is not in the desired state, i.e., `v3 != #o3`, then I move the base to the desired configuration.
           2.  **`pick v4 v12 v13 ...`**: Picking up the object.
           3.  **`place v4 v12 #o2 ...`**: Placing the object.
           
           I meticulously review how `canmove()` is affected by the predicates. I ensure that all preconditions are met at each step, making certain that `canmove()` becomes false during base motion, and then re-enables for the pick and place commands.  Essentially, the robot's state changes from `atbconf(v3)` to `atbconf(#o3)`, then it is able to pick, and then place.
           
           I also double-check my goal, making sure that `on(v12, v18)` is true after the place action, which is. By `place` operation, I verify that all conditions are met and that the robot can place object successfully.
