           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My thought process begins with the need to generate 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface.** The object, identified as ID 10, is almost square, with dimensions of approximately 0.096 units. The surface, labeled as `surf_0`, is a square of `0.6 x 0.6` units. My goal is to ensure that each placement is stable, meaning the object must be fully contained within the surface, and that I explore different orientations.
           
           First, I consider that the object can be rotated. I understand that the rotation affects the effective bounding box dimensions. To address this, I begin by using the object's actual dimensions to account for rotation. If an object is rotated by `theta`, I can calculate the AABB using:
           *   `effective_w = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))`
           *   `effective_h = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`
           
           Given that the object is almost a square, I know that the 45-degree rotation (`pi/4` radians) will give the largest bounding box. I decide to use two rotation angles: 0 degrees and `pi/4` to ensure good coverage. The effective bounding box dimensions are the key to find the ranges for `x` and `y` center positions, which will ensure that the object lies inside the surface.
           
           I calculate the available `x` and `y` ranges using a simple approach. For `theta = 0`, the effective width and height are the object's dimensions. For `theta = pi/4`, I calculate the effective dimensions based on the 45-degree rotation. The object is slightly rotated, and the AABB increases. Given these dimensions, I determine the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates within the surface. I then divide these ranges into smaller steps to make a 5 x 5 grid of stable placements. Using both `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4` and taking the proper bounding box dimensions, I arrive at 50 placements. I confirm I calculated all necessary values using the appropriate precision and correct `pi` values.
