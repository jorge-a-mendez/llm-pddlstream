           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Immovable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring an object, let's call it `?green`, is both `on(v18)` and of `type(v17)`. Analyzing the initial state, I've identified `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates for `?green` because they have the required type.
           
           The core strategy boils down to moving one of these objects to `v18`. From the initial state and the definition of the `on` predicate, this necessitates a `place` action. However, the available `place` action has strict preconditions, notably `atbconf(#o3)`. Conversely, the initial state is `atbconf(v3)`, and the sole move action provided only moves from `v3` to `v3`, effectively a no-op concerning `atbconf`.
           
           Upon thorough investigation of the `kin` facts, it's evident that all kinematic trajectories for the arm require base configuration `#o3`. Unfortunately, no viable path exists to modify `atbconf` from `v3` to `#o3` with the given domain and actions. Thus, the crucial `place` action, and consequently the overall goal, becomes unattainable.
