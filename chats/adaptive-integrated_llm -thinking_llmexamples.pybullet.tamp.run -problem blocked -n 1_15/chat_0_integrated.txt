User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.312, -0.151), (-4.215, -0.055)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.263, -0.103, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.487, 0.874).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. Since I'm an expert, I immediately recognize this as a conditional conjunction.  I know I have to find an appropriate `?green`.
           
           Initial thoughts: Based on the available `type` facts, `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`. Thus, the path forward is to achieve either `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.  I can see that to make `on` true, I need to place an object on top of v18.
           
           Here's where things get tricky. The `on` predicate requires `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So, for instance, `on(v8, v18)` means I need `supported(v8, p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, p)`.  I spotted that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial facts, making the path seem straightforward: place v8 at pose `#o2` on top of v18.
           
           My gut tells me I need to check the allowable actions.  I need to pick up v8 (currently on top of v11) and place it on v18. I'll need a `pick` and a `place` action.
           
           The problem, as I suspected, is that I'm severely constrained. My "experts vision" confirms that only a `move_base` action instance is allowed: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. No `pick` or `place` instances are present!
           
           I've got a problem.  I need actions that aren't on the approved list to make the goal true! I need pick and place, but the constraint says I can only use `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. I'm basically stuck.
           
           Therefore, because I can't manipulate objects, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given constraints. I must conclude the problem is unsolvable.
