User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.312, -0.151), (-4.215, -0.055)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.263, -0.103, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.487, 0.874).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal: Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the task at hand is to make sure an object, which I'm calling `?green`, is both *on* something and of a specific *type*. I've got two candidate objects, `v8` and `v12`, that fit the type requirement.  My initial thought is that I should check which one is the easiest to manipulate given the current arrangement. To be *on* something, the object has to be supported by it and at a specific pose (position and orientation). I see `v8` *and* `v12` could work, since they are both supported by `v18`. 
           
           Now I need to choose. Since both are viable, I will choose `v8` for now. To get `v8` on `v18`, I need to move it from its current spot (pose `v9`). Luckily, the initial state gives me `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, and all I need is to position `v8` in the `#o2` pose. 
           
           The initial state tells me that the robot arm `v4` and `v6` are available. I see some kinematic facts, describing the relationship between the arm, `v8`, and the poses I'm considering. With these, I should be able to make a plan.
           
           I have two potential actions I could use to achieve my goal: `pick` and `place`. So, I need to pick up `v8` from pose `v9` and place it at pose `#o2` on `v18`. 
           
           I'll start by picking `v8` from pose `v9` with `arm v4` using grasp `#o1`, base configuration `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`. Then, after picking `v8`, I'll place it at pose `#o2` with `arm v4` using grasp `#o1`, base configuration `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           I need to confirm if these actions are valid by checking their preconditions. I have to make sure that the robot can reach `v9`, that its hand is empty, and there are no potential collision risks. After checking, the preconditions for both `pick` and `place` seem to be met!
           
           Now that I have a valid plan, I need to provide values for the poses. I'll need a good continuous value for `#o2`, so it rests on `v18`.  `v18`'s area is given, and I will place `v8` in the center of that space and at a height that would rest on `v18`. I've calculated that to be a pose of `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Finally, it's worth checking to see if `v15` will be in the way. It is nearby but not close enough to cause a collision. Likewise, `v12` is on the other side of the workspace and poses no problems.
           
           Given everything I've seen, this plan should work. If I followed the provided kinematics facts to find all necessary information, the initial state seems right, and the goal `new-axiom@0()` should be met.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan that's been flagged as using illegal actions. Let's break this down. The only *allowed* action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Essentially, it's just telling the base to *stay put* using a specific trajectory.  The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, expands to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I can see that initially, `type(v8, v17)` is true, so I need to establish `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           Now, for `on(v8, v18)` to be true, I need both `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`. But looking at the initial state, I see that `v8` *is* already supported, but *on* `v11`, not `v18`.  So I've got to somehow move `v8` from `v11` to `v18`.
           
           That's where the problem really hits me. To achieve that, I *absolutely* need `pick` and `place` actions.  I need to pick up the object, move the base, and then place it down.  However, the *only* action I'm given is the "do nothing" action for the base. This means I can't actually manipulate *any* of the objects, or move them around in the environment.
           
           Therefore, because I cannot use *pick* and *place*, I cannot change the state of `v8` to be *on* `v18`. The system is basically rigged to fail. I can confidently conclude that the goal state is unreachable given the current action constraints. The constraints imposed by only allowing `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))` make the task fundamentally impossible.
