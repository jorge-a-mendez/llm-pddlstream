           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.312, -0.151), (-4.215, -0.055)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.263, -0.103, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.487, 0.874).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing an object of type `v17` *on* a surface `v18`. After analyzing the initial state, I've determined that the objects `v8` and `v12` are both of type `v17` and could potentially be the target object. However, the existing facts `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)` show these objects are already *on* surfaces `v11` and `v14`, respectively. Since my focus will be on the available initial states, I will assume a valid solution involves *only* those states, meaning picking from an initial supporting surface, and placing on the target supporting surface *without* having to do any more complex steps like collision avoidance. 
           
           Analyzing the requirements for an *on* predicate and existing pose information, I've identified that `v8` is a prime candidate, currently located on surface `v11` (specifically `v9`). The target surface, `v18`, is actually a part of `v11`, occupying the negative y part. This is an important detail, as it means I can place `v8` directly onto `v18` without moving it *off* of `v11`, but into *the section defined as* `v18`. 
           
           The plan will require these steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** A `move_base` action is necessary to transition the robot's base from its current configuration `v3` to a base configuration `#o3` (which can include the same `bconf` value, that is if `v3` and `#o3` are the same). The reasoning for this is to ensure the robot arm, `v4`, can reach and interact with `v8` on a kinematic level. Note that `atbconf(#o3)` needs to hold true *during* the pick-place action.
           2.  **Pick Object:** I will need to use the `pick` action `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`, where `v4` is the arm, `v8` is the object to pick, and `v9` is its current pose. The object must be grasped with the corresponding parameters (base, gripper etc.). The state changes will include `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` and negation of the `atpose(v8, v9)` predicate.
           3.  **Place Object:** Finally, I'll place the object `v8` onto `v18` using the `place` action `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`. The pose `#o2` will be where `v8` is placed, which must be supported on `v18`. The `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` initial state predicate helps me infer the corresponding initial states required to satisfy the goal. This means I'll need to define a *new* pose for `#o2` for a stable and collision-free placement for `v8` on `v18`. The state changes will include `atpose(v8, #o2)` and the negation of the `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)` predicate.
           
           **Reasoning for the Pose Value**
           
           Now, I need to derive a specific pose value for `#o2`. The goal requires the robot to place an object `v8` onto the surface `v18`. Initial state facts show that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. Since the current position of `v8` is defined by `v9`, I will use it as the reference for my reasoning. The existing object AABB for `v8` is `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))`, and the AABB for `v18` is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. To ensure stability and collision avoidance, I'll place `v8` at the center of the surface *or* a section of `v18` with the same height value as the existing position, so it can be supported without falling through. Since the table/base height is specified as `z=0.8` for all objects, I will use this as my value for placing `v8`. The ideal placement for this, based on geometry, will be `(4.5, -0.3,
