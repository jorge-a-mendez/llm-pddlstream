(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for this object (ID 5) on a given surface, which is a simple AABB defined by `0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  The object's AABB dimensions are `size_x = 0.08787965215166171` and `size_y = 0.08787965215166177`. A stable placement means the object's *entire* AABB must fit *inside* the surface's AABB.  The placement is defined by a surface index, rotation angle (`theta`), and (x, y) coordinates of the object's center.
           
           The key is figuring out how the object's AABB changes with rotation.  The "effective" AABB dimensions, `effective_dx` and `effective_dy`, change with `theta`. Since the object's dimensions are almost equal, it's nearly square. The maximum effective dimensions occur at a 45-degree angle.
           
           I'm interpreting the problem statement carefully.  It's likely the `x` and `y` given are for the center of the object's *unrotated* AABB.  So, I need to calculate the "effective" width and height of the rotated bounding box for any given angle.
           
           To ensure stability, I've got to calculate the bounds for the object's center at each angle.  The object's AABB needs to fit inside the surface, so I have to adjust the permissible `x` and `y` center coordinates depending on the rotation.
           
           I broke it down into several `theta` values.  I calculated the valid ranges for `x` and `y` for `theta` values of 0, pi/4, pi/2, and pi/8.  Then I chose several x, y coordinates within the allowable ranges and compiled a list of placements.  I have my 50 unique, stable placements, and I'm ready to output them in the specified format.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got the placement data for object 5, along with its dimensions and successful placement on the surface. That placement defines a key region to avoid when placing the new object, object 6. Here's my thought process:
           
           I need to calculate the bounding box (AABB) of object 5, which I've done based on its specified width and height, and its position. The AABB is defined by `x \in [-0.1239, -0.0361]` and `y \in [-0.1239, -0.0361]`.
           
           Object 6 is a square, which simplifies things. I'll need to figure out its effective dimensions based on the chosen rotation angle (theta). For a square object, the dimensions will be a function of the side length. My goal is to find 50 valid, non-colliding placements for object 6 on the given surface, surface 0 which is `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I consider the case where object 6 has no rotation. I determine the valid ranges for `x` and `y` coordinates for the object's center on the surface, accounting for the object's half-width. I then need to ensure that the placement doesn't overlap the AABB of object 5.
           
           I'll divide the surface into zones and then calculate the locations. I know object 5 is in the bottom-left quadrant. Therefore, I need to place object 6 either entirely to the right, above, or below object 5 to avoid overlap.
           
           I start by systematically calculating valid placements based on the restrictions. This approach will involve generating a grid of coordinates, avoiding those that overlap with object 5's AABB. I am going to try theta = 0, pi/4, pi/2, and pi/8 (degrees 0, 45, 90, 22.5) for the object rotation. For each case, I will calculate the range for object 6, then identify the locations for object 6 to be. The coordinates must be selected in such a way so the bounds of object 6 does not overlap the bounds of object 5. The total sum of placements will be checked to be 50.
           
           I've carefully considered the valid placement zones by computing regions above and right of object 5.
           I have confirmed 50 distinct locations:
           *   **Theta = 0.0**: 15 placements above object 5, and 9 to the right of object 5.
           *   **Theta = pi/4**: 6 above and 4 to the right.
           *   **Theta = pi/2**: 10 above.
           *   **Theta = pi/8**: 6 above.
           
           Each of these coordinates has been checked against the object 5 AABB to ensure that there are no overlaps. The chosen coordinates are also specific to the angle and are distinct. All checks are satisfied.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object 4**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, taking into account two pre-existing, fixed obstacles (Objects 5 and 6) already on the surface. My first move is to meticulously map out the "no-go" zone created by these obstacles, specifically the bounding box they occupy.
           
           Based on their known placements and dimensions, I can calculate their individual Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). Then, I'll take the union of these two AABBs to determine the combined occupied space. After careful calculations using the dimensions of each object, this union region is now my "Obstacle_AABB", precisely identified as `((-0.1239, -0.1239), (-0.0361, 0.0532))`.
           
           Now, considering Object 4's dimensions, I have to ensure its placement keeps it entirely within the confines of Surface 0 `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` while also staying clear of the "Obstacle_AABB" at any rotation (theta). With the object being square, different rotations affect the AABB dimensions. After calculating various placement thresholds, I concluded any suitable placements must be to the right of the obstacle.
           
           Given these constraints, I've devised a strategic approach:
           *   I will be considering 3 placement angles, 0, pi/4, and pi/2.
           *   I will place the object in a grid layout to determine the available space.
           
           I now need to iterate over several (x, y) coordinates. These placements must meet two requirements. Surface containment and collision-free placement. This strategy should yield the 50 placements I'm after.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (Object ID 7) on Surface 0, taking into account three existing, fixed obstacles (Objects ID 5, 6, and 4). My approach involves carefully considering the geometry of the surface and obstacles to avoid collisions and ensure Object 7 fits within the surface boundaries.
           
           The surface is a 0.27 x 0.27 square.  I've defined bounding boxes (AABBs) for each of the fixed obstacles. The initial idea was to take the union of all obstacles. But using the bounding box of the union led to an overly conservative assessment of safe regions. This means I'll need to check the placement individually against the AABB of each fixed obstacle to ensure no overlap.
           
           My primary strategy is now to define a grid of potential placement centers across Surface 0, then check if, for each position, the AABB of Object 7 (considering different rotations) overlaps any of the AABBs of the fixed obstacles.  Object 7 is very close to a square shape, with dimensions of around 0.086 x 0.086 units.
           
           I'll check for collision with each obstacle individually: if object 7's AABB doesn't overlap any of the obstacles AABBs, it's a valid placement. I use a fine grid over the surface (x and y) to increase the odds of finding good placements.  I have also defined 8 different angles for the object. This grid is over each angle, increasing the number of candidate placements and the probability of finding 50 unique placements to satisfy the original request.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan:** I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 8 on surface 0, taking into account the fixed obstacles (IDs 5, 6, 4, and 7) already placed. Surface 0 is a square with coordinates from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Since the previous objects are at a theta of 0, their AABBs are simple rectangles.  I've meticulously calculated the AABBs for all four existing objects, including their dimensions and placements, paying close attention to the half-width (hw) and half-height (hh).
           
           I'll start by determining the size and shape of object ID 8, which is almost square (W = H = ~0.095). My initial surface bounds are set, but the existing objects effectively reduce the usable space. I'll need to figure out a smart placement strategy.
           
           My core idea is this:
           1.  Try a few different rotation angles (theta) for object 8.
           2.  For each angle, figure out the object's half-width and half-height to calculate its bounds.
           3.  Calculate an initial valid (x, y) range for containment on Surface 0.
           4.  Generate many candidate (x, y) points.
           5.  Check each point against the AABBs of all four fixed obstacles. If there's an overlap, it's a collision and that point is rejected.
           
           The combined obstacle space creates a complex irregular area. So, I will check each possible placement and reject those with collisions. 
           
           I've carefully examined the obstacles AABBs, visualizing their positions on the surface. Object 5 is bottom-left, Object 6 is above it, Object 4 is right of Object 5, and Object 7 is the right-middle, near the top, which means they effectively block off a good portion of the space.
           
           The right side of the surface seems potentially promising to position the new object to the right of them. The top-right area also looks potentially free. I'll need to see.
           
           Since object ID 8 has similar width and height, its rotation won't make a huge difference in my collision checks. I'm focusing on finding the right (x,y) location.
           
           After this analysis, I'll systematically search the available space. I'll calculate the rotation of each AABB (using effective_dx, effective_dy, hw and hh.)

Model:     **Okay, here's my plan:** I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 8 on surface 0, taking into account the fixed obstacles (IDs 5, 6, 4, and 7) already placed. Surface 0 is a square with coordinates from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Since the previous objects are at a theta of 0, their AABBs are simple rectangles.  I've meticulously calculated the AABBs for all four existing objects, including their dimensions and placements, paying close attention to the half-width (hw) and half-height (hh).
           
           I'll start by determining the size and shape of object ID 8, which is almost square (W = H = ~0.095). My initial surface bounds are set, but the existing objects effectively reduce the usable space. I'll need to figure out a smart placement strategy.
           
           My core idea is this:
           1.  Try a few different rotation angles (theta) for object 8.
           2.  For each angle, figure out the object's half-width and half-height to calculate its bounds.
           3.  Calculate an initial valid (x, y) range for containment on Surface 0.
           4.  Generate many candidate (x, y) points.
           5.  Check each point against the AABBs of all four fixed obstacles. If there's an overlap, it's a collision and that point is rejected.
           
           The combined obstacle space creates a complex irregular area. So, I will check each possible placement and reject those with collisions. 
           
           I've carefully examined the obstacles AABBs, visualizing their positions on the surface. Object 5 is bottom-left, Object 6 is above it, Object 4 is right of Object 5, and Object 7 is the right-middle, near the top, which means they effectively block off a good portion of the space.
           
           The right side of the surface seems potentially promising to position the new object to the right of them. The top-right area also looks potentially free. I'll need to see.
           
           Since object ID 8 has similar width and height, its rotation won't make a huge difference in my collision checks. I'm focusing on finding the right (x,y) location.
           
           After this analysis, I'll systematically search the available space. I'll calculate the rotation of each AABB (using effective_dx, effective_dy, hw and hh.) I'll create a grid of (x, y) candidates and then check them for collisions with each of the obstacles. I plan to use the `check_collision` method using the AABBs and will then filter until I find 50 valid, collision-free, positions. I'll repeat this for multiple angles of object ID 8 to increase the odds of finding good placements.
