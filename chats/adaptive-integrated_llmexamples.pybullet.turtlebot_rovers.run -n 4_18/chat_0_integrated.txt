           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two landers, v9, and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20). There is one camera, v10, which supports mode v11. The camera is onboard both rovers. There is one store, v16, which is free for both rovers.
           
           The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()`, which effectively requires:
           1. Both rovers v12 and v14 to be at some configuration (they are at v13 and v15 respectively in the initial state).
           2. Both rovers to have their store v16 free (they are both free in the initial state).
           3. All objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) to have received images in mode v11.
           4. Rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4) to have received analysis.
           5. Rocks of type v6 (v5, v7, v8) to have received analysis.
           
           Let's break down the plan to achieve these conditions:
           
           **Achieving `receivedimage` for all objectives:**
           This requires:
           - `take_image` for each objective.
           - `send_image` for each objective.
           
           To `take_image`, the rover needs to be calibrated, atconf, have imagevisible, and the ray not blocked.
           To `send_image`, the rover needs to have the image, be atconf, have comvisible, and the ray not blocked.
           
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible` to all objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) from configuration #o3 using ray #o4.
           Rover v14 also has `imagevisible` to all objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) from configuration #o3 using ray #o4.
           Both rovers have `comvisible` to lander v9 from configuration #o0 using ray #o1.
           
           Since both rovers have the same camera `v10` onboard and `v10` supports `v11`, we can use either rover to take and send images. Let's use rover v12 since it's already at `v13` and has a path to `#o3` and `#o0`. However, the available actions only show move actions with `v13` and `v15` as target configurations for rovers `v12` and `v14` respectively, and not any other configurations like `#o3` or `#o0`. This means that if we need to move to `#o3` to take images or `#o0` to send them, we'd need more complex motion planning or different action instances.
           
           Looking at the provided valid action instances:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           These actions essentially move the rover from its current configuration to the same configuration, which doesn't change its location. This implies that if we need to take images or send analyses, the rovers must be able to do so from their current initial configurations `v13` and `v15`, or the provided configurations with '#', specifically `#o3` for images and `#o0` for communication.
           
           However, the problem statement says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that we cannot use `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` if they are not explicitly listed, even if their preconditions are met. The only actions available are `move` and `drop_rock`. This dramatically limits the possible actions.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal given the *only* available actions:
           `((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))`
           `((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))`
           `((drop_rock v12 v16))`
           `((drop_rock v14 v16))`
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()` which means:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` (True in initial state)
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` (True in initial state)
           - `free(v12, v16)` (True in initial state)
           - `free(v14, v16)` (True in initial state)
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)` (False in initial state)
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)` (False in initial state)
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)` (False in initial state)
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)` (False in initial state)
           - `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for all rocks of type v2. (False in initial state)
           - `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for all rocks of type v6. (False in initial state)
           
           Since the only available actions are `move` (to the same configuration) and `drop_rock`, and none of these actions can achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, the goal is unreachable. The `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions are required to achieve the goal, but they are not listed as valid action instances. Therefore, the plan cannot be completed.
