User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.032, -0.307, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.938, -0.347).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.237, -0.322, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.723, 0.691).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.207, 0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.454, 0.891).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.004, -0.546), (0.069, -0.472)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.018, -0.356), (0.081, -0.258)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.201, -0.358), (0.274, -0.285)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.032, -0.509, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.688, 0.726).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.256, 0.46), (-0.158, 0.557)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal state where `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all placed on `v18`.  The initial state indicates these objects are currently supported by `v11`. To accomplish this, I must employ the `pick` and `place` actions, moving each object from `v11` to `v18`.
           
           **Constraints and Available Actions**
           
           The major roadblock here is the extremely restrictive constraint: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The only action instance provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This effectively means no movement of the robot's base is required or allowed beyond this zero-cost operation. Crucially, *no* `pick` or `place` action instances are listed.
           
           **The Dilemma: Unreachable Goal**
           
           Based on this strict constraint and the available action instances, the goal appears unreachable. I need `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects. However, these actions aren't provided. Without the ability to actually *pick* or *place* the objects, I can't move them to `v18`.
           
           **Re-evaluation of the Problem Statement and Assumptions**
           
           Let's review the instructions carefully. "When creating a plan, replace the arguments of each action with specific objects." This suggests I should *instantiate* the generic action types (pick, place, etc.). However, that's directly contradicted by the "only action instances" restriction.
           
           **Deep Dive into Initial State and Preconditions**
           
           A quick scan of the initial state confirms my suspicions.  The `kin` predicates, which are crucial for defining the robotic arm configurations and trajectories required for `pick` and `place` actions, are absent or insufficient. No specific kin facts.
           
           **Analysis of the "Available Action Instances" Wording**
           
           The wording is critical. "list of available action instances" indicates a *fixed* set, not action templates. If the intent were that I *generate* instances of `pick` and `place`, the instructions would be different (e.g., "The robot can execute the following actions" followed by "we have computed the following instance: ...").
           
           **The Unavoidable Conclusion**
           
           With the action instance restriction, I have no way to execute `pick` or `place` operations. Consequently, the task of placing `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` on `v18` is unsolvable. I must conclude that the goal is *unreachable* given the provided constraints.
