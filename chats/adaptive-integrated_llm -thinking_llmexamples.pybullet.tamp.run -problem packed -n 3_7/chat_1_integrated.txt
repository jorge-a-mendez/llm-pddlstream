User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.221, 0.426), (-0.139, 0.508)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.04, 0.216), (0.038, 0.294)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.252, -0.285, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.78, 0.626).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.18, 0.467, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, 0.1).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.001, 0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.063, 0.998).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.294, -0.327), (-0.21, -0.243)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           My objective is to craft a plan to position objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` atop object `v16`.  This necessitates a series of "pick" and "place" actions to relocate these objects from their initial poses (`v9`, `v13`, and `v15`) to a pose supported by `v16`. I have a robot arm (`v4`) available.
           
           The system provides me with the initial state, including the objects' poses, their supports, and the robot's configuration. Crucially, I'm given a restricted list of "valid action instances": `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This is problematic. The problem also includes some `kin` facts which would be used with actions.
           
           The preconditions for both `pick` and `place` include `kin` predicates, `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and the absence of unsafe configurations. The main issue is the given list of valid instances, which contains *only* a self-looping `move_base` action.
           
           The problem explicitly states that I *must* adhere to this list, meaning I am forbidden from using `pick` or `place`.  I interpret this restriction as a hard constraint.  Even though the problem's structure implies I should generate `pick` and `place` actions, the explicit constraint trumps that assumption.
           
           The effect of `move_base` is to disable `canmove()`, which is usually necessary to perform actions like pick/place. However, pick and place do not *require* `canmove()` in their preconditions - which is confusing. This self-loop effectively "burns" a move, and makes the system wait for an event.
           
           Since the only allowed action is the self-looping `move_base`, I am unable to perform the necessary "pick" and "place" actions. Therefore, I can not reach the goal state.
