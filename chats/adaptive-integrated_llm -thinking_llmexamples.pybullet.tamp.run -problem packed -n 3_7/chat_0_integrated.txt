           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.18, 0.467, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.995, 0.1).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.221, 0.426), (-0.139, 0.508)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.04, 0.216), (0.038, 0.294)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.001, 0.255, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.063, 0.998).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.252, -0.285, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.78, 0.626).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.294, -0.327), (-0.21, -0.243)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis: The Goal is Unreachable**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve the goal: `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  Effectively, this means I must move objects v8, v12, and v14 from their initial positions on v11 to a pose on the surface v16, where they are supported and at a specified pose. My initial observation is that the available data details poses and grasps for each object.
           
           I meticulously analyzed the initial state, identifying the initial positions of the three objects (`on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, `on(v14, v11)`) and recognizing the need for `pick` and `place` actions to modify their location. Specifically, I determined that valid grasp and placement poses exist for each.
           
           However, a critical constraint arises from the problem statement: *only* the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is allowed.  This severely limits my options, as this `move_base` action is essentially a no-op, resetting `canmove()` if necessary, and it has no impact on object positions or poses.  The `pick` and `place` actions, which are necessary to change the `on` predicates, are explicitly *not* on the valid action list.
           
           Therefore, since the problem requires these actions to be on the allowed action list to be used in the plan,  and that list *does not contain* `pick` and `place`, the goal becomes unattainable. No action instances exist that can modify the initial configuration to meet the specified `on` predicates. It is impossible to generate a valid plan given these limitations.
