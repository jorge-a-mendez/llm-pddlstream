           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom's a beast: a long conjunction of predicates. First, I noticed that the initial state already satisfies the first four predicates: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`. But the rest? That's where things get interesting.
           
           **Unachievable Objectives**
           
           The critical predicates that are holding me back are: `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`, and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. To meet these, I've gotta use `send_image` and `send_analysis`. Both of these require the rover to be at certain configurations (`#o0` and `#o3` or `#o5`), but the provided actions are limited: the rovers are stuck in place. The `move` actions I've got are just self-loops, so they can't change the rover's position!
           
           **Obstacles: Limited Actions and Immobile Rovers**
           
           The problem lies with the fundamental precondition of several actions: the required `atconf`. Both `send_image` and `send_analysis` necessitate the rovers to be at a specific configuration (dictated by the `comvisible` requirement), and `take_image` needs the rovers to be at a specific configuration (dictated by the `imagevisible` requirement). However, the only `move` actions available don't actually change the rovers' location at all, they just end up in the same configuration as they start. Therefore, I can't meet the preconditions for `take_image`, `calibrate`, or `sample_rock`. The rovers are effectively immobilized.
           
           **Final Verdict**
           
           Given these constraints and the nature of the goal - specifically the requirements for both `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` - I'm forced to conclude that this goal is unachievable, at least with the available actions. No matter how many times I try, without any true movement actions, I'm stuck, and the plan just can't be completed.
