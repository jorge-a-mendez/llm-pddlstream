User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall at x = 0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the environment. I will try to find diverse positions around the target point, keeping in mind the obstacles. The target point is (0.83 -0.63).
           
           Positions:
           (1.83 -0.63)
           (0.83 -1.63)
           (0.83 0.37)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the environment. The previous attempts were made for a different target point, so the collision and line-of-sight failures are not directly applicable to the new target. However, I will still use the general knowledge of the environment. The target point is (0.83 -0.63).
           
           Positions:
           (0.83 -1.0)
