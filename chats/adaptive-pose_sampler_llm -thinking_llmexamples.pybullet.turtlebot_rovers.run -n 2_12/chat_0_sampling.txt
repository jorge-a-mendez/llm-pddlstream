User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Positioning for Target Acquisition**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding three suitable (x, y) locations for a robot base to acquire a target point. The main constraint is that the base must be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target. The robot's orientation will be automatically adjusted to face the target, so I don't need to worry about that. The base needs to be within the square area of  [-2.5, 2.5] for both x and y coordinates.
           
           I'm also provided with a list of fixed obstacles represented as AABBs, which I need to account for.  Crucially, I need to ensure line-of-sight to the target, meaning the base's view can't be obstructed by any obstacle.  This is the first time I've been asked to position for this specific target, so I'm starting fresh without any prior "failed" positions to learn from.
           
           My first step is to analyze the scene geometry based on the provided obstacles. It's a rectangular environment, effectively bounded by the walls and a central pillar.  There are a series of small obstacles scattered around, adding complexity. The main challenge here is the central pillar (`x=0`).
           
           The target point is (0, 0), which makes things a bit tricky, because it *appears* to be inside the central pillar obstacle (x = [-0.05, 0.05]). This immediately raises a red flag:  if the target is actually *inside* a solid obstacle,  line-of-sight should be impossible, right?  My initial thought is that if this is the case, the system is designed in a way to make it still possible.
           
           My strategy will be to generate candidate positions that meet the distance constraint, avoid collisions with the fixed obstacles, and try to have a clear view to the target. However, given that the target is *within* an obstacle, it looks like LOS might never work. However, the problem explicitly states that I must *never give up*, even in a problematic scenario, so I must press forward.
           
           To address the key concern with the central pillar, I will consider placements on both sides of it (x > 0 and x < 0), trying to maximize the clearance from other obstacles while minimizing the x distance from 0. I will prioritize positions that are at a reasonable distance from the target but provide some separation to the central obstacle.
           
           After careful consideration of the spatial relationships, I'm proposing the following three positions, which meet the basic distance constraints and are clear of other fixed obstacles: (1.0, 1.0), (-1.0, 1.0), (1.0, -1.0). Each is in a different quadrant and, importantly, is *not* colliding with the central pillar, but it's hard to tell if the system treats LOS as being *strictly blocked by* the target's obstacle, or a more nuanced rule.
           
           My hope is that the system will handle the specific target location with a reasonable line-of-sight determination, and these diverse positions provide a good starting point.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:
           
           ```
           Target point: (-0.3144107758998871, 2.1400225162506104, 0.20100000500679016), Proposed position: (1.0, 1.0) -- not reachable for robot base
           ```
           
           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Navigating the Feedback: Decoding the "Not Reachable" Challenge**
           
           Okay, so the user's feedback gives us a new target point, T, located at approximately (-0.314, 2.140), and tells us that the previous position (1.0, 1.0) was "not reachable for robot base."  This isn't just a simple rejection; it's a puzzle. The distance from the previous attempted position to the new target is within the robot's maximum range, and the coordinates are within the environment bounds. Therefore, the "not reachable" issue *must* be about something else.
           
           After a thorough examination, including considering the obstacles and their positions, I've reasoned that the target is *inside* a fixed obstacle (specifically Obstacle 10 and a smaller inner obstacle, 20).  A line-of-sight from the rejected position  (1.0, 1.0) would likely pass through a neighboring obstacle 10, thus this is the most probable reason for the negative response.
           
           **The Strategy: Three Promising Positions**
           
           Given the likely cause of the failed line of sight from (1.0, 1.0), I need to find positions that *avoid* the problematic line of sight, and allow a valid line of sight to the target that is embedded in the obstacles.
           I have arrived at three different positions.
           
           I'm proposing:
           1.  **Lower-left, below Obstacle 8**: (-2.2, 1.6). At this location, there is no line of sight blockage.
           2.  **Middle-left, below Obstacle 10**: (-1.0, 1.0)
           3.  **Right of the central pillar**: (0.5, 1.0).
           
           These three positions should provide various perspectives on the target, while avoiding narrow spaces and potential collision risks.
           
           I'm confident that with the three options presented here, we should see an improved line of sight and target acquisition, given the current environment configuration.
