           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) *on* `v20`.  The definition of "on" means each object needs to be at a specific pose and *supported* by `v20`.  
           
           I looked at the initial state and noticed all the objects are currently *supported* by `v11`, not `v20`.  To move them, I'd need to use `pick` and `place` actions.  I carefully reviewed the available actions, looking at the preconditions and effects.
           
           However, the problem specifies *only* `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is allowed.  *No* `pick` or `place` actions are available. Since the problem explicitly says that *only* the provided actions are allowed, I am forced to conclude I cannot change the `atpose` of any object.  Therefore, I cannot satisfy the goal of getting any object "on" `v20`.  Essentially, the *only* action I *can* use is a no-op that doesn't change anything relevant to the goal.
           
           The available action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` sets `canmove` to false, which further blocks me from using future *move* actions that will achieve the goal. No matter how I try, it's a dead end because the problem's constraints don't allow a solution.
