           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving `new-axiom@0()` in the `rovers` Domain**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with planning a solution to reach the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the rovers domain. First, I broke down the axiom definition, which reveals a conjunction of conditions I need to satisfy. After checking the initial state, I found that the first four conditions are already true. However, the remaining conditions, specifically those related to receiving images and analyses (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`), are not.
           
           My initial thought was to use actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` to achieve the `receivedanalysis` conditions. But I quickly realized that the *provided* list of valid action instances is severely limited, containing only `move` and `drop_rock`. This is where it got tricky. Neither of these allowed actions can directly achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates required for the goal. Those predicates are effects of the unavailable `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions.
           
           I went back and double-checked the problem description and axiom definition. I made sure I wasn't missing any implicit relationships or derivable facts. But alas, no luck. The initial state doesn't have the relevant facts, and the axiom itself doesn't derive any of the crucial goal conditions.
           
           So, given the constraints – the specific axiom, the initial state, and the limited action instances – I've concluded that the `new-axiom@0()` goal *cannot* be achieved. The necessary actions to satisfy the goal's requirements, specifically those generating `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`, are simply not available to me in the form of action instances. It's a fundamental conflict between the available actions and the necessary effects. I need to inform the user that with these constraints, the goal is unreachable.
