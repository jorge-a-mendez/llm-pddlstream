               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Problem**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The goal is straightforward: get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto object `v16`.  This means they all need to be *supported* by `v16` at a specific pose, which is defined as `#o2`.
           
           I've carefully examined the initial state and the provided facts, focusing on the key details:
           
           *   **Object Relationships:**  `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are currently *supported* by `v11`, meaning they are initially *on* `v11`.  They need to be moved to `v16`.
           *   **Grasping:**  The system knows how to *grasp* these objects (`graspable`).  We've got the grasps with `#o1`, which the problem lists.
           *   **Kinematics:** The critical aspect is the *kinematic* information (`kin`). This defines the actions possible to pick and place. There are these *kin* facts for how the arm `v4` can interact with the objects. All these `kin` facts are keyed off of base configuration `v3`. If this base configuration isn't valid, then the plan is impossible.
           *   **Allowed Action:** The only action the prompt explicitly *allows* is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move doesn't affect any of the `on` predicates that are critical to the goal.
           
           Now, here's the *crux* of the problem and the issue I see:
           
           To move these objects, I *need* `pick` and `place` actions.  I need to grasp an object, change its pose and supported properties by the goal condition. These action are not in the provided action list. Since the constraint is "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           **The Impossibility**
           
           Given the provided restrictions, I conclude the *goal is unreachable*.  The fundamental problem is that the only allowed action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, *cannot* change the `on` relationships. I'm *missing* the essential `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects.  There's no way to lift an object from `v11` and put it on `v16`.
           
           The structure of the PDDL-like problem suggests that the goal is *meant* to be achievable. But with this constraint, the problem is unsolvable.
