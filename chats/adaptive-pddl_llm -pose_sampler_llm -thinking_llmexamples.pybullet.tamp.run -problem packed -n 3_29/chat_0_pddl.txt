(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions (surf_idx, theta, x, y) for object ID 4 on surface 0. The object is essentially a square, very close to 0.081 units on a side, and the surface is a square of size 0.27, centered at (0,0).  The crucial aspect is that each placement must be fully contained within the surface.
           
           I've determined that the object's rotation (theta) significantly impacts its bounding box. For rotations of 0 or pi/2 (and multiples), the object essentially stays the same, its effective dimensions being slightly different due to the slightly different side lengths.  At pi/4 (45 degrees), the effective bounding box grows, and I need to account for this.
           
           To ensure all placements are stable, I'm focusing on a strategy that balances rotation and positional freedom. I'll need to generate a set of x, y values for each angle considered.
           
           I am using this approach to guarantee complete stability:
           1.  **Define Angles:** I am creating a set of angles spanning the valid range to include diversity.
           2.  **Calculate Effective Bounding Box:** For each angle, I will compute the effective bounding box and its half dimensions (half_W and half_H).
           3.  **Determine Valid Ranges:** With half_W and half_H, I calculate the allowable x and y ranges for each angle.
           4.  **Sampling:** I sample ten points for x and y, and then combine them for unique x,y positions at that angle.
           
           For a diverse set of valid points, i'll pick 5 angles; including `theta = 0`, `theta = pi/4`, `theta = pi/2`, `theta = 3*pi/4`, and `theta = pi`.
           
           To ensure that the object is always contained within the surface, I choose a restricted x, y range that works for all rotations.  I will take `x_sample = [-0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07]` and `y_sample = [-0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07]`.
           This restricted region will guarantee that all my 50 placements are valid.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on a given surface, while avoiding a collision with the pre-placed object ID 4.  Here's my thought process.  I've got the data: ID 5 is nearly square, about 0.09 units on each side.  The surface is a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  ID 4 sits at (-0.07, -0.07) with its own extents.
           
           The crucial part is avoiding collisions.  Object 4's AABB is centered at (-0.07, -0.07). I need to make sure I pick positions that don't overlap with this.
           
           The *worst-case* effective dimension for ID 5, if it's rotated by 45 degrees, is 0.12764.  So the center of ID 5 can't get any closer than about 0.0638 to any of the sides of the surface.  Since ID 4's AABB is roughly from -0.11 to -0.03, and the surface boundaries effectively limit my options for ID 5's center, I can't just space things out.
           
           I need a *collision avoidance strategy*. Based on the collision region for object 4, I will pick x and y coordinates that will guarantee no collision in all angles. Since the center of Object 4 is at (-0.07,-0.07), I will restrict object 5's placement to a safe region.
           
           I've determined that all placements of object 5 with x values >= 0.034307 and y values >= 0.034307 are completely safe. I can create a list of x and y values within this safe zone, and create the safe placements by varying angles and coordinates to generate 50 unique placements.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Strategy:**
           
           Okay, I need to place object 6 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects 4 and 5.  Object 6 is square-ish, and I have its dimensions and the surface boundaries.  I'm going to start by calculating the maximum effective dimensions of object 6 across all rotations to ensure it *always* fits within the surface. This means I'll use the worst-case, most conservative approach with the AABB calculation. Then, I need to figure out where I *can't* place it because of objects 4 and 5. The prompt says I need 50 stable placements, so I have to be smart here about how to efficiently search for positions and angles.
           
           **Detailed Calculations and Collision Avoidance:**
           
           First, I figured out the surface boundaries for the *center* of object 6, allowing for *any* rotation. Then I made those calculations based on the surface bounds (that sets bounds on the center of the object) combined with an approximation for how a rotating square would fit into the surface bounds.
           
           I then identified the AABB's for the existing objects. I calculated the collision regions for objects 4 and 5, based on their given positions and the worst-case rotation (which is conservative since they're not rotating, but I won't assume that for *object* 6) and determined where object 6 *can't* be placed. At this point, I discovered a crucial problem: *no* placement seemed possible because of collision with object 5.
           
           **Rethinking the Approach:**
           
           The initial collision checking was too conservative, so I had to re-evaluate what “stable” and “collision-avoidance” meant. I realized that to be more efficient, I had to treat object 6's AABB for collision and surface constraints differently for object 6, because I can pick its rotation, but object 4 and 5's rotations are *fixed*.
           
           So, my improved approach is: For object 6, I consider the *actual* (not worst-case rotated) AABB to figure out the coordinate bounds that are *collision-free* with objects 4 and 5. This lets me choose a rotation, then compute the coordinate bounds.  This strategy will *not* be as conservative when checking collision between new and existing objects, because I'm assuming that existing objects are only in their current configuration.
           
           I need a systematic way to generate valid placements. I decided to generate coordinate combinations that satisfied both surface bounds and collision avoidance for objects 4 and 5, *for specific rotations* because this is more efficient to calculate. This means I can check an *initial* set of combinations *without needing to recalculate*.
           
           **The Solution:**
           
           With these rules and interpretations, I constructed sets of positions for the object.
           I generated coordinate combinations for two orientations `theta=0` (0 degrees) and `theta=pi/2` (90 degrees). Each set of placements consisted of a combination of positions that would satisfy both surface containment and collision-free conditions.
           I chose combinations to satisfy both requirements.
           
           I will then use coordinate combinations for generating valid positions to make up the 50 placements. I made sure to organize my position generation so that it met the required stable and collision-free requirements.
           
           This approach addresses the problem by efficiently generating a diverse set of valid placements.
