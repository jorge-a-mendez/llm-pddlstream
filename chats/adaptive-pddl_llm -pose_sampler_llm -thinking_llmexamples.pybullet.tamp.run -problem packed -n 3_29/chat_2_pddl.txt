(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Relocation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is crystal clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all stacked neatly on `v16`. Currently, they're sitting pretty (or not so pretty, depending on your perspective) on `v11`. I've got the facts laid out: `v8` is supported by something, `v12` is supported by something, and `v14` is supported by something, all on `v11`.  My tools are limited, just one arm really, `v4`, and its current state is "empty".  `v6` is there but not useful here.
           
           First, I examined available actions to see if I could place objects onto v16. I can, based on the `supported` facts.  I can place objects at pose `#o2` on `v16`. 
           
           So, it's a pick-and-place game. I'll need to move each object individually. My immediate thought is to create a series of sub-goals: get `v8` on `v16`, then `v12`, and finally `v14`. This is the most logical route.
           
           Let's begin with `v8`. To move `v8`, I'll need to use the `pick` action to grasp the object and then `place` it. The preconditions for `place` look solid; as long as the robot can move, is grasping, and is clear, and the position is safe, I'm good.  So I'll need to be in the correct `atbconf`, which is `#o3`. Then `pick v8`, then `place v8`.  
           
           The plan must have these steps:
           1.  Move Base to `#o3`,  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           2.  Pick `v8`.
           3.  Place `v8`.
           4.  Pick `v12`.
           5.  Place `v12`.
           6.  Pick `v14`.
           7.  Place `v14`.
           
           The robot has to move from position `v3` to get to `#o3`. After that, it is smooth sailing.
           
           I ran a quick check, and everything appears safe. No unsafe poses, no unsafe trajectories.  The preconditions should be met.  The facts confirm my approach:  the necessary kinematics are available.  The robot is handempty before picking, the poses are valid. The move base ensures correct configuration. All good.
           
           This is a pretty straightforward plan:  move base, pick and place for each object. The goal is met when `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` are all true, which will be the case after `place v14`.  I've checked the action instances.
           
           It's a go! This strategy should work, given the available actions and current state. Let's execute!
