(Thoughts: **50 Stable Object Placements on a Surface**
           
           Okay, here's the plan: I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) that's a square, measuring 0.0767... by 0.0767... units, on a square surface (surface 0) that's -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           First, I need to figure out the effective AABB dimensions of the object as it's rotated.  Since it's a square, I know I only need to consider rotations from 0 to pi/2 (or rather, a bit more than that). The rotation doesn't change the bounds in increments of pi/2. I'll need to figure the actual dimensions using `obj_half_s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'm calculating the effective object half-extents.
           
           I'm starting with a list of ten `theta` values, ranging from 0 to pi, evenly spaced to generate diverse rotation values, i.e., different bounding box sizes.  For each theta, I have a specific range within which the object's center can sit, calculated by accounting for the rotated object's bounding box and the surface boundaries.
           
           I've calculated a range of 5 x and y coordinates for each rotation, and those values will be paired and added to a list for each of the 5 rotations. Then a list of 5 (x,y) pairs will be added to the output list.  Since my calculation has a specific period for the bounds, I've confirmed that using `theta_0 = 0` leads to a range -0.096... to 0.096.... And all the other values will vary based on this baseline!
           
           I've got the ranges, I've got the rotation angles, and I've got the math for a stable placement. Now it's just a matter of combining them and outputting the results as a list of 50 tuples (surface_idx, theta, x, y) which fulfills the original task.

(Thoughts: **Analysis and Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating that one placement worked for object ID 4. I need to remember its position, (-0.0966, -0.0966), to avoid collisions with the new object, ID 5. This object has dimensions of approximately 0.0987, so let's treat it as a square with a side of 0.0987. Since object 4 is already placed at the bottom-left corner of the surface 0, touching its boundaries.
           
           My task is to find 50 valid placements (x,y,theta) for object 5 on surface 0 while ensuring no collision with object 4, or fixed obstacles, within the provided constraints.
           
           First, I define my bounding box calculations with the following:
           *   AABB = Axis Aligned Bounding Box
           *   I will be using `he` for half of the object extent. `he_x` and `he_y` in the x and y directions when considering rotations.
           
           I'm calculating the effective half-extents of object 5 based on its angle. I'll be using this value to calculate a non-colliding "valid region" for placing object 5. My current surface bounds are `[-0.135, 0.135]` in both dimensions. The valid range for x and y placement is surface bounded.
           The dimensions of AABB4 are `[(-0.135, -0.135), (-0.05828, -0.05828)]` which is the bottom-left of my coordinate plane.
           
           I am setting `theta = 0` as my baseline and defining candidate points based on the bounding region of the new object. I will pick 5 points to start with, calculate an AABB and see if collision occurs with the earlier object. To avoid collision, I need to check if one of the object's planes crosses past the AABB limits. 
           
           I've learned from prior calculations that a collision happens. For example, the `(0,0)` point where both X and Y overlap with my prior placement. However, it's easy to correct this in my algorithm by simply shifting the point.
           
           The new point will need to ensure that it has no overlap with the AABB4, in which either `x - he_x >= AABB4_ux` or `y - he_y >= AABB4_uy`.
           
           To ensure proper coverage across various rotations, I'll need to run this procedure across 10 different angles for each of these calculated points.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding 50 Stable Positions**
           
           I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID 6) onto a surface (Surface 0) while avoiding collisions with two existing, fixed obstacles (Objects 4 and 5).  My goal is to find 50 stable placements, which I interpret as 50 unique, non-overlapping positions, across a range of rotations.
           
           First, I analyze the scene geometry. Surface 0 is a square, and I have the AABBs for Object 4 and Object 5. I calculate the AABB's for both, taking into account the object's extents and locations. I also determine that object 6 is a square, which I note since I need that.
           
           The key is preventing collisions. I'll take a grid-based approach. For Object 6, I'll calculate the rotation and extent of the square. I need to make sure the placement points are inside the surface, and outside of O4 and O5 by running a check with AABB ranges. The new object will have a rotation, so I need to rotate its AABB accordingly. I'm going to run ten rotations.
           
           My initial strategy will generate a comprehensive set of candidate placements. For each rotation, I'll systematically explore points within the surface, filtering out those that collide with the fixed objects. I use a grid approach, picking points far from the obstacles first, and refining this if needed. I prioritize positions on the edges and corners to maximize space.
           
           In short, I'll generate a list of 50 stable placements, and this includes accounting for rotation and the fixed obstacles.
