User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Deadlock Analysis**
           
           My objective is to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a specific type (v17) "on" another object (v18).  Specifically, I need to find an object, which I'll call `?green`, that meets both the `on` and `type` criteria.  I see that both `v12` and `v8` fit the `type` requirement (they are both of type `v17`), so the issue boils down to achieving either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           Digging deeper into the `on` axiom, I see that it means that something is "on" another object if it is `supported` by that object, and the first object is `atpose` with the specified object.  Both `v12` and `v8` are already supported by `v18` (`supported(v12, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` are true).  The problem lies in manipulating the `atpose` facts.  For `v12` to be on `v18`, I need `atpose(v12, #o2)`, but currently, `v12` is `atpose(v12, v13)`.  Similarly, for `v8`, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)`, but `v8` is currently `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           
           However, the action space is limited. The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, a no-op that just moves the robot base from and to the same location, and doesn't affect the object positions. Crucially, I have *no* `pick` or `place` action instances available. Without those, I'm stuck: I have no way to alter the `atpose` facts, and thus, no way to change the `on` facts.
           
           Given the current state and available actions, neither `on(v12, v18)` nor `on(v8, v18)` is true, nor is there any path to make them true.  Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable.  This is a case of a deadlock resulting from the inability to manipulate objects to achieve the desired configuration.
