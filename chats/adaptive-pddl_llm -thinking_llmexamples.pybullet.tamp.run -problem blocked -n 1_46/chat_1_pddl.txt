           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unachievable Due to Base Configuration Mismatch**
           
           Okay, here's my analysis: The goal is `on(?green, v18)`.  This means I need to get either `v12` or `v8` (both have the correct `type`) onto `v18`. To do that, I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions, because those actions are defined in terms of `kinematics`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see that currently `v12` is at `v13`. I'll need to define a plan to pick up either `v12` or `v8` and place it on `v18`. The `kin` facts specify that, in order to perform these actions, the robot needs to be in base config `#o3`. I can't move to that base configuration with the given actions.  The robot is currently at base configuration `v3`. The only available `move_base` action doesn't change the base configuration to `#o3`.
           
           The initial plan I considered was:
           1. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (pick up `v12`)
           2. `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (place `v12` on `v18` at `#o2`)
           However, the `atbconf(#o3)` precondition in both `pick` and `place` is not true.
           
           Since the robot can't reach the required base configuration (`#o3`), any plan involving picking up an object and placing it on `v18` cannot be executed. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the current state and available actions.
