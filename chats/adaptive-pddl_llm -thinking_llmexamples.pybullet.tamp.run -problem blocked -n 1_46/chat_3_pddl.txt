           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to having two conditions met: an object `?green` must be *on* `v18` and have type `v17`.  I quickly scan the initial state and see that `v12` and `v8` are both candidates for `?green` because they have the correct type. Since the `on` predicate is itself an axiom, that tells me I need to find some *supported* pose for my chosen object.
           
           Given that, I can move `v12` or `v8` to `o2`.  Either object is supported on `v18` when at `#o2`. I'll focus on getting `v12` to `#o2`.
           
           So here's the game plan:  get `v12` to `#o2`.
             1.  First, the robot needs to move its base to a configuration where it can pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`. I'll use `(move_base v3 #q0 #t1)`. That should get the robot near `v12`.
             2.  Then, I'll use `(pick v4 v12 v13 #g0 #q0 #t0)` to grasp `v12`.  Preconditions check out. The crucial bit here is knowing the robot needs to be *at* `#q0` to pick `v12` from `v13`.
             3.  Next, the robot needs to be at a configuration that can support the place operation.  I'll use `(move_base #q0 #o3 #o0)`. This should position the robot near the correct object.
             4.  Finally, I'll use `(place v4 v12 #o2 #g0 #o3 #o4)` to place `v12` at `#o2`.  This is the final move.  The placement should satisfy the `on(v12, v18)` predicate.
           
           After placing `v12`, the conditions for `new-axiom@0()` should be satisfied. `v12` will be *on* `v18` and its type is `v17`.
           
           I'm confident this plan works.  It covers the necessary steps to manipulate the objects and reach the goal state.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing and Addressing a Planning Failure**
           
           The initial plan failed to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires satisfying `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. My analysis points to a possible issue in satisfying the `on` predicate. I hypothesized that I was misinterpreting the interaction with the `~unsafepose`, `~unsafeapproach`, and `~unsafeatraj` predicates, or, the continuous parameters that are part of the process.
           
           My original plan focused on moving object `v12` to `#o2`. My reasoning was as follows: I knew `type(v12, v17)` was already true in the initial state. Since `on(?o, ?r)` depends on `atpose(?o, ?p)` and `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)`, if I placed `v12` at `#o2` (which is supported by the initial fact `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`), then I would satisfy `on(v12, v18)`, thus achieving the goal.
           
           However, the plan failed, so I re-evaluated. The problem stated that multiple instances of `new-axiom@0()` being defined, meant this was a *specific* instance of achieving `on(?green, v18)` with `?green` being of type `v17`. After revisiting the axioms, I decided to focus on using `v8`, because `type(v8, v17)` is known from the initial state, and I could place it at `#o2` so that it would be *supported* on `v18`.
           
           My alternative plan:
           1.  Move the base robot from location `v3` to configuration `#o3`.
           2.  Pick up `v8` from `v9`.
           3.  Place `v8` at `#o2`.
           
           This would establish `atpose(v8, #o2)` and thus `on(v8, v18)`, satisfying the goal. My analysis strongly suggests that this plan is valid given the provided PDDL and initial state. I am proceeding under the assumption that the implicit constraints and facts are correctly interpreted.
