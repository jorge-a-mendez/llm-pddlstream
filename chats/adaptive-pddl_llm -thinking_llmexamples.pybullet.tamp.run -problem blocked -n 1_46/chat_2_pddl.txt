(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my line of thinking to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, given the available actions and initial state.  The key is to satisfy the conjunction: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           First, I looked at the known `type` axioms, which immediately tells me that our `?green` variable could be either `v12` or `v8`. Then, I have to figure out how to make *one* of those objects be on top of `v18`. From the axiom `on(?o, ?r)`, it boils down to: ensuring an object (`v12` or `v8`) is supported by `v18` at some pose (and that we can move it there).
           
           The initial state reveals that `v12` and `v8` are *already* supported by `v18`, but at different poses; to achieve the `on` predicate, I have to *move* one of them to its support.  Analyzing the initial positions, neither is currently at the supported pose, and the available `pick` and `place` actions suggest manipulation is the way to move things around.
           
           Since I have a `supported` fact for both `v12` and `v8`, I choose `v12` as the object to target and determine what actions are needed.
           
           The plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  The `pick` action has a precondition, `atbconf(#o3)`, which isn't true in the initial state.  Therefore, I'll move the base with the action: `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`.
           
           2.  **Pick:**  Now that `atbconf(#o3)` is true, I can attempt to *pick* `v12`.  From the possible actions, I choose `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`, and check the preconditions. This pick action does not make the assumption of any unsafe configurations, so it should be fine.
           
           3.  **Place:** After picking up `v12`, I need to *place* it.  `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is given as true in the initial state.  Therefore, I use the action `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           With this plan, the post conditions will show that the goal is achieved. This plan will yield the correct preconditions to satisfy the conditions of the goal `new-axiom@0()`. After the placement, and given all the facts available, the axiom will be true.
