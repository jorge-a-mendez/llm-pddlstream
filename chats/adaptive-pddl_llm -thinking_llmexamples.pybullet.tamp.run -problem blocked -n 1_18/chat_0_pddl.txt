           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom arm(v6)

           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)

           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachability**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` be "on" `v18`. From the initial state, I know that `v12` and `v8` are candidates because they have the correct `type`. To be "on" something, using the definition of `on`, it needs to be both `supported` by that object *and* be at a particular pose, defined by `atpose`.
           
           Currently, neither `v12` nor `v8` meet this criteria. I need to get either of them to a pose such that they are `supported` by `v18` and then confirm their current `atpose` matches the previous condition. Looking at the current state, `v12` is at `v13`, and `v8` is at `v9`. They are both supported by `#o2` which is itself supported by `v18`. However, `v13` supports `v14` for `v12` and `v9` supports `v11` for `v8`.
           
           The problem is, the only available action is `move_base`. This action only deals with robot base configurations and cannot manipulate any object.
           
           Clearly, I need `pick` and `place` actions to move either `v12` or `v8` and make them meet the conditions. These are clearly missing. The `clean` and `cook` actions are irrelevant.
           
           Therefore, because my tools are limited to only a `move_base` action, and this will not suffice for moving an object to make it be "on" something else, this goal state is unreachable with the current available actions.
