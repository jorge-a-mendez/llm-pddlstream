(Thoughts: **Understanding and Implementing Stable Object Placements**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (0.07m x 0.07m) on a square surface defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)) – Surface 0. A stable placement means the object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface's bounding box. Each placement needs to be specified as (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where theta is the rotation angle and (x, y) is the center of the object's AABB.
           
           Since the object is a square, the effective width and height after rotation are equal, and can be calculated using  `dim_rot = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The maximum rotated size occurs at 45 degrees (pi/4) and is approximately 0.099m, and the minimum size is 0.07m at 0 degrees and 90 degrees. The surface is a 0.6m x 0.6m square. Since this can be handled easily,  the valid x and y ranges are:
           
           *   `x_min_valid = 4.2 + dim_rot / 2`
           *   `x_max_valid = 4.8 - dim_rot / 2`
           *   `y_min_valid = -0.6 + dim_rot / 2`
           *   `y_max_valid = 0.0 - dim_rot / 2`
           
           Given 50 placements are needed, I've adopted a strategy of considering 10 equally spaced angles from 0 to pi (covering all needed orientations due to symmetry of a square object), and calculating 5 (x, y) coordinates for each. The angles chosen are 0, pi/10, 2pi/10,...9pi/10.  For a given theta, I generate x and y ranges.
           
           The x and y values are calculated by evenly distributing positions in the available area.
           The valid (x,y) locations include a corner, center, top/bottom corners (and mirror image to fully utilize the rectangular surface in all axes with the rotated and non-rotated AABB's).
           This leads to 10 angles * 5 (x, y) positions, which results in the required 50 placements, evenly distributed over rotations.
           
           Here's the algorithm, implemented in Python:
           *   Calculate the dimension `dim_rot` of rotated AABB for each angle theta.
           *   Calculate the x and y coordinate range.
           *   Get points based on calculations to fit.
           *   Print the result as list of tuples (0, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Refined Approach to Object Placement for Surface Containment**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've pinpointed the issue with the previous placement calculations, particularly for rotated objects. It seems my initial method for determining the valid center coordinates, especially concerning the rotation-adjusted dimensions, was slightly off, leading to placements that barely clipped outside the surface's boundary due to floating-point precision limitations.
           
           To address this, I'm going to revise the approach. First, I'll calculate the rotated width and height (`rot_w`, `rot_h`) of the object, taking into account its original dimensions and rotation angle (`theta`). For a square object, these will be equal, but I'll maintain separate calculations for robustness.
           
           Next, I'll calculate the *valid* range of center coordinates, accounting for the rotated dimensions.  I'll ensure the object's boundaries, when rotated, stay within the surface's AABB.  To guarantee this, I'll introduce a small, positive margin (a tiny `epsilon`, specifically `1e-7`) to the boundary calculations.  This effectively shrinks the "available" space within the surface, creating a buffer that prevents those pesky boundary-crossing errors.  I am thinking a much more robust calculation of `center_x >= surf_min_x + dim_rot_w / 2 + 1e-7`,  `center_x <= surf_max_x - dim_rot_w / 2 - 1e-7` will be enough. I'll do similar logic for the `y` dimension.
           
           I will need to loop through the 10 angles for the rotation and vary the position with the adjusted center boundaries. I will pick five coordinate pairs for each rotation: one at the min point for both dimensions, another at the max point for both dimensions, one in the middle, and one at the min/max or max/min points.
           
           For the specific request involving Object ID 10 on Surface 0, the object's almost square shape simplifies the rotation dimension calculations. However, I'll still adhere to the slightly more complicated but more robust approach of calculating `rot_w` and `rot_h` separately. This will be more future proof as I could have objects that are not square. I will then ensure each placement point is *strictly* contained within the surface's boundaries, and I'll use the margins.
           
           My primary goal with this revision is to achieve *stable* and *guaranteed* containment of the rotated bounding box within the surface AABB.
