(Thoughts: **Initial Thoughts on Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I need to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on surface 0. This surface is a square itself, extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). The object's side length is 0.08783483062921338. First things first, I'll need to calculate the object's half-size to determine the valid area for its center within the surface. The half-size is half of that, which gives me approximately 0.04391741531460669.
           
           Since I'm working with a square, the orientation won't affect the size of the bounding box. The center of the square needs to be at least the half-size away from the surface edges. This results in a smaller square area, within [-0.09108258468539331, 0.09108258468539331] in both X and Y. I'll refer to that value as `L`. This means I need to place the square's center within that range.  I have to ensure that all 50 placements are stable (i.e. not out of bounds) on the surface, regardless of the angle.
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           To achieve this, I'll use a systematic approach, I'll generate the placement coordinates in a 5x5 grid. That will give me 25 points, and then I'll use those points at two different theta angles to increase the variety. I'll use 0 degrees for half of the points and 90 degrees (pi/2 radians) for the other half, so a 50/50 split.
           I'll space the grid points evenly. 
           
           **Calculation Details and Output**
           
           I will now create two sets of x and y coordinates that will use the variable `L`.
           
           x coords: [-L, -L/2, 0, L/2, L]
           y coords: [-L, -L/2, 0, L/2, L]
           
           The final list of placements will look something like this: (surface_index, theta, x, y).
           Where surface_index will be 0, and each of the 25 points from the grid will be associated with either a 0 or a pi/2 for the value of theta.
           
           **Resulting Placements**
           The final placements are as follows:
           (0, 0.0, -0.09108258468539331, -0.09108258468539331)

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that the previous object placement was successful. Now, I need to place a new square object (ID 4) on the same surface (surface 0). Its side length is 0.0988, so its half-side is roughly 0.0494.  Surface 0 is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I've calculated the valid region where I can place the center of the new object on surface 0, taking its half-side length into consideration.  This gives me a valid range of approximately  `-0.0856` to `0.0856` for both the x and y coordinates of the object's center.
           
           The tricky part is that I need to avoid collision with the previously placed object (ID 5). Object 5 is centered at about (-0.091, -0.091) and has a side length of approximately 0.088, which gives a half-side of 0.0439.
           
           To avoid collision, the distance between the centers of object 4 and object 5 must be greater than the sum of their half-side lengths (approximately 0.0933). Because the current object position is negative in X and Y, and object 5's position is close to that, the safe placements are either when object 4 is placed such that its center x-coordinate is greater than 0.002237 or its center y-coordinate is greater than 0.002237. These avoid the collision region.
           
           To find 50 diverse placements, I can divide the surface and generate these placements. I will generate positions, primarily those meeting `x >= 0.002237` or `y >= 0.002237`, but also using a strategy such that points are guaranteed to not collide.  Then use 50 distinct positions from these sets.
           
           I am using a 9x9 grid across the surface to get 81 total points, which guarantees that all values are valid because the object won't collide with the surface limits nor object 5.
           I have also made sure half the positions have a `theta=0` and half have a `theta=pi/2` to add some diversity, without affecting the collision check or placement.

(Thoughts: **1. Understanding the Problem:** My goal is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 6) on a surface (surface 0), ensuring it fits within the surface's boundaries and doesn't collide with two other objects (IDs 5 and 4) already placed.
           
           **2. Surface 0 and Object 6 Details:** Surface 0 is a square region. Object 6 is also a square, with dimensions determined. I've calculated the half-size of Object 6 for collision checks.
           
           **3.  Valid Placement Area (Initially):**  Without considering other objects, Object 6's center can be placed anywhere within a smaller square region inside the surface bounds, defined by subtracting the object's half-size from the surface boundaries.
           
           **4.  Analyzing Existing Object Placements:** I have details on the location and size of Objects 5 and 4, specifically their center coordinates and half-sizes.  These are critical for collision detection. I will focus on a strict AABB.
           
           **5.  Collision Avoidance Strategy:** My primary method for determining if an Object 6 center location is valid relies on computing and checking two  AABB overlap conditions. I first consider all valid positions, and then, based on the coordinates of object 5 and object 4, the size of object 6, I compute the bounds for each collision scenario. I consider an object's center to collide if the computed coordinates of the new object's center is greater than the collision box. This generates a set of AABB collision boxes, and an object will collide if its center coordinate falls inside the collision boxes.
           
           **6. Calculating Restricted Collision AABB Bounds:** Next I convert the general rules, based on the size and location of the placed objects, into a more restricted collision detection rule set. I do this by intersecting the general AABB collision zone coordinates with the Surface 0 bounds. This is to avoid checking coordinates for validity that are already outside of the valid surface boundaries.
           
           **7. Grid and Validation:** I created a grid of potential locations for Object 6's center within Surface 0. For each candidate point, I checked if it's within surface bounds and if it avoids collision with Objects 5 and 4, by checking if the coordinate values intersect with either collision zone (restricted AABB bounds).
           
           **8. Generating Final Placements:**  I found the set of valid center points for object 6 placement. Then, finally, to achieve variability, I included an alternating rotation with `0` radians and `pi/2` radians. This gives a list of 50 unique placements for Object 6, ensuring each is within the surface boundaries and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I need to place this new object, ID 7, a whopping 50 times, stable as can be, on surface 0.  I've got a square surface, which is good.  It's size: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  The object itself, with dimensions close enough to be square `(size_x = 0.0974351293999916`, `size_y = 0.09743512939999155`)`, means rotation doesn't matter too much for my calculations here. I've already calculated half its size for AABB calculations.  `obj7_half_size = 0.0487175646999958`.
           
           First things first, I've got to define the *safe zone* within the bounds of surface 0.  That means the center of Object 7 must be within the region `-L7, L7` which is approx. `-0.086282, 0.086282`.
           
           Next, the *fun* part. Avoid collisions with the three other objects already on the surface - IDs 5, 4, and 6. I've carefully calculated the forbidden AABBs for Object 7's center based on each of those objects using the sum of their half-sizes and their centers.  The forbidden boxes, in the format `(x_min, x_max)` and `(y_min, y_max)`, are as follows:
           
           -   Object 5: `x in [-0.086282, 0.001552]`, `y in [-0.086282, 0.001552]`
           -   Object 4: `x in [-0.076720, 0.086282]`, `y in [-0.086282, 0.012521]`
           -   Object 6: `x in [-0.086282, -0.003326]`, `y in [-0.082315, 0.086282]`
           
           Now comes the *placement* strategy.  I'll set up a 10x10 grid of potential center points for Object 7, with the step size of `0.019173874511112044`. I'll generate the x, y coordinates as follows:
           `x_coords = [-0.086, -0.067, -0.048, -0.029, -0.010, 0.009, 0.028, 0.047, 0.066, 0.086]`
           `y_coords = [-0.086, -0.067, -0.048, -0.029, -0.010, 0.009, 0.028, 0.047, 0.066, 0.086]`
           
           For each point on the grid, I'll *check for collisions*.  If the center falls within *any* of the forbidden boxes, it's a no-go.  I'll implement a `check_collision` function for the specific logic to handle that. Finally, I'll alternate `theta` between 0 and pi/2 to ensure a diverse set of placements and meet the project goal.

Model:     **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I need to place this new object, ID 7, a whopping 50 times, stable as can be, on surface 0.  I've got a square surface, which is good.  It's size: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  The object itself, with dimensions close enough to be square `(size_x = 0.0974351293999916`, `size_y = 0.09743512939999155`)`, means rotation doesn't matter too much for my calculations here. I've already calculated half its size for AABB calculations.  `obj7_half_size = 0.0487175646999958`.
           
           First things first, I've got to define the *safe zone* within the bounds of surface 0.  That means the center of Object 7 must be within the region `-L7, L7` which is approx. `-0.086282, 0.086282`.
           
           Next, the *fun* part. Avoid collisions with the three other objects already on the surface - IDs 5, 4, and 6. I've carefully calculated the forbidden AABBs for Object 7's center based on each of those objects using the sum of their half-sizes and their centers.  The forbidden boxes, in the format `(x_min, x_max)` and `(y_min, y_max)`, are as follows:
           
           -   Object 5: `x in [-0.086282, 0.001552]`, `y in [-0.086282, 0.001552]`
           -   Object 4: `x in [-0.076720, 0.086282]`, `y in [-0.086282, 0.012521]`
           -   Object 6: `x in [-0.086282, -0.003326]`, `y in [-0.082315, 0.086282]`
           
           Now comes the *placement* strategy.  I'll set up a 10x10 grid of potential center points for Object 7, with the step size of `0.019173874511112044`. I'll generate the x, y coordinates as follows:
           `x_coords = [-0.086, -0.067, -0.048, -0.029, -0.010, 0.009, 0.028, 0.047, 0.066, 0.086]`
           `y_coords = [-0.086, -0.067, -0.048, -0.029, -0.010, 0.009, 0.028, 0.047, 0.066, 0.086]`
           
           For each point on the grid, I'll *check for collisions*.  If the center falls within *any* of the forbidden boxes, it's a no-go.  I'll implement a `check_collision` function for the specific logic to handle that. Finally, I'll alternate `theta` between 0 and pi/2 to ensure a diverse set of placements and meet the project goal.
