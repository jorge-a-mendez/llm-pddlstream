(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a 0.07 x 0.07 object on surface 0, which is defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A stable placement means the object is fully contained within the surface boundaries. Right now, I'm only dealing with surface boundaries because I don't have collision data for obstacles or other placed objects yet.
           
           Since the object is a square, I know that at any rotation angle, the dimensions of the bounding box will always be equal, but the specific sizes will vary. I need to consider how the rotation affects the AABB size. I'll use the AABB and not worry about the exact shape to do containment checks and simplify the process.
           
           I've determined that the relevant factors for stability are: `surf_idx`, `theta`, `x`, and `y`.
           
           To tackle this, my plan is:
           1.  **Define the object's half extents** when unrotated (`hx = hy = 0.035`) and for rotated case (`rotated_hx`, `rotated_hy`).
           2.  **Calculate the valid ranges** for `x` and `y` coordinates for different rotation angles, ensuring the rotated object stays inside the surface boundaries.
           3.  **Generate a set of placements**, varying both `x`, `y`, and `theta`.
           
           To start, I've chosen to consider the angles `0` and `pi/4` because they represent the minimum and maximum bounding box dimensions, respectively, for this square object. This will give a good idea of the range I have to work with.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the calculation is straightforward. The valid `x` range is [4.235, 4.765] and the `y` range is [-0.565, -0.035]. I'll need to generate a grid of points within these ranges. I did the math and determined that with a grid of 5 points in each dimension (x and y), I will get 25 placements.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, where the bounding box is enlarged, the valid range becomes tighter. The valid x-range becomes [4.249497, 4.750503] and the y-range [-0.550503, -0.049497]. I applied the same approach to divide that x-y space into a grid of 25 placements.
           
           To generate a diverse set of 50 placements, I'll take both sets of 25 that were computed using `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/4`.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a new object placement task: finding 50 stable placements for object ID 10 on surface 0.  Importantly, I note that the feedback about object ID 5's placements doesn't influence this task. It's a clean slate.
           
           The object's dimensions are almost identical in X and Y, approximately 0.09895665.  I'll treat it as a square with that side length, `size`.  Surface 0 is defined as `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  As with previous placements, I'll leverage a grid-based approach, varying x, y, and theta to generate a range of candidate locations.
           
           Since `size_x` and `size_y` are close enough, I can simplify calculations.  My strategy will be to use two rotation angles: 0 degrees and pi/4 radians (45 degrees).
           
           For the 0-degree rotation, the object's half-extents (`rotated_hx`, `rotated_hy`) are simply `size / 2`, or approximately 0.049478325.  This simplifies the valid range calculations.  The valid x range is then `4.2 + 0.049478325 <= x <= 4.8 - 0.049478325`, or `4.249478325 <= x <= 4.750521675`.  The y range is `-0.6 + 0.049478325 <= y <= 0.0 - 0.049478325`, or `-0.550521675 <= y <= -0.049478325`. I calculate the step sizes for a 5x5 grid.
           
           For a pi/4 rotation, I calculate the rotated size to be `size * sqrt(2)`. The rotated half-extents will also need to be recalculated. Calculating the bounding box will determine the valid x range which is `4.2699739 <= x <= 4.7300261`, and the y range of `-0.5300261 <= y <= -0.0699739`. Again, I'll divide the ranges to derive the step sizes to use for the second 5x5 grid.
           
           I will then generate the fifty placements based on the above calculations.
