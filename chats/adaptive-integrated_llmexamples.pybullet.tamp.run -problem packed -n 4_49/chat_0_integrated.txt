           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.058, -0.518), (0.146, -0.43)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.236, 0.203, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.872, 0.49).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.014, -0.317), (0.107, -0.223)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.231, -0.364, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.898, -0.44).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.102, -0.474, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.148, 0.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.06, -0.27, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.848, 0.53).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.284, 0.155), (-0.188, 0.251)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.182, -0.413), (0.28, -0.315)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal is to place all objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) on object v18. Currently, all objects are supported by v11. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which just moves the robot from `v3` to `v3`. This action changes `canmove()` to false. Since the robot must pick and place the objects, and the available actions only allow it to move to its current base configuration, no objects can be manipulated. Since no pick or place actions are available, the goal is unreachable.
