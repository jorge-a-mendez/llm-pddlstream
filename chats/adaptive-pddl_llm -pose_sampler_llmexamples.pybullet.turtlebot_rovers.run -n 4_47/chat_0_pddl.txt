User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.0 0.0). I need to find 3 robot base positions within a 2-unit radius of this point, avoiding the numerous obstacles. The obstacles define a complex environment. Obstacles 0-4 define the outer boundaries of the environment. Obstacle 5 is a long, thin rectangle along the y-axis at x=0, effectively splitting the environment into two halves. There are several smaller obstacles, including 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22, scattered throughout the environment. Given the central target point, the area around (0,0) is highly restricted by obstacle 5. I will explore positions in both the positive and negative x regions, keeping in mind the other obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 1.0)
           (-1.0 1.0)
           (1.0 -1.0)

Model:     The target point is (0.0 0.0). I am looking for 3 robot base positions within a 2-unit radius of this point. My previous choices (1.0 1.0), (-1.0 1.0), and (1.0 -1.0) appear to have failed. This suggests that there might be unmodeled obstacles or occlusions in those general directions. Given obstacle 5 at x=0, which divides the space, I need to consider positions carefully. The failure of (1.0 1.0) and (1.0 -1.0) suggests potential issues in the right half of the workspace, and (-1.0 1.0) in the left half. I will try to place the robot closer to the x-axis or further from the center but still within the max range. I will try to use positions in the negative x region and positive x region, trying to avoid the upper and lower quadrants where the previous positions failed.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.0 -1.0)
           (1.5 0.0)
           (-1.5 0.0)
