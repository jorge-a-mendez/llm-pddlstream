(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) on a given surface. The object is a square with side 0.0931589075753754, and the surface is a square AABB defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Stability means the object must be fully contained within the surface.
           
           First, I calculate the object's effective AABB half-extents after rotation, `h_eff`. For a square rotated by `theta`, `h_eff` is  `0.0931589075753754 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))) / 2`. The maximum value of this term happens at pi/4, with a value of `0.065874296`. Since this is less than half the surface width (0.135), the object *always* fits.
           
           I determine the valid range for the center coordinates (x,y) of the object for each rotation angle `theta`. `x` and `y` must be within `[-0.135 + h_eff, 0.135 - h_eff]`.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll use 10 different rotation angles, spaced from 0 to pi, and, for each angle, calculate the valid center range.  For each angle, I will create a 3x3 grid of placements within this range, giving 9 possible (x, y) combinations. I will repeat until I have 50 unique placements (surface id, rotation, x center, y center). The results will be:
           `(<surf_idx_1>, <theta_1, <x_1>, <y_1>)`
           No comments, no bolding, no italics, just the raw output.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placements for Object 4, Avoiding Object 7**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to find 50 *stable* positions for this new square object (ID 4) on a surface where another square object (ID 7) is already placed. I've already confirmed object 7's placement, and now I need to figure out where to put object 4 without them overlapping.
           
           First, I looked at the surface and the size of object 4. I quickly determined that it *can* fit on the surface no matter the rotation. So that's good.
           
           Object 7 is in the bottom-left corner of the available surface, with its bottom-left coordinate at `(-0.135, -0.135)`. Its extent is represented by the range `(-0.135, -0.0418410924246246)`.
           
           To avoid any collisions, I'll need to make sure object 4 is *not* overlapping the object 7's AABB. I am going to focus on placing object 4 entirely to the right or entirely above the existing object 7.
           
           To do this, I'll generate a grid of positions. I'll rotate the object at a few angles (ten rotations from 0 to pi). For each rotation, I'll choose some x and y positions in the surface.  I'll then be checking whether it is colliding or not. By placing it to the right or above in this way, I'm confident there won't be collisions, due to the square shapes.
           
           The final result will be 50 unique placements that will be good to go.

(Thoughts: **Scene Understanding and Placement Strategy for Object ID 8**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable and collision-free locations for the new object (ID: 8) on surface 0, while respecting existing objects' positions.
           
           **Understanding the Scene:**
           
           Surface 0 has an effective area of `[(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)]`. Previously placed objects (ID 7 and ID 4) are currently taking up space. It is essential to understand their occupied area and prevent new objects from overlapping.
           
           **Object AABB Details:**
           -   Object 7: Square of size `0.0931589075753754 x 0.0931589075753754` with a placement that effectively occupies `[-0.135, -0.041841] x [-0.135, -0.041841]`.
           -   Object 4: Also square with dimensions `0.09774229798611167 x 0.09774229798611173`, its position implies an occupied area of `[-0.041842, 0.055900] x [-0.135, -0.037258]`.
           
           There is a slight overlap in the X-axis between both objects.
           
           **My Plan:**
           
           Given these objects' current placements, to provide robust placement solution, I will avoid this overlap by focusing on general collision checks of each generated candidate.
           
           1.  **Calculate the Effective Half-Size for ID 8:**  I will calculate for each proposed rotation using the object's width, the effective half-size, `h_eff`,  will be calculated considering the object's area and rotation and must be factored into the AABB dimensions.
           2.  **Explicit Collision Check with AABBs:** For each placement proposed, I will compare its generated AABB with the AABB of the occupied regions. Any location which overlaps will be discarded.
           
           3.  **Region Generation using a Dense Grid:** I'll establish a dense grid of candidate placements on the available surface area, excluding regions occupied by objects 7 and 4. This is a robust approach. With enough candidates I will have 50 unique stable placements for object ID 8 without collisions.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for this new object (ID 5) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects 7, 4, and 8. The approach I'm taking is a solid and efficient one. First, I know the surface bounds, which are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've already determined the AABBs for the existing objects and their placements.
           
           The key here is to accurately calculate the AABBs and ensure the new object doesn't intersect with those. To do that, I'll iterate through different `theta` values (rotations) for the new object. For each `theta`, I calculate `h_eff5`, the effective half-size of object 5, which determines the area it occupies. This value varies based on the rotation.
           
           Next, I'll calculate valid ranges for the `x` and `y` center coordinates of the new object, making sure it stays completely within the surface boundaries. Then, I'll create a grid of potential placements within those ranges.  
           
           For each potential placement, I'll calculate the new object's AABB. After that, I run it through a collision check against the existing objects' AABBs to ensure there's no overlap. If there's no collision, the placement is valid and it's added to my list.
           
           I'm using a fairly simple and efficient collision check function that rapidly determines if AABBs overlap. The strategy will yield a large amount of placements which I will pick from. I'm using a strategy to iterate through a set of angles, followed by a grid of positions for each angle, and am confident that this approach will find the 50 distinct, stable placements I need.

(Thoughts: **Scene Analysis and Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of object ID 6 onto surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with the four pre-existing objects: IDs 7, 4, 8, and 5. This surface is a square with an edge length of 0.27, centered at the origin.
           
           First, I've got to understand the occupied space. I calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each pre-placed object, taking into account their positions and sizes. These AABBs define the regions I absolutely need to steer clear of. I've also noted that my new object, ID 6, is a square with a known size, which affects its effective bounding box depending on its rotation.
           
           The key is going to be a systematic approach. I'll iterate through a set of rotation angles for object 6, and for each angle, I'll calculate the *effective* half-extent of the object (which changes with the rotation). Based on this half-extent and the surface dimensions, I can determine the valid area within which the center of my new object can be placed without extending beyond the surface boundary.
           
           I'll generate a grid of potential center points within this valid area, densely sampling the space. Then, for each potential placement, I'll calculate the corresponding AABB for object 6, given its rotation and center coordinates. Finally, the crucial step: I'll check for any overlap (collision) between this new AABB and the AABBs of all the pre-existing objects.  If there's no collision, this placement is valid and I'll add it to my list. I will keep generating placements and check against this list for duplicates until I find 50 stable, collision-free positions.

           I'll generate a grid of potential center points within this valid area, densely sampling the space. Then, for each potential placement, I'll calculate the corresponding AABB for object 6, given its rotation and center coordinates. Finally, the crucial step: I'll check for any overlap (collision) between this new AABB and the AABBs of all the pre-existing objects.  If there's no collision, this placement is valid and I'll add it to my list. I will keep generating placements and check against this list for duplicates until I find 50 stable, collision-free positions.
           

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Reconciling Feedback and Refining Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so here's the situation as I understand it. I've received feedback indicating that my initial approach to ensuring "stability" (i.e., full surface containment) was flawed. The system appears to be using a different, potentially more lenient, AABB check than I initially anticipated. Specifically, the system's AABB for stability checks isn't directly related to the object's stated dimensions (`size_x`, `size_y`).
           
           **Key Insights from Feedback:**
           
           *   **Tolerance:** The successful placements that "overhang" the surface boundaries suggest an implicit tolerance in the system's stability check. Successful placements have `y_upper` values that are slightly greater than the surface bound of `0.135`.
           *   **Effective Half-Extent (for Stability):**  Although the object's true half-extent (`s6 / 2 = 0.049229...`) is relevant for calculating AABBs for *inter-object* collisions, the system appears to be using a fixed, smaller "effective" half-extent (about `0.035`) for ensuring surface containment. I confirmed this via manual calculation of AABB and by inspecting system's AABB extents.
           *   **Collision Avoidance:** My calculations for AABBs and collision avoidance, based on the *actual* object dimensions, are correct. These will be used for collision checking between placed objects.
           
           **Revised Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Obstacle AABB:** I have to first collect all the occupied spaces by listing the center and the `AABB` for the other objects. In order to do so, I need to list all object-id and their respective bounding boxes. The reason for this, I need a list of non-occupied spaces to put my next object into.
           2.  **Valid Placements for Object 6 (at theta=0):** I will follow the strategy with the list of constraints:
               *   **Surface Bounds:** The center of an object 6 at `theta=0` is set to `(x, y)` and the bounding box will be as follows: `x_min = x - 0.049`, `x_max = x + 0.049`, `y_min = y - 0.049`, and `y_max = y + 0.049`. The `(x,y)` will be in valid range `-0.08577038183633641` to `0.08577038183633641`. The coordinates, which are outside of the range will be filtered out. The tolerance `epsilon_tolerance = 0.00055` will be applied to consider boundary violations of previous cases.
               *   **Collision Avoidance:** The algorithm takes `(x, y)` coordinates and `h_eff = 0.049` for `theta=0`. So, the bounding box would be as follows: `(x_center - h_eff, y_center - h_eff)` to `(x_center + h_eff, y_center + h_eff)`. To avoid the collision, I'll calculate the union of previous placements that has a collision.
           
           **Implementation Details:**
           With all this in mind, the implementation will work as follows:
           *   AABBs are re-calculated with the dimensions of objects and the previously calculated parameters
           *   Valid Placement coordinates for object 6 will be calculated
           *   The placement coordinates of object 6 will then be checked for collisions and surface boundaries.
           *   The final coordinates will be calculated and the object will be placed.
           
           **Assumptions and Limitations:**
           I am assuming that the system's stability check is primarily based on the surface bounds.
           I am also assuming that my interpretation of `h_eff` for `theta=0` and for other cases is right.
           
           I will prioritize generating placements that fit entirely within the bounds and avoid the "boundary" edge cases as much as possible, for simplicity and safety.
