User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is bounded by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a central vertical wall along x=0, and several smaller rectangular obstacles. Some of the obstacles are in the top-right, top-left, and bottom-right quadrants.
           The target point is (1.05, 1.25).
           I will try to place the robot in a circle around the target point. I need to avoid obstacles and stay within the range of 2 units from the target point.
           I will consider positions around the target point, extending outwards in different directions while checking for the known obstacles.
           Since the target is at (1.05, 1.25), which is in the top-right quadrant, I will prioritize positions that give a clear view.
           I will try a position to the left of the target, around (0, 1.25), but this might be too close to the central wall (x=0).
           I will try positions further to the right and slightly below or above the target, considering the obstacles in the top-right.
           I'll also try a position further down and to the left of the target, if clear.
           
           Positions:
           (1.05 0.5)
           (0.5 1.7)
           (1.8 1.8)

User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.8, -1.0). I need to find a base position within 2 units of this point.
           The fixed obstacles include a central vertical wall at x=0, and a few obstacles in the vicinity of the target. Specifically, obstacle 18 is at ((0.136, -1.868), (0.258, -1.746)) and obstacle 15 is at ((0.423, -2.205), (0.560, -2.068)). These are relatively far from the target. The obstacle 5: ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) is the main concern near x=0.
           I will try positions in various directions around the target point, keeping an eye on the central wall and the boundaries.
           
           1.  To the right of the target, around (1.8, -1.0). This should be clear of most obstacles.
           2.  Above the target, around (0.8, 0.0). This is somewhat close to the central wall, but hopefully far enough.
           3.  Below the target, around (0.8, -2.0). This is close to obstacle 15 and 18, so I will try to keep a bit of distance and go slightly to the right to avoid them.
           4.  To the left of the target, around (-0.5, -1.0). This will need to be carefully chosen to avoid the central wall.
           
           Positions:
           (1.8 -1.0)
           (0.8 0.0)
           (0.4 -0.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous requests were for target points (1.05, 1.25) and (0.8, -1.0), and the provided "failures" are for a new target point (-1.8818919658660889, 1.9620997905731201). This suggests the previous positions were fine for their respective targets, and the provided feedback is for the *current* target. I will use the current target.
           
           The target point is (-1.88, 1.96). This is in the top-left quadrant.
           The central wall at x=0 is a major obstacle. Obstacle 5 is at ((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)).
           There are several obstacles in the top-left quadrant:
           6: ((-2.4047, -2.3455), (-1.3953, -1.6544)) - this is in the bottom left, far from target
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - this is very close to the target, almost overlapping
           11: ((-1.029, 2.008), (-0.917, 2.120)) - also in the top-left, a bit to the right of the target
           20: ((-1.929, 1.914), (-1.834, 2.009)) - this is almost directly on top of the target, this is a very small obstacle.
           
           Given the target (-1.88, 1.96) and the very close obstacles 8 and 20, finding a line-of-sight position will be challenging.
           The previous attempts (1.8, -1.0), (0.8, 0.0), (0.4, -0.5) were far away and to the right of the central wall, so it makes sense that they had no line of sight to a target in the top-left. I need to focus on the top-left quadrant.
           
           I need to place the robot within 2 units of (-1.88, 1.96).
           Let's analyze the region around the target:
           Obstacle 8 is at ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). The target is at (-1.88, 1.96), which is inside this box! Specifically, x_target is between -2.25 and -1.75, and y_target is between 1.75 and 2.25. This means the target *itself* is within a fixed obstacle. This seems like an impossible request. If the target is inside an obstacle, no position will have line of sight.
           
           Let me re-read the problem description carefully. "You are given a target point". It does not say the target point is *not* inside an obstacle. However, "avoiding collisions and occlusions" implies the robot needs to *view* the target. If the target is occluded by a fixed obstacle that it's inside, it's unviewable.
           
           Assuming the target *is* viewable somehow (perhaps the given AABB is a rough approximation, or the target is just on the edge, or it's a "point" that needs to be viewed through an opening in the box):
           The obstacle 8 is ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). The target is (-1.88, 1.96).
           The obstacle 20 is ((-1.929, 1.914), (-1.834, 2.009)). The target is (-1.88, 1.96), which is also inside this box!
           
           This is a critical observation. If the target point is inside a fixed obstacle, it cannot be viewed. I will assume there's some nuance to the problem, perhaps the "point" is small and the box defines a larger structure. If it is truly inside, this is an impossible request. I will try to place the robot as close as possible without colliding with the structure that contains the target.
           
           Given that the target is within obstacle 8 (a large square block) and obstacle 20 (a smaller block also encompassing the target), I need to find a position that is *not* colliding with obstacle 8 or 20, and still within 2 units of the target. This means I need to be *outside* of these blocks.
           
           To the left of obstacle 8: x < -2.25. For example, (-2.3, 1.96). Distance from target: sqrt((-2.3 - (-1.88))^2 + (1.96 - 1.96)^2) = 0.42. This is well within 2. But the overall map limit is x > -2.5, so -2.3 is valid.
           To the right of obstacle 8: x > -1.75. For example, (-1.7, 1.96). Distance from target: sqrt((-1.7 - (-1.88))^2 + (1.96 - 1.96)^2) = 0.18. Valid.
           Below obstacle 8: y < 1.75. For example, (-1.88, 1.7). Distance from target: sqrt((-1.88 - (-1.88))^2 + (1.7 - 1.96)^2) = 0.26. Valid.
           Above obstacle 8: y > 2.25. For example, (-1.88, 2.3). Distance from target: sqrt((-1.88 - (-1.88))^2 + (2.3 - 1.96)^2) = 0.34. Valid.
           
           I will try these positions, assuming the target itself is not part of the physical obstacle, but rather located *within* it, and needs to be seen from the outside.
           
           Positions:
           (-2.3 1.96)
           (-1.7 1.96)
           (-1.88 1.7)
