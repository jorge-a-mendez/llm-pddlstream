           Surfaces ((lower_x, lower_y), (upper_x, upper_y)):
           
           ```
           0: ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))
           ```
           
           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07000000000000028, 0.06999999999999995)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:** The user needs 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on a rectangular surface (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  I'm assuming no collisions initially, so stability just means the object is fully inside the surface's boundaries. The object is a square (0.07 x 0.07).
           
           Since rotation affects the object's effective size within the surface, I need to consider it. The square's rotation won't change its AABB, which is why I'll vary both x, y position, and a couple of angles.  With the two chosen angles, I will have a couple of rotations for the square's effective bounding box within the surface and place the object accordingly. To make sure the placements are well-distributed I am using a grid sampling strategy, which will ensure that the placements are not too clustered together and the number of returned values is exactly 50. I'll focus on these two specific orientations that will produce two different AABB sizes and give the output as requested.
