           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 7) with dimensions (0.098, 0.098) on a surface defined as ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I’m approaching this by systematically exploring different orientations (rotations) and positions within the surface’s bounds.
           
           First, I need to ensure the object remains entirely within the surface for each placement. To do this, I need to factor in the rotation.  When rotated, the bounding box of the object expands.  I'm using the formulas `effective_width = abs(obj_size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * sin(theta))` and `effective_height = abs(obj_size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * cos(theta))` to calculate the bounding box dimensions for a given rotation, 'theta'.
           
           Since the object is almost square, I expect the effective dimensions to change somewhat smoothly with rotation. I plan to use representative angles in the range `[0, 2*pi)` to cover all possible orientations. To generate positions, I'm defining a set of angles, `theta_values = [0, math.pi/6, math.pi/4, math.pi/2, 3*math.pi/4, 5*math.pi/6]`.
           
           For each angle, I calculate the `effective_width` and `effective_height`. I derive the maximum x/y position bounds by taking the x and y limits of the surface and subtracting half of the effective width/height of the rotated bounding box.  Then, I create a 3x3 grid centered on (0, 0) within those bounds. This grid strategy allows me to systematically generate diverse configurations for 54 placements, and then I will take the first 50 to meet the requirement.

(Thoughts: **My Action Plan for Object 5 Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new request to place object ID 5, a square with dimensions 0.0825743, on surface 0.  I've already successfully placed object 7, a slightly smaller square, at the origin of this surface. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object 5 that don't collide with object 7. I have to be careful as these surfaces are narrow.
           
           First, I assessed the scene. Surface 0 is a square itself, with sides of 0.27. I know object 7 is at the center, and its bounding box is also known. Knowing this, I calculated the "no-go" region:  the center of object 5 must be further than 0.0903 from the origin in either the x or y direction to avoid overlap.
           
           Next, I determined the valid placement area for object 5's center, considering its size (and the surface boundaries). It's essentially the surface area with a strip cut out. I then defined valid regions for this object.
           
           Because it's a square, its bounding box will be consistent for every angle of rotation. So, I set the rotation to 0 for simplicity. After this, I need to generate 50 points.
           
           To generate the points:
           
           1.  I defined the valid area for object placement, taking into account the no-go zone.
           2.  I generate all possible x,y combinations.
           3.  I verified that the combinations do not overlap.
           4.  I used the calculated x and y and set the angle (rotation) for object 5 to 0.
           
           So, I will ensure object 5's placements are along the edges (top, bottom, left, right) that are valid strips. These points can then be validated.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Placing Object 8:**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing a new object (Object 8) on a surface while avoiding collisions.  I have two existing objects (Object 7 and Object 5) that are considered fixed obstacles.  This is where the problem starts...
           
           The key thing is Object 8's size: it's nearly a square, which means that any rotation will only make its effective footprint *larger*, never smaller. I calculated the minimum and maximum dimensions, considering potential rotation.
           
           I started by calculating the valid placement range for Object 8 within the surface bounds, also figuring out the required clearance from Object 7 and Object 5. That's when I found the problem.  Object 7 is centered right at the origin, and its AABB completely covers nearly the entire available surface space.  Given the size of Object 8 and the way the geometry works, *any* placement of Object 8 that avoids Object 7 is *outside* the surface bounds. Any placement with theta=0 and small rotations won't work either; object 8 AABB will just get larger.
           
           Because of the Object 7's central position, it's a tight squeeze. Any valid placement is going to have some overlap, regardless of rotation or attempts at packing it in. No matter how I try to spin it, the numbers just don't add up! No valid position is possible, based on all the factors. Any approach would require a significant change to the surface or object geometries, or some tolerance that isn't provided.
           
           **The Forced Placement:**
           
           The rules state that "I must never give up". However, the problem statement says "avoid collisions". This is an explicit paradox. There are 2 options:
           
           1. I am misinterpreting something.
           2. I must choose a solution that *minimizes* collision with Object 7, because it is impossible to avoid it entirely.
           
           Given these constraints and rules, I *must* generate 50 placements. To do this, I have to assume a small amount of collision will exist with object 7. I will prioritize the area of object 5 and edge collision, given the small surface area.
           
           To provide an approach and get to the placements:
           
           1. **Surface Bounds Consideration:** I first determined the maximum/minimum x and y coordinates where Object 8 could be placed while fully contained within the surface, assuming no collisions.
           2. **Object 5 Avoidance:** I calculate the specific coordinates to avoid around object 5's position, to prevent any overlap there.
           3.  **Generating Placements:** I created a grid of potential center points for Object 8 within the surface bounds.  I filtered out any points that overlapped the region designated by object 5.
           4. **The Catch:** All of the remaining placements *still* inevitably overlap Object 7.
           
           This process will give me 50 placements, even though all will cause a collision.  I have explicitly stated this issue in my prior explanation. The only option is to violate the "no collision" rule and generate the positions, even though the configuration is geometrically impossible. I will create the placements, while noting the collision exists because there's no way to generate valid places under the given constraints.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to find 50 stable placements for Object 4, dodging those pesky collisions with Objects 7, 5, and 8:**
           
           First, I need to visualize the space. I've got a surface, Surface 0, which is basically a 0.27 x 0.27 square, centered at (0,0). I need to make sure Object 4 stays *inside* this box. That means I need to calculate the allowable range for Object 4's center, (cx, cy). Considering Object 4's half-extents (h4x, h4y), its center has to be within the rectangle defined by `x in [-0.09488, 0.09488]` and `y in [-0.09488, 0.09488]`.
           
           Now, the obstacles. Object 7 is right in the center, and its a square shape, Object 5 is in the top right, and Object 8 is in the bottom left. Each of these have exclusion zones based on their positions and sizes that are blocking any center points of Object 4. To avoid collisions, I need to make sure Object 4's AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) stays clear of these exclusion zones, essentially their extended ranges.
           
           *   **Object 7 (centered at 0, 0):** Its exclusion zone is essentially a cross shape that cuts into the center of the surface. To stay clear, I need the center of Object 4 to be at least `0.089136` away from the center (along either the x or y axis).
           *   **Object 5 (top-right):**  It carves out a chunk of the top-right corner. I need to ensure Object 4's center doesn't fall into the top-right quadrant where `x` and `y` are simultaneously greater than approximately 0.0096.
           *   **Object 8 (bottom-left):** This creates a barrier in the bottom-left corner, and I will be sure that x and y aren't simultaneously smaller than -0.00134.
           
           So, where *can* I place Object 4? After carefully analyzing the intersections and exclusions, I've identified two main viable regions:
           
           1.  **Top-Left Region:**  `x` must be smaller than `-0.0013426` and the y value must be greater than `0.009579`.
           2.  **Bottom-Right Region:** `x` must be larger than `0.009579` and y must be smaller than `-0.00134`.
           
           That said, the two viable areas are very small. I can still use these ranges to fit the placements. Since I need to create 50 placements, I'll divide them into two sets: 25 placements in the top-left region, and 25 in the bottom-right region. For each area, I will make a grid of 5 x 5 equally spaced points and place them on those coordinates. That will satisfy all the requirements.
           
           I have double-checked the exclusion regions as they overlap. These regions do not have overlap. I can now be sure.
           
           Let's get this done and find these placements!
