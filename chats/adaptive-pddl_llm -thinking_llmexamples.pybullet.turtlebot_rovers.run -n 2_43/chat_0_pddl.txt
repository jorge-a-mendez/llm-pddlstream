           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Deep Dive into the Implausibility of the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This translates into a bunch of conditions that need to be true. I've broken down these conditions and, using my knowledge of the problem, I'm finding a critical issue. The problem seems to revolve around getting these rovers to do things, like take images, and send them back, and do sample analysis.
           
           Initially, I see that I already have some things taken care of. Great! But the real challenges are related to the rovers' interactions with their environment, specifically the lander and the targets that I need to gather info about.
           
           My approach: start with the actions I can take and what the prerequisites are for each one. To get the images and analysis data, the rovers are gonna have to "get into position" to receive the data and interact with objects that are "visible". But here's the kicker:  all these "visible" predicates have parameters that indicate what *configuration* the rovers *need* to be in.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is that my rovers are stuck! Their configurations are *fixed* in the initial state, and I can't move them to a different configuration. There are some "motion" actions, but they only result in the rovers remaining in the *exact* configuration they started in. They just don't have the actions necessary to actually *move* and *reconfigure* themselves. The implication is that the rovers are unable to carry out the actions necessary to fulfill the goal.
           
           Why does this matter? Well, consider that `imagevisible` is true *only* if the rover is at a *specific* configuration, say `#o3`.  To send the image, the rover has to be at a specific configuration, like `#o0` or some other configuration.  The problem I'm seeing is that, according to what's defined, the rovers have a fixed initial position, in the PDDL framework. My assumption is that the state *never changes.* In the available PDDL, no action would allow a rover to be visible to, sample rocks, receive or transmit images etc.
           
           The available actions let them `move` and `drop_rock`.
           Since `free` (where the rover can put its cargo) is true, the `drop_rock` action is useless.
           `move` is useless because those actions are self-loops.
           
           This whole picture makes me think the solution is *impossible*. I cannot achieve the goal because I cannot set up the prerequisite conditions.
