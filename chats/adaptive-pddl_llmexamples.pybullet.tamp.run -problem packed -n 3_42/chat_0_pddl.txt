User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14) that are currently on object v11, as indicated by the `atpose` and `supported` facts. The goal is to move all three of these objects (v8, v12, v14) onto object v16. All three objects are `graspable` and `stackable` with v16.
           
           The initial state also provides information about two robot arms (v4 and v6), both of which are `handempty`. The robot's base is at configuration v3.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base from v3 to v3, essentially staying in the same place. It does not involve any manipulation actions like `pick` or `place`. To achieve the goal of moving objects, `pick` and `place` actions are necessary. Since these actions are not available in the list of valid action instances, and there are no action instances that would allow the robot to pick up or place objects, the goal is unachievable.
           
           Therefore, no plan can be generated with the given available actions.
