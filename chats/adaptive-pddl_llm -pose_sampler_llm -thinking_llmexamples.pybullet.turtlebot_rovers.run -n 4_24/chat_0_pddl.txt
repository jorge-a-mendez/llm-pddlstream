User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **My Solution for Base Positions**
           
           The target point is at (0.0, 0.0).  A significant challenge here is that the target resides inside the central vertical obstacle (AABB 5), which by standard interpretations means line-of-sight is likely blocked from anywhere outside of the obstacle.  However, the goal is to find base positions for the robot "to view" this target, so I assume valid base positions exist. My strategy is to select three positions that are within the maximum range of 2 meters from the target, within the given x/y limits of [-2.5, 2.5], and are unlikely to collide with any fixed obstacles, while ensuring diversity. I've used a buffer of 0.1 meters around each obstacle to account for the robot's size.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 0.0)
           (-1.0 0.0)
           (1.4 1.4)
