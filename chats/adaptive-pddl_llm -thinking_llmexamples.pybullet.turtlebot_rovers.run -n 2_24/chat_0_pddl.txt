           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. This breaks down into several sub-goals, the most critical of which are getting the rover's camera to capture images, and then transmitting those images to the lander.  Specifically, I need to achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`.
           
           To do this, I need to use the `take_image` and `send_image` actions. These actions have key preconditions, including being in the right configuration (at the right "location" on the surface, called a *conf* in this language). I have two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera. The problem arises because the *imagevisible* predicates that describe what my cameras *can* see require the rovers to be at a specific configuration, #o3. However, my initial state indicates that the rovers are at v13 (for v12) and v15 (for v14).
           
           Crucially, the only available "move" actions are no-ops – meaning the rovers cannot change their configurations. They are stuck at v13 and v15 respectively. So, while I have the *ability* to take images, the way the current rules are structured means I cannot position the rovers to *see* the necessary objectives, v17 and v18. Without the ability to move, I can't meet the preconditions for the `take_image` action and cannot meet the preconditions of the `send_image` action. Therefore the main goal of receiving an image will never be met.
           
           Since achieving `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is a fundamental prerequisite for `new-axiom@0()`, the entire goal is unreachable given the current state and the available actions.  The rovers can't move, and thus can't achieve the necessary image acquisition and transmission.
