(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Placement Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for an object with ID 4, dimensions (approximately) `0.0836 x 0.0836`, on a square surface extending from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Stability means the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is fully contained within the surface's bounds after rotation.
           
           The key insight is that since the object is almost square, its rotated AABB dimensions vary minimally with rotation. I'll approximate these dimensions as constant where the AABB size is mostly constant and nearly the same for all rotations.  I recognize the rotated bounding box will grow to a maximum of approximately 0.118 by 0.118 when rotated by pi/4 radians.  For rotations of 0 and pi/2 radians, the objects bounding box has its smaller dimension.
           
           The strategy involves varying both the rotation angle (`theta`) and the center position (`x`, `y`) of the object's AABB. I'll use 10 different rotation angles, spaced from 0 to 3pi/2, and for each angle, I will pick 5 positions, to get 50 different stable placements.
           
           For each rotation angle, I will determine the maximum possible values for the x and y center coordinates by considering the AABB's dimensions.
           
           The calculation is as follows:
           
           1.  I identify the surface (surface 0, which is the aforementioned square).
           2.  I estimate `half_rotated_s`, which is half of the dimensions of the rotated object, using the formulas, `W = obj_w * abs(math.cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(math.sin(theta))` and `H = obj_w * abs(math.sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(math.cos(theta))`, then `half_rotated_w= W/2`, `half_rotated_h = H/2`.
           3.  For each `theta`, I compute the x and y ranges: `[-0.135 + half_W, 0.135 - half_W]` and `[-0.135 + half_H, 0.135 - half_H]`.
           4.  I generate placement coordinates with these points: center, bottom left, bottom right, top left, and top right based off the x,y center coordinates.
           
           The angles are spaced roughly equally to try and cover all possibilities. The positions are meant to give some spatial diversity. I have confirmed these positions should give valid, stable placements given the relatively small size of the object.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object 5, Avoiding Collision with Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement for Object 4 at (0,0), and I need to figure out where to put Object 5 without them bumping into each other. I'm aiming for 50 good placements on Surface 0.
           
           Here's the plan: First, I'll calculate the bounding box for Object 5 for different rotations. Then I'll identify the region where Object 5 can *actually* go on the surface, making sure it doesn't overlap with the center (where Object 4 is).  I'll pick 10 angles spaced evenly, then, for each, I'll identify regions in 2D space away from the center for placement, and pick 5 positions.
           
           To ensure no collision, I need to check the boundaries.  I'll find the valid x and y regions on the surface, ensuring there are no collisions with Object 4's bounding box. Then, instead of placing things in the center (Object 4's already there!), I'll use the available space at the corners and edges of the available surface area for each rotation.
           
           Let's break it down: I'll use those same 10 angles, and for each: Calculate the size of object 5, find x and y ranges on the surface. Next, I need to make sure the AABB of object 5 doesn't collide with object 4, which is a square. So I will ensure the distance between the two bounding boxes is big enough. Then, I'll pick points from the extreme corners of the non-colliding regions. Specifically, picking a set of valid corners and the mid-point of the first. This gives me a set of 5 points for each of the 10 angles.
           
           I think this method of generating a set of corner points avoids collision by ensuring enough space between the two objects. I'll test it out with 0 degrees rotation and check it all out!

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for object ID 7 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't collide with objects 4 and 5:**
           
           First, I need to define the problem. I've got object 7, with its dimensions, and I need to place it 50 times without any collisions. The existing objects, 4 and 5, are fixed obstacles. My surface 0 has boundaries that I must respect. The rotation will be zero for now to keep things simple.
           
           **Key calculations:**
           
           To start with, I'll focus on the surface constraints and collision avoidance. I'll need to calculate the bounding box for each object to see if it collides.
           I have object 4 centered at `(0,0)`, and object 5 placed at a negative location and the sizes will remain constant relative to where they are placed.
           
           I know object 7's dimensions, so I'll first determine its bounding box.
           For a given rotation `theta`, it will be a calculation with respect to the width and the height.
           
           1. **Calculate Object AABB:**
              *   I'll calculate `half_W7` and `half_H7` for the various rotations.
              *   Given the object 7's size and the surface size, I know there should be plenty of space.
           
           2. **Define Valid Range:**
              *   The placement has to consider where objects 4 and 5 are placed.
              *   I need to check for collision by calculating the overlap of the objects bounding boxes.
           
           3. **Collision Avoidance Strategy:**
              *   If I pick a potential center point `(x7, y7)` for object 7. I must calculate `(x7- half_width, y7 + half_height)` and `(x7 + half_width, y7 - half_height)`
              *   If the bounding boxes are overlapping in both the X and Y coordinates with objects 4 or 5, there is a collision.
           
           **Now, the Plan:**
           I'll iterate through 10 distinct angles.
           1.   I'll define the candidate grid, with points along X and Y with 5 intervals each.
           2.   I will calculate if the center would collide for each grid point.
           3.   I'll check for the overlap of AABBs to calculate if a collision occurs.
           
           **Simplification Strategy**
           Rather than computing complex exclusion regions. I will apply this point selection:
           1.  For each point, for each theta, I can use the AABB and check.
           2.  If the center of the object 7 is within the AABB of objects 4 and 5, I've got a collision.
           3.  I keep checking until 50 placements are available. I will filter the points based on a check for the AABB overlap.
           4. I will define a candidate `(x, y)` point in a surface-constrained grid.
           
           I will then use a defined function to check for the bounding box overlap for collision.
           
           **Expected Outcome**
           After running, I will receive 50 valid placements for surface 0, for object 7, with a fixed angle.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable positions for Object ID 6 on Surface 0, which is a square region. Object 6 is also a square, and I know its dimensions.  I also have to consider the locations of three already placed objects (IDs 4, 5, and 7), all squares, and their AABBs.
           
           My goal is to place Object 6 without any overlap. Since Object 6 is square,  I can optimize by considering rotations that minimize its area.  Specifically, I'll use only the cardinal rotations: 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2.  I can quickly calculate Object 6's AABB extents for these rotations, and the rotation is handled by the function.
           
           Here's my general approach:
           
           1.  **Define Placement Space:** I'll determine the valid range within the surface where the center of Object 6 can be located, considering its dimensions.
           2.  **Obstacle Identification:** I'll map the AABBs for Object 4, 5 and 7.
           3.  **Buffer Zones:**  For each existing object, I need to create a "buffer zone" around it, an exclusion zone, effectively expanding the area it occupies.  Object 6's center must be outside of any such region.
           4.  **Sampling Placement Locations:**  I'll generate a grid of potential center points within the surface's valid area.  For each point, I'll test if Object 6's AABB at that location collides with any of the buffer zones. If so, it is invalid.
           5.  **Iteration and Output:** I will efficiently generate and test numerous possible center points. I want 50 stable, valid placements, that I can return.
           
           My main focus will be on the available space in the corners, top-right and bottom-right corners of the placement area.  The center of the surface is effectively blocked by Object 4, and the two corner objects block significant area as well.
