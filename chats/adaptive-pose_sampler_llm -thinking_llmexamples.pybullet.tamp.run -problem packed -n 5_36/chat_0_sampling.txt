(Thoughts: **Fulsome Summary of Thought Process:**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown. The task is to place a square object (ID 5) with side length 0.0924 units (approximately) onto a larger square surface (Surface 0) that's 0.27 units on a side, centered at the origin.  The object needs to be *fully* contained within the surface, meaning its *axis-aligned bounding box* (AABB) can't poke out.  I need 50 stable placements, which means variations in both position and orientation.
           
           First, I need to account for rotation. Since the problem description defines the object's size in terms of its axis-aligned bounding box, the dimensions provided (0.0924 x 0.0924) represent the AABB *when the object is aligned with the world axes*.  When the object rotates, its AABB *grows*. A good way to calculate the effective bounding box after rotation of angle theta and initial side s is with s * (abs(cos(theta) + abs(sin(theta))).
           
           The largest AABB occurs at a 45-degree angle (pi/4 radians) because cos and sin are each sqrt(2)/2 or approximately 0.707 and the maximum "stretch" from the initial aligned dimensions is then s * sqrt(2), or approximately 0.1307. I calculated the AABB size for 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. At a 45-degree angle, I calculated the size as 0.1307 which is well below 0.27 and still fits the surface.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to constrain the object's center within a smaller region inside the surface. If the object is aligned, it can move along the x and y axes until its edge is 0.046 units away from the edge of the surface.  This is because its AABB size is 0.092. The center can range from -0.0888 to 0.0888 in both x and y. If the angle is rotated at 45 degrees, the most it can travel is from -0.0696 to 0.0696.
           
           I calculated the ranges for the center point based on how the object's AABB grows with the rotation.  The goal is to generate 50 distinct (x, y) coordinates for various angles, that can fit the objects completely within surface 0.
           I'll try 5 different angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2. And then, for each angle, I need a good set of 10 points.
           
           To generate the x and y ranges for the points, I needed to define the "effective side", which changes with the rotation. I defined the formula `eff_s(theta) = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`
           Then, the ranges become `[surf_min + half_eff_s(theta), surf_max - half_eff_s(theta)]`
           
           For each angle, I will create a standard set of x positions using 4 equally spaced points with the formula `x_min + k * (x_max-x_min) / 3` for k=0,1,2,3.
           I defined 10 placements per angle with this set, generating a reasonable distribution for placement. This structure avoids overlap of the various points, ensuring 50 distinct values.
           The surface index is 0.
           The placement set will then be outputted with the format: `(<surf_idx>, <theta>, <x>, <y>)` and nothing else.

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Placements for Object ID 8**
           
           Having received confirmation that a previous placement of Object ID 5 is successful and collision-free, I now need to determine 50 stable and non-colliding placements for a new object, ID 8, on the same surface. Object ID 5's position, specifically its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box), is fixed, and I must ensure that any new placement for object 8 doesn't overlap with it.
           
           Object 8, being almost a square (0.09826561737312121 x 0.09826561737312123), presents a geometric challenge. Its effective side length varies with its rotation, ranging from its original side length to `sqrt(2)` times that side length. The surface available for placement has dimensions of 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           To ensure non-collision with object 5, I've developed a placement strategy. I'll sample a range of eight angles (0 to 7pi/8 radians) to achieve diverse rotations for the object. This angle selection should ensure enough variation.  For each angle, I create a grid of points on the surface, carefully filtering out any placements that overlap with object 5. My logic is based on checking for AABB overlap.
           
           The AABB of Object 5 is given as `-0.135` and `-0.0426`.  A valid placement for the center point of object 8 must be outside of this region (where the center of object 5 sits). I have to avoid generating points close to the collision boundary, which is the bottom-left corner.  To check for collisions I use two steps, 1) calculate the x and y bounds of object 8 given its rotation and 2) compare these to the bounding box of object 5 for overlap.
           
           This methodology combines diverse rotational options with a systematic grid-based sampling of potential positions, followed by rigorous AABB-based collision checks. This combined strategy should produce 50 feasible and non-colliding placements, meeting the requirements of this stage.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I need to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object ID 4 (a square, size s4) on Surface 0. Surface 0 is a square itself, centered at (0,0) with side 0.27.  I've got to dodge two obstacles: Object ID 5, stuck down in the bottom-left corner, and Object ID 8, hovering in the mid-left area. Both are also squares.
           
           First, I'll figure out where I *can't* put Object 4. The obstacles' positions give me their AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) ranges.  Since the squares might be rotated, I'll need to check a range of rotations for Object 4. I'll need to calculate the effective size of Object 4 for each rotation (theta) since its projected area will change.
           
           Next, I'll map out the possible center points (x, y) for Object 4 on Surface 0, taking into account its changing size with rotation. I'll create a grid of potential placements, carefully considering the surface boundaries.
           
           Now the fun part - the collision checks.  For each potential placement, I'll calculate Object 4's AABB. Then, I'll check if this AABB overlaps with the AABBs of Object 5 and Object 8. If there's an overlap, the placement's rejected.
           
           I'll start with 8 angles from 0 to pi/2, then add a grid of 7x7 potential centers for each angle, creating an 8x7x7 grid. I can see a "safe" rectangle on the right side of the surface. Once I have those placement, I'll extend to 12 angles from 0 to pi to get 50 clean placements. Then that's done.

           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 on Surface 0, while making sure it doesn't collide with Objects 5, 8, and 4, which are already in place. The surface is a square of size 0.27 centered at (0,0). Object 7 is a square with side length s7 = 0.08539.
           
           My strategy will be to generate placements for various angles (rotations) of Object 7. I'll use 8 angles evenly spaced between 0 and pi, and for each angle, calculate the effective size of the object to determine the feasible placement region. Then I'll create a grid of potential center points within this region. For each candidate placement, I’ll construct the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) and check it for collision against the AABBs of the other three objects. If there are no collisions, the placement is valid.
           
           Specifically, I'll use 8 angles, and for each angle, I will generate a 7x7 grid of candidate center points. Then I'll filter the resulting 392 candidates for valid ones. If I find at least 50 valid ones, I'll select the first 50.
           
           The AABBs of the obstacles are:

           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 6, a square with side length 0.0951, on Surface 0, which is a square region of size 0.27. I need to carefully avoid collisions with four existing objects: IDs 5, 8, 4, and 7.
           
           To achieve this, I've outlined a comprehensive strategy:
           
           1.  **AABB Calculations:** First, I've meticulously calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each of the four obstructing objects. This involves precise calculations using their provided placement data (x and y center coordinates and rotation) and side lengths to define the minimum and maximum x and y extents of each object's bounding box. I've re-calculated the AABBs with full precision.
           
           2.  **Rotation and Effective Side Length:** To determine potential placements, I will consider various rotation angles for Object ID 6. These angles are: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3\*pi/8, pi/2, 5\*pi/8, 3\*pi/4, and 7\*pi/8. For each angle, I will calculate the "effective side length" of Object ID 6, which accounts for the object's rotation.
           
           3.  **Containment Boundaries:** For each rotation, I will determine the valid center ranges for Object ID 6 to fit within Surface 0, taking into account the effective side length and the surface's boundaries.
           
           4.  **Grid Generation:** Within these valid center ranges, I will create a grid of potential placements for Object ID 6. I'll use a 5x5 grid for each rotation (25 positions per angle) leading to 200 possible placement combinations.
           
           5.  **Collision Detection:** For each candidate placement, I'll calculate the AABB of Object ID 6. Then, I'll perform collision checks with each of the obstructing objects by comparing their respective AABBs.
           
           6.  **Collision Logic:** The collision check uses a robust formula: `max(x1_min, x2_min) < min(x1_max, x2_max)` AND `max(y1_min, y2_min) < min(y1_max, y2_max)`. It will accurately determine if any potential placement intersects with any of the obstacles.
           
           7.  **Placement Selection:** Finally, I'll collect the first 50 placement coordinates that pass the collision detection checks.
           
           Before I fully implement this approach, I performed some test checks that confirmed the logic. The goal is to generate 50 unique placements that meet the required criteria.
