(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Alright, I need to come up with 50 stable positions for a square object (ID 6, dimensions: 0.096x0.096) on a square surface (AABB: 0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))).  "Stable" means the object must be entirely inside the surface. Since this is a simple square on a square, I can break this down:
           
           First, I know a square's bounding box has the same shape every 90 degrees of rotation. So, I only have to consider rotations (`theta`) from 0 to pi/2 radians.  I'll generate placements by varying the rotation and object center (x, y).
           
           I'll pick 5 evenly-spaced rotations. Next, I must calculate the "valid" region for the object's center at each rotation. The key here is determining the bounding box of the square after it's been rotated.  The rotated bounding box's size depends on `theta`.  I'll calculate the half-extents (half-width and half-height) of the rotated object's bounding box.  Then, by adding those half-extents to the surface boundaries, I can determine the area on the surface where the object can be safely placed.
           
           I'll choose five different angles for the rotation and ten (5x2) positions (x, y) for each, to ensure a grid of 50 different solutions. The x- and y-positions will be evenly spaced within these valid regions, making for 50 placements in total.
           
           Here's the plan:
           *   Pick the rotation angles
           *   Calculate the size of the rotated bounding box
           *   Calculate the valid range to place the object's center (x, y) given the boundary box's size
           *   Pick points within those ranges, ensuring 50 total.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's my plan to get object ID 4 onto surface 0 without a collision. I've got the dimensions for both objects, the surface boundaries, and the known location of the existing object, ID 6. 
           
           First, I'll calculate the *half_rotated_extent* of object 4, which changes with the rotation angle. Then, for each angle (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2), I'll establish the valid ranges for the center of object 4 on the surface, considering the object's size and the surface's limits. I'll need to know the dimensions of Object 4, which is a square with size = 0.0907.
           
           Next comes the trickier part: *collision avoidance*. I'll calculate the *collision region* around object 6 – essentially, an area that's off-limits to object 4's center. 
           
           I'll then combine these results to determine the *effective placement space*: the valid surface area minus the collision region. For `theta = 0`, I know it creates an 'L' shaped space I can pick from. To ensure the object placements are not in a position to collide, I have to ensure the positions are to the right (X), and the top (Y) of the object 6 position. With a simple, sorted 5x5 grid of valid (x,y) locations, and selecting the first 10, the program should be efficient for picking from the valid placements.
           
           In essence, I'm mapping out the problem space, carving out the 'safe zones', and then filling them efficiently and evenly.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's get this done. I need to place 50 of object ID 5 on surface 0.**  This is a square, and I know its dimensions. The surface is a simple rectangle. I've got a strategy: I'll use a 15x15 grid (for now) and try rotating the square at a few angles to see how to fit it in there. I have to avoid collisions, so I'll check my placement against two existing objects.
           
           I've got the dimensions of object ID 5 and the surface area. I also have the coordinates and dimensions of the two previously placed objects, I can easily check for overlap of the AABB with existing ones, and if it does I just look for another spot.  I will iterate through all the angles and placements and store valid ones to be sure I get enough for the requirement.
           
           I've determined I need the rotation half-extent calculations for the different angles, and for the 15x15 grid, I will check the placement, checking for collision at that angle and position, keeping any valid placements found.  I will iterate through the angles and placements to get those 50 spots.
           
           So, I need to generate placement candidates based on object dimensions, rotations, and available surface area. I will check for collision to make sure the object avoids previously placed objects. Let's start and get 50 stable placements. I'll make sure to get 50, but if something doesn't work, I'll need to increase that grid for a more complete search.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Square Object**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 8) on a square surface (Surface 0). The object's side length is `s8`, and it's a square. The surface is also a square. I must avoid collisions with three existing objects (IDs 6, 4, and 5) that are already placed on the surface.
           
           To achieve this, I'll use AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to represent both the surface and the existing objects, and will calculate the rotated AABBs of the object for different angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2).
           
           The core process involves:
           
           1.  **Defining Ranges:** Determining the valid ranges for the center coordinates (x and y) of the new object, considering its size and rotation, and the surface boundaries.
           2.  **Generating Candidates:** Creating a grid of candidate positions within these valid ranges, covering a 15x15 grid of points for each of the five rotation angles.
           3.  **Collision Checking:** Checking each candidate placement for collision against the AABBs of the existing objects using a simple collision check function.
           4.  **Selection:** Choosing the non-colliding positions, prioritizing positions to obtain diversity in placements by setting constraints to avoid occupied areas.
           5.  **Output:** After finding many valid points, the first 50 stable placements are chosen, to ensure the right number of stable placements is achieved.
