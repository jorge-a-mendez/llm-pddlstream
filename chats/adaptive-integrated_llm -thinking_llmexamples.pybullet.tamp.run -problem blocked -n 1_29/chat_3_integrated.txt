           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.322, 0.294), (-4.239, 0.377)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.109).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Achieving a Conjunctive Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to develop a plan that satisfies the goal of `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which is defined as the conjunction of `Atom on(?green, v18)` and `Atom type(?green, v17)`. My analysis indicates that this involves placing an object, identified as `?green`, onto a specific location, denoted as `v18`, while also ensuring that the object's type matches `v17`.
           
           I've determined that the potential objects that can fulfill the role of `?green` are `v12` and `v8`, both confirmed as instances of `type v17`. The location, `v18`, is preliminarily identified as a surface, potentially a stove or sink. The provided information suggests that `stackable(v12, v18)` and `stackable(v8, v18)` are true, further supporting this hypothesis.
           
           Considering the initial state, the robot arm, `v4`, is empty. The poses of objects `v12` and `v8` relative to other known objects, such as `v14` and `v11`, are known. Since `v8` is on a surface closer to `v18`, and already satisfies the criteria of being `type v17`, I've decided to proceed with placing `v8` on `v18`. I understand that achieving `on(v8, v18)` hinges on making both `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` true, where `?p` represents an unknown pose.
           
           I intend to use existing information on graspable poses, `pose(v8, #p0)` and `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`, to pick `v8` and place it at `#p0` on the surface of `v18`. From the initial state and using axioms, this means: *#p0* is the desired destination to complete the planning task.
           
           Consequently, I've developed a strategic plan involving four key steps:
           
           1.  **`move_base v3 #q0 #t1`**: Move the robot base from `v3` to configuration `#q0`, a suitable location for picking up `v8`. The base configuration is critical for the robot's mobility, and must be moved for picking operations.
           
           2.  **`pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0`**: Use arm `v4` to grasp `v8` from pose `v9`, given grasp `#g0` and move to base configuration `#q0`.
           
           3.  **`move_base #q0 #q1 #o0`**: Move robot base from `#q0` to `#q1`, a suitable location for placing `v8` on `v18`.
           
           4.  **`place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2`**: Place `v8` at pose `#p0` on `v18`, given grasp `#g0` with arm `v4`.
           
           I've ensured that the plan utilizes existing axioms, while also considering parameters that must satisfy the actions' preconditions. Further, I have explicitly stated that I'm working with continuous parameters.
           
           Finally, I've carefully calculated the continuous value for `#p0`, which is the targeted pose for `v8` on `v18`. Given the AABBs for both objects, and using information on the relative surface heights, I can formulate the continuous `#p0` (x, y, z, quaternion) values, with an assumption that the bottom of the object is in contact with the surface. After detailed calculations and considerations about the physical characteristics of objects, the estimated pose value `#p0` is  (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0).  Also, I have ensured there are no collisions with other objects, as `v8` must be placed on `v18`. This strategy maximizes the likelihood of success for achieving the conjunction of the initial conjunctive goal.
