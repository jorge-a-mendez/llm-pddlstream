User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.322, 0.294), (-4.239, 0.377)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.109).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v6)

           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)

           Atom bconf(#o3)
           Atom atraj(#o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v15, v16, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)

           Atom kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           Atom kin(v4, v15, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Reasoning:**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified that `v12` and `v8` are potential candidates for `?green` because they both satisfy `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           To satisfy `on(?green, v18)`, the object needs to be both `supported` by `v18` and at a specific `pose` compatible with `v18`.  Initially, neither `v8` nor `v12` is in this state. To place either object onto `v18` (i.e., to manipulate its `atpose` predicate), I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions. However, I am restricted to only using the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does *not* affect the positions or support relationships of the objects. Since my available action set is constrained to only `move_base`, I am unable to manipulate any object's `atpose` predicate and, consequently, I cannot achieve the goal of having an object on `v18`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the current limitations.
