User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.322, 0.294), (-4.239, 0.377)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.109).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom arm(v4)

           Atom canmove()

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)

           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires establishing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've identified `v12` and `v8` as potential candidates for `?green` because `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true.
           
           To make `on(v12, v18)` true, I'd need to ensure that `v12` is *atpose* a pose that is supported by `v18`. Initially, `v12` is *atpose* `v13`, and to make this to `on(v18)`, requires to use place `v12` in a new pose that can be supported by `v18`, like `#o2`.
           
           Similarly, to make `on(v8, v18)` true, `v8` must be *atpose* a pose that is supported by `v18`, initially, `v8` is *atpose* `v9`, requiring to use place `v8` on a new pose that can be supported by `v18`.
           
           My initial plan was to use a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions: move the object from its current pose to a pose supported by `v18`. I know from initial state facts that both `v12` and `v8` are indeed supported by `v18` at pose `#o2`. I need to execute `pick` and `place` commands to achieve this state.
           
           However, a critical constraint has been imposed: I can only use the action instances provided in a specific list. The *only* action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot base from location `v3` to the same location `v3` - effectively a no-op. This move has no effect on `atpose`, `handempty`, or `atgrasp` predicates, which are essential for achieving `on` preconditions.
           
           Since I am restricted to the `move_base` no-op and there is no predicate `on` initially true that involves `v18` being supported by a object at any pose, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is not achievable. I can't manipulate the object poses to make the necessary preconditions of the goal true.
