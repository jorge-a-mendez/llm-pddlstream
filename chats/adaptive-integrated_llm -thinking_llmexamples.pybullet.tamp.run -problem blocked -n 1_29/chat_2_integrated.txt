User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.322, 0.294), (-4.239, 0.377)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.281, 0.336, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.994, 0.109).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, I've got a clear objective: to get `Atom new-axiom@0()` to be true in this `pr2-tamp` domain.  Looking at the definition, this means I need to make both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I know from the initial state that `type(?green, v17)` is already satisfied for either `v8` or `v12`, so I just need to figure out how to get one of them "on" object `v18`.
           
           Examining the `on` axiom, that means getting `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` true.  I checked the initial state and noticed that both `v8` and `v12` are already *supported* by `v18` at pose `#o2`. This is good news, as it gives me a clear path.
           
           Since I have to pick one, I'll go with `v8` to be `?green`.  My current knowledge is that `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and I can change this using the move actions.  So, I need to get `v8` to be `atpose(v8, #o2)`. Since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true, this'll get me to the goal.
           
           The initial state reveals a robotic arm named `v4` and a base at `v3`.  Given the initial `atpose(v8,v9)` and what I need to achieve, it looks like a standard pick-and-place sequence is needed.  I'll need to move to the base position needed and *then* pick and place the object.
           
           I've got the action instances for both pick and place, with the relevant base configurations and trajectories. Now, let's nail down this plan:
           
           1.  **`move_base v3 #o3 #o0`**: This gets the robot arm into the correct position to interact with `v8`. The initial base configuration is v3. From this, the robot needs to travel the trajectory #o0, to the target base configuration #o3.
           2.  **`pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`**:  This picks up `v8` from its current pose `v9` with arm `v4`.
           3.  **`place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`**:  This places `v8` onto the pose `#o2`, which is supported by `v18`.  `#o1` is my grasp, `#o3` is the base, and `#o4` is the trajectory.
           
           After executing this sequence, I'll have `on(v8, v18)` true, which, combined with the initial `type(v8, v17)`, satisfies the `new-axiom@0()` axiom and therefore the goal.
           
           For object `#o2`, I must define its continuous pose with the surface in mind. The object v8 AABB is `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))`, while surface `v18` AABB is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. Then, I'll just assign `#o2` the pose `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. This placement should be on the surface, so I am confident it is a reasonable solution. It can be verified that the `(x,y)` coordinates of the plate fit perfectly onto the table `v18`, so it is a good placement.
           
           This is my plan to achieve the target.
