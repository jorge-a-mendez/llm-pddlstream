           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal State: The Obstacle of Kinematics**
           
           Okay, here's the situation: I'm presented with a goal to achieve a specific arrangement of objects, namely having five objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18`) all placed "on" another object (`v20`). This "on" relationship hinges on the presence of supporting poses and object configurations which is essentially defined in the axiom. I'm focusing on the `supported` predicate which I can achieve with the provided initial conditions and possible actions.
           
           My initial examination of the setup quickly reveals a crucial roadblock: the need for `pick` and `place` actions to move these objects to their desired final positions. Each object currently rests on `v11`, and my goal demands that I reposition them onto `v20`. The obvious approach, and likely the intended solution is the usage of the pick and place actions, a series of picking the object and then placing it somewhere else. I'm immediately noticing that the initial state is missing the critical 'kin' predicates which relates an arm, an object, its pose, a grasp, a base configuration, and an arm trajectory, necessary prerequisites for executing `pick` and `place`.
           
           The absence of these `kin` predicates is a major red flag, it's immediately blocking the execution of the pick-and-place actions that are crucial for changing the objects' poses. It is essentially the gatekeeper to the robotic kinematics and its necessary functions. Furthermore, I've checked the allowed action instances, there's only a single `move_base` action, and it appears to simply set and reset the `canmove` flag. It effectively acts as a no-op as the movement does not change the pose nor can it be linked with the usage of pick and place actions.
           
           To summarize, my plan is to utilize the available actions to change each object's support to achieve the `on` predicates, but since the initial state lacks the kin predicates, the necessary pick and place actions can never be executed, and therefore the goal state is unachievable given the current set of constraints.
           
           I've rechecked the initial state and the provided actions, confirming there's no way to generate or introduce the necessary `kin` information, and no other actions that are currently viable. I'm essentially stuck with a problem that's unsolvable in the current state.
