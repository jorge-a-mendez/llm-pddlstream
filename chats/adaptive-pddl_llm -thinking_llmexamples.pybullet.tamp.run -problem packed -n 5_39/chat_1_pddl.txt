(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal: Objects on v20**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The goal is straightforward: get those five objects – v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 – all resting on v20.  Right now, they're sitting pretty on v11.  The tools I have at my disposal?  `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  But, let's be realistic, `clean` and `cook` aren't going to help me with this. My expertise tells me I need to be using `pick` and `place` actions to move these things around.
           
           I've scoped out the scene. The objects can interact with my arm v4. I know where they currently "live" (v9 for v8, v13 for v12, and so on) and I know where I want them to live, which is "pose #o2" on top of v20.  I have the "kin" facts I need – those tell me which poses are reachable. Good to go there.
           
           My plan was simple. Pick each object up from its current spot on v11, move it to v20, and place it down on the target pose.
           
           However, here's the kicker. The instruction is strict: "Only use the provided action instances." Well, there's only one. And it's not a `pick` or a `place`. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the robot's base... from where it is to... the exact same place! This is useless for this task. There are no available `pick` and `place` instances that fit my plan.
           
           Without a mechanism to actually pick up and put down objects, I am completely stuck.  The goal is, effectively, unachievable. There is no way I can change the state of the objects given the actions I am permitted to take. This seems like an obvious mistake in setting up the task.
