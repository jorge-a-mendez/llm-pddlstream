(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for generating 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0. My goal is to ensure each placement is *stable*, meaning the object's fully contained within the surface, and to generate a diverse set of positions and orientations.
           
           First, I've got a square surface, 0.27m x 0.27m centered at the origin.  The object, which is practically a square with dimensions of roughly 0.0829m x 0.0829m, can rotate. I need to keep the object *completely* inside the surface for *every* placement.
           
           Since the object is almost a square, and the surface is a square, the greatest amount of space needed occurs when rotated by 45 degrees. The dimensions of the rotated object's bounding box are going to be a little bit more, but never outside of the 0.0829 * sqrt(2) or 0.1172 meters. Because surface 0.27 half-width is 0.135, and 0.1172/2 < 0.135, it's always possible to place the center of the object at (0,0) without collision.
           
           The challenge is to generate distinct placements that are also a bit diverse.
           Here's my strategy:
           
           1.  **Grid Placement with Key Angles:** I'm going to create a 3x3 grid of positions for a few key angles: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, and pi. This means I'll have 9 placements for each of these angles. I can guarantee these are stable because the surface half-width is larger than the maximum rotation half-width. This will give me a base of 45 placements.
           
           2.  **Central Placements with Novel Angles:**  I'll pick 5 new angles that aren't used in the grid to place the object at the origin. The range will be from 0 to 2*pi. This allows me to have unique stable placements. This gives me a total of 50.
           
           I'm confident this method gives a good spread of placements while guaranteeing stability and diversity in the orientations and positions of the object.

(Thoughts: **My approach to placing Object 5, avoiding Object 4:**
           
           Alright, I've got this. I need to figure out where to place this new object, ID 5, on Surface 0 without it crashing into Object 4, which is currently sitting pretty in the bottom-left corner.  Object 4's already accounted for, so I'm leveraging the knowledge of that successful placement.  I've got the dimensions and position of both objects, as well as the surface boundaries, all ready to go.
           
           Here's the plan: First, I'm going to determine if Object 5 even *fits* on the surface, regardless of the collision risk. It's a nearly square object, and even with some rotation (specifically, at pi/4), I can tell it will fit comfortably, with room to spare.
           
           Now, the important part: avoiding collisions.  Object 4 is, as I noted, snugly in the bottom-left.  To make sure I don't run into it, I need to make sure I *don't* overlap its rectangular bounding box. Since the bounding boxes are orthogonal, I can use the classic approach: if I put object 5's top edge above object 4's top edge, or its right edge to the right of object 4's right edge, I can make this placement safe. I will need to consider the amount of rotation.
           
           My strategy involves generating a series of potential placements for Object 5, then rigorously *checking* each one against a collision condition. I'll use a rotated bounding box and then calculate the minimum safe offsets.
           I'm going to generate a grid of potential placements, across various rotations (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, ...). I’ve decided to be precise with the collision check, using an appropriate epsilon value for comparisons.
           
           I know I can’t simply generate a grid and then filter. I have to design the grid with the *collision* in mind from the beginning.  I'll define the safe zones, and place my points accordingly.
           
           For each angle, I will pick from three values each for x and y. I will choose points in the top-right, or above and right of object 4. This is a robust approach. I'll take the first 50 points that I generate that don't collide.
           
           I'm confident this method will reliably find a set of 50 collision-free placements for Object 5.

(Thoughts: **My Task: Find 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I've been given a surface, Surface 0, which is a square region. My job is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 6 within this square, avoiding collisions with any existing objects. Right now, there are two objects placed: Object ID 4 and Object ID 5. I need to make sure my new placements don't overlap with either of these, or go outside the surface boundaries.
           
           **The Geometry**
           
           The surface itself is straightforward: a square with a center at (0,0) and a side length of 0.27, so its extents are from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Object ID 4 is already positioned. I have its dimensions and position: it takes up a square of approximately 0.083 by 0.083, centered at (-0.094, -0.094) (roughly in the bottom-left corner). Object ID 5, a square approximately 0.097 by 0.097, and is centered at (-0.086, 0).
           
           **Key Calculations**
           
           The core of this is about calculating the occupied space of the existing objects and ensuring Object 6 doesn't intrude on it. To do that, I'm defining the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) for each object. For any placement of Object 6, I'll calculate its AABB, and it can't intersect with the existing AABB's.
           
           For Object 6, I need to keep in mind its rotation. Because Object 6 is almost a square, this will impact the placement. I will compute the rotated width and height using:
           
           *   `hw_rot = (w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|) / 2`
           *   `hh_rot = (w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|) / 2`
           
           **Strategy: Placement Generation and Collision Checks**
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Generate candidate placements:** I'll generate a grid of potential centers for Object 6. I'll cover all surface using a good number of points.
           2.  **Rotation:** I'm also going to test object 6 at different orientations because that's crucial. I'll be sampling multiple angles, because the best rotation is unknown and might depend on the geometry.
           3.  **Collision checks:** For each potential placement (center position and rotation), I'll calculate the AABB of the rotated Object 6. Then I'll check it against the AABB's of Object 4 and Object 5. If it doesn't collide with them, it's a valid placement.
           
           **Optimization Considerations**
           
           The key to success is getting the balance right between coverage and filtering. I'll make the following considerations:
           
           1.  Given the obstacles being in the left side of the scene, I'm going to prefer points on the right.
           2.  I'll increase the grid density to find the points quicker, and reduce the number of checks, since checking is very time consuming.
           3.  I need at least 50 valid placements. If I don't find 50, then I'll use a fallback strategy where I try to place object in unoccipied regions.
           
           **Collision Detection**
           
           The actual collision check is straightforward: two AABBs overlap if their ranges overlap on both the x and y axes. This will be computed with an is_colliding function I created.
           
           In my calculations:
           
           *   Object 6: `w6 = 0.07969773449137046`, `h6 = 0.07969773449137041`
           *   Surface Bounds: `[-0.135, 0.135]` in both x and y
           
           The code is well-structured and efficient, and after running I'll have the list of 50 stable placements.
