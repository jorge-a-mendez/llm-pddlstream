           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. All of them are currently supported by `v11` and are at specific poses. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are initially handempty and at their respective home configurations. The robot's base is at `v3` and can move. The goal is to place all three objects (`v8`, `v12`, and `v14`) onto `v16`.
           
           Looking at the initial state and available actions, I see a few problems:
           1. The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change the state of the objects or the robot's grip. It only moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, effectively doing nothing useful for the goal.
           2. The goal requires placing objects, which would involve `pick` and `place` actions. However, no such actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances. Specifically, there are no `kin` facts that link an arm, an object, a pose, a grasp, a base configuration, and an arm trajectory that are *also* linked to a `pick` or `place` action instance.
           3. The `on` predicate, as defined by the axiom, requires `supported` and `atpose` facts. While there are `supported` facts for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16` (e.g., `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`), these are for continuous parameter `#o2`, which needs to be computed. Even if we assume a valid pose could be found, we would still need `atpose` actions to set the object at that pose, which would be achieved by a `place` action.
           
           Since no `pick` or `place` actions are available, and the only available action is a self-loop base movement, it's impossible to pick up any object from its current location (`v11`) and place it on `v16`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
