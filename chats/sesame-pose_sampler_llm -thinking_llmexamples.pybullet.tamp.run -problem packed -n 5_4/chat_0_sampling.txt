(Thoughts: **Understanding the Placement Task for Object ID 8**
           
           As a seasoned expert in geometric reasoning, I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for object ID 8, a square with dimensions approximately 0.091 x 0.091, on surface 0, a square with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). A stable placement requires the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) to be entirely within the surface's AABB.
           
           **Key Considerations and Assumptions**
           
           The crucial point is the interpretation of the object's dimensions and its rotation.  While the problem states that dimensions are those of the AABB, I'm assuming a more robust interpretation: that the given dimensions represent the *intrinsic* dimensions of the object and that when rotated, the effective AABB dimensions change. This means that at a 45-degree angle, the AABB effectively increases in size.  If my understanding is incorrect, and the *current* AABB dimensions are fixed, only the visual orientation changes.
           
           **Placement Strategy**
           
           To achieve the required variety of stable placements, I will use a multi-faceted approach:
           
           1.  **Varying Theta:** I'll include various rotation angles (theta) to ensure diverse orientations. I will use 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2
           2.  **Grid-Based Sampling:** For each theta, I'll calculate the *safe* region within the surface where the object can be placed. This safe region is smaller when using higher theta angles due to increased effective size. I will then utilize a grid-based approach to generate x, y coordinate positions
           3.  **Ensure Enough Points:** To obtain 50 total stable placements, I will generate 52 placements, and trim them to the requisite number.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of Implementation**
           
           1.  Calculate and set the dimensions
           2.  Then, for each rotation angle, I will compute safe regions and create grids to sample x, y positions.
           3.  Each (x, y, theta) is appended to a list
           4.  Then, I'll take first 50 stable placements for use.
           
           By utilizing these steps, the generated placements will be stable and diverse.

(Thoughts: **Scene Understanding and Placement Algorithm**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. We've got a new request to place object ID 7 on surface 0, which is a square region defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  A prior placement, object ID 8, is already in place at `(-0.0895, -0.0895)` with `theta = 0`.  This means it’s a square of size `(0.09097, 0.09097)` occupying the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since the new object is also a square `(0.07276, 0.07276)`, I need to ensure it's fully *inside* the surface and doesn't *collide* with the existing object.
           
           To do this, I will generate placements considering rotation angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, and pi/16. I'll need to calculate the bounding box or AABB of object 7 for each angle. With `theta = 0` or `theta = pi/2`, the AABB's side length is simply the object's original side length.  For other rotations, I will need to consider the diagonal.  We can calculate half-extent based on the sum of s/2 times the sum of the absolute values of the sin and cos of the rotation angle. This will result in an effective 'radius'.
           
           First, for each rotation angle, I will determine valid center point ranges. The AABB of the new placement must fit fully within the surface bounds, excluding object 8. Then, I will generate a grid of candidate center points. Since object 8 is located in the bottom left, the valid range for placement is quite constrained. I'll need to exclude potential placement centers that overlap.
           
           To efficiently check for collisions, I'll calculate the AABB of the potential new object based on its center point and the appropriate half-extent. I'll then compare this AABB against object 8's known AABB which is `[-0.135, -0.0440282712] x [-0.135, -0.0440282712]`. Two AABBs collide if their extents overlap in both X and Y. I have implemented a collision check that returns `True` if any overlap, excluding that point from the placement list.
           
           I will iterate through the candidates for each angle, applying a robust AABB-based collision check.  I must make sure no duplicate placements are created. I'll keep generating placements until I have 50 unique, stable ones.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm going to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, avoiding collisions with objects ID 8 and ID 7.**
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. I've got the dimensions and positions of the obstacles (objects 8 and 7) on the surface, including their rotations (which are currently 0). I can use their center points and dimensions to calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).  These AABBs will define the areas I need to avoid.
           
           Next, I know the size of object 5, which is a square with side length roughly 0.073 units.  I will have to figure out the effective AABB of object 5,  which will depend on the rotation angle I place it.
           
           The stability criteria are straightforward: object 5's AABB must fit within surface 0 and must not overlap with either of the obstacle AABBs.
           
           I'll use a collision-check function to see if two AABBs overlap. I'll need a systematic strategy to place object 5. My plan is to iterate through different rotation angles, starting with a grid of angles from 0 to pi, incrementing by pi/16.
           
           For each rotation, I'll calculate the half-dimensions of the rotated object 5. From that, I'll calculate the valid placement area on the surface, accounting for the object's rotation.  Within this area, I'll create a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates.
           
           For each potential placement, I'll calculate object 5's AABB. I'll then check for collisions against object 8 and object 7's AABBs. If no collisions are detected, that placement will be considered valid. I'll continue until I find 50 valid, non-overlapping placements.

(Thoughts: **My Solution for Stable Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable locations for Object ID 4 on Surface 0, ensuring no collisions with previously placed objects (IDs 8, 7, and 5). Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Scene Understanding:** The surface is a simple square AABB. I've calculated the AABBs for the obstacle objects, accounting for their positions and intrinsic dimensions, which simplifies collision detection.
           2.  **Stable Placement Criteria:** A stable placement means the rotated AABB of Object 4 fits entirely within the surface bounds and doesn't intersect with any obstacle AABB.
           3.  **Placement Strategy:** I'm generating candidate placements by iterating through various rotation angles (`theta`) from 0 to π/2, in steps of π/16, using a grid-based approach. For each `theta`, I calculate the rotated AABB's dimensions and the valid center range for Object 4. I then create a grid of potential `(x, y)` center coordinates, with a grid size depending on theta, and check for collision between each candidate's AABB and the obstacle AABBs.
           4.  **Collision Detection:** I'm using an efficient AABB overlap check to determine if any two AABBs intersect.
           5.  **Placement Generation and Validation:** The grid is created over free space. I prioritize areas farther from the obstacles. I iterate through the `theta` values and populate placements.
           6.  **Results:** I found 50 valid placements. The generated placements are evenly distributed across the surface and avoiding the existing obstacles.
