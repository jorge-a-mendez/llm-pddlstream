           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Base Configuration Constraint**
           
           Alright, I've got a clear picture of the task at hand. The primary goal is to achieve `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. This implies, essentially, placing all these objects on `v18`. From the initial state and the 'on' axiom, I know I'll need to satisfy both `supported(?o, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(?o, #o2)` for each object.
           
           Analyzing the current state, it's immediately apparent that all four objects are currently on `v11`, occupying various poses, and I need to move each of them onto `v18` at pose `#o2`. I can achieve this by picking them up from their current poses and placing them onto `v18`.
           
           Now, the robot has two arms: `v4` and `v6`. Arm `v4` seems to have the relevant `kin` facts for picking and placing these objects. Using the provided `kin` facts, it appears that for each object, I'll need to perform a `pick` action followed by a `place` action using arm `v4`.
           
           However, here's where the problem arises: the `kin` facts for both pick and place actions share a critical precondition – `atbconf(?q)`, where ?q is `#o3`. In other words, I need the robot's base to be in configuration `#o3` to execute these actions.
           
           The initial base configuration is `v3`, and the only base motion allowed is a no-op (moving from v3 back to v3 using trajectory #o0). Crucially, there's no way to reach the required base configuration `#o3` using the provided actions.
           
           Since achieving the necessary base configuration is a prerequisite for all relevant pick and place actions, and that configuration is unreachable, the task is inherently unsolvable with the provided actions and initial state. There is no way to achieve the goal state.
