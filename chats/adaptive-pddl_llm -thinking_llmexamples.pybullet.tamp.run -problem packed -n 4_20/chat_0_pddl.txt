           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so the goal is pretty straightforward: get four objects – v8, v12, v14, and v16 – all sitting on v18.  Easy peasy, right?  The "on" axiom is clear:  I need to make sure each object is supported by v18 and in the correct pose. I've already confirmed the correct poses exist for each.
           
           Now, let's break this down.  For each object, I'd ideally need a 'pick' and a 'place' action to move it to the right pose on v18.  That's how I could modify the `atpose` facts.  For example, v8 is currently *atpose(v8, v9)*, supported on v11, but I need *atpose(v8, #o2)* on v18. This is the same for the others.
           
           But here's the rub: my available actions are limited. I'm only given one action instance: `move_base`. It doesn't allow me to directly manipulate any of the objects' poses or their support relationships, thus I cannot move any object.
           
           And that's the kicker, isn't it?  I need `pick` and `place` actions to change these relationships and, critically, the list of valid action instances does not include them.  Without them, I can't modify the `atpose` facts.  My hands are tied.  It's a textbook case of a planning problem where the necessary actions are simply not permitted. The goal is unreachable given the current action instances.  We can stop here.
