           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.165, 0.37), (0.252, 0.457)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.068, -0.341), (0.029, -0.244)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.213, 0.186), (-0.124, 0.275)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.265, -0.421), (-0.167, -0.324)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.209, 0.413, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.599, 0.8).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.019, -0.292, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.464, 0.886).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.169, 0.231, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.987, 0.163).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.216, -0.373, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.883, -0.469).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Plan to Achieve Goal: All Objects on v18**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: get those four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. Currently, they're all hanging out on v11. Since I can't just magically teleport them, it's pick-and-place time!
           
           My strategy is this: for each object, I'll *pick* it up from its current location on v11, move it to a *new* pose supported by v18 (that's my target), and then *place* it there. I need to make sure to define the poses, and that `#o2` is a set of specific poses.  I know that `#o2` is the type. I am calling these positions `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, `#o2_v14` and `#o2_v16`.
           
           The initial state tells me the robot arm (v4) is handempty and at a specific base config (v3). I'll need to move the robot base before each pick and place, so I am moving it to a general base configuration, labeled `#o3`.
           
           Let's break down the process for object v8:
           1.  **Move Base:**  Move robot to the base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick v8:** Pick up v8 from its current pose.
           3.  **Place v8:** Place v8 onto the new pose, on v18.
           
           This sequence needs to be repeated for v12, v14, and v16. However, the move base only happens once.
           
           I have actions I can perform, including moving the base and picking and placing objects.  It seems the cost of each pick and place is 1. The cost of a move is the distance between base configurations. I will place each object on the surface `v18`.
           
           So, the plan's structure looks like this:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** Move to base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and Place v8**
           3.  **Pick and Place v12**
           4.  **Pick and Place v14**
           5.  **Pick and Place v16**
           
           The key here is those "#o2" poses.  Since I'm told to give specific, collision-free, stable placements, and I've been given some poses for all the objects, I can arrange them on the surface.
           
           I've determined a base configuration for the robot which is `(-0.5, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           My pose will be `#o2`, which will be at the following coordinates on `v18`:
           
           *   `#o2_v8`: (0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `#o2_v12`: (-0.05, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `#o2_v14`: (0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   `#o2_v16`: (-0.05, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these poses, and after all objects have been correctly moved, the goal condition will be met. The total cost is `8.5` ( 0.5 for the base move, and 1 for each pick and place).
