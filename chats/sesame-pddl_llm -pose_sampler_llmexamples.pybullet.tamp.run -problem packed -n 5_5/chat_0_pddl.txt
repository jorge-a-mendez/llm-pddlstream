           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 7) -- 0.07137817018427728, 0.07137817018427728)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0714 x 0.0714. This means the object is significantly smaller than the surface, allowing for many possible stable placements.
           
           Given that the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its bounding box, meaning any angle will result in the same footprint. Therefore, I will primarily use a theta of 0 for simplicity.
           
           I need to place the object within the bounds of the surface `0`. The surface spans from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. The object has a half-size of approximately 0.03569 in both x and y.
           
           For a stable placement, the object's center `(x, y)` must satisfy:
           `surface_lower_x + object_half_size_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object_half_size_x`
           `surface_lower_y + object_half_size_y <= y <= surface_upper_y - object_half_size_y`
           
           So for surface 0:
           `-0.135 + 0.03569 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.03569`
           `-0.09931 <= x <= 0.09931`
           
           `-0.135 + 0.03569 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.03569`
           `-0.09931 <= y <= 0.09931`
           
           I will generate a diverse set of placements within this range, varying both position and orientation. I will use a mix of centered placements, placements near the edges, and some with non-zero rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           A previous object (ID 7), also square, was successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. This object has a size of approximately 0.0714 x 0.0714.
           
           The new object (ID 4) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0802 x 0.0802.
           
           I need to place object ID 4 on surface 0, ensuring it is stable and *does not collide with object ID 7*.
           
           Object 7 is centered at (0,0) with half-extents of approx 0.0357. Its bounding box is approximately `(-0.0357, -0.0357)` to `(0.0357, 0.0357)`.
           
           For object ID 4, its half-extents are approximately 0.0401.
           The allowed placement region on surface 0 for object ID 4 is:
           `surface_lower_x + object4_half_size_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object4_half_size_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.0401 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0401`
           `-0.0949 <= x <= 0.0949`
           
           Similarly for y:
           `-0.0949 <= y <= 0.0949`
           
           To avoid collision with object 7, the new object's bounding box must not overlap with object 7's bounding box.
           Object 7's AABB: `x_min_7 = -0.0357, x_max_7 = 0.0357, y_min_7 = -0.0357, y_max_7 = 0.0357`
           Object 4's AABB (centered at `(x,y)` with half-extents `hx4, hy4`):
           `x_min_4 = x - hx4, x_max_4 = x + hx4, y_min_4 = y - hy4, y_max_4 = y + hy4`
           `hx4 = 0.0401, hy4 = 0.0401`
           
           Collision occurs if:
           `(x_min_4 < x_max_7 AND x_max_4 > x_min_7) AND (y_min_4 < y_max_7 AND y_max_4 > y_min_7)`
           
           So, to avoid collision, I need to ensure that the x or y interval of object 4 does not overlap with object 7.
           This means:
           `x + 0.0401 <= -0.0357` (object 4 is completely to the left of object 7) -> `x <= -0.0758`
           OR
           `x - 0.0401 >= 0.0357` (object 4 is completely to the right of object 7) -> `x >= 0.0758`
           OR
           `y + 0.0401 <= -0.0357` (object 4 is completely below object 7) -> `y <= -0.0758`
           OR
           `y - 0.0401 >= 0.0357` (object 4 is completely above object 7) -> `y >= 0.0758`
           
           Combining the surface bounds `(-0.0949 to 0.0949)` with the collision avoidance conditions:
           For x-dimension: valid x are `[-0.0949, -0.0758]` and `[0.0758, 0.0949]`.
           For y-dimension: valid y are `[-0.0949, -0.0758]` and `[0.0758, 0.0949]`.
           
           I will try to place the object in the corners or along the edges of the allowed region, outside of object 7.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           There are two previously placed objects:
           - Object 7 (size ~0.0714): placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Half-extents ~0.0357.
             AABB: `(-0.0357, -0.0357)` to `(0.0357, 0.0357)`.
           - Object 4 (size ~0.0802): placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)`. Half-extents ~0.0401.
             AABB: `(0.08 - 0.0401, 0.08 - 0.0401)` to `(0.08 + 0.0401, 0.08 + 0.0401)`
             `(~0.0399, ~0.0399)` to `(~0.1201, ~0.1201)`.
           
           The new object (ID 6) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0931 x 0.0931. Its half-extents are approximately 0.04656.
           
           I need to place object ID 6 on surface 0, ensuring it is stable and *does not collide with object ID 7 or object ID 4*.
           
           First, determine the allowed placement region on surface 0 for object ID 6:
           `surface_lower_x + object6_half_size_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object6_half_size_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.04656 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.04656`
           `-0.08844 <= x <= 0.08844`
           
           Similarly for y:
           `-0.08844 <= y <= 0.08844`
           
           Now, consider collision avoidance with Object 7 (AABB: `(-0.0357, -0.0357)` to `(0.0357, 0.0357)`) and Object 4 (AABB: `(0.0399, 0.0399)` to `(0.1201, 0.1201)`).
           Object 6 half-extents (`hx6, hy6`) are `0.04656`.
           
           Collision with Object 7 (center (0,0)):
           `x + hx6 <= -0.0357` -> `x <= -0.0357 - 0.04656` -> `x <= -0.08226`
           OR
           `x - hx6 >= 0.0357` -> `x >= 0.0357 + 0.04656` -> `x >= 0.08226`
           OR
           `y + hy6 <= -0.0357` -> `y <= -0.08226`
           OR
           `y - hy6 >= 0.0357` -> `y >= 0.08226`
           
           Collision with Object 4 (center (0.08, 0.08)):
           Let object 4's half extents be `hx4 = 0.0401`.
           `x + hx6 <= 0.08 - hx4` -> `x <= 0.08 - 0.0401 - 0.04656` -> `x <= -0.00666`
           OR
           `x - hx6 >= 0.08 + hx4` -> `x >= 0.08 + 0.0401 + 0.04656` -> `x >= 0.16666` (This is outside surface bounds for x)
           OR
           `y + hy6 <= 0.08 - hy4` -> `y <= -0.00666`
           OR
           `y - hy6 >= 0.08 + hy4` -> `y >= 0.16666` (This is outside surface bounds for y)
           
           Considering the surface bounds `x, y in [-0.08844, 0.08844]`:
           
           From O7:
           `x in [-0.08844, -0.08226]` or `x in [0.08226, 0.08844]`
           `y in [-0.08844, -0.08226]` or `y in [0.08226, 0.08844]`
           
           From O4 (center (0.08, 0.08)):
           `x <= -0.00666` (considering surface bounds: `x in [-0.08844, -0.00666]`)
           `y <= -0.00666` (considering surface bounds: `y in [-0.08844, -0.00666]`)
           
           Combining all:
           The only remaining possible regions are where `x` is negative and `y` is negative, specifically far from the origin and far from (0.08, 0.08).
           `x in [-0.08844, -0.08226]` (from O7) and `x in [-0.08844, -0.00666]` (from O4). Intersection is `x in [-0.08844, -0.08226]`.
           `y in [-0.08844, -0.08226]` (from O7) and `y in [-0.08844, -0.00666]` (from O4). Intersection is `y in [-0.08844, -0.08226]`.
           
           This means the only valid placement region for the center of object 6, given the current information, is in the very bottom-left corner of the surface, close to `(-0.088, -0.088)`.
           Let's pick a point in this small range. For example, `(-0.085, -0.085)`.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           There are three previously placed objects:
           - Object 7 (size ~0.0714): placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Half-extents ~0.0357.
             AABB_7: `(-0.0357, -0.0357)` to `(0.0357, 0.0357)`.
           - Object 4 (size ~0.0802): placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)`. Half-extents ~0.0401.
             AABB_4: `(0.0399, 0.0399)` to `(0.1201, 0.1201)`.
           - Object 6 (size ~0.0931): placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085)`. Half-extents ~0.04656.
             AABB_6: `(-0.085 - 0.04656, -0.085 - 0.04656)` to `(-0.085 + 0.04656, -0.085 + 0.04656)`
             `(-0.13156, -0.13156)` to `(-0.03844, -0.03844)`.
           
           The new object (ID 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0988 x 0.0988. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0494.
           
           I need to place object ID 5 on surface 0, ensuring it is stable and *does not collide with object ID 7, 4, or 6*.
           
           First, determine the allowed placement region on surface 0 for object ID 5:
           `surface_lower_x + object5_half_size_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object5_half_size_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.0494 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0494`
           `-0.0856 <= x <= 0.0856`
           
           Similarly for y:
           `-0.0856 <= y <= 0.0856`
           
           Now, consider collision avoidance with:
           - Object 7 (center (0,0), hx7=0.0357)
           - Object 4 (center (0.08, 0.08), hx4=0.0401)
           - Object 6 (center (-0.085, -0.085), hx6=0.04656)
           
           Object 5 half-extents (`hx5, hy5`) are `0.0494`.
           
           Collision with Object 7:
           `x + hx5 <= -hx7` -> `x <= -0.0357 - 0.0494` -> `x <= -0.0851`
           OR
           `x - hx5 >= hx7` -> `x >= 0.0357 + 0.0494` -> `x >= 0.0851`
           OR
           `y + hy5 <= -hy7` -> `y <= -0.0851`
           OR
           `y - hy5 >= hy7` -> `y >= 0.0851`
           
           Considering surface bounds `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`:
           For x-dimension: `x in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` or `x in [0.0851, 0.0856]`
           For y-dimension: `y in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` or `y in [0.0851, 0.0856]`
           This means object 5 must be in the extreme corners (or very narrow strips) to avoid object 7.
           
           Collision with Object 4 (center (0.08, 0.08)):
           `x + hx5 <= 0.08 - hx4` -> `x <= 0.08 - 0.0401 - 0.0494` -> `x <= -0.0095`
           OR
           `x - hx5 >= 0.08 + hx4` -> `x >= 0.08 + 0.0401 + 0.0494` -> `x >= 0.1695` (Outside surface bounds)
           OR
           `y + hy5 <= 0.08 - hy4` -> `y <= -0.0095`
           OR
           `y - hy5 >= 0.08 + hy4` -> `y >= 0.1695` (Outside surface bounds)
           
           From O4, considering surface bounds `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`:
           `x in [-0.0856, -0.0095]`
           `y in [-0.0856, -0.0095]`
           
           Collision with Object 6 (center (-0.085, -0.085)):
           `x + hx5 <= -0.085 - hx6` -> `x <= -0.085 - 0.04656 - 0.0494` -> `x <= -0.18096` (Outside surface bounds)
           OR
           `x - hx5 >= -0.085 + hx6` -> `x >= -0.085 + 0.04656 + 0.0494` -> `x >= 0.01096`
           OR
           `y + hy5 <= -0.085 - hy6` -> `y <= -0.18096` (Outside surface bounds)
           OR
           `y - hy5 >= -0.085 + hy6` -> `y >= 0.01096`
           
           From O6, considering surface bounds `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`:
           `x in [0.01096, 0.0856]`
           `y in [0.01096, 0.0856]`
           
           Now, combining all conditions:
           - From surface bounds: `x, y in [-0.0856, 0.0856]`
           - From O7: `x in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` or `x in [0.0851, 0.0856]`
           - From O7: `y in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` or `y in [0.0851, 0.0856]`
           - From O4: `x in [-0.0856, -0.0095]`
           - From O4: `y in [-0.0856, -0.0095]`
           - From O6: `x in [0.01096, 0.0856]`
           - From O6: `y in [0.01096, 0.0856]`
           
           Let's find the intersection for x:
           `( [-0.0856, -0.0851] U [0.0851, 0.0856] ) INTERSECT [-0.0856, -0.0095] INTERSECT [0.01096, 0.0856]`
           
           The interval `[-0.0856, -0.0095]` (from O4) means `x` must be negative.
           The interval `[0.01096, 0.0856]` (from O6) means `x` must be positive.
           These two conditions for `x` are mutually exclusive. Their intersection is empty.
           
           This means, given the current information, there are no stable placements for object 5 that avoid all three existing objects. This is a crucial piece of information. Since I *never give up*, I will generate placements based on the largest available regions considering only *some* of the obstacles, starting with the surface and the largest obstacles first, hoping that a less restrictive definition of "stable" (e.g., in terms of only fixed obstacles, and the previous ones were *non-fixed*) might lead to success. However, the prompt clearly states "does not collide with any of the fixed obstacles in the scene" and implies the provided successes are fixed. The problem is that my calculation says there are no valid positions. This means either my calculations are too conservative, or I missed some nuance, or the problem is actually unsolvable with the given information.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the collision logic very carefully.
           AABB collision means `(box1.x_max > box2.x_min AND box1.x_min < box2.x_max)` and `(box1.y_max > box2.y_min AND box1.y_min < box2.y_max)`.
           To *avoid* collision, it means NOT this. So, `(box1.x_max <= box2.x_min OR box1.x_min >= box2.x_max) OR (box1.y_max <= box2.y_min OR box1.y_min >= box2.y_max)`.
           This is where my previous calculation seems to be stricter. I was calculating "object 4 is completely to the left of object 7", which is one of the *four* ways to avoid collision *along one axis*.
           
           Let's recalculate the *allowed zones* (not collision zones) more accurately.
           Object 5 (center `(x,y)`, hx5=0.0494).
           
           Surface Bounds: `x,y in [-0.0856, 0.0856]`
           
           Object 7 (center (0,0), hx7=0.0357)
           Collision with O7 means: `(x-hx5 < hx7 AND x+hx5 > -hx7)` AND `(y-hy5 < hy7 AND y+hy5 > -hy7)`
           i.e., `(x < hx7+hx5 AND x > -hx7-hx5)` AND `(y < hy7+hy5 AND y > -hy7-hy5)`
           i.e., `(x < 0.0357+0.0494 AND x > -0.0357-0.0494)` AND `(y < 0.0357+0.0494 AND y > -0.0357-0.0494)`
           i.e., `(x < 0.0851 AND x > -0.0851)` AND `(y < 0.0851 AND y > -0.0851)`
           So, to avoid O7: `x <= -0.0851` OR `x >= 0.0851` OR `y <= -0.0851` OR `y >= 0.0851`.
           
           Object 4 (center (0.08, 0.08), hx4=0.0401)
           Collision with O4 means: `(x-hx5 < 0.08+hx4 AND x+hx5 > 0.08-hx4)` AND `(y-hy5 < 0.08+hy4 AND y+hy5 > 0.08-hy4)`
           i.e., `(x < 0.08+0.0401+0.0494 AND x > 0.08-0.0401-0.0494)` AND `(y < 0.08+0.0401+0.0494 AND y > 0.08-0.0401-0.0494)`
           i.e., `(x < 0.1695 AND x > -0.0095)` AND `(y < 0.1695 AND y > -0.0095)`
           So, to avoid O4: `x <= -0.0095` OR `x >= 0.1695` OR `y <= -0.0095` OR `y >= 0.1695`.
           Considering surface bounds for x and y `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`, the `x >= 0.1695` and `y >= 0.1695` options are not possible.
           So, to avoid O4 within surface bounds: `x <= -0.0095` OR `y <= -0.0095`.
           
           Object 6 (center (-0.085, -0.085), hx6=0.04656)
           Collision with O6 means: `(x-hx5 < -0.085+hx6 AND x+hx5 > -0.085-hx6)` AND `(y-hy5 < -0.085+hy6 AND y+hy5 > -0.085-hy6)`
           i.e., `(x < -0.085+0.04656+0.0494 AND x > -0.085-0.04656-0.0494)` AND `(y < -0.085+0.04656+0.0494 AND y > -0.085-0.04656-0.0494)`
           i.e., `(x < 0.01096 AND x > -0.18096)` AND `(y < 0.01096 AND y > -0.18096)`
           So, to avoid O6: `x <= -0.18096` OR `x >= 0.01096` OR `y <= -0.18096` OR `y >= 0.01096`.
           Considering surface bounds for x and y `[-0.0856, 0.0856]`, the `x <= -0.18096` and `y <= -0.18096` options are not possible.
           So, to avoid O6 within surface bounds: `x >= 0.01096` OR `y >= 0.01096`.
           
           Summary of constraints for (x,y) of object 5, within `[-0.0856, 0.0856]^2`:
           1. Avoid O7: `(x <= -0.0851 OR x >= 0.0851)` OR `(y <= -0.0851 OR y >= 0.0851)`
           2. Avoid O4: `x <= -0.0095` OR `y <= -0.0095`
           3. Avoid O6: `x >= 0.01096` OR `y >= 0.01096`
           
           Let's try to find regions.
           Suppose `x` is positive. Then from (2), `y <= -0.0095` must hold.
           Suppose `x` is positive and `x >= 0.01096`. Then from (3), the condition is met.
           Now check (1) with `x` positive (and within bounds, `x in [0.01096, 0.0856]`). This implies `x >= 0.0851` must hold or `y <= -0.0851` or `y >= 0.0851`.
           
           Let's try to place it in one of the clear quadrants.
           Upper Right Quadrant (Positive X, Positive Y) for object center:
           If `x >= 0.01096` and `y >= 0.01096`.
           From (2): Must satisfy `x <= -0.0095` OR `y <= -0.0095`. This is impossible in this quadrant.
           So, no placements in the upper right quadrant if we assume `x > 0.01096` AND `y > 0.01096`.
           
           Upper Left Quadrant (Negative X, Positive Y) for object center:
           If `x <= -0.0095` and `y >= 0.01096`.
           From (3): Must satisfy `x >= 0.01096` OR `y >= 0.01096`. This condition is satisfied by `y >= 0.01096`.
           From (2): `x <= -0.0095` is satisfied.
           From (1): `(x <= -0.0851 OR x >= 0.0851)` OR `(y <= -0.0851 OR y >= 0.0851)`
           Given `x <= -0.0095` and `y >= 0.01096`:
           The options `x >= 0.0851` and `y <= -0.0851` are impossible.
           So we need `x <= -0.0851` OR `y >= 0.0851`.
           
           So, for Upper Left: we need `x in [-0.0856, -0.0095]` AND `y in [0.01096, 0.0856]`.
           And from (1), additionally `(x <= -0.0851 OR y >= 0.0851)` must hold.
           
           Combining:
           Region 1: `x in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` AND `y in [0.01096, 0.0856]`
           Region 2: `x in [-0.0856, -0.0095]` AND `y in [0.0851, 0.0856]`
           
           Let's pick a point in Region 1: `x = -0.0855`, `y = 0.05` (e.g. midpoint of y range).
           Let's pick a point in Region 2: `x = -0.05`, `y = 0.0855`.
           
           Symmetrically for the other "empty" quadrants:
           Lower Left Quadrant (Negative X, Negative Y): `x <= -0.0095` AND `y <= -0.0095`.
           From (3): Must satisfy `x >= 0.01096` OR `y >= 0.01096`. This is impossible.
           So, no placements in the lower left quadrant where object 6 is located. (This makes sense, object 6 is there).
           
           Lower Right Quadrant (Positive X, Negative Y): `x >= 0.01096` AND `y <= -0.0095`.
           From (2): Must satisfy `x <= -0.0095` OR `y <= -0.0095`. This condition is satisfied by `y <= -0.0095`.
           From (3): `x >= 0.01096` is satisfied.
           From (1): `(x <= -0.0851 OR x >= 0.0851)` OR `(y <= -0.0851 OR y >= 0.0851)`
           Given `x >= 0.01096` and `y <= -0.0095`:
           The options `x <= -0.0851` and `y >= 0.0851` are impossible.
           So we need `x >= 0.0851` OR `y <= -0.0851`.
           
           So, for Lower Right: we need `x in [0.01096, 0.0856]` AND `y in [-0.0856, -0.0095]`.
           And from (1), additionally `(x >= 0.0851 OR y <= -0.0851)` must hold.
           
           Combining:
           Region 3: `x in [0.0851, 0.0856]` AND `y in [-0.0856, -0.0095]`
           Region 4: `x in [0.01096, 0.0856]` AND `y in [-0.0856, -0.0851]`
           
           Let's pick a point in Region 3: `x = 0.0855`, `y = -0.05`.
           Let's pick a point in Region 4: `x = 0.05`, `y = -0.0855`.
           
           So, the four corners are essentially where the object must be. This is a very tight fit.
           
           Let's generate placements based on these identified regions.
           Mid-range values within these small regions:
           Region 1: `x = -0.0855, y = 0.05`
           Region 2: `x = -0.05, y = 0.0855`
           Region 3: `x = 0.0855, y = -0.05`
           Region 4: `x = 0.05, y = -0.0855`
           
           Let's also try points very close to the edge of the surface (but within the bounds for the object).
           Surface max extent for object 5 is `0.0856`.
           `x_edge_neg = -0.0856 + 0.0494 = -0.135` (object left edge)
           `x_edge_pos = 0.135 - 0.0494 = 0.0856` (object right edge)
           
           Let's try `x = -0.0855` and `y = 0.0855`.
           For `x = -0.0855`: This falls into `x in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` (from O7) and `x in [-0.0856, -0.0095]` (from O4).
           For `y = 0.0855`: This falls into `y in [0.0851, 0.0856]` (from O7) and `y in [0.01096, 0.0856]` (from O6).
           This combination `(-0.0855, 0.0855)` satisfies all conditions.
           It is `x <= -0.0851` and `y >= 0.0851`. So it avoids O7.
           It is `x <= -0.0095`. So it avoids O4.
           It is `y >= 0.01096`. So it avoids O6.
           This seems like a solid candidate.
           
           Symmetrically, `(0.0855, -0.0855)` also seems valid.
           `x = 0.0855`: `x in [0.0851, 0.0856]` (from O7) and `x in [0.01096, 0.0856]` (from O6).
           `y = -0.0855`: `y in [-0.0856, -0.0851]` (from O7) and `y in [-0.0856, -0.0095]` (from O4).
           This combination `(0.0855, -0.0855)` satisfies all conditions.
           It is `x >= 0.0851` and `y <= -0.0851`. So it avoids O7.
           It is `y <= -0.0095`. So it avoids O4.
           It is `x >= 0.01096`. So it avoids O6.
           
           Let's generate placements in these two corner regions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           There are four previously placed objects:
           - Object 7 (size ~0.0714): placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Half-extents ~0.0357.
             AABB_7: `(-0.0357, -0.0357)` to `(0.0357, 0.0357)`.
           - Object 4 (size ~0.0802): placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)`. Half-extents ~0.0401.
             AABB_4: `(0.0399, 0.0399)` to `(0.1201, 0.1201)`.
           - Object 6 (size ~0.0931): placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.085, -0.085)`. Half-extents ~0.04656.
             AABB_6: `(-0.13156, -0.13156)` to `(-0.03844, -0.03844)`.
           - Object 5 (size ~0.0988): placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.0855, 0.0855)`. Half-extents ~0.0494.
             AABB_5: `(-0.0855 - 0.0494, 0.0855 - 0.0494)` to `(-0.0855 + 0.0494, 0.0855 + 0.0494)`
             `(-0.1349, 0.0361)` to `(-0.0361, 0.1349)`.
           
           The new object (ID 8) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.0711 x 0.0711. Its half-extents are approximately 0.03555.
           
           I need to place object ID 8 on surface 0, ensuring it is stable and *does not collide with object ID 7, 4, 6, or 5*.
           
           First, determine the allowed placement region on surface 0 for object ID 8:
           `surface_lower_x + object8_half_size_x <= x <= surface_upper_x - object8_half_size_x`
           `-0.135 + 0.03555 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.03555`
           `-0.09945 <= x <= 0.09945`
           
           Similarly for y:
           `-0.09945 <= y <= 0.09945`
           
           Now, consider collision avoidance with:
           - Object 7 (center (0,0), hx7=0.0357)
           - Object 4 (center (0.08, 0.08), hx4=0.0401)
           - Object 6 (center (-0.085, -0.085), hx6=0.04656)
           - Object 5 (center (-0.0855, 0.0855), hx5=0.0494)
           
           Object 8 half-extents (`hx8, hy8`) are `0.03555`.
           
           Collision Avoidance Logic (X-axis for example):
           Object `i` with center `(xi, yi)` and half-extents `hxi, hyi`.
           Object `j` with center `(xj, yj)` and half-extents `hxj, hyj`.
           Collision in X if `abs(xi - xj) < hxi + hxj`.
           To avoid collision in X: `abs(xi - xj) >= hxi + hxj`.
           This means `xi <= xj - (hxi + hxj)` OR `xi >= xj + (hxi + hxj)`.
           
           1. Avoid Object 7 (center (0,0), hx7=0.0357):
              `abs(x - 0) >= hx8 + hx7` -> `abs(x) >= 0.03555 + 0.0357` -> `abs(x) >= 0.07125`
              So, `x <= -0.07125` OR `x >= 0.07125`.
              Similarly for y: `y <= -0.07125` OR `y >= 0.07125`.
           
           2. Avoid Object 4 (center (0.08, 0.08), hx4=0.0401):
              `abs(x - 0.08) >= hx8 + hx4` -> `abs(x - 0.08) >= 0.03555 + 0.0401` -> `abs(x - 0.08) >= 0.07565`
              So, `x - 0.08 <= -0.07565` OR `x - 0.08 >= 0.07565`
              `x <= 0.08 - 0.07565` OR `x >= 0.08 + 0.07565`
              `x <= 0.00435` OR `x >= 0.15565`
              Similarly for y: `y <= 0.00435` OR `y >= 0.15565`. (Note: `0.15565` is outside surface bounds `0.09945`).
              So, for O4, x-avoidance means `x <= 0.00435`. y-avoidance means `y <= 0.00435`.
           
           3. Avoid Object 6 (center (-0.085, -0.085), hx6=0.04656):
              `abs(x - (-0.085)) >= hx8 + hx6` -> `abs(x + 0.085) >= 0.03555 + 0.04656` -> `abs(x + 0.085) >= 0.08211`
              So, `x + 0.085 <= -0.08211` OR `x + 0.085 >= 0.08211`
              `x <= -0.085 - 0.08211` OR `x >= -0.085 + 0.08211`
              `x <= -0.16711` OR `x >= -0.00289`
              Similarly for y: `y <= -0.16711` OR `y >= -0.00289`. (Note: `-0.16711` is outside surface bounds `-0.09945`).
              So, for O6, x-avoidance means `x >= -0.00289`. y-avoidance means `y >= -0.00289`.
           
           4. Avoid Object 5 (center (-0.0855, 0.0855), hx5=0.0494):
              `abs(x - (-0.0855)) >= hx8 + hx5` -> `abs(x + 0.0855) >= 0.03555 + 0.0494` -> `abs(x + 0.0855) >= 0.08495`
              So, `x + 0.0855 <= -0.08495` OR `x + 0.0855 >= 0.08495`
              `x <= -0.0855 - 0.08495` OR `x >= -0.0855 + 0.08495`
              `x <= -0.17045` OR `x >= -0.00055`
              Similarly for y: `abs(y - 0.0855) >= hy8 + hy5` -> `abs(y - 0.0855) >= 0.08495`
              `y - 0.0855 <= -0.08495` OR `y - 0.0855 >= 0.08495`
              `y <= 0.0855 - 0.08495` OR `y >= 0.0855 + 0.08495`
              `y <= 0.00055` OR `y >= 0.17045`
              Considering surface bounds `[-0.09945, 0.09945]`:
              For O5, x-avoidance means `x >= -0.00055`.
              For O5, y-avoidance means `y <= 0.00055`.
           
           Summary of constraints for (x,y) of object 8, within `[-0.09945, 0.09945]^2`:
           1. Avoid O7: `(x <= -0.07125 OR x >= 0.07125)` OR `(y <= -0.07125 OR y >= 0.07125)`
           2. Avoid O4: `x <= 0.00435` OR `y <= 0.00435`
           3. Avoid O6: `x >= -0.00289` OR `y >= -0.00289`
           4. Avoid O5: `x >= -0.00055` OR `y <= 0.00055`
           
           Let's find regions by considering the `x` and `y` conditions separately and then combining them.
           
           From (2), (3), (4) for `x`:
           `x <= 0.00435` (from O4)
           `x >= -0.00289` (from O6)
           `x >= -0.00055` (from O5)
           
           Combining these `x` conditions: `x in [-0.00055, 0.00435]`. This is a very narrow range around x=0.
           
           From (2), (3), (4) for `y`:
           `y <= 0.00435` (from O4)
           `y >= -0.00289` (from O6)
           `y <= 0.00055` (from O5)
           
           Combining these `y` conditions: `y in [-0.00289, 0.00055]`. This is also a very narrow range around y=0.
           
           So, if we satisfy conditions (2), (3), (4) by restricting both `x` and `y` to these central narrow bands, we have the region:
           `x in [-0.00055, 0.00435]` AND `y in [-0.00289, 0.00055]`
           
           Now, check condition (1) for this region: `(x <= -0.07125 OR x >= 0.07125)` OR `(y <= -0.07125 OR y >= 0.07125)`.
           The `x` values `[-0.00055, 0.00435]` are NOT `x <= -0.07125` and NOT `x >= 0.07125`.
           The `y` values `[-0.00289, 0.00055]` are NOT `y <= -0.07125` and NOT `y >= 0.07125`.
           This means any point in the central region defined by (2),(3),(4) will collide with Object 7.
           
           This implies there is no valid placement if we rely on separating AABBs along both axes.
           This is again a situation where I should consider alternative interpretations or try different ways to fulfill the 'OR' conditions.
           
           Let's look at the logical structure again.
           We need to find (x,y) such that:
           (Surf_X AND Surf_Y) AND (Avoid_O7) AND (Avoid_O4) AND (Avoid_O6) AND (Avoid_O5)
           
           Where Avoid_Oi are disjunctions (OR statements).
           
           Consider the regions of potential collision:
           O7: `x in (-0.0851, 0.0851)` AND `y in (-0.0851, 0.0851)`
           O4: `x in (-0.0095, 0.1695)` AND `y in (-0.0095, 0.1695)`
           O6: `x in (-0.18096, 0.01096)` AND `y in (-0.18096, 0.01096)`
           O5: `x in (-0.17045, -0.00055)` AND `y in (0.00055, 0.17045)`
           
           This is getting complex. Let's simplify and try to place it in one of the remaining corners, if any, that haven't been occupied by other objects and are not too close to the existing objects.
           
           Let's focus on the upper right corner of the surface: `x > 0`, `y > 0`.
           Surface bounds: `x,y in [-0.09945, 0.09945]`.
           
           O7 avoidance: `x >= 0.07125` (since `x` is positive) or `y >= 0.07125` (since `y` is positive).
           O4 avoidance: `x <= 0.00435` or `y <= 0.00435`.
           O6 avoidance: `x >= -0.00289` (always true in this quadrant) or `y >= -0.00289` (always true in this quadrant).
           O5 avoidance: `x >= -0.00055` (always true in this quadrant) or `y <= 0.00055`.
           
           Let's try a point in the upper-right corner. The previous object 4 is at `(0.08, 0.08)`.
           The x-range for object 8 from O4 avoidance is `x <= 0.00435` or `x >= 0.15565`. Since the surface limit is `0.09945`, `x >= 0.15565` is not possible. So, we need `x <= 0.00435` for O4.
           Similarly, for y from O4: `y <= 0.00435`.
           This forces object 8 to be to the "left-bottom" of object 4.
           
           The problem implies there should be valid placements. My strict interpretation of the collision conditions, especially the ORs, is leading to dead ends. Maybe the fixed obstacles in the scene are *only* the objects that were placed first, and the subsequent ones that were "successfully placed" are "non-fixed" (collidable) for this specific object? No, the prompt says "did not collide with fixed obstacles" and "must avoid collision between objects i and j". So all previously placed objects are fixed for the current request.
           
           Let's re-examine the collision rule: two AABBs `[x1a, x1b] x [y1a, y1b]` and `[x2a, x2b] x [y2a, y2b]` collide if and only if `(x1a < x2b AND x1b > x2a)` AND `(y1a < y2b AND y1b > y2a)`.
           To avoid collision, the negation of this is true: `NOT ((x1a < x2b AND x1b > x2a) AND (y1a < y2b AND y1b > y2a))`.
           This is equivalent to `NOT (x1a < x2b AND x1b > x2a) OR NOT (y1a < y2b AND y1b > y2a)`.
           Which simplifies to `(x1b <= x2a OR x1a >= x2b) OR (y1b <= y2a OR y1a >= y2b)`.
           This is indeed what I am using (e.g., `x <= xj - (hxi + hxj)` OR `x >= xj + (hxi + hxj)` represents `(x1b <= x2a OR x1a >= x2b)` in a sense where `x` is the center of obj1 and `x_j` is center of obj2).
           
           Let me use the AABB min/max directly.
           Object 8: `x_min = x - 0.03555`, `x_max = x + 0.03555`, `y_min = y - 0.03555`, `y_max = y + 0.03555`.
           Surface `0`: `S_xmin = -0.135`, `S_xmax = 0.135`, `S_ymin = -0.135`, `S_ymax = 0.135`.
           For O8 to be on surface:
           `x_min >= S_xmin` -> `x - 0.03555 >= -0.135` -> `x >= -0.09945`
           `x_max <= S_xmax` -> `x + 0.03555 <= 0.135` -> `x <= 0.09945`
           So `x in [-0.09945, 0.09945]` and `y in [-0.09945, 0.09945]`. This is correct.
           
           Collision rectangles (ranges where object 8 *collides* with other objects):
           O7 (center (0,0), hx=0.0357): `C7_x = (-0.0357-0.03555, 0.0357+0.03555) = (-0.07125, 0.07125)`. Same for y.
           O4 (center (0.08,0.08), hx=0.0401): `C4_x = (0.08-0.0401-0.03555, 0.08+0.0401+0.03555) = (0.00435, 0.15565)`. Same for y.
           O6 (center (-0.085,-0.085), hx=0.04656): `C6_x = (-0.085-0.04656-0.03555, -0.085+0.04656+0.03555) = (-0.16711, -0.00289)`. Same for y.
           O5 (center (-0.0855,0.0855), hx=0.0494): `C5_x = (-0.0855-0.0494-0.03555, -0.0855+0.0494+0.03555) = (-0.17045, -0.00055)`.
           `C5_y = (0.0855-0.0494-0.03555, 0.0855+0.0494+0.03555) = (0.00055, 0.17045)`.
           
           To avoid collision with ALL objects, a point `(x,y)` must be such that *for each obstacle k*:
           `x` is NOT in `C_kx` OR `y` is NOT in `C_ky`.
           And `x` must be within `[-0.09945, 0.09945]`, `y` must be within `[-0.09945, 0.09945]`.
           
           Let's test potential positions using this.
           
           Try `x = 0.09`, `y = 0.09` (upper right corner of surface bounds for O8):
           1. With O7: `x=0.09` is in `C7_x=(-0.07125, 0.07125)`? No, `0.09` is greater. So `x` is NOT in `C7_x`. (OK)
           2. With O4: `x=0.09` is in `C4_x=(0.00435, 0.15565)`? Yes. `y=0.09` is in `C4_y=(0.00435, 0.15565)`? Yes. So collision with O4.
           Therefore `(0.09, 0.09)` is not valid.
           
           Try `x = 0.09`, `y = -0.09` (lower right corner):
           1. With O7: `x=0.09` is NOT in `C7_x`. (OK)
           2. With O4: `x=0.09` is in `C4_x=(0.00435, 0.15565)`? Yes. `y=-0.09` is in `C4_y=(0.00435, 0.15565)`? No. So avoid O4. (OK)
           3. With O6: `x=0.09` is NOT in `C6_x=(-0.16711, -0.00289)`. (OK)
           4. With O5: `x=0.09` is NOT in `C5_x=(-0.17045, -0.00055)`. (OK)
           This position `(0.09, -0.09)` looks promising! All conditions are met.
           
           Let's verify `(0.09, -0.09)`:
           Within surface bounds `[-0.09945, 0.09945]`? Yes.
           Avoids O7: `x = 0.09` is outside `(-0.07125, 0.07125)`. Condition `x outside C7_x` met. YES.
           Avoids O4: `x = 0.09` is inside `(0.00435, 0.15565)`. `y = -0.09` is outside `(0.00435, 0.15565)`. Condition `(x outside C4_x OR y outside C4_y)` met because `y outside C4_y`. YES.
           Avoids O6: `x = 0.09` is outside `(-0.16711, -0.00289)`. Condition `x outside C6_x` met. YES.
           Avoids O5: `x = 0.09` is outside `(-0.17045, -0.00055)`. Condition `x outside C5_x` met. YES.
           
           This confirms that `(0.09, -0.09)` is a valid placement. My previous reasoning with intersecting allowed regions was too strict because of how the `OR` clauses interact. I should generate placements based on specific locations rather than trying to define a continuous region that satisfies all `OR` conditions simultaneously.
           
           Let's try its symmetric counterpart `(-0.09, 0.09)` (upper left corner):
           1. With O7: `y = 0.09` is NOT in `C7_y`. (OK)
           2. With O4: `y = 0.09` is in `C4_y`. `x = -0.09` is NOT in `C4_x`. (OK)
           3. With O6: `y = 0.09` is NOT in `C6_y`. (OK)
           4. With O5: `y = 0.09` is in `C5_y`. `x = -0.09` is in `C5_x`. Collision with O5.
           So, `(-0.09, 0.09)` is *not* valid because of collision with O5.
           
           This means the upper-left corner of the surface is occupied by O5 itself!
           AABB_5: `(-0.1349, 0.0361)` to `(-0.0361, 0.1349)`.
           If Object 8 center is `(-0.09, 0.09)`, its AABB is `(-0.09-0.03555, -0.09+0.03555)` to `(0.09-0.03555, 0.09+0.03555)`.
           AABB_8: `(-0.12555, 0.05445)` to `(-0.05445, 0.12555)`.
           AABB_5 and AABB_8 overlap:
           x-overlap: `(-0.1349, -0.0361)` and `(-0.12555, -0.05445)`. Yes, `max(-0.1349, -0.12555) < min(-0.0361, -0.05445)` -> `-0.12555 < -0.05445`. TRUE.
           y-overlap: `(0.0361, 0.1349)` and `(0.05445, 0.12555)`. Yes, `max(0.0361, 0.05445) < min(0.1349, 0.12555)` -> `0.05445 < 0.12555`. TRUE.
           So, there is indeed a collision with O5 at `(-0.09, 0.09)`.
           
           My manual checks are crucial. So `(0.09, -0.09)` is the prime candidate.
           Let's find more spots.
           How about `(0.0, -0.09)`?
           Surface bounds: OK.
           1. O7: `x=0` is in `C7_x`. `y=-0.09` is NOT in `C7_y`. Avoid O7. OK.
           2. O4: `x=0` is NOT in `C4_x`. Avoid O4. OK.
           3. O6: `x=0` is NOT in `C6_x`. Avoid O6. OK.
           4. O5: `x=0` is NOT in `C5_x`. Avoid O5. OK.
           This looks like another promising candidate: `(0.0, -0.09)`.
           
           How about `(-0.09, 0.0)`?
           Surface bounds: OK.
           1. O7: `x=-0.09` is NOT in `C7_x`. Avoid O7. OK.
           2. O4: `x=-0.09` is NOT in `C4_x`. Avoid O4. OK.
           3. O6: `x=-0.09` is in `C6_x`. `y=0` is NOT in `C6_y`. Avoid O6. OK.
           4. O5: `x=-0.09` is in `C5_x`. `y=0` is NOT in `C5_y`. Avoid O5. OK.
           This looks like another promising candidate: `(-0.09, 0.0)`.
           
           How about `(-0.09, -0.09)`?
           Surface bounds: OK.
           1. O7: `x=-0.09` is NOT in `C7_x`. Avoid O7. OK.
           2. O4: `x=-0.09` is NOT in `C4_x`. Avoid O4. OK.
           3. O6: `x=-0.09` is in `C6_x`. `y=-0.09` is in `C6_y`. Collision with O6.
           So `(-0.09, -0.09)` is not valid.
           
           So far: `(0.09, -0.09)`, `(0.0, -0.09)`, `(-0.09, 0.0)` are candidates.
           
           Let's explore other coordinates. What if `x` is between `C7_x`? E.g., `x=0.0`
           If `x=0.0`:
           Avoid O7: need `y <= -0.07125` OR `y >= 0.07125`.
           Avoid O4: `x=0.0` is NOT in `C4_x`. So avoids O4.
           Avoid O6: `x=0.0` is NOT in `C6_x`. So avoids O6.
           Avoid O5: `x=0.0` is NOT in `C5_x`. So avoids O5.
           So, if `x=0.0`, any `y` such that `abs(y) >= 0.07125` will work.
           Combined with surface bounds `[-0.09945, 0.09945]`:
           `y in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` or `y in [0.07125, 0.09945]`.
           Examples: `(0.0, -0.09)` (already identified), `(0.0, -0.08)`, `(0.0, 0.08)`, `(0.0, 0.09)`.
           
           What if `y=0.0`:
           Avoid O7: need `x <= -0.07125` OR `x >= 0.07125`.
           Avoid O4: `y=0.0` is NOT in `C4_y`. So avoids O4.
           Avoid O6: `y=0.0` is NOT in `C6_y`. So avoids O6.
           Avoid O5: `y=0.0` is NOT in `C5_y`. So avoids O5.
           So, if `y=0.0`, any `x` such that `abs(x) >= 0.07125` will work.
           Combined with surface bounds `[-0.09945, 0.09945]`:
           `x in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` or `x in [0.07125, 0.09945]`.
           Examples: `(-0.09, 0.0)` (already identified), `(-0.08, 0.0)`, `(0.08, 0.0)`, `(0.09, 0.0)`.
           
           This provides a good strategy. I will fill placements using these four narrow strips (top/bottom edges, left/right edges).
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.09, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09)
           (0, 0.0, -0.09, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.09, 0.0)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.08)
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08) # This one is very close to O4, O7, O5. Re-check `(0.08, 0.08)`.
           Let's check `(0.08, 0.08)`.
           Surface bounds: OK.
           1. O7: `x=0.08` is NOT in `C7_x`. Avoid O7. OK.
           2. O4: `x=0.08` is in `C4_x=(0.00435, 0.15565)`. `y=0.08` is in `C4_y=(0.00435, 0.15565)`. Collision with O4.
           So `(0.08, 0.08)` is NOT valid. I must be careful.
           
           Let's stick to the positions confirmed by the detailed check.
           `x in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` or `x in [0.07125, 0.09945]`
           `y in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` or `y in [0.07125, 0.09945]`
           
           And also these specific ones:
           `x=0.0`, `y in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` or `y in [0.07125, 0.09945]`
           `y=0.0`, `x in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` or `x in [0.07125, 0.09945]`
           
           Let's pick precise values based on these allowed ranges and the obstacles.
           For `x = 0.09` (just inside `[0.07125, 0.09945]`) and `y = -0.09` (just inside `[-0.09945, -0.07125]`): `(0.09, -0.09)` (Verified valid)
           For `x = 0.09` and `y = 0.0` (Verified valid)
           For `x = 0.0` and `y = -0.09` (Verified valid)
           For `x = -0.09` and `y = 0.0` (Verified valid)
           
           Let's try other values in the valid ranges:
           `x = 0.075` (in `[0.07125, 0.09945]`)
           `y = 0.075` (in `[0.07125, 0.09945]`)
           Consider `(0.075, 0.075)`:
           1. O7: `x=0.075` is NOT in `C7_x`. Avoid O7. OK.
           2. O4: `x=0.075` is in `C4_x`. `y=0.075` is in `C4_y`. Collision with O4. Invalid.
           
           It seems the `(x,y)` locations have to be chosen carefully.
           The `C4_x = (0.00435, 0.15565)` and `C4_y = (0.00435, 0.15565)` are quite large.
           `C6_x = (-0.16711, -0.00289)` and `C6_y = (-0.16711, -0.00289)`
           `C5_x = (-0.17045, -0.00055)` and `C5_y = (0.00055, 0.17045)`
           
           The safest places are likely far away from existing obstacles.
           Let's use the points that fall outside the main "collision rectangles".
           
           Upper right extreme corner `(0.099, 0.099)`:
           1. O7: OK, both x, y outside `C7`.
           2. O4: x in `C4_x`. y in `C4_y`. Collision with O4. (0.08,0.08) and (0.099,0.099) are too close.
           
           What about `(0.09, -0.09)` and its permutations and variations?
           This one works: `(0.09, -0.09)`.
           What about `(0.09, -0.095)`? (still within surface y-range)
           1. O7: x outside `C7x`. OK.
           2. O4: x in `C4x`. y outside `C4y`. OK.
           3. O6: x outside `C6x`. OK.
           4. O5: x outside `C5x`. OK.
           Seems valid. `(0.09, -0.095)`
           
           What about `(0.095, -0.09)`?
           1. O7: x outside `C7x`. OK.
           2. O4: x in `C4x`. y outside `C4y`. OK.
           3. O6: x outside `C6x`. OK.
           4. O5: x outside `C5x`. OK.
           Seems valid. `(0.095, -0.09)`
           
           The area `x in [0.07125, 0.09945]` AND `y in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` seems relatively clear.
           Let's try some points there.
           `(0.075, -0.075)`:
           1. O7: x outside `C7x`. OK.
           2. O4: x in `C4x`. y outside `C4y`. OK.
           3. O6: x outside `C6x`. OK.
           4. O5: x outside `C5x`. OK.
           This works.
           
           Let's generate placements within this confirmed "lower right" quadrant for object 8.
           `x in [0.07125, 0.09945]` and `y in [-0.09945, -0.07125]`.
           Also, the two strip-like regions:
           `x in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` OR `x in [0.07125, 0.09945]` for `y=0.0`.
           `y in [-0.09945, -0.07125]` OR `y in [0.07125, 0.09945]` for `x=0.0`.
