           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.712, -0.412, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.034).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.749, -0.449), (-4.675, -0.375)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan to Achieve the New Axiom**
           
           My goal is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which requires me to find an object that is both `type` and `on` the surface `v18`. I know that `v12` and `v8` are candidates because they are of the correct `type`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see I can place these objects using the predicate `on(?o, ?r)`, which I can achieve if I can achieve `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`.  `Supported` is already true, so I need to make `atpose(?green, ?p)` true for one of `v12` or `v8`.
           
           Looking at my available actions and knowledge, I will attempt to first use `v8`. I can pick it up from `v9` and place it at a suitable pose.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** I need to move the robot base from its initial configuration `v3` to a new configuration `#o3`. This will allow me to reach the location.
           2.  **Pick:** Using arm `v4`, I will pick up object `v8` which is currently at pose `v9`.
           3.  **Place:** Then, using arm `v4`, I will place `v8` at a target location called `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           Here's how I chose the continuous parameters:
           
           *   For `v8`, I've chosen a pose `#o2` for this placement. It's safe on `v18` and its x, y and z coordinates are (4.5, -0.3, 0.8), where `x` and `y` are inside the surface `v18` and the height accounts for the objects half height.
           *   For the base configuration `#o3`,  I estimate that since the arm is kinematically valid, `#o3 = (3.8, 0.0, 0.0)` is reachable.
           *   The exact trajectories for arm and base motions, which are critical for smooth operation, are computed by my TAMP (Task and Motion Planning) solver. I specify the necessary symbolic relations.
           
           The total cost is the distance traveled + the pick and place cost (which is just 3.3).
           
           I believe this plan will succeed in satisfying `new-axiom@0()`, as I'm placing the correct type of object (`v8`) on the correct surface (`v18`).
