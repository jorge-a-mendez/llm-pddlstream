           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.712, -0.412, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.034).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.749, -0.449), (-4.675, -0.375)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, the task is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` on surface `v18`. From the given data, I've identified that either `v12` or `v8` (both type `v17`) could be the target object. I've broken down the problem into a "pick and place" scenario: either move `v12` from its current location on `v14` to `v18`, or move `v8` from its current location on `v11` to `v18`.
           
           **Object and Surface Analysis**
           
           Further investigation of the provided facts revealed that `v18` is a surface with dimensions ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)), while `v11` is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)), and appears to contain `v18`. I've also noted the current locations: `v12` is on `v14` ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)), which is a surface on the negative X side, and `v8` is on `v11`, on the positive X side. The object `v15` is also on `v11` at `v16`. Given the geometry, moving an object from the positive X side to `v18` seems more direct, since there are no provided base movements, and `move_base v3 v3` is a null operation.
           
           **Action Selection and Plan Formation**
           
           I've examined the available actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`. The last two are irrelevant for the task. The only available `move_base` action does nothing, so I'll ignore it unless it's strictly necessary. I am choosing the actions `pick` and `place`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which have the `handempty` property. I am checking the `kin` facts of arm `v4`. It's clear that it can interact with `v8` and `v12`. I need to pick either `v12` or `v8`. Given the spatial information, picking `v8` which is near `v18` seems simpler than using `v12` which is on the other side. This removes any base motion and minimizes arm trajectory.
           
           **Plan Refinement and Validation**
           
           I've decided to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9` and place it on `v18`. To be able to perform these two actions, I have to ensure preconditions. The `kin` facts support the use of arm `v4`. The pick action has preconditions regarding `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, and a base configuration. I assumed safety unless explicitly noted as unsafe.
           
           **Target Pose and Continuous Parameter Determination**
           
           For placement, I need to specify the target pose of `v8` on `v18`. Based on `v8`'s pose information, I am placing `v8` to the center on `v18` which seems the most reasonable for now. I calculated the appropriate (x, y) coordinates. The height should ensure that it is on top of `v18`. Given the known poses and related surface information, I calculated a target pose with coordinates `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Optimized Plan and Cost Analysis**
           
           Given that I have `kin` facts for placing `v8`, I propose this two-action plan:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           
           Each of these actions is assumed to have a cost of 1, resulting in a total cost of 2. I've re-checked the plan and objects' roles, and the plan seems valid and optimal within the given data.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, the user flagged that the previous plan used some invalid actions.  I understand now; I'm constrained to only use `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This is a significant limitation.  Let's revisit the goal: `Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is essentially looking for an object of a specific type to be 'on' a particular surface.
           
           Analyzing the axioms, I see that this means I need to find an object, either `v8` or `v12` (both of which are the correct type, `v17`), and make sure it is `on` surface `v18`.  The 'on' axiom is defined by the predicates `supported` and `atpose`.  Looking at the initial state, both `v8` and `v12` are *supported* by `#o2`, which in turn is supported by `v18`. So I could achieve 'on' by manipulating *where*  `v8` or `v12` are `atpose`.
           
           The initial state reveals that both `v8` and `v12` are *not* currently `atpose` where they *need* to be.  `v12` is `atpose` `#o2`, which is on `v18`. `v8` is `atpose` `#o2`, which is on `v18`.
           
           So, the challenge boils down to moving one of those objects to `atpose` `#o2`.  However, here's the rub: my *only* available action is `move_base`. This is a dead end. `move_base` does *not* alter the `atpose` predicate.  It just moves the base.  I need actions like `pick` and `place` to actually achieve this goal.  Since I can't use those, the entire plan is impossible. The goal is unachievable with the provided action instances. It's simply beyond my capabilities with the allowed action.
