           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.712, -0.412, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.034).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.749, -0.449), (-4.675, -0.375)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom arm(v6)

           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis:  new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem: The ultimate goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of `type v17` *on* `v18`. From the initial state, I can see that either `v8` or `v12` fits the `type v17` criteria.  Therefore, I essentially need to get either `v8` or `v12` *on* `v18`.
           
           To make this happen, I need to understand what "on" entails: According to the problem definition,  `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` means that the object must be both `supported` by `?r` and at the appropriate `pose` to be on it. I also know I can use either `v8` or `v12` which are `type v17`.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that both `v8` and `v12` are supported at `pose #o2` by `v18`. Now comes the tricky part:  I need to move either `v8` or `v12` to `pose #o2`. Both objects currently have different `atpose` states.
           
           Here's the critical constraint: I'm only allowed to use the action instance `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That's it. No `pick` actions, no `place` actions, nothing else.  Since I'm restricted to only using the `move_base` action, I am stuck. The only provided `action` is a base movement action. Therefore, I can't interact with any of the physical objects.
           
           This is a dead end. I cannot pick up and place `v8` or `v12` using only a *base* movement action.
           
           My conclusion is simple: given the incredibly restrictive constraints on allowed actions, I can't possibly achieve the goal of having an object of type v17 on v18. The plan is infeasible.
