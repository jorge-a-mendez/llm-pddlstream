           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the deal. My initial assessment indicates that achieving `new-axiom@0()` is currently impossible, given the available actions and the current state. Let me walk you through my reasoning, step by step:
           
           1.  **The Goal's Makeup:** `new-axiom@0()` demands two key things: `receivedimage` for three different objectives, and `receivedanalysis` for a rock of type `v2` and one of type `v6`.
           
           2.  **Unpacking `receivedimage`:**  `receivedimage` is the result of a successful `send_image`.  To send an image, I need to have the image (`haveimage`), be in a position to communicate (`comvisible`), and be at the right configuration (`atconf`).
           
           3.  **The `haveimage` Bottleneck:** `haveimage` comes from taking the image in the first place, using `take_image`. The prerequisites for `take_image` are that the camera is calibrated, it is in image range, and at the right configuration.
           
           4.  **Configuration Conundrum:** Both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are currently stuck in configurations that are not conducive to either image acquisition or analysis.  `v12` is at `v13` and `v14` is at `v15`. To image, the rover needs to be at `#o3` configuration, and to send, it needs to be at `#o0` configuration. These configurations are not the same as the rover’s current configurations.
           
           5.  **The Unmovable Rovers:** The only move actions I have are self-loops: `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`.  That means, `v12` *cannot* change from the `v13` position, and `v14` *cannot* budge from the `v15` location. So, I cannot achieve the `atconf` precondition necessary to calibrate, take images, and send them.
           
           6.  **Analysis is Equally Out of Reach:** Similarly, `receivedanalysis` hinges on being able to `send_analysis`. To send the analysis, I need to have the rock analyzed, in a position where the communication can happen, and in the right configuration.
           
           7.  **The Sampling Problem:** I analyze rocks using `sample_rock`. To perform `sample_rock`, I must have a free space available, the rover must be `above` the rock, and in the right configuration (`atconf`). The only sampling spots, based on the current state, is at configuration `#o5`. But again, given the move limitations I cannot get rovers to configuration `#o5`.
           
           8.  **The Bottom Line:** Since the rovers cannot move to the necessary locations to either image or analyze the rocks, the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is unachievable given the very limited valid actions. I am constrained by self-loops and unable to fulfill the requirements of both `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
