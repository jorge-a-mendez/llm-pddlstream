           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.076 x 0.076. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its footprint, but I will vary it for completeness. I will place the object on surface 0. To ensure stability, the center of the object must be within the bounds of the surface, accounting for half of the object's extent in each dimension. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. Half of the object's extent is approximately 0.03824. So, the object's center (x, y) must be within the range [-0.135 + 0.03824, 0.135 - 0.03824], which simplifies to [-0.09676, 0.09676] in both x and y. I will generate a variety of placements within this allowed range, varying both x, y, and theta.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0) centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           I have successfully placed object 6 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). This means object 6 occupies the space within +/- 0.03824 from the origin in both x and y.
           
           Now I need to place a new object, object 4, which is also square with dimensions approximately 0.0828 x 0.0828. Half of object 4's extent is approximately 0.0414.
           To be stable on surface 0, object 4's center must be within [-0.135 + 0.0414, 0.135 - 0.0414], which simplifies to [-0.0936, 0.0936] in both x and y.
           
           Additionally, object 4 must not collide with object 6. Object 6 is centered at (0,0) and has dimensions 0.07648 x 0.07648. This means object 6 occupies the region from approximately -0.03824 to 0.03824 in both x and y.
           
           Therefore, for object 4 to not collide with object 6, object 4's center must be positioned such that its bounding box does not overlap with object 6's bounding box.
           If object 4 is placed with its center at (x, y) and its half-extents are sx/2 and sy/2, its bounding box is [x-sx/2, x+sx/2] and [y-sy/2, y+sy/2].
           Object 6's bounding box is approximately [-0.03824, 0.03824] in x and y.
           For non-collision, the x-intervals must not overlap, AND/OR the y-intervals must not overlap.
           So, either `x + sx/2 < -0.03824` OR `x - sx/2 > 0.03824` OR `y + sy/2 < -0.03824` OR `y - sy/2 > 0.03824`.
           Substituting sx/2 = sy/2 = 0.0414 for object 4, this means:
           `x + 0.0414 < -0.03824` => `x < -0.07964`
           `x - 0.0414 > 0.03824` => `x > 0.07964`
           `y + 0.0414 < -0.03824` => `y < -0.07964`
           `y - 0.0414 > 0.03824` => `y > 0.07964`
           
           Combining this with the surface stability constraint [-0.0936, 0.0936], I will look for placements where the center is either very negative/positive in x or y. For example, `x` values around `0.08` or `-0.08` (and similar for `y`) should work. Since the object is square, rotation doesn't change its AABB, but I will still vary the angle.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0) centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           I have two previously placed objects:
           - Object 6 (0.07648 x 0.07648) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its bounding box is approximately [-0.03824, 0.03824] in both x and y.
           - Object 4 (0.08283 x 0.08283) at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08). Its half-extents are approximately 0.0414. Its bounding box is approximately [0.08 - 0.0414, 0.08 + 0.0414] = [0.0386, 0.1214] in x and y.
           
           Now I need to place object 7, which is square with dimensions approximately 0.07208 x 0.07208. Half of object 7's extent is approximately 0.03604.
           
           To be stable on surface 0, object 7's center must be within [-0.135 + 0.03604, 0.135 - 0.03604], which simplifies to [-0.09896, 0.09896] in both x and y.
           
           Object 7 must not collide with object 6 or object 4.
           Object 6's AABB: [-0.03824, 0.03824] x [-0.03824, 0.03824].
           Object 4's AABB: [0.0386, 0.1214] x [0.0386, 0.1214].
           
           Let (x_7, y_7) be the center of object 7. Its half-extent is 0.03604.
           Object 7's AABB: [x_7 - 0.03604, x_7 + 0.03604] x [y_7 - 0.03604, y_7 + 0.03604].
           
           To avoid collision with object 6:
           `x_7 + 0.03604 < -0.03824` => `x_7 < -0.07428` OR
           `x_7 - 0.03604 > 0.03824` => `x_7 > 0.07428` OR
           `y_7 + 0.03604 < -0.03824` => `y_7 < -0.07428` OR
           `y_7 - 0.03604 > 0.03824` => `y_7 > 0.07428`
           
           To avoid collision with object 4:
           `x_7 + 0.03604 < 0.0386` => `x_7 < 0.00256` OR
           `x_7 - 0.03604 > 0.1214` => `x_7 > 0.15744` (this is outside surface bounds [ -0.09896, 0.09896]) OR
           `y_7 + 0.03604 < 0.0386` => `y_7 < 0.00256` OR
           `y_7 - 0.03604 > 0.1214` => `y_7 > 0.15744` (this is outside surface bounds [ -0.09896, 0.09896])
           
           Considering all constraints, I need to find a placement (x_7, y_7) within [-0.09896, 0.09896] that avoids both object 6 and object 4.
           Looking for regions where `x_7` and/or `y_7` are sufficiently negative or positive.
           For instance, a placement around (-0.08, -0.08) should work, as it is far from both object 6 (centered at 0,0) and object 4 (centered at 0.08, 0.08).
           `x_7 = -0.08`: This satisfies `x_7 < -0.07428` (avoids obj 6) and `x_7 < 0.00256` (avoids obj 4 in x).
           `y_7 = -0.08`: This satisfies `y_7 < -0.07428` (avoids obj 6) and `y_7 < 0.00256` (avoids obj 4 in y).
           So (-0.08, -0.08) seems like a good candidate.
           Also, `(0.08, -0.08)` or `(-0.08, 0.08)` could be viable. Let's verify `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           `x_7 = 0.08`: This satisfies `x_7 > 0.07428` (avoids obj 6). However, for obj 4, `x_7` needs to be `x_7 < 0.00256` OR `x_7 > 0.15744`. `0.08` is not in these ranges, so `x_7 = 0.08` would collide with object 4 if `y_7` also overlaps.
           Let's consider `x_7 = 0.08, y_7 = -0.08`.
           Against object 6: `x_7 = 0.08 > 0.07428` (OK) and `y_7 = -0.08 < -0.07428` (OK). No collision with obj 6.
           Against object 4 (AABB: [0.0386, 0.1214] x [0.0386, 0.1214]):
           Object 7's x-interval: [0.08 - 0.03604, 0.08 + 0.03604] = [0.04396, 0.11604]
           Object 7's y-interval: [-0.08 - 0.03604, -0.08 + 0.03604] = [-0.11604, -0.04396]
           Does [0.04396, 0.11604] overlap with [0.0386, 0.1214]? Yes.
           Does [-0.11604, -0.04396] overlap with [0.0386, 0.1214]? No. So (0.08, -0.08) works due to y-separation from object 4.
           
           Similarly, (-0.08, 0.08) should work due to x-separation from object 4 and y-separation from object 6.
           Let's try to fill the remaining quadrant: `(-0.08, 0.08)`.
           Against object 6: `x_7 = -0.08 < -0.07428` (OK) and `y_7 = 0.08 > 0.07428` (OK). No collision with obj 6.
           Against object 4 (AABB: [0.0386, 0.1214] x [0.0386, 0.1214]):
           Object 7's x-interval: [-0.08 - 0.03604, -0.08 + 0.03604] = [-0.11604, -0.04396]
           Object 7's y-interval: [0.08 - 0.03604, 0.08 + 0.03604] = [0.04396, 0.11604]
           Does [-0.11604, -0.04396] overlap with [0.0386, 0.1214]? No. So (-0.08, 0.08) works due to x-separation from object 4.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0) centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           I have three previously placed objects:
           - Object 6 (0.07648 x 0.07648) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its bounding box is approximately [-0.03824, 0.03824] in both x and y.
           - Object 4 (0.08283 x 0.08283) at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08). Its half-extents are approximately 0.0414. Its bounding box is approximately [0.0386, 0.1214] in x and y.
           - Object 7 (0.07208 x 0.07208) at (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08). Its half-extents are approximately 0.03604. Its bounding box is approximately [-0.11604, -0.04396] in x and y.
           
           Now I need to place object 5, which is square with dimensions approximately 0.0938 x 0.0938. Half of object 5's extent is approximately 0.0469.
           
           To be stable on surface 0, object 5's center must be within [-0.135 + 0.0469, 0.135 - 0.0469], which simplifies to [-0.0881, 0.0881] in both x and y.
           
           Object 5 must not collide with object 6, object 4, or object 7.
           Object 6's AABB: [-0.03824, 0.03824] x [-0.03824, 0.03824].
           Object 4's AABB: [0.0386, 0.1214] x [0.0386, 0.1214].
           Object 7's AABB: [-0.11604, -0.04396] x [-0.11604, -0.04396].
           
           Let (x_5, y_5) be the center of object 5. Its half-extent is 0.0469.
           Object 5's AABB: [x_5 - 0.0469, x_5 + 0.0469] x [y_5 - 0.0469, y_5 + 0.0469].
           
           This is becoming quite constrained. The central region, top-right region, and bottom-left region are occupied. This leaves the top-left and bottom-right regions, and edges of the surface.
           
           Let's try to place object 5 in the top-left quadrant, for example, around (-0.08, 0.08).
           First, check stability on surface 0:
           (-0.08, 0.08) is within [-0.0881, 0.0881]. So stable.
           
           Now check for collisions:
           Candidate center: (-0.08, 0.08). Object 5's AABB: [-0.08 - 0.0469, -0.08 + 0.0469] x [0.08 - 0.0469, 0.08 + 0.0469] = [-0.1269, -0.0331] x [0.0331, 0.1269].
           
           Collision with object 6 (AABB: [-0.03824, 0.03824] x [-0.03824, 0.03824]):
           Object 5's x-interval [-0.1269, -0.0331] does not overlap with Object 6's x-interval [-0.03824, 0.03824]. No collision.
           
           Collision with object 4 (AABB: [0.0386, 0.1214] x [0.0386, 0.1214]):
           Object 5's x-interval [-0.1269, -0.0331] does not overlap with Object 4's x-interval [0.0386, 0.1214]. No collision.
           
           Collision with object 7 (AABB: [-0.11604, -0.04396] x [-0.11604, -0.04396]):
           Object 5's x-interval [-0.1269, -0.0331] *does* overlap with Object 7's x-interval [-0.11604, -0.04396].
           Object 5's y-interval [0.0331, 0.1269] does not overlap with Object 7's y-interval [-0.11604, -0.04396]. No collision.
           
           So placement at (-0.08, 0.08) for object 5 should be valid.
           
           Let's also consider (0.08, -0.08).
           Object 5's AABB: [0.08 - 0.0469, 0.08 + 0.0469] x [-0.08 - 0.0469, -0.08 + 0.0469] = [0.0331, 0.1269] x [-0.1269, -0.0331].
           
           Collision with object 6 (AABB: [-0.03824, 0.03824] x [-0.03824, 0.03824]):
           Object 5's x-interval [0.0331, 0.1269] does not overlap with Object 6's x-interval [-0.03824, 0.03824]. No collision.
           
           Collision with object 4 (AABB: [0.0386, 0.1214] x [0.0386, 0.1214]):
           Object 5's x-interval [0.0331, 0.1269] *does* overlap with Object 4's x-interval [0.0386, 0.1214].
           Object 5's y-interval [-0.1269, -0.0331] does not overlap with Object 4's y-interval [0.0386, 0.1214]. No collision.
           
           Collision with object 7 (AABB: [-0.11604, -0.04396] x [-0.11604, -0.04396]):
           Object 5's x-interval [0.0331, 0.1269] does not overlap with Object 7's x-interval [-0.11604, -0.04396]. No collision.
           
           So placement at (0.08, -0.08) for object 5 should also be valid.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0) centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27 x 0.27.
           
           I have four previously placed objects:
           - Object 6 (0.07648 x 0.07648) at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). Its bounding box is approximately `[-0.03824, 0.03824]` in both x and y.
           - Object 4 (0.08283 x 0.08283) at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08). Its half-extents are approximately 0.0414. Its bounding box is approximately `[0.0386, 0.1214]` in x and y.
           - Object 7 (0.07208 x 0.07208) at (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.08). Its half-extents are approximately 0.03604. Its bounding box is approximately `[-0.11604, -0.04396]` in x and y.
           - Object 5 (0.0938 x 0.0938) at (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08). Its half-extents are approximately 0.0469. Its bounding box is approximately `[-0.1269, -0.0331]` x `[0.0331, 0.1269]`.
           
           Now I need to place object 8, which is square with dimensions approximately 0.09415 x 0.09415. Half of object 8's extent is approximately 0.047075.
           
           To be stable on surface 0, object 8's center must be within `[-0.135 + 0.047075, 0.135 - 0.047075]`, which simplifies to `[-0.087925, 0.087925]` in both x and y.
           
           Object 8 must not collide with objects 6, 4, 7, or 5.
           Let (x_8, y_8) be the center of object 8. Its half-extent is 0.047075.
           Object 8's AABB: `[x_8 - 0.047075, x_8 + 0.047075]` x `[y_8 - 0.047075, y_8 + 0.047075]`.
           
           The surface is largely occupied by objects in the center, top-right, bottom-left, and top-left quadrants. This leaves primarily the bottom-right quadrant as the most open space.
           
           Let's try a placement for object 8 at `(0.08, -0.08)`.
           Check stability: `(0.08, -0.08)` is within `[-0.087925, 0.087925]`. So stable.
           
           Check for collisions:
           Candidate center: `(0.08, -0.08)`. Object 8's AABB: `[0.08 - 0.047075, 0.08 + 0.047075]` x `[-0.08 - 0.047075, -0.08 + 0.047075]` = `[0.032925, 0.127075]` x `[-0.127075, -0.032925]`.
           
           1. Collision with object 6 (AABB: `[-0.03824, 0.03824]` x `[-0.03824, 0.03824]`):
              Object 8's x-interval `[0.032925, 0.127075]` does not overlap with Object 6's x-interval `[-0.03824, 0.03824]`. No collision.
           
           2. Collision with object 4 (AABB: `[0.0386, 0.1214]` x `[0.0386, 0.1214]`):
              Object 8's x-interval `[0.032925, 0.127075]` *does* overlap with Object 4's x-interval `[0.0386, 0.1214]`.
              Object 8's y-interval `[-0.127075, -0.032925]` does not overlap with Object 4's y-interval `[0.0386, 0.1214]`. No collision.
           
           3. Collision with object 7 (AABB: `[-0.11604, -0.04396]` x `[-0.11604, -0.04396]`):
              Object 8's x-interval `[0.032925, 0.127075]` does not overlap with Object 7's x-interval `[-0.11604, -0.04396]`. No collision.
           
           4. Collision with object 5 (AABB: `[-0.1269, -0.0331]` x `[0.0331, 0.1269]`):
              Object 8's x-interval `[0.032925, 0.127075]` does not overlap with Object 5's x-interval `[-0.1269, -0.0331]`. No collision.
           
           Therefore, placing object 8 at `(0.08, -0.08)` seems to be a valid placement.
