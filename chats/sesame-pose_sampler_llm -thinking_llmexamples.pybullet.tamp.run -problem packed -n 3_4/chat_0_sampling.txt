(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on a square surface.  The object is also square, with sides of about 0.09 units. The surface is centered at (0,0) and extends from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  The core of this problem is to ensure the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface's boundaries.
           
           Initially, I considered rotation (theta). Because the object is square, rotating it doesn't change its *local* bounding box's dimensions (the object remains a square).  However, for stability, I need to ensure that the *rotated* AABB fits within the surface. The dimensions of the rotated square are larger (diagonal becomes the longest). The more conservative approach is safer. Using the rotated AABB, the effective bounding box dimension will be 0.09 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06414.
           
           To find stable placements, I first calculated the valid range for the object's center (x, y).  Given the surface's boundaries and the *most conservative* bounding box dimension, I found the x and y ranges.
           
           With that I made a 7x7 grid of x,y coordinates within the valid ranges, and set the surface index (surf_idx) to 0. All 49 values would use theta=0. Then, I added the 50th placement at the center, with theta = pi/4 to ensure diversity.
           
           Here's the plan I'm going with: I will provide a list of 50 tuples. Each tuple represents a placement (surface_index, rotation, x_coordinate, y_coordinate). The surface index will always be 0. Most placements will have a rotation of 0. For the last placement, the rotation will be pi/4, and the position is the center. This should generate valid and diverse set of placements that satisfy the "fully contained" requirement, *even* if the object is rotated.

           Okay, here's the situation. I've got to figure out where to place Object 4.  The key piece of information is the successful placement of Object 5, which is already down and it's center is at `x = -0.0708, y = -0.0708`.  I've got to make sure Object 4 doesn't bump into it. Also I have to make sure both objects fit within the surface.
           
           **Scene Setup**
           
           Let's break down the scene.  The surface is a square centered at the origin, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y. Object 5, it's already on the board with the center at -0.07 and the length is around 0.09. I did the math to work out the exact bounding box for Object 5 - it turns out to be from -0.1162 to -0.0255 in both x and y. Object 4 is also a square with a width and length of about 0.0987. Since I can rotate it, its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is going to change a bit. When it's straight, the half-extent is about 0.0494. When it's rotated at 45 degrees, the half-extent extends to around 0.0698.
           
           **Valid Placement Area**
           
           For Object 4 to be stable, its center needs to be within the square surface. I have to keep the rotation in mind, which means the valid area shrinks because the rotated object now spans more of the X and Y axis. So, the safe zone within the original surface, considering any possible rotation, is from -0.0652 to 0.0652 in both x and y. But if the object doesn't rotate, the zone grows a bit. 
           
           **Collision Avoidance**
           
           Now comes the hard part: avoiding collisions with Object 5. I am going to make things simple and place Object 4 mostly at 0 degrees and compare their AABB. If I *can* rotate, I'll use the larger value for the rotated object. Object 5's fixed AABB is in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  A good strategy seems to put Object 4 in the top-right corner, or along the top and right edges, to get some distance.
           
           I calculated the AABB for object 4 centered at any point `(cx, cy)` will be `[cx - L4_half, cx + L4_half] x [cy - L4_half, cy + L4_half]`.
           Object 5's AABB is `(-0.1162, -0.0255) x (-0.1162, -0.0255)`.
           To avoid collision, it's gotta be far enough away. A quick way to test is to use these checks:
           * `obj4_max_x <= obj5_min_x` (Object 4 entirely left)
           * `obj4_min_x >= obj5_max_x` (Object 4 entirely right)
           * `obj4_max_y <= obj5_min_y` (Object 4 entirely below)
           * `obj4_min_y >= obj5_max_y` (Object 4 entirely above)
           
           I figured out I *could* have two non-collision conditions:
           * Object 4's center x must be >= 0.02389
           * Object 4's center y must be >= 0.02389
           
           I set up a 11x11 grid of placement points. If the center of the object meets either condition, then it won't be colliding with Object 5. 
           So, now I have my 50 valid placements with rotation at zero.

           Okay, here's what I've got to do: Place a square object (Object 6) on Surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into two other fixed objects already there (Object 5 and Object 4). I need to find 50 stable spots for Object 6.
           
           First, I looked at the surface geometry. Surface 0 is a square, -0.135 to 0.135 in both the X and Y axes. Object 6 is also a square with a side of 0.07371. The key is to keep it within the surface boundaries, regardless of how it's rotated. I figured out the maximum safe region for the center of Object 6, which is basically a smaller square inside the main surface square.
           
           Next, I need to prevent collisions. I calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for both Object 5 and Object 4 (these are the fixed obstacles). Then, for each potential placement (position and rotation) of Object 6, I need to compute *its* AABB and make sure it doesn't overlap with the obstacles' AABBs.
           
           To generate placement candidates, I created a grid of points within that safe region. Then I rotated object 6 with a list of rotations. For each grid point/rotation combo, I calculated Object 6's AABB. I also took the surface bounds into consideration.
           
           To find more spots, I used denser grids and wider rotations in iterations. To prevent getting duplicates from being added across different loops (due to rounding) I added a condition where the placement would not be added if already added.
           
           I used AABB collision checks (checking if the AABBs overlap) - which is an efficient way to decide if there are any overlaps. If no overlap, then the spots are fine.
           
           Essentially, I'm now going through many points, rotations to ensure that Object 6 lands in a safe, valid spot, then finding enough of those spots to satisfy the requirement of 50.
