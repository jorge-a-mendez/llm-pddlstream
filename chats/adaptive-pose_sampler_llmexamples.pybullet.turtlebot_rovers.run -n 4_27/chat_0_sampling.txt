User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The environment is a square room with dimensions 5x5, centered at (0,0). There are several obstacles within this room.
           Obstacles 0-4 define the outer walls of the room. Obstacle 5 is a long, thin vertical bar in the center of the room, effectively dividing it into two halves. Obstacles 6-22 are smaller, scattered obstacles within the room.
           I will try to find positions for the robot that are not inside any of these obstacles and are within 4 units of the target point. I'll prioritize positions that are likely to have a clear line of sight, such as those further away from obstacles.
