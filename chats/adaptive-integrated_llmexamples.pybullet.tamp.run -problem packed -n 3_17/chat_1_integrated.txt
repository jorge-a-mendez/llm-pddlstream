User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.248, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.085).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, -0.019, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.167).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.011, -0.289), (0.087, -0.191)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.289, -0.461), (-0.208, -0.38)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.038, -0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.313, 0.95).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.203, -0.064), (0.292, 0.025)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene consists of three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all supported by v11 (a large surface). The goal is to place all three objects on v16 (a smaller surface). The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are currently empty. The robot is at base configuration v3. The only available action is `move_base` from v3 to v3 with trajectory #o0, which means the robot doesn't need to move its base to pick or place objects.
           
           To achieve the goal, the robot needs to pick up each object and place it on surface v16. Since there's only one arm (v4) that has kin information to interact with these objects, it needs to perform three pick and three place actions. Since no actual object is defined for v16, and it's defined as a surface, it indicates that v16 is a dummy surface and we must place objects on a different surface whose continuous values are provided. v11 has poses provided for it, so we will use v11 to place objects.
           
           The object v12 is at pose v13, object v14 is at pose v15, and object v8 is at pose v9. All these poses are currently on the object v11. There are also poses with #o2 which is a placeholder for a new pose on a surface, this will be used for placing on v16.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. Pick v14 from v15 using arm v4.
           2. Place v14 onto v16 at a new pose, #o2 using arm v4.
           3. Pick v12 from v13 using arm v4.
           4. Place v12 onto v16 at a new pose, #o2 using arm v4.
           5. Pick v8 from v9 using arm v4.
           6. Place v8 onto v16 at a new pose, #o2 using arm v4.
           
           Since there are three objects and they are being placed at the same placeholder pose #o2, each will require a unique actual pose. I will provide three distinct poses for #o2, one for each object. These poses should be within the bounds of v11 as v16 is a dummy surface and there are no continuous values for it. The poses will be chosen to be close to each other.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on surface v16. However, the only valid action instance provided is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the robot's base from one configuration to the same configuration, effectively doing nothing relevant to manipulating objects. There are no pick or place actions available in the list of valid actions. Therefore, it is impossible to move any objects to achieve the goal with the given valid actions.
