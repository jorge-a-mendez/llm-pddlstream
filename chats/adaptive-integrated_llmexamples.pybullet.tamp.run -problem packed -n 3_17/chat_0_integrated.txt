           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.248, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, -0.085).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.289, -0.461), (-0.208, -0.38)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.248, -0.019, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.167).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.038, -0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.313, 0.95).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.203, -0.064), (0.292, 0.025)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.011, -0.289), (0.087, -0.191)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: v8, v12, and v14. They are currently located at poses v9, v13, and v15 respectively, all supported by v11 (a large surface). The goal is to place all three objects on v16 (a smaller surface). There are two arms, v4 and v6, both are handempty and at their home configurations. There is only one base motion available, which is moving from v3 to v3 (staying in place). There are no pick or place actions in the provided action instances, and therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `move_base` action instance provided is a null move (from `v3` to `v3`), which doesn't change the base configuration and has no cost. The problem statement explicitly states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." Since there are no `pick` or `place` action instances available, the robot cannot manipulate the objects to achieve the `on` predicates in the goal state. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
