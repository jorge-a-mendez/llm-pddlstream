User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v19: object
           v20: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.195, -0.428), (-0.103, -0.337)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.127, -0.442), (0.198, -0.371)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.056, 0.435), (0.023, 0.514)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.18, 0.489), (0.261, 0.57)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.149, -0.383, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, 0.191).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.02, -0.592), (0.071, -0.502)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.162, -0.407, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.006, 1.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.016, 0.475, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.997, 0.072).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.22, 0.529, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.996, 0.089).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.026, -0.547, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.822, 0.569).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the Unsolvable Object-Moving Task**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My primary objective is to move five specific objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current poses on v11 to a new location, v20. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, which I assume are essential for grasping and placing the objects.
           
           The initial state clearly defines the position of each object on v11. The goal state requires all five objects to be located on v20.  The "on" axiom is critical here; it tells me I need to ensure that each object is *supported* at its new pose on v20 and that its `atpose` predicate is true.  Essentially, I need to *pick* up each object from its initial pose, *place* it on v20 at a specific pose, and then ensure that the new `atpose` predicate is set.
           
           The problem lies in the *actions* I'm allowed to use. I'm provided with a single action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action instance indicates that the robot cannot change its base position. It remains fixed at v3, which means only grasping and placing of the objects is needed. The scene does not contain the actions `pick` or `place`.
           
           The problem statement explicitly states that only the provided actions can be used. This is a significant constraint, especially since I'm trying to manipulate objects. Picking an object to move it, placing it in a new position, or even verifying that it has been placed are all actions, but they aren't provided. These are the fundamental actions required to achieve the goal state.
           
           In conclusion, because I lack the necessary `pick` and `place` actions, the goal of moving the objects to v20 is *unachievable* given the provided action instance. The robot's movement (only using `move_base v3 v3 #o0`) would not allow any change in state relating to object locations. Therefore, any attempt to create a plan would be futile, as the crucial actions for object manipulation are missing. The limitations of the allowed actions prevent any successful state transition towards the defined goal.
