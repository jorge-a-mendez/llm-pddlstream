           Object extents (size_x, size_y): `((ID: 5) -- 0.07301393249344135, 0.07301393249344135)`.
           
           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is also square, with side length 0.073.
           To find stable placements, I need to ensure the object is fully contained within the surface.
           For a square object with side `s` placed on a square surface with side `L` (centered at origin), the valid range for its center `(x, y)` at `theta = 0` (or `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2`) is `(-L/2 + s/2, L/2 - s/2)` for both x and y.
           In this case, `L = 0.27` and `s = 0.07301393249344135`.
           So, `L/2 = 0.135` and `s/2 = 0.03650696624672067`.
           The valid range for `x` and `y` when `theta = 0` is `(-0.135 + 0.0365, 0.135 - 0.0365)` which is `(-0.0985, 0.0985)`.
           
           When the object is rotated by `pi/4` (45 degrees), the effective "radius" of the object (distance from center to furthest corner) is `sqrt((s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2) = sqrt(2 * (s/2)^2) = (s/2) * sqrt(2)`.
           Effective half-width for a square rotated by 45 degrees is `s * sqrt(2) / 2`.
           `s_eff = 0.07301393249344135 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.0516386866160105`.
           The valid range for `x` and `y` when `theta = pi/4` is `(-0.135 + 0.0516, 0.135 - 0.0516)` which is `(-0.0834, 0.0834)`.
           
           I will generate a variety of placements, varying position and orientation within these bounds, primarily focusing on `theta=0` and `theta=pi/4` and also some intermediate angles.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned that placing object 5 at (0, 0, 0.0, 0.0) is a stable placement.
           Now, I need to place object 4, which is also square, with side `s = 0.08220273866441596`. The surface is the same as before, `L = 0.27`.
           First, I will calculate the valid placement ranges for object 4, assuming no other objects.
           `L/2 = 0.135`
           `s_4 = 0.08220273866441596`
           `s_4/2 = 0.04110136933220798`
           
           For `theta = 0`:
           Valid range for `x` and `y` is `(-0.135 + 0.0411, 0.135 - 0.0411)` which is `(-0.0939, 0.0939)`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           Effective half-width for a square rotated by 45 degrees is `s_4 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.08220273866441596 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.05812836263546743`.
           Valid range for `x` and `y` is `(-0.135 + 0.0581, 0.135 - 0.0581)` which is `(-0.0769, 0.0769)`.
           
           I must also consider that object 5 is already placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Object 5 has a side length of `0.07301393249344135`.
           The AABB of object 5 is `(-0.0365, -0.0365)` to `(0.0365, 0.0365)`.
           The new object (ID 4) has a side length of `0.0822`. Its half-side is `0.0411`.
           If object 4 is placed at `(0, 0, 0.0, 0.0)` with `theta=0`, its AABB is `(-0.0411, -0.0411)` to `(0.0411, 0.0411)`. This would overlap with object 5.
           I need to find placements for object 4 that do not overlap with object 5's AABB.
           
           To avoid collision with object 5 at (0,0) (AABB: x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]), I need to place object 4 such that its AABB does not overlap.
           If object 4 is oriented at `theta = 0`, its half-side is `0.0411`.
           To avoid collision along the x-axis, its center x should be `> 0.0365 + 0.0411 = 0.0776` or `< -(0.0365 + 0.0411) = -0.0776`.
           Similarly for y-axis.
           The maximum allowed center for object 4 is `0.0939`. So, valid x or y coordinates for placement when theta=0 are `[0.0776, 0.0939]` and `[-0.0939, -0.0776]`.
           This means I can place object 4 at `(0.08, 0.0)` or `(-0.08, 0.0)` or `(0.0, 0.08)` or `(0.0, -0.08)` or in combinations of these.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned about the following successful placements:
           - Object 5 (side 0.073) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. Its AABB is `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`.
           - Object 4 (side 0.0822) at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)`. Its AABB is `x in [0.08 - 0.0411, 0.08 + 0.0411] = [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`.
           
           Now, I need to place object 8, which is square, with side `s_8 = 0.09813085283844472`. The surface is `L = 0.27`.
           `L/2 = 0.135`
           `s_8/2 = 0.04906542641922236`
           
           For `theta = 0`:
           Valid range for `x` and `y` is `(-0.135 + 0.04906, 0.135 - 0.04906)` which is `(-0.08594, 0.08594)`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           Effective half-width for a square rotated by 45 degrees is `s_8 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.09813085283844472 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06939986506385153`.
           Valid range for `x` and `y` is `(-0.135 + 0.0694, 0.135 - 0.0694)` which is `(-0.0656, 0.0656)`.
           
           I must avoid collision with object 5 and object 4.
           Object 5 AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`.
           Object 4 AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`.
           
           Let's consider placing object 8 at `theta = 0`. Its half-side is `0.0491`.
           Collision with object 5 (center 0,0):
           To avoid collision along x: `abs(x_center_8) > 0.0365 + 0.0491 = 0.0856`.
           To avoid collision along y: `abs(y_center_8) > 0.0365 + 0.0491 = 0.0856`.
           The maximum allowed center for object 8 (at theta=0) is `0.08594`.
           This means there is only a very small sliver of space at `abs(x_center) > 0.0856` and `abs(y_center) > 0.0856`. For example, `(0.0857, 0.0)` or `(0.0, 0.0857)`. However, any placement along x or y axis (e.g., `(0.0857, 0.0)`) would still overlap with the y-extent of object 5, and any placement along x (e.g., `(0.0857, 0.0)`) would overlap with the y-extent of object 4.
           The only way to avoid object 5 at (0,0) with `theta=0` for object 8 is if `x_8 > 0.0365 + 0.0491` AND `y_8 > 0.0365 + 0.0491` (or other quadrants). But this places the object outside the bounds.
           This indicates that any placement for object 8 at `theta = 0` centered on an axis or at the origin will collide with object 5 due to its large size. It's likely that a corner placement is the only way to fit.
           
           Let's analyze the free space on the surface.
           The combined occupied area from object 5 and object 4 extends:
           X-range: `[-0.0365, 0.1211]`
           Y-range: `[-0.0411, 0.0411]` (this is the max range from both object 4 and 5)
           
           Available space:
           Top left quadrant: `x in [-0.135, -0.0365]`, `y in [0.0411, 0.135]`
           Bottom left quadrant: `x in [-0.135, -0.0365]`, `y in [-0.135, -0.0411]`
           Top right quadrant: `x in [0.1211, 0.135]`, `y in [0.0411, 0.135]`
           Bottom right quadrant: `x in [0.1211, 0.135]`, `y in [-0.135, -0.0411]`
           
           Let's consider the top-left region:
           `x_min_avail = -0.135`, `x_max_avail = -0.0365`
           `y_min_avail = 0.0411`, `y_max_avail = 0.135`
           
           Width of available X-space = `-0.0365 - (-0.135) = 0.0985`
           Width of available Y-space = `0.135 - 0.0411 = 0.0939`
           
           If object 8 (side `s_8 = 0.0981`) is placed at `theta = 0`, its half-side is `0.0491`.
           For the top-left region:
           X-center range: `(-0.135 + 0.0491, -0.0365 - 0.0491) = (-0.0859, -0.0856)`
           Y-center range: `(0.0411 + 0.0491, 0.135 - 0.0491) = (0.0902, 0.0859)` -- this is an invalid range (min > max). This indicates that the y-available space (`0.0939`) is barely larger than the object's side (`0.0981`), making it impossible to fit if considering edge cases from *both* sides of the occupied space.
           
           Wait, my calculation for available space for placement might be flawed.
           The actual limit for the center of object 8 with `theta = 0` (half-side 0.0491) is:
           `x_center`: `[-0.135 + 0.0491, 0.135 - 0.0491]` i.e., `[-0.0859, 0.0859]`
           `y_center`: `[-0.135 + 0.0491, 0.135 - 0.0491]` i.e., `[-0.0859, 0.0859]`
           
           Collision conditions:
           1. With Object 5 (center `(0,0)`, half-side `0.0365`):
              `abs(x_8) < 0.0365 + 0.0491 = 0.0856` AND `abs(y_8) < 0.0365 + 0.0491 = 0.0856`
              This means if `abs(x_8) < 0.0856` AND `abs(y_8) < 0.0856`, it collides with object 5.
              Since the overall valid range for `x_8, y_8` is `[-0.0859, 0.0859]`, this means placing object 8 in any of these ranges `x in (-0.0856, 0.0856)` and `y in (-0.0856, 0.0856)` will collide with object 5.
           
           2. With Object 4 (center `(0.08,0)`, half-side `0.0411`):
              `abs(x_8 - 0.08) < 0.0411 + 0.0491 = 0.0902` AND `abs(y_8 - 0.0) < 0.0411 + 0.0491 = 0.0902`
              This means if `x_8` is in `(0.08 - 0.0902, 0.08 + 0.0902) = (-0.0102, 0.1702)` AND `y_8` is in `(-0.0902, 0.0902)`, it collides with object 4.
           
           Combining the constraints:
           For `x_8`:
           Must be `x_8 >= 0.0856` or `x_8 <= -0.0856` to avoid object 5.
           Must be `x_8 <= -0.0102` or `x_8 >= 0.1702` to avoid object 4. (Note that `x_8 >= 0.1702` is outside the surface bounds.)
           So, `x_8 <= -0.0856` is the only option from these two.
           
           Let's test `x_8 = -0.0857` (very close to the edge of the surface).
           If `x_8 = -0.0857`, then it avoids object 5 in x direction.
           It avoids object 4 in x direction as `-0.0857 < -0.0102`.
           Now for `y_8`:
           It needs to avoid object 5: `abs(y_8) >= 0.0856`. (So `y_8 >= 0.0856` or `y_8 <= -0.0856`).
           It needs to avoid object 4: `abs(y_8) >= 0.0902`. (So `y_8 >= 0.0902` or `y_8 <= -0.0902`).
           This means it must be `y_8 >= 0.0902` or `y_8 <= -0.0902`.
           However, the maximum valid `y_center` for object 8 is `0.0859`.
           This implies that for `theta = 0`, there are *no* valid placements for object 8 because the required separation from objects 4 and 5 is larger than the available space on the surface.
           
           Let's reconsider the rotation `theta = pi/4`.
           Half-diagonal of object 8: `0.0694`.
           Max x/y for center: `(-0.135 + 0.0694, 0.135 - 0.0694)` = `(-0.0656, 0.0656)`. This is a much smaller range.
           
           Collision with object 5 (center `(0,0)`, half-diagonal `0.073 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.0516`):
           `abs(x_8) < 0.0516 + 0.0694 = 0.121`
           `abs(y_8) < 0.0516 + 0.0694 = 0.121`
           Since the maximum allowed `x_8, y_8` for object 8 at `theta=pi/4` is `0.0656`, any placement at `theta=pi/4` will overlap with object 5's footprint if object 5 is also at `theta=pi/4`. However, object 5 is at `theta=0`.
           Let's use the AABB collision for object 5, even with object 8 rotated.
           Object 5 AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`.
           Object 8 (at `theta=pi/4`) AABB, if centered at `(x_8, y_8)`:
           `x in [x_8 - 0.0694, x_8 + 0.0694]`
           `y in [y_8 - 0.0694, y_8 + 0.0694]`
           
           Collision with Object 5 AABB:
           `abs(x_8) < 0.0365 + 0.0694 = 0.1059` AND `abs(y_8) < 0.0365 + 0.0694 = 0.1059`.
           Since the valid range for `x_8, y_8` is `[-0.0656, 0.0656]`, this means any placement of object 8 at `theta=pi/4` will collide with object 5.
           
           This means placing object 8 on the surface is not possible given the current occupied space and the object's size. Let me re-check my calculations.
           
           Surface L = 0.27, L/2 = 0.135
           Object 5 (ID 5) -- s5 = 0.07301, s5/2 = 0.0365. Placed at (0, 0, 0, 0). AABB: [-0.0365, 0.0365] in x and y.
           Object 4 (ID 4) -- s4 = 0.08220, s4/2 = 0.0411. Placed at (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0). AABB: [0.08-0.0411, 0.08+0.0411] = [0.0389, 0.1211] in x, [-0.0411, 0.0411] in y.
           Object 8 (ID 8) -- s8 = 0.09813, s8/2 = 0.04906.
           
           Let's assume `theta=0` for object 8.
           Allowed center for object 8: `x_c` in `[-0.135+0.04906, 0.135-0.04906]` = `[-0.08594, 0.08594]`
           `y_c` in `[-0.08594, 0.08594]`
           
           Collision with Object 5:
           `|x_c_8 - x_c_5| < s8/2 + s5/2 = 0.04906 + 0.0365 = 0.08556`
           `|y_c_8 - y_c_5| < s8/2 + s5/2 = 0.04906 + 0.0365 = 0.08556`
           Since `x_c_5 = 0, y_c_5 = 0`:
           `|x_c_8| < 0.08556` AND `|y_c_8| < 0.08556` implies collision with object 5.
           So, to avoid collision with object 5, `|x_c_8| >= 0.08556` OR `|y_c_8| >= 0.08556`.
           
           Collision with Object 4:
           `|x_c_8 - x_c_4| < s8/2 + s4/2 = 0.04906 + 0.0411 = 0.09016`
           `|y_c_8 - y_c_4| < s8/2 + s4/2 = 0.04906 + 0.0411 = 0.09016`
           Since `x_c_4 = 0.08, y_c_4 = 0`:
           `|x_c_8 - 0.08| < 0.09016` AND `|y_c_8| < 0.09016` implies collision with object 4.
           So, to avoid collision with object 4: `|x_c_8 - 0.08| >= 0.09016` OR `|y_c_8| >= 0.09016`.
           `x_c_8 - 0.08 >= 0.09016` => `x_c_8 >= 0.17016` (outside surface bounds)
           `x_c_8 - 0.08 <= -0.09016` => `x_c_8 <= -0.01016`
           
           Combining conditions for non-collision:
           1. `(|x_c_8| >= 0.08556)` OR `(|y_c_8| >= 0.08556)`
           2. `(x_c_8 <= -0.01016)` OR `(|y_c_8| >= 0.09016)`
           
           Let's look for `x_c_8` in `[-0.08594, 0.08594]` and `y_c_8` in `[-0.08594, 0.08594]`.
           
           Consider placing object 8 in the negative x-region and positive y-region.
           Let `x_c_8 <= -0.01016`. This satisfies condition 2 for x.
           Then we need to satisfy condition 1: `(|x_c_8| >= 0.08556)` OR `(|y_c_8| >= 0.08556)`.
           If `x_c_8` is around `-0.0859`, then `|x_c_8|` is `0.0859`, which satisfies `|x_c_8| >= 0.08556`.
           In this case, we have a candidate `x_c_8 = -0.0858`.
           This also satisfies `x_c_8 <= -0.01016`.
           So, if `x_c_8 = -0.0858`, we only need to make sure `y_c_8` is within its allowed range `[-0.08594, 0.08594]`.
           Let's try a small positive `y_c_8`, e.g., `0.01`.
           Placement: `(0, 0.0, -0.0858, 0.01)`
           
           Let's check this placement:
           Object 8 AABB: `x in [-0.0858 - 0.04906, -0.0858 + 0.04906] = [-0.13486, -0.03674]`
           `y in [0.01 - 0.04906, 0.01 + 0.04906] = [-0.03906, 0.05906]`
           
           Check bounds:
           `x`: `[-0.13486, -0.03674]` is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`. OK.
           `y`: `[-0.03906, 0.05906]` is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`. OK.
           
           Check collision with object 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`):
           Object 8's x-range `[-0.13486, -0.03674]` does not overlap with Object 5's x-range `[-0.0365, 0.0365]`. (Specifically, `-0.03674 < -0.0365`). So no collision with Object 5.
           
           Check collision with object 4 (AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`):
           Object 8's x-range `[-0.13486, -0.03674]` does not overlap with Object 4's x-range `[0.0389, 0.1211]`. So no collision with Object 4.
           
           This placement `(0, 0.0, -0.0858, 0.01)` looks promising.
           I'll try a few other similar placements, keeping `theta=0`.
           We need to satisfy `|x_c_8| >= 0.08556` or `|y_c_8| >= 0.08556`.
           And `x_c_8 <= -0.01016` or `|y_c_8| >= 0.09016`.
           
           Let's try satisfying `|y_c_8| >= 0.09016`. Max `y_c_8` is `0.08594`. This means `y_c_8` can't be `0.09016`.
           This confirms my earlier suspicion that `theta=0` is very difficult/impossible.
           My calculation for `s8/2 + s4/2` for y-collision (`0.09016`) is greater than the max allowed y-center (`0.08594`). This effectively means that if `x_c_8` is in the `(-0.01016, 0.17016)` range (i.e. if it's not far enough away from object 4 in the x-direction), then `y_c_8` must be `> 0.09016` or `< -0.09016` to avoid object 4. This is impossible as `y_c_8` can only go up to `0.08594`.
           
           Therefore, for `theta=0`, the only way to avoid object 4 is for `x_c_8 <= -0.01016`.
           And to avoid object 5: `|x_c_8| >= 0.08556` OR `|y_c_8| >= 0.08556`.
           
           So we must have `x_c_8` in `[-0.08594, -0.08556]` (combining surface bounds and obj 5 avoidance) AND `x_c_8 <= -0.01016` (obj 4 avoidance). So `x_c_8` in `[-0.08594, -0.08556]`.
           If we satisfy this for `x_c_8`, then we just need to satisfy `y_c_8` is in `[-0.08594, 0.08594]`.
           
           So, `x_c = -0.0857` (or similar value in the range `[-0.08594, -0.08556]`) seems to be the only viable x-position with `theta=0`.
           Then for `y_c`, we can choose any value in `[-0.08594, 0.08594]`. Let's use `0.0` or other small values to ensure it's not too close to object 5's y-extent or object 4's y-extent, though my check above showed no collision.
           
           Let's place Object 8 at `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, 0.0)` for example.
           AABB: `x in [-0.0857 - 0.04906, -0.0857 + 0.04906] = [-0.13476, -0.03664]`
           `y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`
           - Bounded by surface: x is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`, y is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`. OK.
           - Collides with Obj 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`):
             x-range `-0.13476` to `-0.03664`. Obj 5 x-range `-0.0365` to `0.0365`. No x-overlap. OK.
             y-range `-0.04906` to `0.04906`. Obj 5 y-range `-0.0365` to `0.0365`. y-overlap, but this is fine as x-ranges don't overlap. OK.
           - Collides with Obj 4 (AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`):
             x-range `-0.13476` to `-0.03664`. Obj 4 x-range `0.0389` to `0.1211`. No x-overlap. OK.
             y-range `-0.04906` to `0.04906`. Obj 4 y-range `-0.0411` to `0.0411`. y-overlap, but this is fine as x-ranges don't overlap. OK.
           
           This placement works.
           Given how tight the space is, it's very likely that only placements in this "far left" region will work. I will try to fill this region with different y-values and orientations, although the orientation `theta=pi/4` will reduce the available central coordinate range.
           
           Let's check `theta = pi/4`.
           Half-diagonal `s8_diag/2 = 0.0694`.
           Max center for object 8: `x_c` in `[-0.0656, 0.0656]`, `y_c` in `[-0.0656, 0.0656]`.
           
           Collision with object 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`):
           `|x_c_8| < 0.0365 + 0.0694 = 0.1059`
           `|y_c_8| < 0.0365 + 0.0694 = 0.1059`
           Since `x_c_8` is in `[-0.0656, 0.0656]`, `|x_c_8|` will always be less than `0.1059`.
           This implies that any placement of object 8 at `theta=pi/4` will collide with object 5's AABB. This is because the object 8's bounding box at `theta=pi/4` is larger than its `theta=0` bounding box, and the available non-colliding area is already small.
           
           Therefore, only `theta=0` (or `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2`) placements in the far left region are likely to succeed.
           I will generate placements varying the y-coordinate for `x_c = -0.0857` and similar x values, keeping `theta=0` or `pi/2`.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned about the following successful placements:
           - Object 5 (side `s5 = 0.07301`) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`.
           - Object 4 (side `s4 = 0.08220`) at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)`. AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`.
           - Object 8 (side `s8 = 0.09813`) at `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, 0.0)`. AABB: `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`.
           
           Now, I need to place object 7, which is square, with side `s7 = 0.08726925363758518`. The surface is `L = 0.27`.
           `L/2 = 0.135`
           `s7/2 = 0.04363462681879259`
           
           For `theta = 0`:
           Valid range for `x` and `y` for object 7, considering only the surface bounds:
           `(-0.135 + 0.04363, 0.135 - 0.04363)` which is `(-0.09137, 0.09137)`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           Effective half-width for a square rotated by 45 degrees is `s7 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.08726925363758518 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06170669275079146`.
           Valid range for `x` and `y` for object 7:
           `(-0.135 + 0.0617, 0.135 - 0.0617)` which is `(-0.0733, 0.0733)`.
           
           Now, I must avoid collision with objects 5, 4, and 8.
           Combined occupied AABB regions for fixed objects:
           Obj 5: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`
           Obj 4: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`
           Obj 8: `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`
           
           Let's assume `theta=0` for object 7 (half-side `0.04363`).
           Collision conditions:
           With Object 5 (center `(0,0)`, half-side `0.0365`):
           `|x_c_7| < 0.04363 + 0.0365 = 0.08013` AND `|y_c_7| < 0.04363 + 0.0365 = 0.08013`
           To avoid collision with object 5: `|x_c_7| >= 0.08013` OR `|y_c_7| >= 0.08013`.
           
           With Object 4 (center `(0.08,0)`, half-side `0.0411`):
           `|x_c_7 - 0.08| < 0.04363 + 0.0411 = 0.08473` AND `|y_c_7| < 0.04363 + 0.0411 = 0.08473`
           To avoid collision with object 4: `|x_c_7 - 0.08| >= 0.08473` OR `|y_c_7| >= 0.08473`.
           From `|x_c_7 - 0.08| >= 0.08473`: `x_c_7 >= 0.16473` (outside surface) OR `x_c_7 <= -0.00473`.
           
           With Object 8 (center `(-0.0857,0)`, half-side `0.04906`):
           `|x_c_7 - (-0.0857)| < 0.04363 + 0.04906 = 0.09269` AND `|y_c_7| < 0.04363 + 0.04906 = 0.09269`
           To avoid collision with object 8: `|x_c_7 + 0.0857| >= 0.09269` OR `|y_c_7| >= 0.09269`.
           From `|x_c_7 + 0.0857| >= 0.09269`: `x_c_7 + 0.0857 >= 0.09269` => `x_c_7 >= 0.00699`.
           OR `x_c_7 + 0.0857 <= -0.09269` => `x_c_7 <= -0.17839` (outside surface).
           
           Summary of avoidance conditions for Object 7 (theta=0, center `(x,y)` in `[-0.09137, 0.09137]`):
           1. Avoid Obj 5: `|x| >= 0.08013` OR `|y| >= 0.08013`
           2. Avoid Obj 4: `x <= -0.00473` OR `|y| >= 0.08473`
           3. Avoid Obj 8: `x >= 0.00699` OR `|y| >= 0.09269` (Note: `|y| >= 0.09269` is outside surface bound `0.09137`, so `|y|` cannot be this large for object 7. This means we *must* satisfy `x >= 0.00699` to avoid object 8 if `y` is small).
           
           Let's try to find an `x` and `y` that satisfies these.
           The constraint `|y| >= 0.09269` from Object 8 cannot be met, so we must satisfy `x >= 0.00699` to avoid Object 8.
           Now, we have `x >= 0.00699`.
           
           Let's check the remaining conditions with `x >= 0.00699`:
           1. Avoid Obj 5: `x >= 0.08013` OR `|y| >= 0.08013`. (Since `x >= 0.00699`, we need to check if `x` is large enough or `y` is large enough).
           2. Avoid Obj 4: `x <= -0.00473` is false, so we must have `|y| >= 0.08473`.
           
           So, for object 7:
           - `x >= 0.00699` (from Obj 8 avoidance)
           - `|y| >= 0.08473` (from Obj 4 avoidance, since x is not small enough)
           - `(|x| >= 0.08013)` OR `(|y| >= 0.08013)` (from Obj 5 avoidance)
           
           The second condition `|y| >= 0.08473` implies the third condition `(|y| >= 0.08013)`.
           So we need:
           - `x >= 0.00699`
           - `|y| >= 0.08473`
           
           Let's check the surface bounds: `x` in `[-0.09137, 0.09137]`, `y` in `[-0.09137, 0.09137]`.
           Combining these:
           `x` must be in `[0.00699, 0.09137]`.
           `y` must be in `[0.08473, 0.09137]` or `[-0.09137, -0.08473]`.
           
           Let's try `x = 0.085`, `y = 0.088`. This is well within the derived ranges.
           Placement `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.088)`
           
           Let's verify this proposed placement:
           Object 7 AABB (theta=0, center (0.085, 0.088), half-side 0.04363):
           `x in [0.085 - 0.04363, 0.085 + 0.04363] = [0.04137, 0.12863]`
           `y in [0.088 - 0.04363, 0.088 + 0.04363] = [0.04437, 0.13163]`
           
           1. Surface bounds:
              `x`: `[0.04137, 0.12863]` is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`. OK.
              `y`: `[0.04437, 0.13163]` is within `[-0.135, 0.135]`. OK.
           
           2. Collision with Object 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`):
              Obj 7 x-range `[0.04137, 0.12863]`
              Obj 5 x-range `[-0.0365, 0.0365]`
              No x-overlap. OK.
           
           3. Collision with Object 4 (AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`):
              Obj 7 x-range `[0.04137, 0.12863]` -- overlaps with Obj 4 x-range `[0.0389, 0.1211]`.
              Obj 7 y-range `[0.04437, 0.13163]`
              Obj 4 y-range `[-0.0411, 0.0411]`
              No y-overlap. OK. (This is because `0.04437 > 0.0411`).
           
           4. Collision with Object 8 (AABB: `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`):
              Obj 7 x-range `[0.04137, 0.12863]`
              Obj 8 x-range `[-0.13476, -0.03664]`
              No x-overlap. OK.
           
           The placement `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.088)` is valid.
           I will generate other placements based on the ranges:
           `x` in `[0.00699, 0.09137]`
           `y` in `[0.08473, 0.09137]` or `[-0.09137, -0.08473]`
           
           I will mostly use `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2` since rotations by `pi/4` severely reduce the available placement area (max center coordinates `[-0.0733, 0.0733]`), which becomes too small to satisfy the non-collision conditions. For instance, for `theta=pi/4`, `s7_diag/2 = 0.0617`. Object 8 avoidance would require `x >= 0.00699`. Max x is `0.0733`. Object 4 avoidance would require `|y| >= 0.08473`, which is outside of `0.0733`. So `theta=pi/4` is not possible for this object.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have learned about the following successful placements:
           - Object 5 (side `s5 = 0.07301`) at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`. AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`.
           - Object 4 (side `s4 = 0.08220`) at `(0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0)`. AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`.
           - Object 8 (side `s8 = 0.09813`) at `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, 0.0)`. AABB: `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`.
           - Object 7 (side `s7 = 0.08727`) at `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.088)`. AABB: `x in [0.04137, 0.12863], y in [0.04437, 0.13163]`.
           
           Now, I need to place object 6, which is square, with side `s6 = 0.0984717952004333`. The surface is `L = 0.27`.
           `L/2 = 0.135`
           `s6/2 = 0.04923589760021665`
           
           For `theta = 0`:
           Valid range for `x` and `y` for object 6, considering only the surface bounds:
           `(-0.135 + 0.04924, 0.135 - 0.04924)` which is `(-0.08576, 0.08576)`.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`:
           Effective half-width for a square rotated by 45 degrees is `s6 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.0984717952004333 * sqrt(2) / 2 = 0.06964408120619894`.
           Valid range for `x` and `y` for object 6:
           `(-0.135 + 0.06964, 0.135 - 0.06964)` which is `(-0.06536, 0.06536)`.
           
           Now, I must avoid collision with objects 5, 4, 8, and 7.
           Let's assume `theta=0` for object 6 (half-side `0.04924`).
           Collision conditions with other objects (all are at `theta=0` for simplicity in AABB collision, as previous objects' rotation does not affect their AABBs):
           
           1. With Object 5 (center `(0,0)`, half-side `0.0365`):
              `|x_c_6| < 0.04924 + 0.0365 = 0.08574` AND `|y_c_6| < 0.04924 + 0.0365 = 0.08574`
              To avoid collision with object 5: `|x_c_6| >= 0.08574` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.08574`.
           
           2. With Object 4 (center `(0.08,0)`, half-side `0.0411`):
              `|x_c_6 - 0.08| < 0.04924 + 0.0411 = 0.09034` AND `|y_c_6| < 0.04924 + 0.0411 = 0.09034`
              To avoid collision with object 4: `|x_c_6 - 0.08| >= 0.09034` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.09034`.
              `x_c_6 - 0.08 >= 0.09034` => `x_c_6 >= 0.17034` (outside surface) OR `x_c_6 - 0.08 <= -0.09034` => `x_c_6 <= -0.01034`.
           
           3. With Object 8 (center `(-0.0857,0)`, half-side `0.04906`):
              `|x_c_6 - (-0.0857)| < 0.04924 + 0.04906 = 0.0983` AND `|y_c_6| < 0.04924 + 0.04906 = 0.0983`
              To avoid collision with object 8: `|x_c_6 + 0.0857| >= 0.0983` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.0983`.
              `x_c_6 + 0.0857 >= 0.0983` => `x_c_6 >= 0.0126`.
              OR `x_c_6 + 0.0857 <= -0.0983` => `x_c_6 <= -0.184` (outside surface).
              Also, `|y_c_6| >= 0.0983` is outside the surface bounds for object 6 (`0.08576`). So we *must* satisfy `x_c_6 >= 0.0126`.
           
           4. With Object 7 (center `(0.085, 0.088)`, half-side `0.04363`):
              `|x_c_6 - 0.085| < 0.04924 + 0.04363 = 0.09287` AND `|y_c_6 - 0.088| < 0.04924 + 0.04363 = 0.09287`
              To avoid collision with object 7: `|x_c_6 - 0.085| >= 0.09287` OR `|y_c_6 - 0.088| >= 0.09287`.
              `x_c_6 - 0.085 >= 0.09287` => `x_c_6 >= 0.17787` (outside surface) OR `x_c_6 - 0.085 <= -0.09287` => `x_c_6 <= -0.00787`.
              `y_c_6 - 0.088 >= 0.09287` => `y_c_6 >= 0.18087` (outside surface) OR `y_c_6 - 0.088 <= -0.09287` => `y_c_6 <= -0.00487`.
           
           Combining conditions for non-collision for object 6 (theta=0, center `(x,y)` in `[-0.08576, 0.08576]`):
           - From Obj 8: `x >= 0.0126`.
           - From Obj 4: `x <= -0.01034` OR `|y| >= 0.09034`.
             Since `x >= 0.0126` (from Obj 8), the `x <= -0.01034` condition is not met. So we *must* have `|y| >= 0.09034`.
             However, the max `y` for object 6 is `0.08576`. So `|y| >= 0.09034` is impossible.
           
           This suggests that for `theta=0`, there are no possible placements for object 6.
           My reasoning from previous objects about rotated objects being too large still applies. `s6_diag/2 = 0.06964`. Max center for `theta=pi/4` is `0.06536`.
           Collision avoidance with object 8 required `x >= 0.0126`.
           Collision avoidance with object 4 required `|y| >= 0.09034` or `x <= -0.01034`.
           Since `x >= 0.0126`, we must have `|y| >= 0.09034`.
           But `|y_c_6|` can only go up to `0.06536` for `theta=pi/4`.
           So, no placement seems possible under `theta=pi/4` either.
           
           Let me double-check all my calculations as this is a very strong conclusion.
           Let's re-examine the collision conditions on Y axis from Object 4 and Object 8 for `theta=0` for object 6:
           `|y_c_6| < 0.09034` implies collision with object 4.
           `|y_c_6| < 0.0983` implies collision with object 8.
           To avoid collision with Object 4: `|y_c_6| >= 0.09034`.
           To avoid collision with Object 8: `|y_c_6| >= 0.0983`.
           
           If `x` is in certain ranges (which it is for object 6 to be on the surface), these y conditions are necessary.
           For object 6 (half-side 0.04924), its y-center `y_c_6` must be in `[-0.08576, 0.08576]`.
           This means `|y_c_6|` cannot be `0.09034` or `0.0983`.
           So, we *must* satisfy the x-conditions for avoidance.
           
           Let's combine all X-conditions:
           - `x_c_6` in `[-0.08576, 0.08576]` (surface bounds)
           - `|x_c_6| >= 0.08574` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.08574` (Obj 5 avoidance)
           - `x_c_6 <= -0.01034` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.09034` (Obj 4 avoidance)
           - `x_c_6 >= 0.0126` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.0983` (Obj 8 avoidance)
           - `x_c_6 <= -0.00787` OR `|y_c_6| >= 0.09287` (Obj 7 avoidance)
           
           Given that `|y_c_6|` cannot be `0.09034`, `0.0983`, or `0.09287` (since max is `0.08576`):
           The conditions effectively become:
           - `x_c_6` in `[-0.08576, 0.08576]`
           - `|x_c_6| >= 0.08574` (from Obj 5)
           - `x_c_6 <= -0.01034` (from Obj 4)
           - `x_c_6 >= 0.0126` (from Obj 8)
           - `x_c_6 <= -0.00787` (from Obj 7)
           
           Now combine these simplified x-conditions:
           `x_c_6` must be in `[-0.08576, 0.08576]`
           AND `(|x_c_6| >= 0.08574)` means `x_c_6 >= 0.08574` or `x_c_6 <= -0.08574`.
           AND `x_c_6 <= -0.01034`
           AND `x_c_6 >= 0.0126`
           AND `x_c_6 <= -0.00787`
           
           The condition `x_c_6 >= 0.0126` contradicts `x_c_6 <= -0.01034` AND `x_c_6 <= -0.00787`.
           This is a true contradiction.
           
           This implies that there are no stable placements for Object 6 on Surface 0, given the current arrangement of objects 4, 5, 7, and 8. The objects are too large and the surface too small to accommodate another object of this size.
           
           However, I must provide 50 placements. Perhaps my AABB collision check is too strict for certain rotations, or there's a small pocket I missed, or I must assume that the `y` conditions for avoidance are not absolute if `x` condition is satisfied, and vice-versa. But for AABB, both conditions (x and y overlap) must be true for a collision. If one is avoided, it doesn't collide.
           
           Let's re-evaluate:
           A placement `(idx, theta, x, y)` collides with an existing object if their AABBs (considering `theta`) overlap.
           
           If I try to place object 6 at `(0, 0.0, 0.0857, -0.0857)` (a corner for itself).
           Object 6 AABB (center (0.0857, -0.0857), half-side 0.04924):
           `x in [0.0857 - 0.04924, 0.0857 + 0.04924] = [0.03646, 0.13494]`
           `y in [-0.0857 - 0.04924, -0.0857 + 0.04924] = [-0.13494, -0.03646]`
           
           Check bounds:
           `x` in `[0.03646, 0.13494]` (within `[-0.135, 0.135]`). OK.
           `y` in `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` (within `[-0.135, 0.135]`). OK.
           
           Check collision with Object 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`):
           `x` range `[0.03646, 0.13494]` vs `[-0.0365, 0.0365]`. No x-overlap (0.03646 is just greater than 0.0365). This is actually overlapping. `0.03646` is almost `0.0365`. This will collide.
           
           My initial detailed check was correct: there seems to be no space for object 6.
           However, I must provide 50 placements. I will generate placements that are *potentially* valid, even if my AABB calculations suggest high likelihood of collision, as the exact fixed obstacles are not fully known to me, and perhaps there is a small error in my reasoning, or the simulator has some tolerance. I will prioritize filling areas that are less likely to collide, such as "corners" of the remaining space.
           
           Let's try to fit object 6 in the bottom-right quadrant or top-left, making sure to avoid the areas occupied by 4, 5, 7, 8.
           Object 5 (center (0,0)) occupies `x:[-0.0365,0.0365], y:[-0.0365,0.0365]`
           Object 4 (center (0.08,0)) occupies `x:[0.0389,0.1211], y:[-0.0411,0.0411]`
           Object 8 (center (-0.0857,0)) occupies `x:[-0.13476,-0.03664], y:[-0.04906,0.04906]`
           Object 7 (center (0.085,0.088)) occupies `x:[0.04137,0.12863], y:[0.04437,0.13163]`
           
           The available space is very fragmented.
           1. Bottom-right: `x` can be `[0.1211, 0.135]` and `y` can be `[-0.135, -0.0411]`. But also needs to avoid object 5.
              This region is: `x` in `(0.0389 + 0.0411 (Obj4), 0.135 - 0.04924 (Obj6_hside))` = `(0.08, 0.08576)`
              And `y` in `(-0.135 + 0.04924, -0.0411 - 0.04924)` = `(-0.08576, -0.09034)` (invalid range, min > max). This part of my calculation for free space might be slightly off due to simplified AABB combining.
           
           I will try placing object 6 in the regions that are furthest from any existing objects.
           For example, the bottom-left corner of the surface: `x` towards `-0.135`, `y` towards `-0.135`.
           Object 8 is at `(-0.0857, 0.0)`. Its AABB is `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`.
           This means the bottom-left corner `(x_c = -0.08576, y_c = -0.08576)` would have its x-range `[-0.13499, -0.03652]` and y-range `[-0.13499, -0.03652]`.
           X-range of Obj 6: `[-0.13499, -0.03652]` vs Obj 8 x-range `[-0.13476, -0.03664]`. Overlap.
           Y-range of Obj 6: `[-0.13499, -0.03652]` vs Obj 8 y-range `[-0.04906, 0.04906]`. No y-overlap.
           
           So, a placement like `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, -0.0857)` (bottom-left corner of available object 6 space) could work, relying on the y-separation from object 8.
           Let's check `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, -0.0857)` (half-side 0.04924):
           Obj 6 AABB: `x in [-0.13494, -0.03646]`, `y in [-0.13494, -0.03646]`
           
           1. Surface bounds: OK.
           2. Collision with Obj 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`):
              X-overlap: `[-0.0365, 0.0365]` overlaps `[-0.03646]`. No, `-0.03646` is greater than `-0.0365`. This means the X-ranges of Obj 6 and Obj 5 are `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` and `[-0.0365, 0.0365]`. They do not overlap on X. OK.
           3. Collision with Obj 4 (AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`):
              X-ranges `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` vs `[0.0389, 0.1211]`. No X-overlap. OK.
           4. Collision with Obj 8 (AABB: `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`):
              X-ranges `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` vs `[-0.13476, -0.03664]`. They overlap in X (e.g. at -0.0366).
              Y-ranges `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` vs `[-0.04906, 0.04906]`. No Y-overlap (Obj6 y_upper `-0.03646` is greater than Obj8 y_lower `-0.04906` so they touch/overlap at the top of object 6, but Obj 6 is entirely below the Y range of object 8).
              `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` is not overlapping with `[-0.04906, 0.04906]` because the lowest point of object 8 is `-0.04906` and the highest point of object 6 is `-0.03646`. So, no Y-overlap. OK.
           5. Collision with Obj 7 (AABB: `x in [0.04137, 0.12863], y in [0.04437, 0.13163]`):
              X-ranges `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` vs `[0.04137, 0.12863]`. No X-overlap. OK.
           
           It appears the placement `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, -0.0857)` is valid! This means my combined `x` and `y` conditions for avoidance were too strict or were misapplied in the combined logic. The AABB overlap logic is a more robust way to check.
           Since this corner works, the other three corners of the available space should also be explored.
           Another corner is top-right `(0.0857, 0.0857)`.
           Object 6 AABB (center (0.0857, 0.0857), half-side 0.04924):
           `x in [0.03646, 0.13494]`, `y in [0.03646, 0.13494]`
           
           1. Surface bounds: OK.
           2. Collision with Obj 5 (AABB: `x in [-0.0365, 0.0365], y in [-0.0365, 0.0365]`): No x-overlap (0.03646 is greater than 0.0365). No y-overlap. OK.
           3. Collision with Obj 4 (AABB: `x in [0.0389, 0.1211], y in [-0.0411, 0.0411]`):
              X-overlap: `[0.03646, 0.13494]` vs `[0.0389, 0.1211]`. Yes, they overlap in x.
              Y-overlap: `[0.03646, 0.13494]` vs `[-0.0411, 0.0411]`. No y-overlap (`0.03646 > 0.0411`). OK.
           4. Collision with Obj 8 (AABB: `x in [-0.13476, -0.03664], y in [-0.04906, 0.04906]`): No x-overlap. OK.
           5. Collision with Obj 7 (AABB: `x in [0.04137, 0.12863], y in [0.04437, 0.13163]`):
              X-overlap: `[0.03646, 0.13494]` vs `[0.04137, 0.12863]`. Yes.
              Y-overlap: `[0.03646, 0.13494]` vs `[0.04437, 0.13163]`. Yes. (E.g. at 0.05).
              So this placement `(0, 0.0, 0.0857, 0.0857)` *collides* with object 7. My AABB overlap check was finally correct! The previous reasoning was too pessimistic.
           
           So, the first placement `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, -0.0857)` (bottom-left) should work, but `(0, 0.0, 0.0857, 0.0857)` (top-right) collides with object 7.
           Let's try bottom-right: `(0, 0.0, 0.0857, -0.0857)`.
           Obj 6 AABB: `x in [0.03646, 0.13494]`, `y in [-0.13494, -0.03646]`
           
           1. Surface bounds: OK.
           2. Collision with Obj 5: No x-overlap. OK.
           3. Collision with Obj 4: X-overlap. Y-overlap: `[-0.13494, -0.03646]` vs `[-0.0411, 0.0411]`. They *do* overlap in Y: `[-0.0411, -0.03646]` is the overlap. So this collides with object 4.
           
           Let's try top-left: `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, 0.0857)`.
           Obj 6 AABB: `x in [-0.13494, -0.03646]`, `y in [0.03646, 0.13494]`
           
           1. Surface bounds: OK.
           2. Collision with Obj 5: No x-overlap. OK.
           3. Collision with Obj 4: No x-overlap. OK.
           4. Collision with Obj 8: X-overlap. Y-overlap: `[0.03646, 0.13494]` vs `[-0.04906, 0.04906]`. They *do* overlap in Y: `[0.03646, 0.04906]` is the overlap. So this collides with object 8.
           
           So only `(0, 0.0, -0.0857, -0.0857)` seems plausible for `theta=0`.
           I need to generate 50 placements. I will generate slight variations around this one good placement and also try other positions that might have a very small chance of success. This situation is extremely tight.
