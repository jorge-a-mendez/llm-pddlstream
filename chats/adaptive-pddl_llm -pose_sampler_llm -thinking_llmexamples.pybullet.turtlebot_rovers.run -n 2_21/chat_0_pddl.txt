User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about finding those 25 robot base positions:**
           
           I'm given a `target_point = (1.2, -1.8)` and need to find 25 valid (x, y) coordinates for the robot's base. These positions need to be within a `max_range` of 4 from the target, and, importantly, lie within the environment bounds of `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`. I also need to ensure that the chosen positions avoid collisions with fixed obstacles represented as AABBs and maintain a clear line of sight to the target. I'll also be mindful of the possibility that this might be a follow-up request, and if the prior position failed, I'll need to consider what lessons were learned.
           
           The initial step involves scene analysis. I have a set of AABBs describing the environment: a large bounding box, walls, and several smaller obstacles. Notably, a central vertical wall at `x=0` significantly impacts line-of-sight possibilities. Given the `target_point`, I need to prioritize robot positions that will not be occluded by this central wall.
           
           To generate valid positions, I'll employ a systematic strategy:
           
           1.  **Sampling:** I'll generate positions around the target point using a radial pattern. I'll use radii from 0.5 up to the `max_range`. I'll consider 360 degrees of rotation around the target, using a fine granularity of angles to have enough options.
           2.  **Filtering:** Each proposed position will undergo several checks:
               *   **Environment Limits:** Ensuring it is within `x: [-2.5, 2.5]` and `y: [-2.5, 2.5]`.
               *   **Max Range:** Checking it is within a distance of `4` from the `target_point`.
               *   **Collision Detection:** Checking for collisions with any fixed obstacles represented as AABBs using standard AABB-vs-point collision checks.
               *   **Occlusion Check:** Since the target (1.2, -1.8) is to the right of the central wall, any proposed robot base position on the left side of the wall is going to be occluded. If the robot position has an x-coordinate of -0.05 or lower, the position will be discarded to ensure line-of-sight.
           3.  **Iteration:** This will continue until 25 valid positions are found.
           4. If this process does not result in enough positions, I'll add a random sampler to help make sure the requirements of 25 positions are met.
           
           Here are the specific details of the constraints I will be using to filter locations.
           
           *   **Distance Constraint:** `dist(P, target_point) <= 4`
           *   **Environment Constraints:** `P.x in [-2.5, 2.5]` and `P.y in [-2.5, 2.5]`
           *   **Obstacle Collision:** Check for intersection between a proposed position (x,y) and the given AABB obstacles.
           
           The coordinates will be output for the robot.
