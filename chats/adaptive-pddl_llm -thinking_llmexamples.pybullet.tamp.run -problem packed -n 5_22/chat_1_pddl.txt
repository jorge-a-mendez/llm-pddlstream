           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           As an expert in planning, I've meticulously reviewed the provided problem description and constraints. The core of this problem lies in the strict limitation on available action instances. My goal is to achieve a state where objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` are all on `v20`. The critical challenge here is that this requires moving these objects from their initial support on `v11` to the desired target.
           
           The problem defines the `on` predicate as an axiom, which implies we need to establish `atpose(object, #o2)` for each object while maintaining support on `v20`. This is where the limited action set presents an insurmountable hurdle. The system provides only one valid action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action effectively does nothing in terms of object manipulation or achieving the required `atpose` states. Specifically, it manipulates only the `canmove()` and `atbconf(v3)` predicate and has no impact on picking, placing, or the `on` relationship.
           
           The key to reaching the goal is to use `pick` and `place` instances, which, for a classic STRIPS planner, would be considered. These actions would modify the `atpose` predicate to achieve the goal by moving objects to the new location. However, the explicit constraint that only provided actions are available directly prohibits this. Without the necessary `pick` and `place` instances to manipulate objects, the goal of placing the objects on `v20` is demonstrably unreachable. The only action available is a no-op that effectively removes `canmove()`, which would be a useful precondition in the `pick` and `place` action instances.
