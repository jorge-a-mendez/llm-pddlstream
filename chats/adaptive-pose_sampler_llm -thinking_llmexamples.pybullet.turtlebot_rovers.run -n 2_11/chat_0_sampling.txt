(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. The user wants three robot base positions around a specific target point. These bases have to be within a 2-unit radius of the target, and the robot's orientation will automatically be set to face the target. The tricky part is avoiding collisions with a bunch of fixed obstacles defined by AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) in the scene, and also trying to avoid occlusion by those same obstacles.
           
           I'm thinking, my main objective is to generate these three positions, filtering them through a few checks.  Firstly, they have to be within the environment boundaries, which are basically an x-y range of `[-2.5, 2.5]`.  Secondly, they can't be inside any of the fixed AABBs. And ideally, I'd like to get a bit of diversity in my selection.
           
           The target point is `(-1.6531, -0.5901)`.
           
           **Obstacle Considerations**
           
           I've got a central wall-like obstacle (AABB 5) at `x=0`. Since the target is to the left of this wall, I should keep the robot bases on the same side, to prevent the wall from blocking the target. So, I need to make sure the x-coordinate of the robot base is less than -0.05.
           
           **Position Generation Strategy**
           
           My approach will be this.  I'll start by generating candidate positions around the target, maintaining a distance of 2 from the target. The obvious choices would be in the North, South, East, West directions, and then combinations like North-East, and so on.
           
           However, I already learned that placing the robot in the East of the target would cause it to collide with the central wall (AABB 5).  Therefore, given the target position `(-1.6531, -0.5901)`, the robot base must be placed on the left side of the central wall with `px < -0.05`.
           
           **Candidate Position Refinement**
           
           Let's begin by the most promising directions:
           
           **Candidate 1: Above Target (North)**
           
           -   I'll try directly above the target (increasing y).
               -   Candidate Position 1 = `(-1.6531, 1.4099)`
               -   This falls inside the boundary and the central wall.
               -   This position checks out!
           
           **Candidate 2: South-East of the Target**
           -   I have learned that placing positions south will not work due to not staying away from the boundary (AABB 2).
           -   Let's use `py = -2.0` (still within the distance 2 bounds).
               -   This will give us a south-east position.
               -   This gives us Position = `(-0.2346, -2.0)`.
               -   The coordinate check out and will be clear of all other AABBs.
           
           **Candidate 3: Top-Left from the target (North-West)**
           
           -   We need to keep `x < -0.05` to be on the same side of the central wall (AABB 5).
           -   Let's try Position 3 = `(-2.4, 1.2652)`.
               -   This is valid!
           
           **Collision and Obstacle Checking**
           
           Now, I'm going to carefully double-check these three proposed positions against all the fixed AABBs. I've got a detailed routine for verifying that the x and y coordinates fall within the boundaries of each AABB. Any collisions here will lead to disqualification and a new iteration.
           
           **Final Solution**
           
           After thorough testing, the three valid base positions that work, and will ensure no occlusion by AABBs, are:
           
           1.  (-1.6531, 1.4099)
           2.  (-0.2346, -2.0)
           3.  (-2.4, 1.2652)
           
           These positions will need to be checked and confirmed with the actual robot dimensions.

(Thoughts: **My Strategic Robot Base Positioning Plan**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with finding three good spots for this robot, all within a 2-meter radius of a specific target point and without crashing into anything. The target is out there at (1.89, -0.63), and I need to consider a bunch of fixed obstacles, plus keep the robot inside the room's boundaries (-2.5 to 2.5 in both X and Y).
           
           Given that the target is in the right half of the room, I immediately know I need to position the robot in the right half as well, to avoid the annoying central wall. That means all X coordinates need to be greater than 0.05.
           
           Here's my thinking for each position:
           
           *   **Position 1:** I wanted to place it to the right, basically, but had to carefully adjust the Y so that it was at the correct distance and would not collide with the right wall's corner. I did some quick calculations, setting X to 2.4 and ensuring the base was at 1.3 to avoid crashing into the walls.
           
           *   **Position 2:** For this one, I aimed for the lower side of the room but still in the right half. To avoid the lower wall I needed to set Y to -2.4 and calculated the X to be 0.96.
           
           *   **Position 3:** I initially considered placing the robot above the target, but I knew I could make it more interesting and choose a position where the robot base was slightly to the left, so I calculated for Y=0.81. This ensures that the robot is not on the same position as position 1.
           
           I've carefully checked all these positions against the predefined obstacles – the walls, that central divider, and some other rectangles in the room - and the bounds and made sure they're all clear. I've also done a final double-check to confirm that I'm inside the main bounds of the room (-2.5 to 2.5).
           
           So, the plan is: (2.4, 1.3068), (0.9647, -2.4), and (0.5, 0.8101). These three positions are ready to go.
