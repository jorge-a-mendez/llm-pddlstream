           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm looking at this problem, and my goal is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* `v18`.  Easy enough, right? I've got my initial state, and I can see where these objects currently are: they're all *on* `v11`.  My brain immediately jumps to "pick them up and place them down", the classic approach.
           
           But here's the snag: the only action I'm *given* to work with is `move_base`.  It essentially moves the robot's base without changing any object positions. Its preconditions are met in the initial state, and it changes nothing relevant to the `on` predicate. It is basically a "no-op" for my purposes here.
           
           My expert intuition, sharpened by years of planning under constraints like these, tells me I'm missing some vital pieces of the puzzle. There are no *pick* or *place* actions defined!  No way to manipulate the objects to get them where I need them to be.  I've double-checked, even the `clean` and `cook` actions are clearly irrelevant to this problem.
           
           Therefore, given the available actions, there's absolutely no way to alter the `on` state of the objects and achieve the goal.  It's just not possible with the constraints imposed by this problem. I have to declare the goal unachievable.
