User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is mostly clear in the center, with walls on the boundaries at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5, as well as a vertical wall at x = 0. There are also a number of smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are within the allowed x and y limits and are within a distance of 2 from the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not close to the larger obstacles, especially the walls and the central divider. I will also try to vary the positions to provide diverse viewing angles.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     My previous attempts for the target point (0.17066710260408643, -1.9168936997455113) all resulted in collisions.
           The position (0.17066710260408643, -0.0) collided with obstacle 5, which is the vertical wall at x=0. This makes sense as the x-coordinate of the proposed position is very close to 0.
           The position (-1.8293328973959136, -1.9168936997455113) collided with obstacle 6, which is located in the bottom-left quadrant.
           The position (2.1706671026040864, -1.9168936997455113) collided with obstacle 16, located in the bottom-right quadrant.
           
           It appears the target point is in a crowded area. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are further away from known obstacles and try to get a clear line of sight. Given the target point is at y = -1.91, I will try to find positions with a larger y value or further out in x if possible, within the max_range of 2.
