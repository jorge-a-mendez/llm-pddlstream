           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. There are several objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) in the environment. The rovers are currently at configurations v13 and v15 respectively. The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` axiom, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (these are already true)
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (these are already true)
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for all rocks of type `v2`
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for all rocks of type `v6`
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           - `receivedimage` for all objectives: This requires taking an image of each objective and then sending it.
           - `receivedanalysis` for all rocks of type `v2` and `v6`: This requires sampling each rock of these types and then sending the analysis.
           
           Looking at the initial state and available actions, the only actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. There are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available in the provided list. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve any of the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals.
           
           --Plan--:
           It is impossible to achieve the goal because the necessary actions for taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis (i.e., `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are not available in the given list of valid action instances.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `It is impossible to achieve the goal because the necessary actions for taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis (i.e., `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a storage unit v16. There are several objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) and rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) in the environment. The rovers are currently at configurations v13 and v15 respectively. The goal is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` axiom, which requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` (these are already true)
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` (these are already true)
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)` for all rocks of type `v2`
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for all rocks of type `v6`
           
           Upon reviewing the available actions, the only actions are `move v12 v13 #o2 v13`, `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`, `drop_rock v12 v16`, and `drop_rock v14 v16`. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, which are necessary to satisfy the `new-axiom@0` goal. The goal is fundamentally unachievable with the provided set of allowed actions.
