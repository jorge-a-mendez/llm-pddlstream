           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about generating 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0:**
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. Object 5 is a 0.07x0.07 square, and surface 0 is an AABB from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) won't impact its size or containment within the surface.
           
           I've calculated the valid placement range for the object's center: the x-coordinate must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and the y-coordinate between -0.565 and -0.035. I've chosen to use a grid-based approach to distribute the 50 placements. I'll make a 7x7 grid for x and y.  Using 7 * 7 I get 49 different (x,y) pairs, I'll then add one more with a different theta.
           
           To make the grid, I'm dividing the x-range (0.53) into 6 equal steps and the y-range (0.53) into 6 equal steps. I'll then step through these and generate (x, y, theta) placement tuples.  Most placements will have theta=0, but I'll make the 50th use a pi/4 theta and I might vary a few others for diversity.
           
           I need to make sure the placements are within the range I calculated and distinct. I will round the coordinates to 6 decimal places, and all coordinates will then be in range (and distinct as long as I have the right step size). The 50th placement is distinct because of a different theta.
           
           Here's the approach:
           
           1.  Calculate the valid x and y center ranges for the object's placement.
           2.  Divide the range into a 7x7 grid.
           3.  Generate the grid's (x, y) coordinates with small changes in theta.
           4.  Round the (x, y) values to 6 decimal places.
           5.  Set theta = pi/4 for the 50th placement to ensure that all are distinct.
           
           This method will ensure that I generate 50 distinct and stable placements for the object on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 10**
           
           My analysis begins by noting the provided successful placements for a different object (ID 5), which, while potentially useful for future reference, isn't immediately relevant to this task. The focus is now on object ID 10, with dimensions of approximately 0.0949 x 0.0949, indicating a square shape.
           
           My primary objective is to find 50 stable placements for this object on Surface 0, defined by the coordinates ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  To achieve stability, the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be entirely contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           I first calculate the object's half-extents (0.04745).  Then, I determine the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) to ensure full containment within the surface:
           
           *   **x-coordinate range:** [4.2474545, 4.7525455]
           *   **y-coordinate range:** [-0.5525455, -0.0474545]
           
           Because of the square shape, I know that rotation doesn't change the bounds, but it can increase diversity. To generate the desired 50 placements, I'll create a 7x7 grid of points within the calculated valid ranges, for a total of 49 placements, varying rotation angle on the 50th placement.
           
           To create the grid, I carefully calculate the step size for both x and y coordinates (approximately 0.08418), and then the following x and y coordinate lists.
           
           *   **x_coords:** [4.2475, 4.3316, 4.4158, 4.5000, 4.5842, 4.6684, 4.7525]
           *   **y_coords:** [-0.5525, -0.4684, -0.3842, -0.3000, -0.2158, -0.1316, -0.0475]
           
           Finally, for the 50th placement, I'll place the object at the center of the available area (x=4.5, y=-0.3) and apply a rotation of pi/4. This will provide a diverse set of stable placements while ensuring the object remains fully contained within Surface 0.
