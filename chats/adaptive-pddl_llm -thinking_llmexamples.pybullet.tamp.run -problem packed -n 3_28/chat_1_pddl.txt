(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan: Achieving `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`**
           
           My analysis indicates a straightforward approach to fulfill the goal of placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`. Since these objects are currently supported on `v11` and positioned at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, the solution boils down to a sequence of `pick` and `place` actions, leveraging the robot's arm `v4`.
           
           The initial state suggests arm `v4` is `handempty` and the robot base is at configuration `v3`. The crucial point is to employ the `kin` predicates to validate and structure the plan around the available actions (`pick`, `place`, `move_base`, `clean`, `cook`). Since the robot's base configuration is constant and `move_base` action would prevent a valid plan from executing, the plan will exclude the `move_base` action.
           
           Each object will undergo two actions:
           1.  **Pick:** `v8` is picked from pose `v9` using `v4` and, similarly, `v12` is picked from `v13` and `v14` from `v15`.
           2.  **Place:** Then, each object `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` is placed at the common target pose `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The order of `pick` and `place` operations is independent of each object. `Kin` predicates support picking and placing by using the same grasp `#o1`, base `v3`, and trajectory `#o4`.
           
           I will be carefully checking continuous parameters (`#o0` for `basemotion`, `#o1` for `grasp`, `#o2` for `pose`, `#o3` for `bconf`, `#o4` for `atraj`) against given initial states and ensure that each pre-condition and post-condition is fulfilled.
           
           Here's the planned sequence:
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           4.  `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           6.  `place(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           This straightforward strategy should effectively achieve the objective without relying on unnecessary base movements, and maintaining `canmove()` between picks/places.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new challenge, and it's quickly become clear that the task is impossible with the tools I've been provided. The user pointed out the initial plan was invalid due to using actions not in the allowed list, so let's try a fresh approach, focusing solely on what's permitted.
           
           I'm starting with the initial state and the ultimate goal. The initial state is a standard configuration with three graspable objects (v8, v12, v14), all supported on v11, and the robot's arm is empty. The robot is also at configuration v3. The goal, however, is to get those same objects, v8, v12, and v14, onto a new pose, v16.
           
           From my understanding, to achieve "on(object, region)", I need to ensure the objects are supported on the correct region. This means I'm looking to get those three objects supported on v16. I can see in the initial state that v8, v12, and v14 are *already* supported on v16! So the challenge is to move those objects from v11 to v16.
           
           Here’s where the problem arises. The only allowed action instance I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It moves the robot’s base from v3 to v3 with a given trajectory. Its preconditions are met in the initial state, namely `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and `canmove()`. However, the effect of this action includes removing the precondition `canmove()` and adding it back.
           
           I need to move objects, and for that, I'd typically rely on `pick` and `place` actions, which I know depend on the precondition `canmove()`. But `move_base`, in the given constraints, is the only option, and it's not designed to move objects. Even if it *did* allow me to keep `canmove()`, I'm still stuck because `pick` and `place` are explicitly *not* allowed.
           
           Since `move_base` doesn't directly affect the position of the objects and I'm limited to just that action, I'm forced to conclude that the goal is simply unattainable with the given constraints. The only thing I can do is move the base, which is useless because I can't interact with the objects at all. I have to report that this plan is infeasible.
