           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Plan for Axiom Achievement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to successfully achieve `new-axiom@0()` – it's a bit involved, but I've broken it down step-by-step. The initial state is promising, with the first four conditions already satisfied. The key to this problem lies in satisfying the remaining conditions: getting images from objectives and analyzing the right types of rocks.
           
           First, let's tackle those images. I have two rovers at my disposal: `v12` and `v14`, along with lander `v9` and the camera `v10`. I see that I can leverage both rovers to achieve `comvisible` with the lander. I need to move a rover to an imaging configuration, capture images of the four objectives, then move back and transmit them. Since both rovers are initially in `atconf`, I'll start with rover `v12` to handle all the image-related operations. It looks like `v12` and `v14` are both capable of fulfilling this role. However, since the goal states that `atconf` must be restored, and my motion and image steps will move both rovers from their initial states. I will take note of what the end state should be, and move rovers to their proper start configurations at the end of execution.
           
           Here's the detailed image plan:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` to the image configuration (`#o3`).
           2.  **Calibrate** `v10` on `v12` to target `v17`.
           3.  **Take image** `v17`.
           4.  **Repeat steps 2 & 3** for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           5.  **Move** `v12` to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           6.  **Send** each captured image to the lander (`v9`).
           7.  **Move** `v12` to its starting position `(v13)`.
           
           Next, I need to focus on rock analysis, specifically stone of type `v2` and soil of type `v6`. I'll employ rover `v14` for sampling and analysis, to ensure `atconf(v12, v13)` will remain met for the goal state. I know from the initial state that both `v12` and `v14` can access the rocks in the world. I need to:
           
           1.  **Move** `v14` to a rock-sampling location (`#o5`).
           2.  **Sample** a stone (type `v2`) at `v3` and drop the sample, due to a store constraint for sampling.
           3.  **Sample** soil (type `v6`) at `v5`, and drop again.
           4.  **Move** `v14` to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           5.  **Send** the analysis of `v3` and `v5` to `v9`.
           6.  **Move** `v14` back to its initial configuration (`v15)`.
           
           Finally, for the continuous parameters. I need to specify the location for the configs:
           1. `#o3 v12`: Represents `v12`'s position for imaging. I will place this config for `v12` at `(0.5, 0.5)`. This will allow me to capture all images given in the world.

Model:     **Strategic Plan for Axiom Achievement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to successfully achieve `new-axiom@0()` – it's a bit involved, but I've broken it down step-by-step. The initial state is promising, with the first four conditions already satisfied. The key to this problem lies in satisfying the remaining conditions: getting images from objectives and analyzing the right types of rocks.
           
           First, let's tackle those images. I have two rovers at my disposal: `v12` and `v14`, along with lander `v9` and the camera `v10`. I see that I can leverage both rovers to achieve `comvisible` with the lander. I need to move a rover to an imaging configuration, capture images of the four objectives, then move back and transmit them. Since both rovers are initially in `atconf`, I'll start with rover `v12` to handle all the image-related operations. It looks like `v12` and `v14` are both capable of fulfilling this role. However, since the goal states that `atconf` must be restored, and my motion and image steps will move both rovers from their initial states. I will take note of what the end state should be, and move rovers to their proper start configurations at the end of execution.
           
           Here's the detailed image plan:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` to the image configuration (`#o3`).
           2.  **Calibrate** `v10` on `v12` to target `v17`.
           3.  **Take image** `v17`.
           4.  **Repeat steps 2 & 3** for `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           5.  **Move** `v12` to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           6.  **Send** each captured image to the lander (`v9`).
           7.  **Move** `v12` to its starting position `(v13)`.
           
           Next, I need to focus on rock analysis, specifically stone of type `v2` and soil of type `v6`. I'll employ rover `v14` for sampling and analysis, to ensure `atconf(v12, v13)` will remain met for the goal state. I know from the initial state that both `v12` and `v14` can access the rocks in the world. I need to:
           
           1.  **Move** `v14` to a rock-sampling location (`#o5`).
           2.  **Sample** a stone (type `v2`) at `v3` and drop the sample, due to a store constraint for sampling.
           3.  **Sample** soil (type `v6`) at `v5`, and drop again.
           4.  **Move** `v14` to the communication configuration (`#o0`).
           5.  **Send** the analysis of `v3` and `v5` to `v9`.
           6.  **Move** `v14` back to its initial configuration (`v15)`.
           
           Finally, for the continuous parameters. I need to specify the location for the configs:
           1. `#o3 v12`: Represents `v12`'s position for imaging. I will place this config for `v12` at `(0.5, 0.5)`. This will allow me to capture all images given in the world.
           2. `#o0 v12`: Represents `v12`'s position for communication. Configured `(0.0, -2.0)`.
           3. `#o0 v14`: Represents `v14`'s position for communication. Configured `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           
           That should do it. It's a comprehensive plan, designed to fulfill all requirements and state restoration. The configuration details will make sure that those spatial constraints are met. I have performed some verification by calculating and checking for the distances.

(Thoughts: **Plan Rationale: Navigating the Complexities of Continuous Configurations**
           
           Alright, here's the deal. I've got a tricky situation here, a plan that demands precise positioning and avoids collisions while juggling imaging and analysis tasks. The core of the problem lies in these "configuration" objects, symbolized by those hash-prefixed names like `#o3` and `#o0`. They represent *specific* locations for the rovers.
           
           The initial plan failed because of collisions between configurations, primarily when communicating with the lander (`v9`). So, my first order of business is to nail down collision-free spots for both Rovers (`v12` and `v14`) when talking to `v9`. I've got the collision reports, and it's clear I need to stay away from those areas where objects are too close for comfort. My geometric constraints: stay within a 4-unit range of the lander for communication.
           
           Now, we're also dealing with image-taking, and that's where the real headache begins. The initial configuration for imaging was also problematic. I have the additional constraints on images: The objects, `v17, v18, v19, v20`, are all between x values of -2.1 and 2, y values of 1.8 and 2.1. The constraints for these objects, according to their ranges, are very restrictive, so I need to find new configurations for imaging.
           
           The biggest challenge is this instruction: I need to assign continuous values to the configurations, using some new symbols. "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." In other words, for an imaging rover such as `v12`, I *must* assign a different (x,y) location for each object!
           
           So, I'm stuck with multiple movements. I will use the base plan of going to each, taking and calibrating images, and going back. In other words, for the image objectives, that means making distinct assignments for all, for example, `#o3 v12 v17`, `#o3 v12 v18`, etc.
           
           The only way to make it all work is to assume that, even if I'm using the *same* `#o3` name in the plan, I can specify different continuous locations for different targets, say, using `(#o3_v12_v17)` for `v17` and `(#o3_v12_v18)` for `v18`. So, there will be multiple `move` actions between them for `v12`. I need to handle collision with *all* configurations, including the lander, when sending data.
           
           The analysis with `v14` follows a similar structure, and the problem is easier because I will just have rock `samples` and send their locations and their analysis to the lander. The objective for the rock samples is to go directly over their locations.
           
           Ultimately, it is a very long plan.

(Thoughts: **My primary concern right now is optimizing the rover's movements to meet the given objectives while adhering to the reachability and obstacle collision constraints. I've been given some initial configurations, and it's my job to refine these, ensuring they are valid and minimize the distance the rovers need to travel.**
           
           The problem at hand involves four main tasks: imaging specific objectives, sampling rocks, and ensuring continuous communication with the lander. The initial setup presents challenges, mainly due to the constraint of a wall located at x=0, which restricts movement and communication between the rovers and the lander, and the fact that the rovers are on either side of the wall.
           
           Initially, I devised that the rovers should split the imaging duties. Rover v12 takes the images to the right of the wall, and rover v14 to the left. But after many iterations, I realized that for rover v12, communication to lander v9 is *impossible*. The axiom `blocked` is a roadblock; a rover has to have a clear line of sight.
           
           Since the wall acts as a constant obstacle that renders any direct communication or movement across impossible, I have decided to reassign all tasks to rover v14. Rover v12 will remain stationary in its starting configuration. Rover v14 will now have to image all objectives, take and analyze samples, and communicate with the lander.
           
           My new plan involves setting new configuration values for rover v14. I've carefully calculated new target configurations for each objective. I've considered distances, collision with the wall, and whether the destination is reachable from the initial configuration. The main challenges are that rover v14 might have to go back and forth between the left side and right side of the wall and go a considerable distance to achieve the goal locations.
           
           I've revised the plan to minimize movements. For each objective, I've tried to make sure that the imaging/sampling configurations are *reachable* from the previous configurations (assuming my motion predicates are correct, since this is a symbolic plan). The continuous parameter values now represent specific, collision-free locations relative to each task's requirements.
           
           In this plan, all the objectives are in range, but rover v14 *must* be able to path around the wall. Otherwise, this plan won't be viable.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's the game plan, as I see it:**
           
           Based on the feedback, the provided configurations are all invalid, so I need to completely rethink the rover's movements.  The biggest problem seems to be getting around that central wall (v21) and navigating within the limited movement range of the robots. I'm focusing on trying to keep the rovers on their respective sides of the wall. Rover v14, being on the same side as the lander, is now the primary mover and the communication hub.  All analyses, image-capturing, and sampling will happen with v14.
           
           **Here's the new plan:**
           
           *   **Move v14:** First I'll need to figure out locations for all the image objectives (v17, v18, v19, and v20), lander communications, and the sampling sites. Based on the "not reachable" error messages, I've got to take this very carefully so I don't set up the robot for failure.
           *   **Imaging:** For the imaging locations, I need to keep the rover within 2 units of the objectives. To dodge the wall, the rover needs to be positioned within range, but not directly across from the objective.
           *   **Communication:**  The lander communication (v9) is the biggest challenge, but I've got a strategy to navigate the robot to the appropriate location.
           *   **Sampling:** The soil and stone samples will need the rover to go directly over the top of the rocks, while also navigating the surrounding obstacles.
           *   **Safety First:**  I've checked each of these calculated configurations to make sure the rover won't collide with the fixed obstacles (wall, lander, small rocks, etc.) and that the line of sight is clear. I've also done my best to minimize Y movement where I can.  This should give the robot the best possible chance to actually *get* to the required locations.  If I'm successful with these positions, the rover will need the least amount of movement to avoid collisions with other obstacles.
           
           I believe this will be a much more feasible plan, assuming the rover's motion planner can handle the adjusted movements, all the while not colliding with existing objects. If this does not work, more adjustments must be done.
