           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `new-axiom@0()`. This thing is a conjunction of several conditions. My immediate thought is, let's break it down and see what needs to be true. I see I need to achieve `receivedimage` predicates for different images using the mode `v11` and also achieve `receivedanalysis` predicates for specific rocks and soil types. Crucially, I have a very limited set of actions I can use: some seemingly useless `move` actions (which don't change anything) and `drop_rock`, which can't be used due to an unmet precondition.
           
           Looking at the goal, I need to get images and analyses.  To do this, I would need actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, those actions *aren't* in the list of what I can use. This creates a problem.  I see that I need these `take_image`, `send_image` and other actions to get the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates, but they're not even available.
           
           The available actions are useless: the `move` actions simply reposition the rovers to the same location (a no-op), and `drop_rock` fails because the rover storage is empty, not full. So, the constraints are tight, and it looks like I'm stuck.
           
           I confirm my understanding by going back to the statement that any action not explicitly listed cannot be used. And then, I confirm by looking closely at the preconditions of the `drop_rock` action: It requires the rover store to be full (which it isn't).
           
           Considering I am given only the `move` and `drop_rock` actions, and these actions don't allow to produce new states (such as `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`) I must conclude: the provided goal is *unachievable* with the given constraints. I cannot construct a plan to satisfy the goal predicate `new-axiom@0()`.
