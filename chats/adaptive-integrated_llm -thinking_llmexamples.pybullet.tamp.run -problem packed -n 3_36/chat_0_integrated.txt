User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.08, 0.355), (0.179, 0.454)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.101, -0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.964, 0.265).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.063, -0.353), (0.161, -0.255)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.149, -0.48), (-0.053, -0.384)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.129, 0.404, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, -0.372).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.112, -0.304, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.433, 0.901).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom stackable(v12, v16)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)

           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)

           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom stackable(v14, v16)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)

           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, I'm facing a constraint here. The goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto surface `v16`.  This translates to satisfying the `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` predicates.  To make `on(object, surface)` true, I need to ensure the object is both `supported` by and at a certain `pose` on the surface. Specifically, I need to get `supported(v8, ?p_8, v16)` and `atpose(v8, ?p_8)`, and similarly for `v12` and `v14`.
           
           The initial state tells me these objects are currently on `v11`. However, my toolbox is incredibly limited.  The only action instance I'm allowed to use is `move_base`. No `pick` or `place` actions are available. This is the killer.  I can't manipulate the `atpose` predicates without a `pick` or `place` action.
           
           Currently, I have `atpose(v14, v15)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `atpose(v8, v9)`.  To achieve the goal, I would need to modify these poses to, in this case, `atpose(v8, #o2)`, `atpose(v12, #o2)`, and `atpose(v14, #o2)`. However, since I can't pick up or place objects, I'm stuck with the initial poses. And I also have conflicting facts because the prompt tells me to assign distinct variables.
           
           So, given the restriction to `move_base` and the absence of `pick` and `place`, I can't alter the `atpose` facts.  Therefore, I cannot change the `on` predicates from `on(..., v11)` to `on(..., v16)`.  The goal is fundamentally unreachable with this limited action set.
