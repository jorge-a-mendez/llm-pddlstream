User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.149, -0.48), (-0.053, -0.384)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.129, 0.404, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, -0.372).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.063, -0.353), (0.161, -0.255)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.101, -0.432, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.964, 0.265).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.112, -0.304, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.433, 0.901).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.08, 0.355), (0.179, 0.454)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **A Path to Object Placement: A Detailed Plan**
           
           My goal is to arrange objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto the surface `v16`, specifically achieving the states `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The challenge lies in the initial state where these objects are supported on `v11` and positioned at specific poses.  The solution strategy is straightforward: pick up each object from its initial pose, and then place it on `v16`.
           
           The given actions are `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Since I'm just manipulating objects, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. The provided `move_base` action doesn't actually move the robot's base; it serves as a "no-op" to allow other actions to proceed.
           
           The initial positions are:
           - `v8` at pose `v9`,
           - `v12` at pose `v13`,
           - `v14` at pose `v15`.
           
           The target surface, `v16`, is a small square.
           
           The key is to pick and place each object. The `pick` and `place` actions rely on `kin` predicates, which are crucial. They involve arm configurations, base configurations, grasp parameters, and trajectories.  Crucially, I'm using the robot's arm `v4` throughout the plan. The shared parameters, such as the grasp `#o1`, base configuration `#o3`, and trajectory `#o4` will be used to streamline the plan. I will be specifying poses such as the placement poses.
           
           Since the problem requires different, continuous values for the pose in `place` actions, I will have to find them. The placement surface is `v16`. I need distinct and feasible positions on `v16` for each of these objects to avoid collisions. I'll need to compute the x, y coordinates as well as quaternions and z coordinate (height).  I can reuse the z coordinate of 0.781 from their initial configurations. For placement:
           
           -   Place `v8` at (x=-0.085, y=0.085, z=0.781) with quaternion (0, 0, 0.928, -0.372).
           -   Place `v12` at (x=0.085, y=0.085, z=0.781) with quaternion (0, 0, 0.433, 0.901).
           -   Place `v14` at (x=0, y=-0.085, z=0.781) with quaternion (0, 0, 0.964, 0.265).
           
           The plan's flow will be:
           
           1.  Pick `v8`
           2.  Place `v8` at the calculated pose.
           3.  Pick `v12`.
           4.  Place `v12` at its calculated pose.
           5.  Pick `v14`.
           6.  Place `v14` at its calculated pose.
           
           I will use standard PDDL operators of `atbconf`, `handempty` and `atgrasp`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so the user correctly pointed out a critical flaw: the actions used in the previous plan, `pick` and `place`, are *not* permitted.  The only action instance we're allowed to use is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This is a significant constraint.
           
           The overall goal is clear: get objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* surface `v16`.  We need `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The initial state shows that these objects are at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, with support from `v11` initially. We need to define `supported` for the new support (v16) and `atpose` for new poses.
           
           Now, the problem.  The `move_base` action is completely useless for achieving this goal. It's essentially a no-op, moving the base from `v3` to `v3`. It fiddles with the robot's configuration (`atbconf`) and `canmove()`, but it does *nothing* to alter the positions of the objects themselves.  We have no means to manipulate objects in any meaningful way. The only way to achieve `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)` is by moving the objects, and we just can't do that with the current action. We can't change the `supported` surface from `v11` to `v16` and the `atpose` predicates.
           
           Therefore, given *only* `move_base` as a permitted action, the goal is unequivocally unreachable. It's a dead end. We need different actions, or the problem is fundamentally unsolvable.
