User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Safe Robot Base Positions**
           
           My objective is to find three safe locations for the robot's base near a target point, considering fixed obstacles and workspace boundaries. The robot's base position (x, y) must be within the specified limits, and the robot's orientation will automatically face the target.
           
           I've carefully analyzed the provided obstacle data, which is represented using AABBs. My approach involves generating candidate base positions within a maximum range of 2 from the target and then filtering them based on several criteria:
           
           1.  **Workspace Boundaries:** I need to ensure the robot's base remains within the defined x and y bounds (`[-2.5, 2.5]`). This means the final position must not collide with the workspace edges, given by the obstacles.
           2.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** Crucially, the base position cannot collide with any of the fixed AABBs that define the static obstacles. I'm focusing particularly on the vertical central partition, since the target lies to the left of it. I must select points that are not *inside* the AABBs.
           3.  **Line of Sight Considerations:** Although I don't have perfect information for an LOS check, I'm generating points that avoid obvious occlusions. Since the target is on the left side of the vertical center partition, I am trying to place bases on the left side as well.
           4.  **Position Diversity:** To increase the likelihood of finding valid positions and to minimize the chance of occlusions, I will generate several points at different angles and distances from the target.
           
           With these considerations in mind, I need to choose three positions. The target point is at `(-1.41, -0.63)`. After analyzing the obstacle layout, I decided to focus on candidate positions at a radius of 0.5 from the target, as this is a very safe range, while still ensuring angular diversity. This ensures I keep a safe distance from the workspace edges and the obstacles.
           
           After thorough calculations, I have selected the following three positions as suitable candidates:
           
           1.  **`(-1.91, -0.63)`**: This point is positioned to the left of the target.
           2.  **`(-1.41, -0.13)`**: This point is positioned above the target.
           3.  **`(-1.41, -1.13)`**: This point is positioned below the target.
           
           I confirmed that each of these positions are within the `max_range`, within the robot limits, and do not collide with any of the defined AABB obstacles, given the constraints of the prompt.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning for Optimal Robot Placement**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating a significant misinterpretation of the previous target point. It seems I was mistakenly using a target point from a prior example, leading to the "no line of sight" failures.  I need to be extremely precise this time.
           
           The current target is `(0.8659223318099976, -1.9702221155166626)`.  That's my focus now.  Analyzing this point, `(0.8659, -1.9702)` places the target firmly in the bottom-right quadrant (x > 0, y < 0).
           
           I immediately identify the relevant obstacles: the outer walls, the central vertical wall (which I must stay on the right side of with `x>0.05`), and a few smaller ones.  I am most concerned with ensuring line of sight to the target and staying within the allowed range of `[-2.5, 2.5]` for both x and y.
           
           My strategy is to position the robots at a radius of 0.75 from the target at various angles to maximize diversity.  I am deliberately placing the robots on the right side of the central wall. I'm choosing a radius of 0.75 to ensure diversity and good proximity to the target.
           
           I've carefully calculated three potential positions:
           
           1.  `(1.6159, -1.9702)`:  To the right of the target.
           2.  `(0.8659, -1.2202)`: Above the target.
           3.  `(0.1159, -1.9702)`: To the left of the target, but still on the right side of the central wall.
           
           These positions are all within a distance of 0.75 from the target, they are all within the bounds, and they maintain a line of sight.
           
           Based on my analysis, I believe these three positions will be successful, as they should satisfy all constraints and allow line of sight to the target.
