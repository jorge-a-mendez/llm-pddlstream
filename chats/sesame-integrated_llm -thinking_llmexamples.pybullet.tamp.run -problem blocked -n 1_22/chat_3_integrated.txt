           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.446, 0.441), (-4.354, 0.533)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.4, 0.487, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.207, 0.978).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Journey to Achieve a New Axiom**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to satisfy the goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which, as a seasoned expert, I immediately recognize as a requirement to ensure a specific object is both *on* a designated surface and *of* a particular type.  The facts given directly map to achieving `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.
           
           The crucial detail here is that `?green` is `v12`, an object of type `v17`. The initial state reveals `v12` is *on* another surface, `v14`, and I need to move it to `v18`. This requires two atomic facts: `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`, where `?p` represents a pose.
           
           Analyzing the initial state, I see that I have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. Bingo! This means I have a potential place to move v12 to, labeled `#o2`. This fulfills half the goal. To make the move, I need to pick and place. There are actions already available to use: `pick` and `place`.
           
           My initial state informs me that the base is currently in `v3` position, and I need to move it to `#o3` (base configuration).  A valid action to move base is present `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This will be step 1.
           
           The robot then needs to pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`. It has preconditions: `handempty` and `atpose(v12,v13)`. These are met. Also, `kin` relation should be true between `v4` (arm), object `v12`, pose `v13` (current),  base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`.  So the 2nd action should be  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`.
           
           Finally, action three: move the object to new place using `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. This action fulfills the requirement `atpose(v12,#o2)`, and, using `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, ensures `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Now, for any `#o` values: I have a constraint. My understanding is that only the poses associated with `#` require a value. Given that `pose(v12, #o2)` is in the initial state, I must define a stable position for `v12` on `v18`.  `v18` is a table-like surface and `v12` is a smaller object. The best position is the center of v18.
           
           So I derive `#o2 = (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Putting it all together:
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v12 (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           And my analysis shows this plan achieves the goal: it places `v12` on `v18` while preserving its type.  I am confident that this is a valid and efficient plan based on the problem specification.
