           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.446, 0.441), (-4.354, 0.533)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.4, 0.487, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.207, 0.978).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning to Achieve the Goal (new-axiom@0)**
           
           My objective is to achieve the new axiom `(new-axiom@0)`, which requires both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Examining the initial state, I see that `type(v12, v17)` is present, implying `?green` must be `v12`. Therefore, my immediate goal becomes achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I need to satisfy the axiom which states the need for two conditions: `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  I can see that `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` exists in the initial state, meaning that the specific pose I need for `v12` is `#p1`. This makes my new subgoal `atpose(v12, #p1)`.
           
           Currently, the state specifies `atpose(v12, v13)`. I've determined I need to pick `v12` from its current pose and place it at `#p1`. I need to execute `(pick)` and `(place)` actions, combined with `move_base` actions to navigate to appropriate configurations.
           
           I've identified the following plan:
           
           1.  **(move_base v3 #q2 #t6)**: I need to move the base from initial configuration `v3` to configuration `#q2` to be able to pick.
           2.  **(pick v4 v12 v13 #g1 #q2 #t5)**: Pick up object `v12`. This action requires that `v12` is currently at `v13` which is satisfied.
           3.  **(move_base #q2 #q3 #t8)**: Move the base from configuration `#q2` to `#q3` to place the object at the new position.
           4.  **(place v4 v12 #p1 #g1 #q3 #t7)**: Place `v12` at pose `#p1`.
           
           All preconditions for these actions seem to be satisfied at the correct time, with one caveat - the configurations required for each action. However, based on the initial state, I can move the base and the robot seems to be able to grasp objects.
           
           Now, I need to assign a continuous value to `#p1`.  Based on the problem definition I should place the object `v12` on `v18`. I will calculate this so that `v12` sits stable on top of `v18`. From the scene, the pose `v13` corresponds to where the object currently is. So I need to set a new pose `p1` for the object. This will be the center of the surface `v18` with a z-height of 0.8 to make sure the object is above the surface and well within its boundary and supported, ensuring a stable placement. I propose `#p1: (4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0)`.
           
           This plan guarantees that I have all preconditions satisfied and I will be able to successfully achieve `(new-axiom@0)`.
