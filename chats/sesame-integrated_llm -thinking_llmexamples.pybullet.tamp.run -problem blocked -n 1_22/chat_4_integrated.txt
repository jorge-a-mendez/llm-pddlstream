           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.446, 0.441), (-4.354, 0.533)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.4, 0.487, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.207, 0.978).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My initial thought process began by carefully examining the target axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to placing an object, `v12`, of a particular type, onto a surface, `v18`. I recognized that the current state provides a crucial hint: `Atom type(v12, v17)`.  This tells me `v12` is the green object and I need to get it "on" the table.
           
           To get `v12` onto `v18`, I need to leverage the concept of "supported." I need to find a suitable "pose" for `v12` on `v18`. The initial state helpfully mentions  `Atom supported(v12, #p1, v18)`.  This tells me that pose `#p1` is a valid one on the surface `v18`.  Moreover, the current state of `Atom pose(v12, #p1)` suggests `#p1` is a valid *placement* on the surface.
           
           Currently, however, `v12` is located elsewhere: at pose `v13`.  So, I need a plan to move `v12` to `#p1`. I examined the available actions and determined I need to first move the base to be ready for the pick and place. Then I will  `pick` `v12` at `v13` and `place` it at `#p1`.
           
           The plan unfolds as follows:
           
           1.  **Move the base.** First, since the robot arm needs to pick and place, I need to configure the robot to be in the correct location for the pick-up.
           2.  **Pick v12.** This uses the available `pick` action to move `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           3.  **Move the base to the place location.** Since the robot has to place at a different location than its current configuration, it must re-orient to place on the table.
           4.  **Place v12.** Finally, I use the `place` action to get the `v12` at the desired pose, `#p1`.
           
           Based on my analysis of the AABB values for `v12` and `v18`, it *should* be possible to place it correctly. After the plan is executed, `v12` will be "on" `v18`, fulfilling the conditions of the initial goal axiom.
           
           The entire procedure should result in a cost of:
           *  The cost of moving the robot base (which I can't currently determine from the information given)
           *  1 for the pick
           *  the cost of moving again
           *  1 for the place
           
           Since the robot must pick and place (with a cost of 1 each) and the only way to re-orient the base is to have it move to the specific configuration, this is the least-cost option. I *assume* that the motion for the `move_base` step is valid and does not incur an increased cost.
           
           In conclusion, given the constraints of the action instances and my assumptions about collision-free placement, this is the most direct and lowest-cost solution.
