           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) that are currently on `v11` and need to be moved to `v20`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both of which are empty. The robot is at base configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal is to have all objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) on `v20`.
           Looking at the initial state:
           - `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v20`. There is a pose `(#o2)` for `v8` supported by `v20`.
           - `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v20`. There is a pose `(#o2)` for `v12` supported by `v20`.
           - `v14` is at `v15` and supported by `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v20`. There is a pose `(#o2)` for `v14` supported by `v20`.
           - `v16` is at `v17` and supported by `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v20`. There is a pose `(#o2)` for `v16` supported by `v20`.
           - `v18` is at `v19` and supported by `v11`. It needs to be moved to `v20`. There is a pose `(#o2)` for `v18` supported by `v20`.
           
           All objects are graspable. There are also grasp and pose continuous parameters for each object on `v20`.
           
           The only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of objects on surfaces. It only moves the base from `v3` to `v3` (which is effectively staying in the same place). Since the robot cannot pick up or place any objects with the available action, it is impossible to move the objects from `v11` to `v20`. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
