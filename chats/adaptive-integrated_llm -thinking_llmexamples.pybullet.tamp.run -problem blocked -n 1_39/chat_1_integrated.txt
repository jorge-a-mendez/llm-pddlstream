User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.289, 0.25, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.385, 0.923).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.339, 0.2), (-4.24, 0.299)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for Achieving the Goal:**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires placing a green object (let's call it `?green`) onto surface `v18`. I know from the initial state that objects `v8` and `v12` are green.  I need to get either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`. I decided to focus on `v8`. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I must ensure it is both `supported` on and `atpose` with respect to `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, but I need it to be supported by `v18` instead. I have the facts: `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This implies that `v8` *can* be placed on `v18`. From the axioms, the actions `pick` and `place` must be used. To achieve my goal, I need to pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`, and then place it at a new pose `#o2` on surface `v18`.
           
           So, the plan I've formulated is:
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           I have carefully checked the preconditions for each action, and all initial facts are satisfied.
           
           Now, because `#o2` is a pose, it needs a real value. I determined that object's `x` and `y` coordinates based on their current extents. I calculated that `#o2` is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Regarding the base, `v3` and `#o3`. I've assumed that `#o3` must be `v3`, due to the constraints of the `move_base` action that is given in the list. To move the base to `#o3` means to just stay at the current configuration.
           
           This plan accomplishes the objective of placing `v8` on `v18`!  It satisfies the target conjunction.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of the Unattainable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a plan, and it's immediately apparent that it's flawed. The provided plan attempts to execute actions that simply *aren't* valid within the constraints of this problem. The only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's... well, useless, really. It moves the base from one place to the *exact same place*. A no-op.
           
           The ultimate goal, I understand, is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which breaks down into `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In the initial state, we already have `type(v8, v17)`. So, the actual *task* is to make `on(v8, v18)` true. 
           
           Currently, `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. Effectively, it is `on(v8, v11)`. To move `v8` to `v18`, I would naturally consider *pick* and *place* actions – the standard approach. But that's where things fall apart. The list of *valid* actions simply *doesn't include* `pick` or `place`.  
           
           Therefore, given the extremely limited set of available actions, this goal, `on(v8, v18)`, is demonstrably *unreachable*. There is no way, with the tools I'm provided, to move `v8` from its current location to `v18`. This plan is fundamentally flawed, and it's a dead end. I need to inform whomever presented this of the significant limitations of this action set and the impossibility of achieving this goal within the current constraints.
