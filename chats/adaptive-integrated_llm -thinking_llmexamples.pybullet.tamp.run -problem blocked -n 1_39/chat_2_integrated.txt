           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`: Placing `v8` on `v18`**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of type `v17` placed `on` another object. Upon analyzing the initial state, it's evident that I can choose between `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. However, my immediate thought is to focus on `v8`.
           
           The core of the problem lies in satisfying the `on` predicate, which in turn necessitates finding a valid pose for `v8` on `v18`.  Luckily, the initial state indicates that both `v8` and `v12` *can* be placed on `v18`, specifically at a pose labeled `#o2`.  Therefore, if I can find a configuration that achieves `atpose(v8, #o2)`, I'll be one step closer.
           
           Given that `v8` is initially at `atpose(v8, v9)`, the plan unfolds naturally:
           
           1.  **Base Movement (if needed):**  I need to check if any base motion is necessary.  If the base needs to be moved to facilitate the pick/place, this step would be to move the base from its current position `v3` to a suitable configuration `#o3` (which is likely needed to execute pick/place). This is based on `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)`. The exact movement can be achieved by `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           2.  **Pick:**  I will direct the robot arm `v4` to pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`, using a known grasp `#o1`. This will require the action `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           3.  **Place:**  After picking, the next action is `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`, moving `v8` to the specific pose `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           **Continuous Pose Value for `#o2`**
           
           To specify `#o2`, I need to determine a collision-free and stable pose where `v8` can be placed on `v18`. From geometry analysis:
           
           *   Object `v8` has dimensions of roughly 0.07x0.07x0.07. Its center is approximately `(4.5, -0.3, 0.735)`.
           *   Surface `v18` has dimensions of `(4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0)` for the x and y coordinates.
           
           Therefore, a valid placement for `v8` on `v18` would be roughly at the center of the surface area, and `z=0.735`.
           
           **The complete pose for `#o2` is : (4.5, -0.3, 0.735, 0.0) (quaternion)**
           
           This pose ensures that the required conditions are met: `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `atpose(v8, #o2)`. This action fulfills the condition of the axiom and solves the problem by putting the `v8` on `v18`.
