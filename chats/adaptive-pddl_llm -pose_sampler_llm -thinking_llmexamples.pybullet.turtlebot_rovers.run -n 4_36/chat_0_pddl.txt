           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal in Restricted Action Set**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown.  My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to ensuring a set of conditions are met: some objects are "at" certain locations, stores are "free," several images have been received, and analyses of soil and stone samples have been received.
           
           Initial analysis reveals that while the "at" and "free" conditions are already satisfied in the initial state, the "receivedimage" and "receivedanalysis" predicates are *not*. This is the core problem.
           
           I then identified the actions available to me. These were extremely limited:  two `move` actions that, critically, appear to be no-ops based on the PDDL definition because they move an object *to its current location*, and two `drop_rock` actions.  The `drop_rock` actions, however, require the stores to be "full," which is also not the case in the initial state.
           
           The key insight is that *none* of the available actions can achieve the remaining subgoals: receiving images, or receiving analyses. To receive images, I'd need actions related to taking and sending images, which are *not* available in the action space. Similarly, to obtain analyses, I'd require actions like sampling and sending analyses, which are also absent.
           
           Given the severely constrained action set, and the requirements of the goal state which are not achievable by the provided actions, I must conclude the goal is **unreachable**.  There's no path forward with the current toolset.
