(Thoughts: **Robot Base Placement Strategy for Target Point (0.9, -1.5)**
           
           Alright, here's my plan to find three suitable base positions for this robot, keeping in mind the constraints: distance to the target, avoiding collisions, and ensuring a clear line of sight.
           
           First, I need to understand the environment.  I've got the boundaries, which are pretty straightforward—it's roughly a 5x5 square with some internal walls represented as AABBs. I've visualized that center wall (AABB 5) as the primary challenge, as the target is on one side, and I need to consider base placement accordingly. I'm treating the robot base as a point to simplify collision checking, and will stick to the provided `[-2.5, 2.5]` bounds. It's safe to use a slightly more conservative region `[-2.45, 2.45]` to keep clear of the AABBs that define the exterior "walls".
           
           The target's at (0.9, -1.5). Since the distance to any proposed base must be within `max_range = 2`, I'll generate candidates nearby. A good strategy is to pick positions around the target at varying distances and angles. I'll stick to positions to the "right" of the target (positive x) because of the central wall.
           
           Let's begin:
           
           1.  **Candidate 1:** I'll put a base to the right, `(2.4, -1.5)`. This means `x` is `0.9 + 1.5 = 2.4` and the `y` coordinate is the same. The distance is 1.5. This coordinate seems clear of collisions with obstacles since its x coordinate is greater than every small blocking coordinate. This gives a nice line of sight to the target.
           
           2.  **Candidate 2:** Next, I'll go straight up from the target. The robot base should be at `(0.9, 0.0)` which is a distance 1.5 from the target. No problems with the central wall here, and this location is "safe" relative to any AABBs.
           
           3.  **Candidate 3:** Finally, I'll place a third base at `(1.7, -0.7)`. This base is a distance `sqrt(1.28)` from the target which is less than 2. The collision checks are clear, and I've double-checked that it doesn't intersect any obstacles.
           
           So, the proposed locations are `(2.4, -1.5)`, `(0.9, 0.0)`, and `(1.7, -0.7)`. I've verified that these are within bounds, the distances are within the specified range, that line-of-sight is present, and they aren't inside or near any AABB obstacles.  I'm confident these will work well.

(Thoughts: **Revised Reasoning and Position Generation for New Target**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my revised thinking and new position generation.  First, I absolutely *must* internalize that I need to treat each request as an independent calculation, focusing on the provided target point for that turn.  I had mistakenly assumed the target from the previous turn would apply, which led to nonsensical results in the last attempt. Lesson learned.
           
           **Analyzing the New Request and Scene:**
           
           The new target is `(1.4, -2.0)`. My goal is to find three robot base positions within a maximum distance of 2 units from this target, within the bounding box of [-2.45, 2.45] for both x and y, and in the right half of the environment (x > 0.05) to stay on the same side of the central wall as the target.  I've got the following obstacles to avoid:
           
           *   **Outer Walls:**  x=[-2.45, 2.45], y=[-2.45, 2.45]
           *   **Central Wall:** AABB 5 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` which splits the space at x=0.
           *   **Fixed Obstacles:**  I've meticulously reviewed the provided AABBs (specifically AABBs 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 20, and 21) within the right half of the environment, to ensure the positions I generate have line of sight to the target and avoid collisions.  AABB 15, positioned at roughly (2.2, -1.8) to (2.3, -1.7), seems particularly relevant, as it's near the target.
           
           **Strategic Position Generation:**
           
           I'll strategically place the robot relative to the target to ensure both line of sight and obstacle avoidance:
           
           1.  **(Right of Target):**  Place the robot at `(2.2, -2.0)`. This places it 0.8 units to the right of the target. This location is within bounds and the line of sight (a horizontal segment) is clear of the AABB 15 because the robot base is positioned below it.
           2.  **(Below the Target):**  Position the robot at `(1.4, -2.3)`. This is 0.3 units below the target and also clears the central wall.  It maintains line of sight with a direct vertical segment.
           3.  **(Up-Left of the Target):** Place the robot at `(0.4, -1.0)`. I can confirm this line of sight to the target remains clear by reviewing the obstacle positions and my prior calculations.
           
           **Final Check:**
           
           These three positions, `(2.2, -2.0)`, `(1.4, -2.3)`, and `(0.4, -1.0)`, satisfy all the constraints. They are within the specified range of the target, avoid all static obstacles, maintain line of sight, and are in the right half of the environment. I should reconfirm that the previous feedback, which led me to this more thorough approach, is directly addressed.
