           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical barrier at x=0. The target point is (0.42841666666666666, 1.4886666666666667). I need to find 3 base positions within 2 units of this target. Given the vertical barrier at x=0, and the target's positive x-coordinate, I should prioritize positions with positive x-coordinates to avoid the barrier. I will also consider positions with slightly negative x-coordinates that are still close to the target, as long as they are to the right of the x=0 barrier.

Model:     The target point is (-0.6390904784202576, 2.1621999740600586). The previous positions failed due to no line of sight or collision with the northern wall (y=2.5). The target is at a high y-coordinate, close to the northern wall. I need to be careful with the y-coordinate of the base position. There are also several small obstacles near the top, such as obstacle 18 around (-0.1, 1.7) and obstacles 20 and 21 around (0.5, 2.1) and (-0.6, 2.1) respectively. Since the target is on the negative x-side, and my previous attempts had positive x, which resulted in no line of sight, I will try positions on the negative x-side of the vertical barrier at x=0. I should avoid having a y-coordinate too close to 2.5 and also consider the obstacles between the robot and target.

Model:     The target point is (0.49390822649002075, 2.1444997787475586). My previous attempts for this target and the previous target failed. The target is in the upper right quadrant, close to the northern wall (y=2.5) and the x=0 barrier. Obstacle 20 ((0.44, 2.09), (0.54, 2.19)) is very close to the target. Obstacles 9 and 10 are also in this general area. The previous attempt to place at (-1.639, 2.162) collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), which is in the upper left quadrant. The 'no line of sight' failures suggest the x=0 barrier is a significant issue, as is obstacle 20. I need to be on the same side of the x=0 barrier as the target. Therefore, I will focus on positive x-coordinates for the base. I will try to stay away from the walls and the known obstacles.
