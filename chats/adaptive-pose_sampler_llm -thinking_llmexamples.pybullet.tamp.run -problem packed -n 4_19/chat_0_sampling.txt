           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Generating 50 Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface, with the placements described as `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.  The object is nearly square with dimensions roughly 0.09 x 0.09 and I'm working with a square surface. There are no collision constraints for this specific instance.
           
           First, I define the size and location of the object and surface. For the surface, I determine the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x and y) based on its dimensions and rotation. Since the object is almost square, the effective bounding box (AABB) won't vary much with small changes in rotation. However, to ensure diversity and meet the request for placement, I will still include the rotation.
           
           I will iterate through the AABB extents of each angle I specify. I've designed the code to iterate over 5 angles, which gives us a distribution of theta values. The formula for the angle is `theta = i * math.pi / (num_thetas-1)`. This will be useful for a number of configurations.
           
           To get the positions to place the angles at, I will set up a 3x3 grid for the x and y values, and then make a calculation of 50. I have set up the angle list and calculations to create the 50 configurations, that will ensure a diverse set of positions and rotations.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request: Place Object ID 4, but I *must* avoid colliding with the already-placed Object ID 5.  I remember that object 5's placement is confirmed, and it's taking up a chunk of space in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  Since this is all in the first person, I'm thinking...
           
           My first step is to figure out the "forbidden zone" – the area around Object 5 where I *cannot* place Object 4.  I need to calculate the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 5, taking into account its width, height, and position.  Knowing Object 5's dimensions and its confirmed (0, 0) placement and rotation (zero degrees), calculating the extents is simple. Object 5 occupies AABB [-0.135, -0.0434] x [-0.135, -0.0434].
           
           Object 4 is square, but slightly smaller. The surface is -0.135 to 0.135 on each axis.
           I also need to work out the valid placement area for Object 4 in its center coordinates. I know if the object is upright, I can't put its center in the bottom-left of the surface because I'm not supposed to collide. So I need to use right side or top-side placement.
           
           The "forbidden" zone is actually not a zone, it's just a region. Since I want to find the first 50 unique placements. I need to generate an exhaustive set, filter out any placements that overlap (which would require generating and checking more), and simply take the first 50.
           
           Here's my refined strategy:  I'll create a grid of potential center locations across the whole surface, for several orientations. I have 10, or more, equally-spaced angles to consider. Then, for each potential placement (angle and center coordinate), I check for overlap between Object 4's AABB and Object 5's AABB.  Any placement that results in an overlap is immediately discarded. I *only* keep placements that *don't* collide.
           
           I'm pretty confident in this approach. It's systematic, takes object dimensions and surface bounds into account, explicitly avoids collisions, and ensures a variety of angles. I'll simply generate more potential placements (at grid coordinates with various angles) than I need and discard the placements that collide.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break this down systematically.** I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 7) on a flat surface (Surface 0). The catch? I need to make sure this new object doesn't collide with two already-placed objects (IDs 5 and 4). My expert eye immediately notes the surface dimensions and the bounding box of the pre-existing objects, forming the spatial constraints I need to consider.
           
           **First, I'll analyze the geometry.** Object 7 is almost a perfect square, which makes the rotation part relatively straightforward. I understand that any rotation will change the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box). The half-widths and half-heights (hw_prime and hh_prime) will fluctuate slightly with angle, but a good approximation can be made. This simplifies the process for my initial search.
           
           **Next, the collision avoidance strategy.** The problem revolves around the AABBs of objects 4 and 5: I need to ensure the AABB of object 7 doesn't overlap these AABBs for any proposed placement. A collision occurs only if the AABB overlaps.
           
           **The plan:** I will select a range of rotation angles. For each angle I calculate the extent of the object in both X and Y.
           Then I'll generate a grid of potential (x, y) center points for the object. By calculating how to avoid O4 and O5 I could filter to get an optimal region to work from. In the initial calculations for the regions and points, I noted that some might be too restrictive in terms of available placement spaces; I will need to iterate through the candidates and check for collision using an efficient grid approach.
           
           I'll check all the points in the grid I made to avoid over lapping with either O4 or O5, so my script is well designed. I'll increase the grid density to ensure I get 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding collisions with three existing objects (IDs 5, 4, and 7). I'm focusing on surface 0, defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. Object 6 has dimensions approximately 0.098x0.098.
           
           First, I need to understand the occupied space. I have meticulously calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects. These AABBs define the regions to be avoided. Essentially, the area `[-0.135, -0.135]` to `[0.135, 0.135]` on the surface has been defined by three rectangular boxes, with one touching the bottom left corner, one near the top left, and one covering the left center.
           
           My primary strategy involves generating a set of candidate placements and then filtering them. I will rotate the square object through various angles: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, and π.  I'll ensure the object remains within the bounds of surface 0. For each rotation, I'll calculate the new effective half-extents. Then, I'll create a grid of potential center points for the object's placement within the valid space. A valid space is any part of the surface that does not overlap with any of the defined AABBs for the existing objects. I have also pre-computed the AABB overlaps for convenience.
           
           I'm applying two strategies to speed up the process. Firstly, I will begin placing new objects by creating a grid in available space where there are no existing objects. Secondly, I will sort through the placement from top to bottom, which helps reduce the number of calculations as soon as a potential collision is detected. Once 50 stable placements are identified, the process concludes.
