User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by a square region defined by obstacles 1, 2, 3, and 4, which effectively create walls at x = +/-2.55 and y = +/-2.55. There's also a vertical obstacle (5) at x=0 that spans the entire y-range. Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the environment. Obstacles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 further constrain the free space.
           
           For the target point (1.89, -0.67), I will aim to find positions within a radius of 2. I'll prioritize positions that are clearly in open spaces and avoid being too close to the known obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           (1.0 -0.67)
           (1.89 -2.0)
           (0.5 -2.0)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target was (1.89, -0.67), not (2.11202335357666, 2.0400304794311523, 0.20100000500679016). It appears there was a misunderstanding of the target point in the previous request's feedback. I will proceed with the new target point provided in the current request.
           
           The new target point is (2.112, 2.040). This point is located in the upper right quadrant, close to the wall. Obstacles 7, 18, 19, and 20 are in this general area. Obstacle 20, specifically, is at ((2.06, 1.99), (2.16, 2.09)), which is very close to the target point, and might cause occlusions or collisions if I place the robot in certain directions. Given the previous feedback about no line of sight, I'll need to be careful with obstacles in the vicinity. I will try to place the robot to the left or bottom of the target to avoid being blocked by obstacle 20 or any other obstacles on the "far side" from the robot.

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now (0.5899542570114136, 1.9326359033584595). This is in the upper right quadrant, close to the vertical obstacle 5 (x=0). Obstacles 9, 10, 18, and 19 are in this area. Specifically, obstacle 19 is ((0.5407206484870567, 1.8834022948341025), (0.6391878655357704, 1.9818695118828165)), which is directly around the target point. This likely explains the collision with (1.0, 2.04), which was too close to obstacle 18. The no line of sight for (2.112, 0.5) is also understandable given the target's position near x=0 and obstacles like 5, 9, 10 and 18, 19 in between.
           
           I need to find a position within 2 units of (0.59, 1.93). I will try positions further away from the dense cluster of obstacles around the target, and on different sides. I will avoid the area between the target and x=0 due to obstacle 5.
           
           Positions:
           (0.5 0.5)
           (-0.5 1.5)
           (0.5 2.5)
