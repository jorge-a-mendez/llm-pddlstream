           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Plan**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  My initial assessment is that they're currently on `v11`, and a simple pick-and-place strategy will likely suffice. The key is to ensure that I move the objects from their current poses to valid poses on `v16`. The available actions are the usual: `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`.
           
           The robot arm, `v4`, is currently empty and at configuration `v5`, and I see the base configuration is at `v3`. I need to handle moving the base before I attempt picking up the objects. To get started, I'll need to move my base to a suitable configuration, `#o3`, where I can execute the `pick` and `place` actions. The `kin` facts and `supported` predicates will guide me on the specific poses and configurations.
           
           It looks like the strategy is straightforward. First, move the base, then pick up `v8`, place it on `v16`.  Repeat for `v12` and `v14`. Crucially, I have to ensure the preconditions for each action are met. Specifically, the base must be in the correct configuration (`#o3`), the arm must be empty, and I need to select the correct object, grasp point, and target place pose, as dictated by the `kin` and `supported` facts.  I'll verify that `#o2` is a valid, safe placement pose on `v16` and ensure no unsafe preconditions, such as collisions, have been specified. With no collisions I can assume that my `pick` and `place` steps will be correct.
           
           The plan will be:
           1.  Move base from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` from its current pose and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           3.  Pick `v12` from its current pose and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           4.  Pick `v14` from its current pose and place it at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           Let's ensure the details of the actions are correct and the preconditions are true: the actions' kinematics are valid, the arm is empty at the appropriate times, the base is at the correct configuration, and that the moves are safe.
