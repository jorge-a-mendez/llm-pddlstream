           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Impossibility of Achieving the Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a plan to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`.  This means they all need to be supported by `v16` and be in their designated poses. Simple enough, in theory.
           
           Let's dive into the current state.  We see that `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are all currently on `v11`.  `v16` is indeed a surface that *could* support them.  The robot has two arms, both are empty, and it's currently at its base configuration, `v3`.  The only available action instance is a do-nothing move of the base.
           
           Now, I start to think about the required actions. I'll need `pick` and `place` instances to shift these objects from `v11` to `v16`.  I review the preconditions: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and the necessary safety checks.  Good. I see I have `kin` facts and `atpose` facts for each object.  The robot is also at base configuration `v3`, which matches the requirement for `atbconf` in my available `kin` facts. I have grasps for each object and my hand is empty.
           
           But here's the kicker: the *only* action instance I have is the robot moving its base to where it already is. This means I'm missing all the critical `pick` and `place` actions!  There are no instances available.  If I can't *pick* up an object and *place* it, I'm stuck.  I'm dealing with a state where I can't manipulate my objects.
           
           Since the only available action is useless, I'm left with the objects still sitting on `v11`, and the goal of getting them on `v16`. Given the constraints, I must conclude this goal is entirely *unreachable*.  I can't move the objects without the ability to pick and place them.  It's a dead end.
