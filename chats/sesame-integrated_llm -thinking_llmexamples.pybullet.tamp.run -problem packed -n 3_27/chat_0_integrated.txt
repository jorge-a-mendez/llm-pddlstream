           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.095, -0.281), (0.184, -0.192)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.285, -0.274), (-0.187, -0.176)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.166, 0.363), (-0.07, 0.459)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.14, -0.237, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.987, 0.163).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.225, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.449, 0.894).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.118, 0.411, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.874, 0.486).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal: getting objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16.  I'm dealing with these objects, all initially on surface v11, and my objective is to place them on v16. I've got a robot with two arms, but the actions are only defined for arm v4. The robot starts at base configuration v3, and arm v4 is in configuration v5, handempty.
           
           The problem requires moving objects from their current poses (v9 for v8, v13 for v12, and v15 for v14) to v16. The key is understanding that I need to place them at specific points on v16, and the system wants unique placements for each.  Since the initial state suggests *supported* relationships,  there shouldn't be any fundamental issues with support on v16 once I get them there.
           
           My available actions are: move_base, pick, and place. The initial state doesn't have an `unsafe` predicates for approach or trajectory.
           
           Here's how I break it down:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** To use the robot's arm to pick and place, it needs to be at a specific base configuration, denoted here as #o3. Since the starting base is v3, I start by moving from v3 to base configuration #o3 using the `move_base` action.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Sequence (for each object):**
               *   **For v8:** Pick it from v9 using arm v4, and then place it at a specific pose on v16, which I'll call `#o2_v8`.
               *   **For v12:** Pick it from v13, and place it at a specific pose on v16, denoted `#o2_v12`.
               *   **For v14:** Pick it from v15, and place it at a specific pose on v16, denoted `#o2_v14`.
           
           The placement strategy is key. I'm going to define unique `#o2` poses on `v16`. Since the objects' sizes are all relatively similar, I will line them in a straight line along the x axis, using a y axis of zero. By placing each object in that pattern, I can ensure that there is no collision between objects and each is safely within the bounding box of v16.
           
           For each `#o2`, the Z height is 0.781. The rotation will be 0.
           Specifically, I plan to place them:
           
               *   For v8: `#o2_v8 = (-0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
               *   For v12: `#o2_v12 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
               *   For v14: `#o2_v14 = (0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           The complete plan is:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` (To go from `v3` to `#o3`)
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v8 #o2_v8 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  `(place v4 v12 #o2_v12 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7.  `(place v4 v14 #o2_v14 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           And I've verified that all the necessary *kin* actions are defined, and that the pose placements are valid. Given the pick and place costs are 1, the total cost for the plan is 6, plus the cost to move base from v3 to #o3. With the current information about that base move cost, this cost is minimal, so I've chosen these poses.
