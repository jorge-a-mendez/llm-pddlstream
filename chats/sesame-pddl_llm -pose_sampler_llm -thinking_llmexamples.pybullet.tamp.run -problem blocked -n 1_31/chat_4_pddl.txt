           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object of a certain type on another specific object. I've got `v12` as the object that needs to be *on* `v18`, and thankfully, `v12` is of the right type.
           
           My initial thought is to figure out the right *pose* for this `v12`. I need to ensure it's both *supported* on `v18` and *at* the correct pose. Thankfully, the initial state already tells me that `#o2` is the ideal pose for `v12` to be supported on `v18`. Right now, `v12` is at pose `v13`.
           
           The core of this problem becomes: I have to *move* `v12` from its current spot to the desired pose `#o2`. This boils down to using `pick` and `place` actions, which I have in my toolbox. The robot arm is `v4`.
           
           So, the plan unfolds like this: first, *pick* `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`. Then, *place* `v12` onto `v18` at pose `#o2` again using arm `v4`. Simple enough conceptually.
           
           But before I can just start picking things up, I need to verify all the preconditions.
           
           For the `pick` action, I need to check the configurations. After scrutinizing the initial state, I see I need to ensure the robot base is at the correct configuration, specifically `#o3`, as this specific `kin` instance suggests. Given that the `move_base` action is available, I'll add that as my first step to align the base. And of course I'll need a trajectory as well, which is present in the initial state with respect to the `kin` instance. Once those are satisfied, the pick action should be valid.
           
           For placing the object, I repeat similar checks with the `place` preconditions. The good news is, I can use the same grasp configuration from the pick. And, the same base and arm trajectory that I got from checking the initial state. Since it looks like all parameters check out and all conditions are met, the place action also seems good to go!
           
           Therefore, the finalized plan is now solid: `move_base` to the target, `pick`, then `place`.
           
           Now, does this plan actually work? Yes, it does. After the place action is executed the robot should have the goal state.
