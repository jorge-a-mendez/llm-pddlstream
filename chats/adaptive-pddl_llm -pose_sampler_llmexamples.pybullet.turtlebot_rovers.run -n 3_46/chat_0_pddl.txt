           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two cameras, `v10` (onboard both rovers), a lander `v9`, and various rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). The rovers are at specific configurations (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`). Both rovers have a storage compartment `v16` which is currently free. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which requires several conditions to be met simultaneously:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` (implicitly satisfied if some rock is of type v2 and analysis is received)
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` (implicitly satisfied if some rock is of type v6 and analysis is received)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's break down the goal and check the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in initial state.
           
           The remaining conditions involve `receivedimage` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` with mode `v11`, and `receivedanalysis` for rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil).
           
           The available actions are extremely limited, only `move` and `drop_rock`. None of these actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. The initial state does not contain any `haveimage`, `receivedimage`, `analyzed`, or `receivedanalysis` facts. Without the ability to `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, the goal is unachievable.
           
           --Plan--:
           No plan is possible as the goal requires sending images and analyzing rocks, but the available actions only allow for movement and dropping rocks, which cannot achieve these required states.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `No plan is possible as the goal requires sending images and analyzing rocks, but the available actions only allow for movement and dropping rocks, which cannot achieve these required states.)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The scene and initial state are as described previously. The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rocks of type `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Upon reviewing the available actions, it's clear that the only possible actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           - `move` actions simply change the rover's configuration from one point to the same point, effectively doing nothing (`(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`).
           - `drop_rock` actions require a rover to have a `full` store, which is not the case for `v12` or `v14` in the initial state (both have `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`).
           
           Crucially, there are no actions to `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`. Without these actions, it is impossible to:
           1. Obtain images (`haveimage`).
           2. Send images to the lander (`receivedimage`).
           3. Sample rocks (`analyzed`).
           4. Send analysis of rocks to the lander (`receivedanalysis`).
           
           Since the goal explicitly requires `receivedimage` for multiple objectives and `receivedanalysis` for two rock types, and these predicates cannot be achieved with the given actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unreachable with the given set of available actions. The plan requires actions like taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis, which are not provided in the list of valid actions.

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem requires achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` (implicitly satisfied if a rock of type v2 is analyzed)
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` (implicitly satisfied if a rock of type v6 is analyzed)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state for the conditions that can be directly observed:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           
           The remaining parts of the goal, namely `receivedimage` for `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and `receivedanalysis` for `?stone` and `?soil`, are not true in the initial state.
           
           The only available actions are:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action moves rover `v12` from configuration `v13` to `v13`. It changes nothing regarding `atconf` and does not affect any other predicates relevant to the goal.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similar to the above, this action moves rover `v14` from `v15` to `v15`, effectively changing nothing.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires `full(v12, v16)` as a precondition. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is not full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: This action requires `full(v14, v16)` as a precondition. In the initial state, `free(v14, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v14` is not full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           None of the provided actions can create the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts. These facts typically require actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`, which are not present in the list of valid actions. Since the goal requires these facts to be true, and there is no way to make them true with the given actions, the goal is unachievable.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unreachable because the necessary actions to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` (such as taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis) are not provided in the list of valid actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is unreachable because the necessary actions to achieve `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` (such as taking images, sending images, sampling rocks, and sending analysis)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem's goal, `new-axiom@0()`, requires several conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: False in initial state.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: False in initial state.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: False in initial state.
           
           The last five conditions (`receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates) are not met in the initial state. To achieve these, actions such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would be required. However, these actions are NOT present in the list of valid actions.
           
           The only valid actions provided are:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action keeps `v12` at `v13`. It does not change `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action keeps `v14` at `v15`. It does not change `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Precondition `full(v12, v16)` is false. Cannot be executed.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Precondition `full(v14, v16)` is false. Cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no actions that can produce the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, and these facts are part of the goal, the goal cannot be achieved with the allowed actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unachievable given the severely restricted set of allowed actions. The necessary actions to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates (such as taking and sending images, or sampling and sending rock analysis) are not available.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is unachievable given the severely restricted set of allowed actions. The necessary actions to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates (such as taking and sending images, or sampling and sending rock analysis)`.

Model:     The goal for this problem is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is false in the initial state. (Requires a rock of type v2 to be analyzed)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is false in the initial state. (Requires a rock of type v6 to be analyzed)
           
           The valid actions provided are:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Rover `v12` moves from configuration `v13` to `v13`. This action does not change any of the goal predicates. `atconf(v12, v13)` remains true.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Rover `v14` moves from configuration `v15` to `v15`. This action does not change any of the goal predicates. `atconf(v14, v15)` remains true.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Precondition `full(v12, v16)` is required. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, so the store is not full. This action cannot be executed.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Precondition `full(v14, v16)` is required. In the initial state, `free(v14, v16)` is true, so the store is not full. This action cannot be executed.
           
           The core issue is that the goal requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true. There are no actions available (such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) that can modify these predicates. Since these critical parts of the goal cannot be satisfied by any available action, the entire goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is impossible to achieve with the provided actions. The plan requires `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts, but no available actions can generate these facts.

Model:     The problem states a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's re-examine these conditions against the initial state and the available actions.
           
           The goal conditions are:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition, satisfied by `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)`.
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is false in the initial state. (Requires any rock of type `v2` to be analyzed and its analysis received).
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition, satisfied by `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is false in the initial state. (Requires any rock of type `v6` to be analyzed and its analysis received).
           
           The allowed actions are extremely limited:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Preconditions: `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `atconf(v12, v13)`. Both are true. Effects: `atconf(v12, v13)` becomes true, `atconf(v12, v13)` becomes false. This means the state after the action would be the same as before for `atconf(v12, v13)`. This action effectively does not change the state relevant to the goal.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similar to the above, this action effectively does not change the state relevant to the goal.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Preconditions: `rover(v12)`, `store(v16)`, `full(v12, v16)`. `full(v12, v16)` is **false** in the initial state (since `free(v12, v16)` is true). Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Preconditions: `rover(v14)`, `store(v16)`, `full(v14, v16)`. `full(v14, v16)` is **false** in the initial state. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           
           None of the provided actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve these, actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would be necessary. Since these actions are explicitly not allowed, the goal, which has these predicates as a crucial component, cannot be reached.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unachievable as the required `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions cannot be met by any of the available actions. The current actions do not provide any mechanism for imaging, sending data, sampling, or analyzing rocks.

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)`
           - `free(v14, v16)`
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           - `type(?stone, v2)` (implicit)
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`
           - `type(?soil, v6)` (implicit)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           Let's check the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` is true.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)` is true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` is true.
           - `free(v14, v16)` is true.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)` are all false.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` are both false.
           
           The available actions are:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition and an effect. It essentially maintains the `atconf` state for `v12`. It does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similar to the above, this maintains the `atconf` state for `v14` and does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action has a precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning `full(v12, v16)` is false. Thus, this action cannot be performed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Thus, this action cannot be performed.
           
           Since there are no actions provided that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are part of the goal, the goal is unachievable given the constraints.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unattainable. There are no available actions to generate `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, which are essential components of the goal state.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem describes a set of objects, an initial state, and a goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a complex conjunction:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: False in initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Satisfied by `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: False in initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Satisfied by `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: False in initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Let's examine the allowed actions:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Preconditions `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `atconf(v12, v13)` are true. Effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `negated atconf(v12, v13)`. This action does not change the state of `atconf(v12, v13)`, nor does it affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similarly, this action does not change `atconf(v14, v15)` or any `receivedimage`/`receivedanalysis` predicates.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, so `full(v12, v16)` is false. This action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Precondition `full(v14, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v14, v16)` is true, so `full(v14, v16)` is false. This action cannot be executed.
           
           None of the provided actions can establish the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates. Without actions such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, it's impossible to satisfy these parts of the goal. Therefore, the goal is unachievable given the very limited set of allowed actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal cannot be achieved. The available actions do not include any mechanism for taking images, sending them, sampling rocks, or sending analysis, which are all necessary to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal cannot be achieved.

Model:     The problem's goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is a complex logical expression:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: False in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: False in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are necessary.
           
           However, the list of *valid action instances* provided is extremely limited:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action, given its parameters, effectively moves rover `v12` from `v13` to `v13`. It maintains `atconf(v12, v13)`. It does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similarly, this action maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` and does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: The precondition `full(v12, v16)` is *not* met because `free(v12, v16)` is true in the initial state. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, `full(v14, v16)` is *not* met. This action cannot be executed.
           
           Since no available action can generate the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, and these facts are a necessary part of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is fundamentally unachievable under the given constraints.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is impossible to achieve given the constraints. There are no available actions to create the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, which are essential for satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` goal.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem requires achieving the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition, rocks `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is false in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition, rocks `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is false in the initial state.
           
           The last five predicates (`receivedimage` for `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for `?stone, ?soil`) are not true in the initial state and must be achieved by actions.
           
           Let's examine the provided list of valid action instances:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action takes `v12` from configuration `v13` to `v13`. Its preconditions `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `atconf(v12, v13)` are met. Its effect is `atconf(v12, v13)` and removes `atconf(v12, v13)`. This means it effectively makes no change to the `atconf(v12, v13)` predicate's truth value. Crucially, it does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similar to the above, this action for `v14` also makes no relevant change to the goal.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, which implies `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions, and these conditions are mandatory for the goal `new-axiom@0()` to be true, the goal is unachievable from the given initial state with the provided actions.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem sets a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of the following conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False initially.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False initially.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: False initially.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: False initially.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: False initially.
           
           The crucial parts of the goal that are not met initially are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Let's review the *only* valid action instances:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action requires `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effect is to make `atconf(v12, v13)` true and simultaneously negate `atconf(v12, v13)`. This means it does not effectively change the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. It does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action works similarly for `v14` and `v15`, making no relevant change to the goal.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action has a precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false initially. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since none of the available actions can make `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates true, and these are essential components of the goal, the goal is unachievable under the given problem constraints.

Model:     The problem specifies a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze each condition based on the initial state and the available actions.
           
           Goal conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: Satisfied by `v1, v3, v4`.
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: False in the initial state.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: Satisfied by `v5, v7, v8`.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: False in the initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve these, actions such as `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           - `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action, given its parameters, moves `v12` from `v13` to `v13`. The precondition `atconf(v12, v13)` is true. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` result in no net change to `atconf(v12, v13)`. This action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           - `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for `v14`, also resulting in no net change relevant to the goal.
           - `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning `full(v12, v16)` is false. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           - `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since none of the available actions can make `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates true, and these are required by the goal, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the provided actions.

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem describes a set of objects, an initial state, and a goal `new-axiom@0()`. Let's analyze the goal's components and the initial state:
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is true as `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is true as `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* allowed actions:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition and an effect that makes `atconf(v12, v13)` true while negating it. This effectively means no change to the truth of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not in any way affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no available actions that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential parts of the goal, the goal is unreachable.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unachievable given the constraints. The available actions do not include any mechanisms for creating `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, which are necessary to satisfy the specified goal.

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()` with multiple conditions. Let's analyze each one in the context of the initial state and the available actions.
           
           Goal conditions:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: False in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This refers to rocks like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: False in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This refers to rocks like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: False in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           The allowed actions are extremely limited:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Preconditions (`motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`, `atconf(v12, v13)`) are met. Effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This action does not change the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` and critically does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similar to the above, this action makes no relevant change to the goal.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Precondition `full(v12, v16)` is required. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning `full(v12, v16)` is false. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similar to the above, this action cannot be executed due to the `full` precondition not being met.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential parts of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unreachable.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of specific conditions. Let's analyze these conditions against the provided initial state and the allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action requires `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. This action does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Similar to the above, this action also maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` and does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action has a precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning `full(v12, v16)` is false. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Thus, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential components of the goal, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.
           
           --Plan--:

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several conditions. I will analyze each condition and its status with respect to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` consists of the following predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as `v1, v3, v4` are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as `v5, v7, v8` are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`.
           
           Now let's review the *only* valid actions that can be used:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action takes `v12` from configuration `v13` to `v13`. Its preconditions `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `atconf(v12, v13)` are both true. The effects update `atconf(v12, v13)` and negate `atconf(v12, v13)`, resulting in no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not in any way affect the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also results in no net change to the relevant goal predicates.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, which implies `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are indispensable parts of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal cannot be achieved from the initial state with the given set of allowed actions.

           Let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. Its effects are to make `atconf(v12, v13)` true and simultaneously negate `atconf(v12, v13)`. This means it results in no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Critically, this action does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

Model:     The problem asks for a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down each condition and compare it to the initial state and the capabilities of the allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects state `atconf(v12, v13)` becomes true and `atconf(v12, v13)` becomes false. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no available actions that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. I will analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

Model:     The problem asks for a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze each condition and compare it to the initial state and the capabilities of the allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.

           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:

Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.

           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. I will analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.

           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.

Model:     The problem asks for a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze each condition and compare it to the initial state and the capabilities of the allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no available actions that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential components of the goal, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:

This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.

           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no available actions that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential components of the goal, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. Let's analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:

This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. Let's analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.

           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. Let's analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

Model:     The problem asks for a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze each condition and compare it to the initial state and the capabilities of the allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:

This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. Let's analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.

Model:     The problem asks for a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's analyze each condition and compare it to the initial state and the capabilities of the allowed actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v1, v3, v4`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is a type definition satisfied by objects like `v5, v7, v8`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **FALSE** in the initial state.
           
           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:

This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is met. The effects `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)` effectively mean that the state of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`. It maintains `atconf(v14, v15)` but does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no available actions that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential components of the goal, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.

           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.

This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` demands the following:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.

           The critical unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.

           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.

Model:     The problem describes a set of objects, an initial state, and a goal `new-axiom@0()`. Let's analyze the goal's components and the initial state.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a conjunction of these predicates:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: True in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.

           - `free(v12, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: True in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v1, v3, v4` being of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Indirectly satisfied by `v5, v7, v8` being of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is FALSE in the initial state.
           
           The critical conditions that are not met in the initial state are the `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and the `receivedanalysis` predicates for rock types `v2` and `v6`. These must become true for the goal to be achieved.
           
           Now, let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means there is no net change to the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)`. Crucially, this action does not modify any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14`, and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, meaning the store `v16` on `v12` is *not* full. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action cannot be executed.
           
           Since there are no available actions that can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these are essential components of the goal, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unachievable given the constraints. The valid actions provided do not include any means to generate the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, which are indispensable for satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `The goal is unachievable given the constraints. The valid actions provided do not include any means to generate the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, which are indispensable for satisfying the `new-axiom@0()`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list:

           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem defines a goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of multiple conditions. Let's analyze each condition in relation to the initial state and the provided valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires the following predicates to be true:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: This is **true** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v1, v3, v4` exist and are of type `v2`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: This is implicitly satisfied as rocks like `v5, v7, v8` exist and are of type `v6`.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This is **false** in the initial state.
           
           The unmet conditions are `receivedimage` for objectives `v17, v18, v19` and `receivedanalysis` for rock types `v2` and `v6`. To achieve these, actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` would typically be needed.
           
           Now let's examine the *only* valid action instances provided:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This action has `atconf(v12, v13)` as a precondition, which is true. The effects are `atconf(v12, v13)` and `NegatedAtom atconf(v12, v13)`. This means the truth value of `atconf(v12, v13)` remains unchanged. Critically, this action does not affect any `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This action is analogous for rover `v14` and also does not affect `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: This action requires the precondition `full(v12, v16)`. In the initial state, `free(v12, v16)` is true, implying `full(v12, v16)` is false. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Similarly, this action requires `full(v14, v16)`, which is false in the initial state. Therefore, this action **cannot be executed**.
           
           Since none of the valid actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates, and these predicates are essential components of the goal `new-axiom@0()`, the goal is unachievable from the initial state with the given limited set of actions.
           
           --Plan--:
           The goal is unachievable given the constraints. The valid actions provided do not include any mechanism for generating the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` facts, which are indispensable for satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` goal.
