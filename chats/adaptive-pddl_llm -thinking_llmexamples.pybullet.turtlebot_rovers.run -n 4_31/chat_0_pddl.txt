           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal: A Rovers Domain Puzzle**
           
           I'm faced with a classic planning problem, but with a twist: I'm given a specific list of action instances and can't deviate from them. The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a complex goal involving image acquisition and material analysis in a rovers domain. 
           
           Breaking down the goal, I see I need to ensure: (1) rovers are at specific configurations, (2) rovers have access to the store, and (3) several images are received and analyses of two types of material (stone and soil) are received. Upon inspection of the initial state, I quickly determine that the initial conditions related to rover configurations and store access are already satisfied. However, achieving image and analysis receipt requires more than just being in the right place. To get images, I need the rovers to take images and have them sent. For the analyses, I need to sample, analyze, and send the result of rock and soil samples.
           
           My problem arises because of what I *can't* do: my only permitted actions are two essentially redundant "move" actions that keep the rovers in the same configuration. I have two specific action instances to use: `move v12 from v13 to v13` and `move v14 from v15 to v15`. These actions aren't helpful because they cannot change the predicates that need to be true to reach the goal.
           
           Essentially, I need to do these actions: `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`. However, no instances of these actions are permitted.
           
           The limited movement actions provided do not enable the necessary activities of imaging, sample collection, and data transmission. With these constraints, the goal is simply unattainable from the initial state. I cannot provide a plan, as the system does not let me use any means to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
