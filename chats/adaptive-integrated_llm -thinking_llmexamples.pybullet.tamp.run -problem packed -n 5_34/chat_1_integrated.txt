           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.25, -0.248), (-0.159, -0.157)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.081, 0.394), (0.009, 0.484)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.143, 0.169), (0.242, 0.268)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.059, 0.265), (0.032, 0.356)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.204, -0.203, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, -0.192).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.094, 0.386), (0.19, 0.482)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.439, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.576, 0.817).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.192, 0.218, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.34, 0.94).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.013, 0.31, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, -0.186).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.142, 0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.867, -0.498).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unsolvable Task**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to move a set of objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a surface (v20) from their current locations on surface v11.  The core of the problem is about satisfying the `on` predicates, which require an object to be `supported` *and* *at* a specific pose.  I need to get all the objects to pose #o2 on the target surface v20. However, the problem statement provides a crucial detail:  I must use the provided *action instances*. And here's the kicker: the only allowed action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.
           
           This is where the plan falls apart. The *only* way to move these objects according to the PDDL domain definition is via `pick` and `place` actions, which manipulate the `atpose` predicate.  Unfortunately, `pick` and `place` are not provided as *allowed actions*. Consequently, I cannot alter the objects' poses to satisfy the goal predicate `on(object, v20)`. The existing `kin` predicates provide clues to pick and place actions, but they are useless if these actions are not permitted. Therefore, even though the setup looks like a standard TAMP problem, it's deliberately impossible to solve with the restricted actions provided. My conclusion: the goal is unreachable.
