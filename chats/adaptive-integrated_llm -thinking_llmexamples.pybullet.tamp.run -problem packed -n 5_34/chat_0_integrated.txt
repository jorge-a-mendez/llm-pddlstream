User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.25, -0.248), (-0.159, -0.157)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.081, 0.394), (0.009, 0.484)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.143, 0.169), (0.242, 0.268)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.059, 0.265), (0.032, 0.356)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.204, -0.203, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, -0.192).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.094, 0.386), (0.19, 0.482)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.036, 0.439, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.576, 0.817).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.192, 0.218, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.34, 0.94).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.013, 0.31, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, -0.186).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.142, 0.434, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.867, -0.498).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Constraint-Induced Impasse**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I'm given the task of moving five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto a new surface, v20.  They're all currently resting on v11.  The desired outcome is `on(obj, v20)` for each of them.  Standard planning, right?  Pick 'em up, put 'em down.
           
           Initially, I looked at the familiar actions available in the domain: `pick`, `place`, `move_base`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Clean and cook are clearly irrelevant here.  The main game plan would involve `pick` and `place` to get the objects from v11 to v20.  All the ingredients are there: graspable objects, target poses, and grasping configurations.
           
           However, the real kicker is the explicit constraint on which *action instances* I'm allowed to use.  I'm given *only* one instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means the robot can only move *from* its current base configuration *to* its current base configuration, essentially doing nothing! It's a no-op.
           
           This is a critical show-stopper.  The problem definition states that I'm only allowed to use the explicitly listed action instances. I can't conjure up any `pick` or `place` instances on my own. Because I cannot pick up any objects or place them, I cannot achieve the goal. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
