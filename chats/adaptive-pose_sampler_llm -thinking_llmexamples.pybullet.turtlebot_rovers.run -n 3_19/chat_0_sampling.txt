User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, here's what I'm dealing with. I need to find three base positions for a robot, described by their (x, y) coordinates, with these constraints: they must be within a distance of 2 from the target point, and the robot's orientation (theta) will automatically face the target, but most importantly, there must be a clear line of sight to the target, and finally the positions must avoid all collisions and all coordinates must be with [-2.5, 2.5]. Easy enough, or so I thought.
           
           First, the target point is `(-1.8, -1.8)`. I need diverse positions around this point, remembering the max distance is 2. The most effective way to cover a large area is to pick points around the perimeter, perhaps top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right and perhaps one directly centered on one of the axis.
           
           I've been given a list of fixed obstacles as well. I'll need to work through this list carefully. The environment limits my search area to a circle of radius 2 around the target, cropped by the box [-2.5, 2.5] in both x and y. So, the effective search area is also a circle of radius 2 centered at the target, bound by the world boundaries.
           
           *Obstacle Assessment and Line-of-Sight Complications*
           
           After calculating the area, I started mapping the position of all obstacles. I realized the target point `(-1.8, -1.8)` is actually *inside* a fixed obstacle (obstacle 6). This is a *major* problem! If the target point is inside an obstacle, how can there be a clear line of sight? It's impossible to see a point that's *within* an obstacle, and this is where it became extremely difficult.
           
           The prompt states that "You never give up." This means I have to provide the three positions even if there are geometric conflicts. I had to interpret the problem, assuming I'm meant to provide a "best effort" answer. Perhaps this implies that I'm supposed to find positions that *would* be valid if the target was *not* inside the obstacle.
           
           I assumed that I was meant to give a valid answer. Given that the line of sight is blocked. Thus, I worked towards the next best solution. I found that I will generate positions that are valid and that fulfill all the requirements, EXCEPT the line of sight (due to the obstacle) requirement.
           
           **Proposed Positions and Reasoning**
           
           I decided to choose three diverse positions that are as good as possible, considering the obstacle issue.
           Here are the final positions I have:
           
           1.  `(-2.5, -2.5)`: The bottom-left corner of the feasible area.
           2.  `(-1.8, 0.2)`: The top position directly above the target (x-aligned).
           3.  `(0.2, -1.8)`: The right position directly to the right of the target (y-aligned).
           
           I have confirmed these positions:
           
           *   Are within a distance of 2 from the target.
           *   Are within the environment limits (x and y between -2.5 and 2.5).
           *   Don't collide with the fixed obstacles themselves.
           
           However, I understand that the line of sight from these points to the target *will* be blocked because the target point is, sadly, inside a fixed obstacle. This is unavoidable given the current setup and the standard meaning of "line of sight". I am giving my best effort to provide valid positions given the constraints, understanding that these positions will not, strictly speaking, satisfy the line-of-sight requirement.

(Thoughts: **Reflecting on the Feedback and a New Challenge**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that is somewhat tricky to interpret, but I'm getting a better handle on the situation. The previous feedback related to a different target point, which, interestingly, was also inside an obstacle. Now, I'm facing a similar scenario: a new target, `T = (2.06, 1.86)`, is nestled within obstacles. This seems like a pattern.
           
           Initially, I hypothesized that `(-1.8, -1.8)` was a collision point, but the feedback, applied to the new target, revealed some more information. One point `(-2.5, -2.5)`, did collide with walls. Another point, `(0.2, -1.8)`, collided with the central vertical wall and had 'no line of sight', which might be a more general issue for points inside walls, and it's something I need to keep in mind for future instances.
           
           The crucial detail from the feedback is that positions are evaluated for a *different* target. This implies some form of asynchronous processing or batching of requests. It means I have to be careful not to learn the wrong lessons from the feedback. My key takeaway from the feedback is to avoid two known "never valid" positions.
           
           Now, I'm focusing on the new target, `T`. Since the target is inside a fixed obstacle, direct line of sight will be limited, but I still need to find positions that are within the allowed distance (2) and environment limits `[-2.5, 2.5]`. I have to navigate these known obstacles, and it's critical to determine the robot's dimensions. My first thought was a safe space for each target.
           
           Based on the environment's `[-2.5, 2.5]` boundary and obstacle dimensions, I calculated the valid search area. My starting search range was `x in [0.06, 2.5]` and `y in [-0.14, 2.5]`. But, the feedback clarified something important: there's probably a radius to the robot's base. If I assume `R = 0.15` as the robot's dimensions based on `(0.2, -1.8)`, then the central vertical wall expanded collision space to `[-0.2, 0.2]`. If a point collides with the wall (5), I must avoid these areas. This changed my range: The effective allowed region of the robot center must be within `[-2.5+R, 2.5-R]` - `x in [-2.35, 2.35]` and  `y in [-2.35, 2.35]`.
           
           With these considerations, I was able to refine the search space and choose the three final positions that are distance 2 from the target and within environment boundaries. While line-of-sight is likely blocked to a target inside obstacles, I've still found possible positions that are safe for the base and within range.
