           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan to satisfy the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires satisfying several conditions, including receiving images of specific objectives (v17, v18, v19) and receiving analyses of rocks (v3, v5, and others of the same type). The initial state already satisfies some conditions, namely the rovers' initial configurations. My primary concern focuses on the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions, which are currently unfulfilled.
           
           My investigation delves into the actions available for achieving these goals: specifically, `send_image` for images and `send_analysis` for analyses. To make these actions valid I need to satisfy preconditions for each step by invoking other actions, such as `take_image`, `calibrate` and `sample_rock`.
           
           The plan hinges on analyzing the rovers, their locations, available configurations (#o0, #o3, #o5), and the objects' locations relative to the rovers. I can identify that there are two rovers, v12 and v14, at known locations (v13 and v15). I intend to use v12 for objectives closer to it (v19) and v14 for objectives at a relatively close distance (v17 and v18). The initial plan entails utilizing the `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, and `sample_rock` actions to complete the goal. However, upon reviewing the actions, I realize that these actions are not explicitly in the valid action list. I need to be sure.
           
           A closer look at the allowed action list reveals a significant constraint: It *only* includes no-op `move` actions and `drop_rock`. Crucially, it *excludes* the necessary actions like `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. Given this restriction, I've concluded that it is impossible to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` requirements of the `new-axiom@0()` goal with only the allowed actions. Consequently, no feasible plan can be generated.
