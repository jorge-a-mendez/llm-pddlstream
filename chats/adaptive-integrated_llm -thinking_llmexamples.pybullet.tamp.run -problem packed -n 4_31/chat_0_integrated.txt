User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.403, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.255, 0.967).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.184, 0.538, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, -0.195).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.198, -0.537, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.178, 0.984).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.047, 0.38), (0.144, 0.478)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.217, -0.45), (-0.122, -0.355)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.153, -0.583), (0.243, -0.492)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.138, 0.492), (0.23, 0.584)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.095, 0.429, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.449, 0.893).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Assessment**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve the goal state where v8, v12, v14, and v16 are all on v18.  The key to getting there is the definition of the `on` predicate:  `on(?o, ?r)` requires the object `?o` to be supported at a pose `?p` on the supporting object `?r`.  Currently, all those objects are on v11.
           
           To move an object, I need to use a `pick` and `place` sequence.  Looking at the initial state, I can see that each object has a pose where it *could* be supported on v18.  Therefore, ideally, the plan would involve picking up each object from its current location on v11 and placing it on v18.
           
           Here's the problem: The provided list of available actions only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the base, and it has the side-effect of invalidating `canmove()`, which is a precondition for both `pick` and `place` actions.  Critically, *no* instances of `pick` or `place` are available.
           
           The constraint is explicit: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This means that even if the preconditions for `pick` and `place` could be met, I'm *not allowed* to use them.
           
           Consequently, since the only available action is the `move_base` action, and it invalidates `canmove()`, I am effectively blocked. I cannot manipulate the objects' `atpose` states. The goal is unreachable given the restricted action set.
