User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.403, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.255, 0.967).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.184, 0.538, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, -0.195).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.198, -0.537, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.178, 0.984).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.047, 0.38), (0.144, 0.478)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.217, -0.45), (-0.122, -0.355)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.153, -0.583), (0.243, -0.492)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.138, 0.492), (0.23, 0.584)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.095, 0.429, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.449, 0.893).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Impossibility of Reaching the Goal**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process:
           
           My objective is clear: get all four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. I've analyzed the initial state and confirmed they're all currently resting on surface v11.  The initial state provides the necessary starting facts for the robot's configuration, and the poses of the objects.
           
           The task boils down to a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions.  I need to pick each object from v11 and place it onto v18.  That's straightforward in principle.  The goal condition specifies these `on()` predicates which confirm the final position of the objects.
           
           I've examined the available actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Given the current task, only `pick` and `place` seem relevant, alongside `move_base`.  I noted the preconditions for each.  Crucially, both `pick` and `place` require `kin` predicates to work, `atbconf(?q)` to apply, and no 'unsafe' conditions.
           
           Now, here's where the problem arises.  I've delved into the `kin` facts and quickly realized a critical constraint: the robot's base configuration (`atbconf`) must be `#o3` for all pick and place actions, as defined in the `kin` predicates I'm provided.  However, the only available `move_base` action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, *doesn't change* the robot's base configuration.  It keeps it at `v3`.
           
           In short, there is no way to transition the base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`, as required by the `pick` and `place` actions, using only the given `move_base` action.  Since the base configuration is a precondition to *every* pick and place action, I can conclude the task can't be completed.  This indicates there is no achievable plan given the constraints of the available actions.
