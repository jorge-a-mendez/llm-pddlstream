(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with placing object ID 5, with its specific dimensions, stably on surface 0, and I need 50 distinct placements.  My initial approach is to figure out the safe area within surface 0 where the object can be completely contained, regardless of its rotation. I know the surface is a 2D rectangle, and the object is almost a perfect square.
           
           First, I define the dimensions of the object, `obj_w` and `obj_h`, and the boundaries of surface 0, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`. To ensure stability, I need the object's entire bounding box to fit within the surface. The tricky part is the rotation, and how it changes the bounding box.  I calculate `eff_w` and `eff_h`, the effective dimensions of the object's bounding box after a rotation of `theta`. I realize since the object is nearly square, rotations won't drastically change its bounding box. I need to figure out the range of `x` and `y` center coordinates.
           
           Based on the surface's dimensions, I establish that for any placement to be stable,  the object's center must be within a safe region, considering the maximum possible effective width and height (`eff_w`, `eff_h`) across all possible rotations.
           
           I then calculate the safe area and identify that I can use the same rectangle, centered at zero, for my safe area.  I choose to create a 5x10 grid of placements, which will be enough to generate 50 positions. I determine the x and y coordinates by using `linspace` from a minimum x to the maximum x, from safe minimum y, to safe max y.
           
           To diversify the placements, I'll rotate the object at various angles. Since the object is nearly square, I'll choose to use a rotation of 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2 to ensure a good diversity of orientations, cycling these rotations as I fill the grid.  I then iterate over the grid and angles, generating 50 unique placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 4**
           
           Alright, I've got a successful placement for Object 5, but now I need to place Object 4 on the same surface. Object 4 is pretty close to a square, with dimensions (0.09678, 0.09678), and I've got to find 50 stable placements without any collisions with Object 5.
           
           First, I need to figure out the effective dimensions of Object 4 for any rotation. The maximum extent will be along the diagonal of Object 4. Now, I'll calculate the half diagonal length, or "effective half dimension" for any possible rotation and find a suitable "safe zone". Then, I need to make sure the center points are far enough from Object 5 to avoid overlap, and make a grid. 
           
           I've set up a plan to generate the placement candidates. The core of this strategy involves these key components:
           1. **Define the Safe Region**: Establish the maximum area in which object centers can be placed, and the minimum area.
           2. **Handle Rotations**: To do so, I have to consider the bounding box of object 4 for any angle.
           3. **Collision Detection**: I have to use a safe bounding box around the object to avoid any intersection with object 5.
           4. **Grid-Based Placements**: Generate a dense grid of points on the safe area, consider some angle for rotation and then check stability and collision.
           
           I started by establishing the safe region for the centers of Object 4, accounting for the object's dimensions and potential rotations. Object 5 is located in the lower left, which means I'll want the objects to be towards the upper-right area, to keep the objects far away. Then, I calculate the Bounding Box using w_rot = (abs(s4_w * cos(theta)) + abs(s4_h * sin(theta)) and check collision for each placement. I'll filter out the placements that overlap with Object 5, which gives me 50 solutions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Placement Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable positions for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with two existing objects, Object 5 and Object 4. I'm leveraging my knowledge of AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and rotational transformations to achieve this.
           
           First, I define the collision zones. I've calculated the AABBs for the existing objects. For Object 5, centered near (-0.0747, -0.0747) with dimensions 0.0854 x 0.0854, the AABB is approximately ((-0.1173, -0.1173), (-0.0320, -0.0320)). Object 4, at (pi/4) rotation centered near (0.0684, 0.0270), has dimensions of 0.0968 x 0.0968. I've calculated its rotated AABB, which is ((0.0000, -0.0414), (0.1369, 0.0954)). Due to a slight boundary inconsistency, I'm using the true bounding box, ((0.0000, -0.0414), (0.135, 0.0954)) for collision detection to stay completely within the surface boundary.
           
           My strategy involves first identifying a "safe" region on Surface 0, which is a square with an edge length of 0.27, where I can *guarantee* stability. This guarantees any new object can always fit inside. For my square Object 7 (0.0984 x 0.0984), the maximum effective half-width (or height) occurs at a rotation of pi/4, which will be the case when it's rotated. So, I calculated the furthest point of the rotated object for all possible angles (0.0, 30.0, 45.0, 60.0, 90.0 degrees). Thus, I determined the available, safe, or collision-free space. Based on that, I can guarantee *stability*, by placing an object *inside* the safe zone. The safe zone center coordinates range from (-0.0654, -0.0654) to (0.0654, 0.0654) on the surface, regardless of the rotation.
           
           Next, I created a grid of potential center positions within this safe region. I generate a systematic test for a given rotation (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2). For each point on the grid and a set of rotations, I create an AABB using the new object's half-width and half-height for that rotation. My logic is systematic. After the AABB is calculated, I systematically check for overlap with Object 5's and Object 4's AABBs. I filter out each invalid placement. This combination of calculations systematically generates and tests a set of candidate points. The final check guarantees complete non-overlap, in addition to stability, and finds many more than 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object 6 (ID 6) on surface 0, avoiding objects with IDs 4, 5, and 7.  The key is to use the existing AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) information for those objects to guide the search.
           
           First, I've calculated the AABBs for Object 5, Object 4 (rotated), and Object 7.  The surface 0 has the bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  I know Object 6 is nearly a square with dimensions of `w=0.091459`, and I've determined that due to its size and potential rotations, I need to define a *safe* placement region within the surface bounds. I calculate the required rotated width and height of the bounding box and use them to constrain the possible centers. This leads to a bounding box for the object, based on the rotation which I will test at several points.
           
           I then plan to generate a grid of potential center points for Object 6 within a safe region that doesn't include the placement locations of any of the bounding boxes of the other three objects.  To ensure good coverage, I will generate a 10x10 grid. With the known dimensions and surface constraints, I have the necessary information to move forward.
           
           For each grid point, I'll test it with 5 rotation angles: 0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, and pi/2.
           
           A crucial part is having a reliable collision detection function to efficiently check if the AABB for a potential Object 6 placement overlaps with the AABBs of any of the existing objects.  I've got the mathematical logic down for this too.  Based on my experiments above, I am confident that my collision checking is correct.
           
           After these candidate placements are generated, I check for collisions between the AABBs and existing objects. If there are no collisions, then I select it as a safe spot.  
           
           By doing that, I'll get the 50 best locations.
