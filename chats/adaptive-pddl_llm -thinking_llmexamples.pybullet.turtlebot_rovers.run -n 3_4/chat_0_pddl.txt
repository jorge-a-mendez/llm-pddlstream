           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive axiom that hinges on receiving images and analyses. The initial state gives me a head start, satisfying the first four conditions, but the remaining require a plan of action.
           
           My immediate challenge lies in satisfying the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To achieve `receivedimage`, I must take and transmit images of three specific objectives using a supported camera mode. And to satisfy `receivedanalysis`, I need to sample and analyze a rock of type `v2` and another of type `v6`.
           
           The image collection part looks straightforward: I have two rovers (`v12`, `v14`) equipped with cameras, and the initial state offers the necessary visibility and communication channels.  I can calibrate the camera, take the images, and send them to the lander. No issues there.
           
           Now, the analysis part is where the problem arises. To acquire `receivedanalysis`, I need rovers to sample rocks (`sample_rock`) and then send the analysis (`send_analysis`). The `sample_rock` action requires the rover to be above the rock and have free storage, both of which are present in the initial state. Crucially, the rover needs to be *at* the configuration where the rock is above it. This translates to the `atconf(V, #o5)` condition. However, the rovers are initially at different configurations (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`) and, critically, there are no actions to move them to the required configuration `#o5`. The only available `move` actions simply keep the rovers in their initial configurations, a useless loop.
           
           This is a dead end. Since the rovers cannot reach the necessary configurations to sample rocks, the analysis step is impossible. Without analyzing rocks, the axiom cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable given the constraints of this initial state and the defined actions. A change in the initial state or introduction of more actions to move the rovers would be required to achieve this goal.
