           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q0', '#t2'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q0', '#q1', '#t4'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', '#p0', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-traj-pose:('#t0', 'v15', 'v16')->()`, which impeded executing the action pick('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0').
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End in the PR2-TAMP Domain**
           
           Alright, the task is clear: I need to devise a plan to satisfy `new-axiom@0()` within the `pr2-tamp` domain. This axiom, as defined, hinges on achieving both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. My initial assessment indicates the presence of objects `v8` and `v12` already possessing the necessary `type(v17)`. The obvious strategy would involve relocating one of these objects to the receptacle `v18`.
           
           The initial state reveals a robot capable of movement (`canmove()`), positioned at a base configuration (`atbconf(v3)`), and with an empty hand (`handempty(v4)`). Moreover, we have three graspable and stackable objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`), each supported by specific poses. Notably, these supported relationships directly translate to `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v14)`, and `on(v15, v11)`. My task boils down to transferring one of `v8` or `v12` to `v18`, which is supported by two objects.
           
           To achieve `on(object, v18)`, I must employ the `place` action. This action necessitates finding a suitable pose where `supported(object, pose, v18)` holds true. It then becomes a matter of picking the object from its current location, and placing it on `v18`. I see that the goal can be achieved by placing either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` at pose `#o2`. I need to execute `pick` followed by `place` actions, and the precondition is to move to base configuration `#o3` so I can apply a `move_base` action.
           
           Now, let's dissect the feasibility of this plan. I need to verify that each action's preconditions are met. The `kin` and `atpose` prerequisites are satisfied. However, I encounter a roadblock with the `pick` action. The initial failure seemed related to `unsafeatraj`, and more specifically a collision of `v15` with `v16`. However, I see it is not the only problem. The precondition that's proving insurmountable is `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)`.
           
           This `new-axiom@0(?o)` essentially restricts the robot to picking only if the target object is *the only* graspable object in the scene. A deeper dive into the axiom's structure confirms my suspicions. Specifically, `new-axiom@0(?o)` is true if there exists *any* other graspable object aside from `?o`. The initial state, unfortunately, contains three graspable objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v15`). This means `new-axiom@0(v8)`, `new-axiom@0(v12)` and `new-axiom@0(v15)` are true. Consequently, the `NegatedAtom new-axiom@0(?o)` precondition for *any* `pick` action is false.
           
           This constraint is absolute. It means that without some form of modification to the initial state, *no* object can be picked up. To place an object at pose `#o2`, it has to be picked from its current pose. This constraint makes the goal impossible to achieve. Since no object can be picked, no object of `type v17` can be placed onto `v18`. It's a dead end. I am going to have to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable. It is a fundamental property of this problem definition, and I cannot formulate a valid plan.
