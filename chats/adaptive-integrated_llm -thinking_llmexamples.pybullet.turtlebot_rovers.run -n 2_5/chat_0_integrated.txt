           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Comprehensive Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal here is `new-axiom@0()`, but that's just a complex conjunction of eight individual conditions. Essentially, we need to get images of two objectives, ensure the camera is calibrated, and perform analysis on a stone and soil sample. The initial state gives us a leg up with the first four conditions already satisfied, leaving us with a four-part task: get two images, get analyses on both a rock and soil.
           
           My assessment indicates that to accomplish this, it is crucial to leverage the available rovers and tools. We've got two rovers, v12 and v14. Each has a camera (v10) and is initially positioned at v13 and v15, respectively. Critically, the available actions are limited and are those which correspond to the pre-existing state. We can "move" a rover but only from their initial configuration to themselves. Because of this, the configurations, named symbolically as #o3, #o0, #o5, and others, must, I believe, refer to the location of the rovers initially. They are already able to view and communicate as defined in the initial state with the locations they are situated.
           
           To obtain the images of objectives `v17` and `v18`, I'll use rover v12 to get `v17` and v14 to photograph `v18`. Each rover will need to calibrate its camera and take an image, then communicate them. The initial conditions and the `move` actions suggest that this needs to be done from the existing starting positions.
           
           I'm interpreting the initial conditions with the available "move" actions to indicate that all `imagevisible` and `comvisible` interactions can be done while the rovers are stationed at the initial positions, i.e., v12 at v13 and v14 at v15.
           
           The actions I'll take include `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image`. The important aspect is that those actions rely on `atconf`, and because the available move actions are of the form `move v<n> v<n> #o2 v<n>`, that means I must equate #o0, #o3, and #o5 with the current configurations, since the rovers cannot otherwise move.
           
           For the stone and soil analyses, I'll need to use the `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions. In the environment, it appears that v4 is the stone sample while v8 is the soil sample. This step follows the exact same logic. By using `sample_rock` on v4 with v12 at v13 and v8 with v14 at v15.
           
           The final plan, broken into steps, will go as follows:
           
           1.  v12 should calibrate its camera to view and photograph v17.
           2.  v12 should take a photo of v17.
           3.  v12 should send the photo of v17.
           4.  v14 should calibrate its camera to view and photograph v18.
           5.  v14 should take a photo of v18.
           6.  v14 should send the photo of v18.
           7.  v12 should sample the rock v4.
           8.  v12 should send an analysis of v4.
           9.  v14 should sample the soil v8.
           10. v14 should send an analysis of v8.
           
           Furthermore, I have deduced the continuous configurations.
           
           The `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicates use `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5`, and their respective values are equivalent to v13 or v15 for the appropriate rover, thus I will note the following:
           
           -   `(#o3 v12 v17)` and `(#o3 v12 v18)` are identical: `(1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `(#o0 v12 v9)` is equivalent to: `(1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `(#o3 v14 v17)` and `(#o3 v14 v18)` are identical: `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `(#o0 v14 v9)` is equivalent to: `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `(#o5 v12 v4)` is equivalent to: `(1.0, -1.75)`
           -   `(#o5 v14 v8)` is equivalent to: `(-1.0,

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan: A Critical Oversight**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. I completely missed a crucial constraint: the allowable actions. My previous strategy relies on actions that aren't even *valid* according to the provided list. This is a significant setback.
           
           Let's break down the situation. The list of valid actions is incredibly restrictive: moves (`move`) that seem to do nothing useful and dropping rocks (`drop_rock`), but the `drop_rock` action has a precondition that isn't met in the initial state. The goal is to establish predicates that are related to receiving images and analysis results.
           
           The key to achieving the goal lies in satisfying those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. Those are the effects of actions that are *not* permitted - `send_image` and `send_analysis`, respectively.
           
           Now, analyzing the available actions:
           *   The `move` actions seem redundant. My initial state satisfies all the atconf conditions required by the goal.
           *   The `drop_rock` actions seem unusable, because the rovers' stores are initially free, and the `drop_rock` action needs the store to be full as a precondition, which is not true.
           
           Therefore, because none of the allowed actions can lead to the goal, and that the moves are redundant, the plan is entirely blocked. The current strategy is unworkable because it violates a critical constraint on the actions I can employ. I need to rethink this, considering the limited available actions.
