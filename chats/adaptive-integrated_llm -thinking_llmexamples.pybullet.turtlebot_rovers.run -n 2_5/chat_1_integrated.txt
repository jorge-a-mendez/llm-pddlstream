           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan to achieve the goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           I need to satisfy several conditions, primarily related to obtaining and analyzing images and soil samples. Let's break it down:
           
           *   **Image Acquisition:** I need to capture images of two objects, `v17` and `v18`. To do this, I'll need to move my rover (`v12`) to a configuration (`#o3`) where it has a clear line of sight to both objects. Specifically, I'll position myself at (0.67, 2.01). Then, I will calibrate my camera (`v10`) and take the images.
           *   **Image Transmission:** After taking the images, I will move to a communication-friendly configuration (`#o0`) at (0.0, -1.9). There, I will use my communication system to send the images to `v9` (lander).
           *   **Sample Acquisition:** Next, I'll need to acquire and analyze samples of a rock (`v4`) and soil (`v5`). I'll move to config #o5.
           *   **Analysis and Transmission:**  I'll then acquire samples of `v4` and `v5` (rock and soil). Then, I'll move back to `#o0`, and send the analysis to the lander.
           *   **Final Actions:** Finally, I'll drop the collected samples. Then, I'll return to my initial configuration at `v13`.
           
           **Here's the detailed plan:**

(Thoughts: **Refined Configuration Plan**
           
           Okay, the initial plan failed because of those darn obstacle collisions with `#o3` and `#o0`. Time to reassess and devise a new collision-free strategy. I've re-examined the object locations and calculated the AABBs of each to get a better handle on the environment.
           
           My goal is still to get images of `v17` and `v18`, analyze rocks, and get the data back to base. Rovers `v12` and `v14` are already in their starting positions, so I can continue with `v12` as the primary rover.
           
           First, I need to define a new `#o3` for image collection. The ideal point needs to be close enough to both targets (`v17` and `v18`) but outside of obstacle `v19`. I checked the distances to potential candidate points using the AABBs. A point at (1.0, 1.5) works. It is outside the obstacle and within 2 units of both `v17` and `v18`. This point is reachable with the current motion predicates.
           
           Next, I need a new `#o0` for communication. I'm aiming for a point that is close to the lander (`v9`) but outside of the obstacle `v20`. The point (0.1, -1.9) is outside `v20` and within 4 units of `v9`.  It's reachable as well.
           
           Fortunately, the `#o5` configuration, used for sampling rocks `v4` and `v5`, remains valid. It is not in collision with `v19` or `v20`.
           
           The overall plan structure will stay the same: I'll move to `#o3`, take images, communicate, move to `#o5` for sampling, send analyses, drop samples, and return to base. The existing `motion`, `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates should support this plan. The action preconditions should be satisfied with this updated plan. It looks robust.

(Thoughts: **My Current Thinking...**
           
           Okay, so the feedback is in, and it's clear: the previous plan went sideways. Reachability, collisions, and occlusion are the culprits. Let's break this down. My objective remains the same - achieve all those goals - but I need to adapt the configurations to the environment, particularly focusing on `v12`'s movements.
           
           First, those pesky configurations... `#o3`, the one meant for capturing images, needs a serious rethink.  The initial guess (1.0, 1.5) was a bust. Either it was too far or, worse, there was occlusion from `v19`... and likely bad trajectory to `v13`. I need something close enough to see both `v17` and `v18` but also reachable from its start. The previous error message for not-reachable points to a trajectory problem. The new `o3` should be reachable from `v13` (current position (1.0, -1.75)), collision-free, and visible to both `v17` and `v18`. After analyzing, I've concluded `(0.8, 2.0)` should work. It's out of the way of `v19`, within range of objectives, and the trajectory should be okay, assuming the existence of a valid `#o2` intermediate for the path.
           
           Next, the communication config, `#o0`. That poor thing was in a wall collision! This needs to be moved to the left to (-0.1, -1.9). This path should be okay if the robot can perform a straight vertical line.
           
           The rest of the positions should be fine. `#o5` which is used for sampling, is fine in the original state.
           
           Now, let me run through the plan.  With these new `#o3` and `#o0` configurations, and the existing plan, it appears it is now valid, with each step making sense, preconditions checking out, and the effects aligning with the goal conditions, meaning all objectives are fulfilled. It means I'm good to go!

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan: Obstacle Avoidance for Effective Mission Execution**
           
           Okay, so the previous configurations for `#o3` and `#o0` still hit those collision reports. Time for a deeper dive. Let's revisit the map and make sure our robot doesn't get stuck in a jam.
           
           **Obstacle Re-Evaluation:** `v19` is that horizontal bar (0.25 < x < 0.75, 1.75 < y < 2.25) and `v20` is the vertical one (-0.05 < x < 0.05, covering most of the y-axis).
           
           **Target Locations (Visualized):** `v17` at (-0.45, 1.91), `v18` at (1.79, 2.11) - we're aiming to see them with the rover. `v9` at (-1.9, -2.0) - where we want to communicate with mission control. `v4` at (1.63, -0.41) and `v5` at (2.18, 0.79) are the rock samples.
           
           **Rover Starting Point:** `v13` at (1.0, -1.75).
           
           **`#o3` - Image Capture for `v17` and `v18`:** The previous point (0.8, 2.0) was a problem. It was just outside the x-range of `v19`, but the robot's footprint apparently still collided. We need a collision-free spot within range of our visual targets and easily reachable. I think (1.0, 2.0) would work. It's safe from `v19` and `v20`, close enough to both targets, and a simple straight move from the rover's start. Let's try that: `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0)`.
           
           **`#o0` - Communication with `v9`:** The previous location (-0.1, -1.9) got flagged for collision, likely due to `v20`. We want a spot closer to the lander and collision-free. Let's try (-0.5, -1.9). This is well outside the problematic x-range of the vertical bar.
           
           **`#o5` - Rock Sampling:** The existing position (1.905, 0.19) seems fine. It avoids all obstacles and is reachable. So, we'll keep `#o5 = (1.905, 0.19)`.
           
           **Revised Configurations:**
           *   `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0)`
           *   `#o0 = (-0.5, -1.9)`
           *   `#o5 = (1.905, 0.19)`
           
           Reachability from the starting point to each location is still valid. All the relevant predicates (motion, visible, etc.) are available. The plan's sequence of actions (image, communicate, sample, analyze, return) remains sound. I'm satisfied that these new configurations will keep our robot safe and our mission on track.

(Thoughts: **Plan Re-Evaluation and Assumptions**
           
           Okay, so I'm revisiting the plan due to those "not reachable" errors for image capture (`#o3`) and communication (`#o0`). The key here is reachability: a valid path from the current position (`v13`) to the target configuration, avoiding all obstacles. The tricky part is obstacle `v20`, a wall seemingly blocking the path and line-of-sight to the camera targets `v17` and `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was to simply shift the original `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0)` to be on the other side of `v20`. But `v20` spans the height of `v17` and `v18`, so this leads to a contradiction. If `#o3` is on one side, it blocks the view of the other, which violates the requirement for a *single* `#o3` value for both `v17` and `v18`. The initial setup *requires* a single `#o3`.
           
           Based on the problem statement, I've got to find a way for `#o3` to see *both* targets. The only possible conclusion is that `v20`'s height is less than the camera height, or it is a gap, and it *doesn't* block the line-of-sight. Therefore, I'm assuming that obstacle `v20` does *not* block the image or communication paths, but is an obstacle for the rover base to traverse.
           
           For `#o3`, I've selected `(0.25, 1.5)`. This spot avoids both obstacles, and is within range of targets `v17` and `v18`.
           For `#o0`, my comms target, `(0.25, -1.5)` is in range of communication with `v9` while staying clear.
           
           I'm keeping sampling config `#o5` at `(1.905, 0.19)`, because it never was flagged as an issue.
           
           The plan:
           1.  Move to `#o3`: `(0.25, 1.5)`
           2.  Calibrate and take images from `#o3` of both targets.
           3.  Move to `#o0`: `(0.25, -1.5)`
           4.  Send the images.
           5.  Move to `#o5`: `(1.905, 0.19)`
           6.  Sample rocks.
           7.  Move back to `#o0` for sending.
           8.  Move back to `v13`.
           
           The assumptions are a bit of a stretch given the geometry but if there is no other way, then this plan should work.

(Thoughts: **Refined Strategy for Achieving the Goal State**
           
           I've re-evaluated the problem considering the new error messages and the critical constraint imposed by the wall (`v20`). My previous plan was flawed because it relied on `v12` crossing the wall, which is impossible due to its location relative to the objectives and the lander. The prompt highlights the need to respect the geometry of the scene, specifically the wall, and any previous attempts were "not reachable" due to this hard constraint.
           
           The key is to leverage both rovers effectively and assign specific tasks based on their spatial limitations. The initial facts, plus the *implications* of the given AABB for the rovers' starting configurations, leads me to this strategy:
           
           *   **Rover `v12` (Positive X Side):**
               *   Image objective `v18`.
               *   Sample rocks `v4` and `v5`.
               *   Send data.
           *   **Rover `v14` (Negative X Side):**
               *   Image objective `v17`.
               *   Send all data (via lander, including `v18` image and samples analysis) to `v9`.
           
           The communication aspect requires a closer examination. The initial problem statement suggested that data can be communicated by any robot to the lander. With this re-examination, and the hard constraint imposed by wall `v20`, the **`v12` must pass its data to `v14` for delivery**.
           
           **Revised Robot Tasks and Coordinates**
           
           Now I have a two-part plan:
           
           **Phase 1: Rover `v12` Actions**
           1.  Move `v12` to `#o3_v12_v18` at (1.0, 1.7) to see `v18`. This is reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and clears the known obstacles `v19` and new `v21`. The AABB of `v12` is ((0.817, 1.521), (1.183, 1.879)).
           2.  Calibrate camera to calibrate the camera and point it at target `v18`.
           3.  Capture image of `v18`.
           4.  Move `v12` to `#o5_v12_sample` at (1.905, 0.19) for sampling rocks. This AABB is ((1.722, 0.011), (2.088, 0.369)) for the robot, it clears `v19` and `v21` at this coordinate.
           5.  Sample rock `v4` and analyze, store analysis in memory. The store is the robot's data buffer.
           6.  Drop rock `v4`.
           7.  Sample rock `v5` and analyze, store analysis in memory. The store is the robot's data buffer.
           8.  Drop rock `v5`.
           9.  Move `v12` to `#o0_v12_v9` at (0.5, -1.75). The AABB of `v12` is ((0.317, -1.929), (0.683, -1.571)). This coordinate is collision-free (0.317 > 0.05).
           10. Send the image of `v18`, analysis for `v4`, and analysis for `v5` to `v14`, for communication with `v9`.
           11. Move `v12` back to its initial location at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           **Phase 2: Rover `v14` Actions**
           
           1.  Move `v14` to `#o3_v14_v17` at (-0.5, 1.5) for image.
           2.  Calibrate camera on robot.
           3.  Take image of `v17`.
           4.  Move `v14` to `#o0_v14_v9` at (-1.5, -1.75) for lander communication.
           5.  Receive image of `v18` and `v4`, `v5` analysis from `v12`.
           6.  Send images of `v17` and `v18`, analysis of `v4`, analysis of `v5` to `v9`
           
           This strategy explicitly respects the wall as an impassable barrier and leverages the rovers

           1.  Move `v14` to `#o3_v14_v17` at (-0.5, 1.5) for image.
           2.  Calibrate camera on robot.
           3.  Take image of `v17`.
           4.  Move `v14` to `#o0_v14_v9` at (-1.5, -1.75) for lander communication.
           5.  Receive image of `v18` and `v4`, `v5` analysis from `v12`.
           6.  Send images of `v17` and `v18`, analysis of `v4`, analysis of `v5` to `v9`
