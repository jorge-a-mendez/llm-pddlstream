           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this:**
           
           Okay, I've got a square object with dimensions that are pretty close to being a perfect square. My goal is to place this object stably 50 times on a larger square surface. The surface is centered at the origin, with its corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135). I need to figure out the right combination of placement angle (theta), and x and y coordinates for each of those 50 placements, ensuring they're all fully within the surface.
           
           Because the object's dimensions are almost equal, rotating it won't drastically change its "effective" size (the space it takes up in the x and y directions).  So, I can simplify things. I'll figure out the usable area on the surface for the object's center point. I know I have to account for any rotation; if I rotate it, the object needs more space because its bounding box will increase. Then, I'll generate the placement coordinates.
           
           I started by calculating how the object's dimensions change based on rotation, but I quickly realized that because the object is almost square, I can use the same constraints across all angles.  I'll focus on just a few rotations: 0 degrees and 90 degrees. This will simplify my calculations because the object's width will be very similar.
           
           I will create a grid of points on the surface. To make sure all the placements fit, I need to account for the object's maximum dimensions when rotated.  I determined that a safe region for the object's center is around 0.137, centered at (0, 0). I will use this area to create a 5x5 grid of center points.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll use 25 points from the grid, with a theta of 0, and then another 25 with a theta of pi/2. This will ensure I cover the surface well and cover different orientations of the object on the surface. I also confirmed that each of my generated placements will fit and are within the surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I've got the feedback on object 4, which is great. I know its location, and I need to make sure object 7 doesn't bump into it.  Object 7 is almost square, just like before, so I'll approach this similarly, looking at the AABB after rotation.
           
           The surface limits are pretty clear: `[-0.135, 0.135]` in both x and y.  Object 7's dimensions are roughly `0.077`, so its AABB, centered, gives me a valid range of about `[-0.08, 0.08]` for the center.
           
           Now, the collision avoidance is key. Object 4 is at `x=-0.06, y=-0.06`. Since I'm using an AABB approach, I need to figure out the "safe" zone around that.  The total size of the boxes, for both objects, would overlap if the centers are too close.  I need the boxes to be completely separated by ensuring the center to center distance is beyond a threshold.
           
           To make things organized, I'll use a grid of points, with `theta = 0` and `theta = pi/2`.  These angles are the most important for an almost-square object.
           
           I'm now going to calculate the exact AABB for object 4 (a rectangle) and object 7.  The problem I'm dealing with is that the placement points need to be outside the rectangle defined by object 4. I'll make sure each placement is not overlapping with object 4 by testing overlap with a rectangle to rectangle overlap function.
           
           So, I'm now testing a list of candidate points, checking if each coordinate collides with object 4, and if it doesn't, I will include it.
           
           To summarize, for each candidate object 7 placement, `(0, theta, xc, yc)`, I will:
           
           1.  Calculate the bounds of the AABB based on `xc`, `yc`, and `theta`.
           2.  Use a rectangle-rectangle collision check using the two AABBs.
           3.  Add the `(surf_idx, theta, xc, yc)` to the final list of placements if there is no collision.
           
           I will iterate through all the points to generate at least 50 non-colliding placement coordinates and rotate object 7 at 0 and pi/2 for each point.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure I don't bump into objects 4 and 7 that are already there. First things first, I've got to define the playing field: surface 0 is a rectangle from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 6 is a square with side lengths of approximately 0.0878.  I've calculated the half-extents (about 0.0439) to make it easier to work with.
           
           Now, to keep object 6 within the surface, its center has to be within a smaller rectangle, roughly from (-0.091, -0.091) to (0.091, 0.091).  Object 4 sits at (-0.06, -0.06) with extents of about 0.0938, so its bounding box (AABB) is pretty well known. Object 7 is located at (-0.09, 0.03) with a corresponding bounding box.
           
           My plan? I'm going to stick with rotations of 0 and pi/2 for object 6, since the square shape simplifies things. I'll create a grid of potential center points (xc, yc) within the surface bounds, a grid with steps of about 0.015. I'll test each point to see if it causes a collision with objects 4 or 7. I'll use simple AABB collision detection to check if the potential object 6 placement intersects the other AABBs.
           
           After going through that grid and collision detection, I have determined the valid points: a total of 76 valid points for `theta = 0`, and the same amount for `theta = pi/2`. Since I needed 50, I took the 50 points from `theta = 0`.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this:**
           
           The core problem is to find 50 stable placements for a near-square object (ID 5) on a single surface (surface 0). I need to avoid collisions with three existing obstacles (ID 4, 7, and 6) already on the surface. My first approach involved calculating AABBs and checking for overlaps, but it was getting a bit tedious and inefficient, especially after finding that there were no placements when using an x coordinate range in `[-0.08, 0.08]`.
           
           My first step was to calculate the object's half-extents, which is roughly 0.049254, using the size. Knowing the surface bounds [-0.135, 0.135], I determined the valid center coordinates for object 5 would be somewhere between [-0.08, 0.08]. My strategy was to use grid sampling in x and y coordinates and then check the AABBs for collisions with the three other objects. 
           
           However, since the objects seemed to be mainly on the left of the surface, checking for any collisions and calculating AABBs for all `9 * 9` grid locations got tedious. I decided to change my strategy and to consider the existing obstacles' location on the surface, and try to find a clear zone. The x-range of all obstacles is approximately `[-0.133, -0.013]`.
           
           Therefore, I determined that if I chose placements such that the object's x-coordinate was always greater than 0.036154, it would be free of any possible collision, as I had shown through AABB checks. That region is, roughly, the top-right and bottom-right.
           
           To find those 50 stable placements, I will just choose the locations given the x coordinate is greater than 0.04 and iterate along the y coordinates. As each position is valid and collision-free, I will be able to pick any of these as my stable placement and place the object with theta = 0.

My strategy was to use grid sampling in x and y coordinates and then check the AABBs for collisions with the three other objects. 
           
           However, since the objects seemed to be mainly on the left of the surface, checking for any collisions and calculating AABBs for all `9 * 9` grid locations got tedious. I decided to change my strategy and to consider the existing obstacles' location on the surface, and try to find a clear zone. The x-range of all obstacles is approximately `[-0.133, -0.013]`.
           
           Therefore, I determined that if I chose placements such that the object's x-coordinate was always greater than 0.036154, it would be free of any possible collision, as I had shown through AABB checks. That region is, roughly, the top-right and bottom-right.
           
           To find those 50 stable placements, I will just choose the locations given the x coordinate is greater than 0.04 and iterate along the y coordinates. As each position is valid and collision-free, I will be able to pick any of these as my stable placement and place the object with theta = 0.
