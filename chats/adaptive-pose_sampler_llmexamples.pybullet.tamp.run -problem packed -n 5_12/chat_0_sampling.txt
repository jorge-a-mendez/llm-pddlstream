           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.098x0.098. I will attempt to place the object on the surface, varying its position and orientation to explore different stable placements. Since the object is square, rotations by multiples of pi/2 will result in the same bounding box, but I will still explore other rotations for diversity. I will try to center the object on the surface, and also place it closer to the edges, ensuring it remains fully within the surface bounds.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID 5) is also square, with dimensions approximately 0.092x0.092. I need to find placements for this new object, ensuring it does not collide with the previously placed object (ID 4), which is centered at (0, 0) with 0 rotation and has dimensions 0.098x0.098.
           
           Since object 4 is centered at (0,0) and occupies a square region from approximately (-0.049, -0.049) to (0.049, 0.049), I should aim to place object 5 outside of this region. I will try placing object 5 near the edges of the surface, avoiding the central area. The combined size of the objects is roughly 0.098 + 0.092 = 0.19, which means placing them side-by-side along an axis will exceed the surface's extent of 0.27 if they are too close to the center. However, I can still place them on opposite sides of the central object.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin. I have two previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (0.098x0.098) at (0, 0) with 0 rotation. This occupies approximately (-0.049, -0.049) to (0.049, 0.049).
           - Object 5 (0.092x0.092) at (0.08, 0) with 0 rotation. This occupies approximately (0.08 - 0.046, 0 - 0.046) to (0.08 + 0.046, 0 + 0.046), which is (0.034, -0.046) to (0.126, 0.046).
           
           The new object (ID 8) is also square, approximately 0.076x0.076. I need to find a stable placement for Object 8 that avoids collisions with Object 4 and Object 5, and remains within the surface bounds.
           
           Given Object 4 is in the center and Object 5 is to its right, I should consider placing Object 8 to the left, top, or bottom of Object 4, or further to the right of Object 5 (if space permits), or in a corner. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Object 4: [-0.049, 0.049] in X and Y
           Object 5: [0.034, 0.126] in X, [-0.046, 0.046] in Y
           
           To avoid collision, Object 8's bounding box (approx. 0.038 extent from center) needs to be clear of these.
           I will try placing it to the left of object 4, or perhaps shifted along the y-axis, or in a corner.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has one square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           I have three previously placed objects:
           - Object 4 (0.098x0.098) at (0, 0) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [-0.049, 0.049], Y: [-0.049, 0.049].
           - Object 5 (0.092x0.092) at (0.08, 0) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [0.034, 0.126], Y: [-0.046, 0.046].
           - Object 8 (0.076x0.076) at (-0.08, 0) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [-0.118, -0.042], Y: [-0.038, 0.038].
           
           The new object (ID 7) is also square, approximately 0.095x0.095. I need to find a stable placement for Object 7 that avoids collisions with the existing objects and stays within the surface bounds.
           
           Currently, the x-axis is quite crowded with objects 8, 4, and 5.
           Combined X occupancy: Object 8 [-0.118, -0.042], Object 4 [-0.049, 0.049], Object 5 [0.034, 0.126].
           The gaps are: from -0.135 to -0.118 (left of 8), from 0.049 to 0.034 (overlap between 4 and 5), from 0.126 to 0.135 (right of 5).
           The overlap between 4 and 5, and 4 and 8, is due to their bounding boxes being close, not necessarily a collision. The reported successes indicate these placements are valid.
           
           Given the x-axis is largely occupied, I will focus on placing Object 7 above or below the existing line of objects, or in the corners.
           The combined Y occupancy for objects 4, 5, and 8 is roughly [-0.049, 0.049].
           The new object's half-extent is approx 0.095 / 2 = 0.0475.
           If placed at (0, Y), its Y extent would be [Y-0.0475, Y+0.0475].
           To avoid collision with Object 4, Y needs to be outside [-0.049, 0.049].
           So, I could try placing it at Y = 0.049 + 0.0475 + epsilon, or Y = -0.049 - 0.0475 - epsilon.
           Let's try Y = 0.1.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           I have four previously placed objects and their successful placements:
           - Object 4 (0.098x0.098) at (0, 0) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [-0.049, 0.049], Y: [-0.049, 0.049].
           - Object 5 (0.092x0.092) at (0.08, 0) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [0.034, 0.126], Y: [-0.046, 0.046].
           - Object 8 (0.076x0.076) at (-0.08, 0) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [-0.118, -0.042], Y: [-0.038, 0.038].
           - Object 7 (0.095x0.095) at (0, 0.05) with 0 rotation. Extent: approx. X: [-0.0475, 0.0475], Y: [0.0025, 0.0975].
           
           Failures for Object 7 indicate that positions with |Y| = 0.1 or |X| = 0.1 (or more) often result in instability due to the object extending past the surface bounds, especially when rotated. This means the overall space for new objects is quite constrained. The surface extends from -0.135 to 0.135. Half the object extent is 0.095 / 2 = 0.0475. For a non-rotated object, if its center is at (x,y), its maximum x or y value (or minimum) must be within the surface limits. So for the y-coordinate, `y + 0.0475 <= 0.135` means `y <= 0.0875`. Similarly, `y - 0.0475 >= -0.135` means `y >= -0.0875`. So the valid range for the center Y coordinate (for 0 rotation) is approximately [-0.0875, 0.0875]. For a 45-degree rotation, the effective radius is larger, approx `sqrt((0.0475)^2 + (0.0475)^2) = 0.067`. So `y + 0.067 <= 0.135` means `y <= 0.068`.
           
           The new object (ID 6) is square, approximately 0.079x0.079. Half-extent is 0.079 / 2 = 0.0395.
           Its maximum center Y coordinate (0 rotation) would be 0.135 - 0.0395 = 0.0955.
           Its maximum center Y coordinate (45-deg rotation) would be 0.135 - sqrt(2 * (0.0395)^2) = 0.135 - 0.0558 = 0.0792.
           
           Current occupied regions:
           - Object 4 (center): X: [-0.049, 0.049], Y: [-0.049, 0.049]
           - Object 5 (right): X: [0.034, 0.126], Y: [-0.046, 0.046]
           - Object 8 (left): X: [-0.118, -0.042], Y: [-0.038, 0.038]
           - Object 7 (top-center): X: [-0.0475, 0.0475], Y: [0.0025, 0.0975]
           
           Looking for free space:
           - Below object 4: Y < -0.049. A good candidate would be around Y = -0.05 - 0.0395 = -0.0895, but that's already cutting it close to the surface boundary for 0 rotation. Let's try Y = -0.08.
           - The area `X: [-0.135, -0.118]` and `X: [0.126, 0.135]` are very small.
           - The corners not yet filled, like the bottom-left or bottom-right.
           - The top-right or top-left (given object 7 is at (0, 0.05)). For example, `X > 0.0475` and `Y > 0.0975` for object 7. But `Y > 0.0975` is outside the allowed range for Object 6's center (0.0955 max).
           
           Let's try to place it below the central objects.
           The Y range available is roughly `[-0.135, -0.049]`. Object 6 has half-extent 0.0395.
           So the center Y for Object 6 must be `Y <= -0.049 - 0.0395 - epsilon = -0.0885 - epsilon`.
           Let's try Y = -0.08 for Object 6, with 0 rotation, and vary X.
           The current objects' Y ranges (with 0 rotation of object 6, half_size=0.03934) and surface bounds:
           Object 4: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Object 5: [-0.0461, 0.0461]
           Object 8: [-0.0378, 0.0378]
           Object 7: [0.0023, 0.0977]
           
           So, the area from `Y = -0.0492` down to `-0.135` is available.
           If object 6 is at (X, -0.08), its Y range would be [-0.08 - 0.03934, -0.08 + 0.03934] = [-0.11934, -0.04066]. This clears Object 4's lower bound and is within surface bounds.
           Now consider the X-coordinate. The total width of the 3 objects (8,4,5) is roughly 0.118 + 0.049 + 0.049 + 0.046 + 0.046 = 0.308, which is larger than the surface. This means they are overlapping in X-coordinates. The exact bounding boxes are what matters.
           Object 8: [-0.118, -0.042]
           Object 4: [-0.049, 0.049]
           Object 5: [0.034, 0.126]
           This means the region from X=-0.049 to X=-0.042 is covered by both 4 and 8. The region from X=0.034 to X=0.049 is covered by both 4 and 5. This implies the individual placement reports are based on non-overlapping bounding boxes for fixed obstacles, or the fixed obstacles are in fact not fixed in the scene until the current object is placed. Given the failure reports for ID 7 explicitly state "collided with fixed obstacles", I must use the known successful positions to avoid collisions.
           
           Let's reconsider the successful placements for 4, 5, 8, 7.
           Obj 4: center (0,0), size 0.098. Occupies X=[-0.049,0.049], Y=[-0.049,0.049].
           Obj 5: center (0.08,0), size 0.092. Occupies X=[0.034,0.126], Y=[-0.046,0.046].
           Obj 8: center (-0.08,0), size 0.076. Occupies X=[-0.118,-0.042], Y=[-0.038,0.038].
           Obj 7: center (0,0.05), size 0.095. Occupies X=[-0.0475,0.0475], Y=[0.0025,0.0975].
           
           These overlaps make sense if they are 'touching' rather than 'colliding'. For instance, object 4's right edge is at 0.049. Object 5's left edge is at 0.034. These are overlapping by 0.015. This suggests that the collision check is not a simple AABB check between already placed objects.
           However, I was given "collided with fixed obstacles" as feedback. This indicates that the *environment* has fixed obstacles that these objects must avoid, and the previously *successful* placements are considered part of the *fixed environment* for subsequent objects. This means the bounding box of object 4 *is* a collision obstacle for object 6.
           
           So, I need to find space for Object 6 (size 0.079x0.079, half extent 0.0395) that avoids the actual bounding box of all prior objects.
           X and Y ranges to avoid:
           Obj 4: X: [-0.049, 0.049], Y: [-0.049, 0.049]
           Obj 5: X: [0.034, 0.126], Y: [-0.046, 0.046]
           Obj 8: X: [-0.118, -0.042], Y: [-0.038, 0.038]
           Obj 7: X: [-0.0475, 0.0475], Y: [0.0025, 0.0975]
           
           The common Y range for 4,5,8 is roughly [-0.049, 0.049].
           The common Y range for 7 is [0.0025, 0.0975].
           
           I'll try placing Object 6 in the bottom region of the surface, clear of Object 4.
           The bottom-most extent of Object 4 is -0.049.
           The top-most extent of Object 7 is 0.0975.
           The overall extent occupied in Y is from -0.049 (Object 4, 5, 8) to 0.0975 (Object 7).
           
           So I need to place Object 6's Y-center such that its bottom edge is below -0.049 OR its top edge is above 0.0975.
           Let's try below:
           Y_center - 0.0395 < -0.049 => Y_center < -0.0095.
           Also, Y_center + 0.0395 > -0.049 if we are just touching.
           To be clearly below and not colliding, Y_center + 0.0395 should be less than -0.049. No. Y_center + 0.0395 should be less than the minimum Y value of objects it's placed against *if it is higher than them*, or its Y_center - 0.0395 should be greater than the maximum Y value of objects it's placed against *if it is lower than them*.
           
           Let's try to place object 6 directly below Object 4.
           Object 4 extends down to Y = -0.049.
           Object 6 (half-extent 0.0395) center Y should be -0.049 - 0.0395 - epsilon.
           Let's try Y = -0.09.
           X could be 0.
           This makes Object 6's Y-extent [-0.09 - 0.0395, -0.09 + 0.0395] = [-0.1295, -0.0505].
           This avoids Object 4's Y range. It is also within the surface Y range [-0.135, 0.135].
           For the X-coordinate, Object 6 at (0, -0.09) with 0 rotation has X-extent [-0.0395, 0.0395]. This is completely within Object 4's X range [-0.049, 0.049], meaning it will collide with Object 4 if its Y-range overlaps, which it does not. It does not collide with the X-ranges of 5 or 8 either.
           
           Let's try a center of (0, -0.09) and (0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.09).
           Also, let's explore the corners of the surface that are less occupied. For example, the bottom left or bottom right, or top left or top right (if space permits, considering object 7 at the top-middle).
           
           For (0, -0.09) and 0 rotation:
           AABB for Object 6: ((-0.03934, -0.12934), (0.03934, -0.05066)). This is stable regarding the surface.
           Collision check with Obj 4 (X:[-0.049,0.049], Y:[-0.049,0.049]): No Y overlap.
           Collision check with Obj 5 (X:[0.034,0.126], Y:[-0.046,0.046]): No Y overlap.
           Collision check with Obj 8 (X:[-0.118,-0.042], Y:[-0.038,0.038]): No Y overlap.
           Collision check with Obj 7 (X:[-0.0475,0.0475], Y:[0.0025,0.0975]): No Y overlap.
           This placement seems viable.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still has one square surface (0.27x0.27) centered at the origin.
           I have several previously placed objects, and for this request, I need to place Object 7 again. This implies the previous set of placements for Object 7 (ID: 7) were part of a search, and now I need to continue finding *new* valid placements for *this specific object*, taking into account the *entire history of successful placements for all objects*. The failure feedback is crucial for understanding the bounds.
           
           Let's summarize the successful placements for all objects *up to this point*:
           (ID: 4) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> X:[-0.049,0.049], Y:[-0.049,0.049]
           (ID: 5) -- (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) -> X:[0.034,0.126], Y:[-0.046,0.046]
           (ID: 8) -- (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0) -> X:[-0.118,-0.042], Y:[-0.038,0.038]
           (ID: 7) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05) -> X:[-0.0475,0.0475], Y:[0.0025,0.0975] (This is a previous success, should avoid)
           (ID: 6) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09) -> X:[-0.0393,0.0393], Y:[-0.1293,-0.0507]
           (ID: 7) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05) -> X:[-0.0475,0.0475], Y:[-0.0975,-0.0025] (Another previous success for ID 7)
           (ID: 6) -- (0, 0.0, 0.08, -0.09) -> X:[0.0407,0.1193], Y:[-0.1293,-0.0507]
           (ID: 4) -- (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.0) -> Effective half_extent = sqrt(2 * (0.098/2)^2) = 0.0693. X:[-0.0693,0.0693], Y:[-0.0693,0.0693] (This is rotated 4, also needs to be avoided.)
           (ID: 5) -- (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0) -> X:[-0.126,-0.034], Y:[-0.046,0.046] (This is a *new* valid placement for ID 5, it means object 5 from before could be moved, or there are multiple scenarios. I will assume these are all *possible* placements to avoid for the current ID 7.)
           (ID: 8) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08) -> X:[-0.038,0.038], Y:[0.042,0.118]
           (ID: 6) -- (0, 0.0, -0.08, -0.09) -> X:[-0.1193,-0.0407], Y:[-0.1293,-0.0507]
           (ID: 5) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.08) -> X:[-0.046,0.046], Y:[0.034,0.126]
           (ID: 7) -- (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.05) -> X:[-0.0674,0.0674], Y:[-0.0174,0.1174]
           (ID: 4) -- (0, 0.0, 0.02, 0.0) -> X:[-0.029,0.069], Y:[-0.049,0.049]
           (ID: 8) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08) -> X:[-0.038,0.038], Y:[-0.118,-0.042]
           (ID: 6) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.09) -> X:[-0.0393,0.0393], Y:[0.0507,0.1293]
           (ID: 5) -- (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08) -> X:[-0.046,0.046], Y:[-0.126,-0.034]
           (ID: 7) -- (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.05) -> X:[-0.0674,0.0674], Y:[-0.1174,0.0174]
           (ID: 4) -- (0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0) -> X:[-0.069,0.029], Y:[-0.049,0.049]
           (ID: 8) -- (0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.08, 0.0) -> X:[-0.1337, -0.0263], Y:[-0.0537, 0.0537]
           (ID: 6) -- (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.09) -> X:[0.0407,0.1193], Y:[0.0507,0.1293]
           (ID: 5) -- (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.08, 0.0) -> X:[0.0101, 0.1499], Y:[-0.0651, 0.0651]
           
           The effective space available for placing Object 7 is diminishing. The surface is ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object 7 has a size of 0.095x0.095. Half extent is 0.0475.
           If rotated by pi/4, effective half extent is sqrt(2*(0.0475)^2) approx 0.067.
           Max center Y for 0 rotation: 0.135 - 0.0475 = 0.0875.
           Min center Y for 0 rotation: -0.135 + 0.0475 = -0.0875.
           Max center Y for pi/4 rotation: 0.135 - 0.067 = 0.068.
           Min center Y for pi/4 rotation: -0.135 + 0.067 = -0.068.
           The same applies for X coordinates.
           
           The previous failures for ID 7 show that placing it at 0.1 in X or Y (or more) makes it unstable when rotated, and sometimes even at 0 rotation, if it's too close to the edge. This implies the stable range for the center of object 7 is roughly `[-0.0875, 0.0875]` for 0 rotation and `[-0.068, 0.068]` for pi/4 rotation.
           
           Given the large number of existing objects and their various successful placements, I need to be careful to select new, non-overlapping regions for Object 7. Since there are many successes for ID 4, 5, 8, 6, I will assume that I should avoid *any* of the successful placements for any object, not just the currently "active" set. The problem states "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This implies that all successful placements for other IDs are now fixed obstacles to avoid. However, the problem also lists previous successes for *ID 7 itself*, which I should not repeat.
           
           Let's simplify and try to place Object 7 in the corners if possible, or along the edges where no other objects have been placed *recently*.
           The coordinates of object 7's successful placements so far:
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.05)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.05)
           
           These are all centered at X=0, Y=0.05 or Y=-0.05.
           I need to find other regions. Let's try corners.
           Consider the top-left corner: X < -0.0475 and Y > 0.0975 (from object 7's current successful placement at 0, 0.05). But Y > 0.0975 is too high for the center (max 0.0875 for 0 rot).
           
           Let's try to place it in the region defined by X < -0.08 (left of object 8's common placements).
           And Y coordinates that avoid all existing objects.
           The Y-axis is quite full:
           -0.1293 to 0.1293 (approx) is occupied by objects 6, 4, 5, 7, 8 in various positions.
           
           I will focus on placing Object 7 at X or Y positions near the boundary, but within the stable limits learned from the failures. For instance, X=0.085 or Y=0.085 for 0 rotation.
           
           Let's try to place it at X=0.085, Y=0.085.
           Object 7 at (0.085, 0.085) with 0 rotation.
           AABB: (0.085 - 0.0475, 0.085 - 0.0475) to (0.085 + 0.0475, 0.085 + 0.0475)
           = (0.0375, 0.0375) to (0.1325, 0.1325).
           This is contained in the surface ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Now check for collision with previously successful placements:
           - (ID: 4) (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0): X:[-0.049,0.049], Y:[-0.049,0.049]. Our object: X:[0.0375,0.1325], Y:[0.0375,0.1325]. Overlap in X,Y is [0.0375,0.049]. Collision.
           
           This indicates that simply shifting it to a corner might still collide with one of the *many* previously successful placements which fill up the space. I need a more systematic way to identify truly empty spots.
           
           The problem implies that if I get a new request for ID 7, the previous successful placements for ID 7 are *also* to be avoided now, effectively meaning I need to find *another* valid position.
           
           Let's find the union of all occupied AABBs from the successful placements for all objects.
           Active objects (based on successful placements from previous request):
           ID 4: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) -> Bbox: ((-0.0492, -0.0492), (0.0492, 0.0492))
           ID 5: (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.0) -> Bbox: ((0.0339, -0.0461), (0.1261, 0.0461))
           ID 8: (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.0) -> Bbox: ((-0.1178, -0.0378), (-0.0422, 0.0378))
           ID 7: (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05) -> Bbox: ((-0.0477, 0.0023), (0.0477, 0.0977))
           ID 6: (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.09) -> Bbox: ((-0.0393, -0.1293), (0.0393, -0.0507))
           
           There are multiple successful placements for *each* ID. This is the tricky part. It means at each step, the set of *fixed obstacles* is essentially the union of all successful placements of *all* objects that have been encountered so far.
           This would make the scene extremely cluttered very quickly.
           "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j."
           This implies that *for this request*, I have one "current ID 7" and a list of *previous successful placements for other objects*. It does not imply that all previous placements for *all* objects are simultaneously "fixed". Rather, it means that *if* a previous placement for ID X succeeded, it is now part of the *set of possible fixed obstacles*. When placing ID Y, I must ensure ID Y does not collide with *any* of the successful placements of ID X.
           
           Let's assume the previous successful placements for a specific ID *replace* previous ones, unless told otherwise. However, the problem statement says "You may reuse previous placements if they are stable". This indicates I should be finding *new* valid positions, not just repeating old ones. The multiple successes for *each* ID (4,5,8,7,6) listed imply that previous successes are a *pool* of known valid states, and *not* that all of them are simultaneously fixed obstacles.
           
           Given the wording "if you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j", and the fact that previous successes for *ID 7* were listed, I interpret this as follows:
           When I am asked to place object ID 7, I must find a stable placement for ID 7 that does not collide with *any previously accepted successful placement for ID 4, ID 5, ID 8, ID 6*. Also, I must find a *new* placement for ID 7 (not one of the previously accepted ID 7 placements).
           
           Let's list the relevant bounding boxes for collision:
           ID 4: Bbox: ((-0.0492, -0.0492), (0.0492, 0.0492)) (from (0,0,0,0))
           ID 5: Bbox: ((0.0339, -0.0461), (0.1261, 0.0461)) (from (0,0,0.08,0))
           ID 8: Bbox: ((-0.1178, -0.0378), (-0.0422, 0.0378)) (from (0,0,-0.08,0))
           ID 6: Bbox: ((-0.0393, -0.1293), (0.0393, -0.0507)) (from (0,0,0,-0.09))
           
           Note that there are *multiple* entries for each ID in the "successes" list. This is highly confusing. "avoid collision between objects i and j". If I'm placing object J, I need to avoid collision with object I. This means I need to avoid the *space occupied by object I*. If I has multiple successful placements, which one is it that I'm avoiding?
           
           Let's assume that "the scene" means a configuration of one successful placement for each *other* object ID, and that the agent has chosen one for each. The only logical way to proceed is to consider that the *most recent* successful placement for *each unique ID other than the current one* defines the obstacles in the scene. The explicit phrasing "you must avoid collision between objects i and j" implies I'm avoiding the geometry of "object i" (a *single instance*) and "object j".
           
           So, for this request for ID 7, the fixed obstacles in the scene are:
           - Object 4: The last successful placement for ID 4 was `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, -0.02, 0.0`. So Object 4 is at (-0.02, 0) with 0 rotation, extent 0.098x0.098. Bbox: ((-0.069, -0.049), (0.029, 0.049)).
           - Object 5: The last successful placement for ID 5 was `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.08, 0.0`. So Object 5 is at (0.08, 0) with pi/4 rotation, extent 0.092x0.092. Bbox: ((0.0101, -0.0651), (0.1499, 0.0651)).
           - Object 8: The last successful placement for ID 8 was `(ID: 8) -- 0, 0.7853981633974483, -0.08, 0.0`. So Object 8 is at (-0.08, 0) with pi/4 rotation, extent 0.076x0.076. Bbox: ((-0.1337, -0.0537), (-0.0263, 0.0537)).
           - Object 6: The last successful placement for ID 6 was `(ID: 6) -- 0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.09`. So Object 6 is at (0.08, 0.09) with 0 rotation, extent 0.079x0.079. Bbox: ((0.0407, 0.0507), (0.1193, 0.1293)).
           
           Object 7 (0.095x0.095, half_extent 0.0475). Rotated half_extent 0.067.
           Surface: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           
           Summary of current obstacles (conservative AABBs for rotated objects):
           Obj 4 (0.0, -0.02, 0.0): [-0.069, 0.029] x [-0.049, 0.049]
           Obj 5 (0.0, 0.08, 0.0): [0.0101, 0.1499] x [-0.0651, 0.0651]
           Obj 8 (0.0, -0.08, 0.0): [-0.1337, -0.0263] x [-0.0537, 0.0537]
           Obj 6 (0.0, 0.08, 0.09): [0.0407, 0.1193] x [0.0507, 0.1293]
           
           The previous successful placements for ID 7 were `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05)` and `(0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.05)` and `(0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05)` and `(0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.05)`. I should not try these exact ones.
           
           Let's look for clear space.
           The top-right corner is heavily occupied by Obj 6 and Obj 5.
           The middle is covered by Obj 4.
           The left side is covered by Obj 8.
           
           Let's try a placement for Obj 7 at (X=0.0, Y=0.0). This would collide with Obj 4 based on the Bbox.
           Let's try to place it at X=-0.08 and Y=0.08.
           AABB for Obj 7 at (-0.08, 0.08) with 0 rotation: ((-0.08-0.0475, 0.08-0.0475), (-0.08+0.0475, 0.08+0.0475)) = ((-0.1275, 0.0325), (-0.0325, 0.1275)).
           This is within surface bounds.
           Check collisions:
           - Obj 4: ((-0.069, -0.049), (0.029, 0.049)). Obj 7 X-range overlaps with Obj 4 X-range. Y-range of Obj 7 (0.0325, 0.1275) overlaps with Obj 4 Y-range (-0.049, 0.049) at [0.0325, 0.049]. This would be a collision.
           
           Let's try a placement at (X=0.0, Y=-0.08) with 0 rotation.
           Obj 7 AABB: ((-0.0475, -0.1275), (0.0475, -0.0325)).
           Check collisions:
           - Obj 4: ((-0.069, -0.049), (0.029, 0.049)). X overlap. Y overlap ([-0.049, -0.0325]). Collision.
           
           Let's try to find an empty corner.
           Consider the area around X=0.0 and Y=0.0. This area is heavily covered.
           Consider X values around -0.1 and Y values around -0.1.
           Obj 7 at (-0.1, -0.1), 0 rotation: ((-0.1475, -0.1475), (-0.0525, -0.0525)). This is out of bounds for the surface (-0.135, -0.135).
           This confirms my earlier calculation of Y_center max/min. Max Y for 0 rot is 0.0875. Min Y is -0.0875. Max X is 0.0875. Min X is -0.0875.
           
           Let's try to place it at X=-0.08 and Y=-0.08.
           Obj 7 AABB: ((-0.1275, -0.1275), (-0.0325, -0.0325)). This is within surface bounds.
           Check collisions:
           - Obj 4: ((-0.069, -0.049), (0.029, 0.049)). X overlap. Y overlap. Collision.
           - Obj 5: ((0.0101, -0.0651), (0.1499, 0.0651)). No overlap.
           - Obj 8: ((-0.1337, -0.0537), (-0.0263, 0.0537)). X overlap. Y overlap. Collision.
           - Obj 6: ((0.0407, 0.0507), (0.1193, 0.1293)). No overlap.
           
           This is very difficult with the overlapping regions. The instruction "avoid collision between objects i and j" implies strict non-overlap of bounding boxes. If the given "successful" placements are themselves overlapping, this implies the collision check is more nuanced or the interpretation of "fixed obstacles" needs to be adjusted.
           Given the failures explicitly state 'not stable, as the AABB of the object is not contained', it suggests my AABB calculations for the surface limits are correct. The failures for ID 7 when it was first requested were also due to going out of bounds.
           
           Since I am given *a list of successes for ID 4,5,6,8 and 7*, I will interpret this as a list of *all currently known stable states*. When placing ID 7, I must not collide with any of these successful placements for *other* IDs, and I must provide a *new* stable placement for ID 7.
           
           Let's explicitly consider all listed successful placements for other objects as static obstacles.
           I will generate candidates near the corners, staying within the safe Y range for the center `[-0.0875, 0.0875]` and X range `[-0.0875, 0.0875]` (for 0 rotation). And `[-0.068, 0.068]` for 45-degree rotation.
           
           Let's try the bottom-left corner with some offset from the max valid values.
           Candidate: (X = -0.08, Y = -0.08) and 0 rotation.
           AABB: ((-0.1275, -0.1275), (-0.0325, -0.0325)).
           Let's list all relevant obstacles' AABBs again.
           Obstacles:

           This is too many overlapping boxes to check manually for each placement. It confirms that the available space is incredibly fragmented. The problem setter probably intends for me to find *any* valid position, not necessarily the most efficient packing.
           The key insight is that the prompt wants 50 stable placements, not just one. The "reuse previous placements if stable" refers to my internal strategy, not that I should output them.
           The "failures" are critical. Any placement that was "not stable" means it went out of bounds. Any placement that "collided with fixed obstacles" means it overlapped one of the obstacles.
           
           Let's simplify. I need to find a new placement for ID 7 that is stable (within surface bounds) and does not overlap with any of the *successful placements of other objects*. I should also not repeat previous successful placements for ID 7.
           
           Let's try placing object 7 in a region that seems less occupied. The failure list provides important clues about the boundaries. For example, placing object 7 at Y=0.1 was unstable (out of bounds) for 0 and pi/4 rotation. This means Y values for the center must be somewhat smaller.
           For object 7 (half_size 0.0475):
           Max Y_center (0 rot) = 0.135 - 0.0475 = 0.0875.
           Min Y_center (0 rot) = -0.135 + 0.0475 = -0.0875.
           Max Y_center (pi/4 rot) = 0.135 - 0.06717 = 0.06783.
           Min Y_center (pi/4 rot) = -0.135 + 0.06717 = -0.06783.
           
           Let's look for pockets.
           The central region is very crowded.
           Consider the top-left area. Maximum X and Y for center are 0.0875. Minimum -0.0875.
           Object 6 (0.08, 0.09) is top-right.
           Object 8 (-0.08, 0.0) is middle-left.
           Object 5 (0.08, 0.0) is middle-right.
           Object 4 (-0.02, 0.0) is middle.
           
           The upper-left quadrant `(X < 0, Y > 0)` has `O4_0_N020` (X:[-0.0692,0.0292], Y:[-0.0492,0.0492]) and `O8_R0_N080` (X:[-0.1337,-0.0263], Y:[-0.0537,0.0537]) and `O8_0_008` (X:[-0.0378,0.0378], Y:[0.0422,0.1178]).
           The space `X < -0.0692` and `Y > 0.0492` is available from Obj 4.
           The space `X < -0.1337` is outside the surface.
           The space `Y > 0.0537` is available from Obj 8.
           The space `X < -0.0378` and `Y > 0.1178` is available from Obj 8 but Y is too high.
           
           Let's try a small Y value and negative X value. For example, X = -0.09, Y = 0.02 (0 rotation).
           Obj 7 AABB: ((-0.09-0.0475, 0.02-0.0475), (-0.09+0.0475, 0.02+0.0475)) = ((-0.1375, -0.0275), (-0.0425, 0.0675)). This is out of bounds for X. (X_min < -0.135).
           
           My maximum x/y center for a non-rotated object 7 is 0.0875.
           Let's try placing it in a "quadrant" not yet too cluttered: say, X from -0.08 to -0.04, and Y from 0.06 to 0.08.
           Candidate: (-0.07, 0.07) with 0 rotation.
           AABB: ((-0.1175, 0.0225), (-0.0225, 0.1175)). This is within surface.
           Check against last known obstacles:
           Obj 4 ((-0.069, -0.049), (0.029, 0.049)): X-overlap [-0.069, -0.0225]. Y-overlap [0.0225, 0.049]. Collision.
           
           This is a very difficult problem under the current interpretation of "fixed obstacles". It makes the available space very fragmented. Given the sheer number of previous successful placements (25 in total, including 4 for ID 7 itself), checking each manually is not feasible. The only way to move forward is to try various placements that *appear* to be in less dense areas of the surface.
           
           Let's assume the scene is reset for each object, and the list of "successes" are merely examples of what *can* be placed, and my current task is just to find 50 placements for Object 7 that are stable on surface 0 and don't collide with *just one* specified configuration of *other* objects if a new config is implied for each request. But then, which config? The problem implies using the *entire list of successful placements for each ID*.
           
           This suggests the problem requires an algorithmic approach to collision detection against multiple AABBs. Without explicit tools for this, I will try to fill the remaining parts of the surface based on the surface bounds and object size, focusing on areas away from the 'center' placements.
           The surface is large enough to fit about 2x2 of object 4 or 5, but smaller for 3x3.
           Object 7 (0.095x0.095)
           Surface (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           Let's try small shifts from the boundaries for a 0-rotation object.
           Max X_center = 0.0875. Max Y_center = 0.0875.
           Min X_center = -0.0875. Min Y_center = -0.0875.
           
           Let's try a grid-like search, avoiding the center positions and previously successful positions of ID 7.
           Previous successful ID 7 placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.05)
           (0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, 0.05)
           (0, 0.7853981633974483, 0.0, -0.05)
           
           I'll try coordinates close to the corner within the stable range (e.g., +/-0.08 for X and Y, and slightly smaller for 45 deg rotation).
           
           Placements:
           (0, 0.0, 0.08, 0.08)
