(Thoughts: **My Stable Placement Strategy for a Nearly Square Object**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0.  I've got an object that's almost a perfect square, with dimensions `size_x = 0.08730276360977157` and `size_y = 0.08730276360977152`, and the surface is defined by the AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Since the surface is a square and the object is nearly a square, I can leverage that to simplify things. The format I need is `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`, with `surf_idx` being 0, meaning surface 0.
           
           To ensure stability, the object's AABB must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.  I'll start by figuring out the valid ranges for `x` and `y` center coordinates, and how that's affected by rotation (`theta`).
           
           First, I define `obj_half_x` and `obj_half_y` as half the object's dimensions, which are essentially the same (both around 0.04365).
           
           For a good initial approach, I know that `theta = 0` (or multiples of π) and `theta = π/2` (or multiples of π/2) are often a good starting point for finding stable placements.  In these cases, the object's AABB extends along the x and y axes, and the containment calculation is straightforward.  But, to be more precise and to account for any rotation, I need to consider a more robust way to compute the valid range.
           
           With a perfect square object and surface, rotation wouldn't change the problem, but this object is technically a rectangle. In theory, I could calculate the effective bounding box for any `theta`.
           
           However, given that the object is very close to a square, calculating ranges based on max bounding box extents is the most conservative and efficient way to guarantee object containment regardless of the rotation. To determine the most restrictive bounding box, I use the rotation `theta = pi/4`.
           
           So I calculated the maximum effective half-dimension, and I know that the most restrictive footprint will occur with rotation at `pi/4`. The best plan is to calculate this and adjust the bounds appropriately to ensure stable containment for *any* rotation.
           
           I calculated `x_min_bound`, `x_max_bound`, `y_min_bound`, and `y_max_bound`  (all based on the bounds of the surface and the padding to keep the object contained, which accounts for maximum AABB size).
           
           The final usable range for `x` and `y` are the same, `[-0.07326992451946382, 0.07326992451946382]`.
           
           To generate 50 placements, I'll create a 5x5 grid of `x` and `y` coordinates within these bounds, with 25 different positions, then applying two `theta` values for each pair: 0 and pi/2. This will provide my 50 required placements. The steps between `x` and `y` positions are 0.0366.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Aware Placement of Object 5**
           
           Okay, I've got the feedback on Object 4's successful placement (ID 4), which is great.  Now, the challenge is placing Object 5 (ID 5) without any collisions. Here's my plan:
           
           1. **Surface Assessment:** First, I'll figure out the valid placement region for Object 5 on Surface 0, taking its size into account and surface boundaries (x and y between -0.135 and 0.135).  This initial step ignores Object 4, it will consider only the stable bounds based on the object's size.
           2. **Collision Filtration:** Then, and this is crucial, I'll filter out any of these potential locations that would intersect with Object 4's current position.
           
           **Object 4's Position:** I've calculated Object 4's bounding box (AABB)  on Surface 0. It's centered at approximately (-0.073, -0.073) with half extents of approximately 0.044, which gives an AABB from roughly (-0.117, -0.117) to (-0.03, -0.03).
           
           **Object 5's Details:** Object 5's sizes are 0.0784 x 0.0784.
           
           **Step 1:  Valid Region for Object 5.**
           I've calculated the minimum boundary considering the half dimensions plus some padding of Object 5 as -0.0795 and 0.0795 for both x and y on the Surface 0.
           
           **Step 2: Collision Avoidance.**
           
           The placement for object 5 is limited to prevent object 4 collisions.
           
           I've determined that the collision region for Object 5's center, assuming its orientation is either 0 or pi/2 is a rectangle: x is from -0.156 to 0.009605, y from -0.156 to 0.009605.
           
           The area is [-0.07952, 0.0096052396] x [-0.07952, 0.0096052396]
           So I need locations *outside* of this for the object's center.  Since x and y are the same, my solution must consider the intersection between the safe location space, and the collision space. In this process I created two zones
           1. `x` from `x_s0_min` to `x_s0_max`, `y` from `y_coll_max_val + epsilon` to `y_s0_max`
           2. `x` from `x_coll_max_val + epsilon` to `x_s0_max`, `y` from `y_s0_min` to `y_coll_max_val`
           I know that I need to position the center either above the object (x range and above 0.009605) or to the right of the object (y range and right 0.009605)
           
           The safe zones, with a little added epsilon, should avoid collisions. Now, using a grid I calculated safe x, y placements in two distinct regions.
           
           I've tested 33 different non-colliding (x, y) coordinates and applying orientations of 0 and 1.57 (pi/2 radians).  This yields 66 positions.  The algorithm requires only 50 positions, so I can use the first 50.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable positions for object ID 6 on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into objects ID 4 and ID 5 already there. First, I need to understand the constraints: object 6's size is about 0.0975 in both dimensions, and the surface bounds are +/- 0.135. With some padding for rotation (using the maximum diagonal size of the object, about 0.069), this gives me a valid center range for object 6 of roughly +/- 0.066.
           
           Next, collision avoidance. I’ve calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for objects 4 and 5 in their current positions and theta=0. I take the center of objects 4 and 5,  add their individual sizes, and then add max half-dimension (0.04876) of object 6 (at both 0 and 90 degrees) to create a no-go zone. Now I am using a simplified AABB around those objects instead of checking all orientations to simplify the computations, the circle-like conservative AABB would be correct.
           
           The surface 0 collision zones are: for object 4, it is -0.066 to 0.019, and -0.066 to 0.019; and for object 5, it is -0.066 to 0.008, and -0.061 to 0.066.
           
           Now, I generated a grid of possible center points for object 6. For each point, I check if it falls within either of those conflict zones. If it does, it's a no-go. I’m making sure that the coordinates of object 6 are not within the region occupied by another object's bounding box. The check is simple AABB tests against the collision zones. The final set of placements I found will ensure no overlap, given I considered two rotations (0 and 90 degrees) to find 50 stable positions.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The new object with ID 7 has dimensions `size_x = 0.09534698831016053` and `size_y = 0.0953469883101605`. This makes it a nearly square object. The available surface (surface 0) is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           First, I determine the valid range for the object's center `(x, y)` to be fully contained within the surface for a given orientation.
           Let `half_x_7 = size_x_7 / 2 = 0.047673494155080265` and `half_y_7 = size_y_7 / 2 = 0.04767349415508025`.
           
           For a placement at `theta = 0` radians:
           `x` range for center: `[-0.135 + half_x_7, 0.135 - half_x_7]` = `[-0.08732650584491973, 0.08732650584491973]`
           `y` range for center: `[-0.135 + half_y_7, 0.135 - half_y_7]` = `[-0.08732650584491975, 0.08732650584491975]`
           
           For a placement at `theta = pi/2` radians:
           `x` range for center: `[-0.135 + half_y_7, 0.135 - half_y_7]` = `[-0.08732650584491975, 0.08732650584491975]`
           `y` range for center: `[-0.135 + half_x_7, 0.135 - half_x_7]` = `[-0.08732650584491973, 0.08732650584491973]`
           
           Since `half_x_7` and `half_y_7` are extremely close, these ranges are practically identical. I will use the `theta=0` ranges as the overall valid range for the object's center, to be conservative, `x_surf_range = [-0.08732650584491973, 0.08732650584491973]` and `y_surf_range = [-0.08732650584491975, 0.08732650584491975]`.
           
           Next, I calculate the collision zones for object 7 with previously placed objects (ID 4, 5, 6). The previous placements are all at `theta=0`, so their AABBs are determined directly by their `size_x` and `size_y`. For object 7, the AABB depends on its chosen orientation. I will calculate collision zones for `theta=0` and `theta=pi/2` for object 7.
           
           **Object 4 (ID: 4):** `(0, 0.0, -0.07326992451946382, -0.07326992451946382)`, `size_x_4=0.08730276360977157`, `size_y_4=0.08730276360977152`. `half_x_4=0.043651381804885785`, `half_y_4=0.04365138180488576`.
           
           **Object 5 (ID: 5):** `(0, 0.0, -0.07952325748213409, 0.026507752494044695)`, `size_x_5=0.07844756466892772`, `size_y_5=0.07844756466892777`. `half_x_5=0.03922378233446386`, `half_y_5=0.039223782334463885`.
           
           **Object 6 (ID: 6):** `(0, 0.0, -0.02201266587942332, 0.04402533175884664)`, `size_x_6=0.09753111023659156`, `size_y_6=0.0975311102365915`. `half_x_6=0.04876555511829578`, `half_y_6=0.04876555511829575`.
           
           **Collision regions for object 7 center at `theta=0`:**
           (Collision with an object `i` creates a rectangular no-go zone `(center_i_x +/- (half_x_i + half_x_7), center_i_y +/- (half_y_i + half_y_7))` for object 7's center.)
           `C4_x_int_0 = [-0.08732650584491973, 0.01805495144050223]`
           `C4_y_int_0 = [-0.08732650584491975, 0.01805495144050219]`
           `C5_x_int_0 = [-0.08732650584491973, 0.00737401900741003]`
           `C5_y_int_0 = [-0.06038952399549943, 0.08732650584491975]`
           `C6_x_int_0 = [-0.08732650584491973, 0.07442638339395272]`
           `C6_y_int_0 = [-0.05241371751452936, 0.08732650584491975]`
           
           **Collision regions for object 7 center at `theta=pi/2`:**
           (These are nearly identical to `theta=0` due to object 7's near-square shape.)
           `C4_x_int_pi2 = [-0.08732650584491975, 0.01805495144050221]`
           `C4_y_int_pi2 = [-0.08732650584491973, 0.01805495144050221]`
           `C5_x_int_pi2 = [-0.08732650584491975, 0.00737401900741001]`
           `C5_y_int_pi2 = [-0.06038952399549945, 0.08732650584491973]`
           `C6_x_int_pi2 = [-0.08732650584491975, 0.07442638339395271]`
           `C6_y_int_pi2 = [-0.05241371751452937, 0.08732650584491973]`
           
           Combining these, the free space for object 7 (for both orientations) is very constrained. The intersection of surface bounds and the complement of all collision zones for `theta=0` indicates a free region for object 7's center:
           `x_center` in `(0.07442638339395272, 0.08732650584491973]`
           `y_center` in `[-0.08732650584491975, -0.05241371751452936)`
           
           To generate 50 unique placements, I will create a 5x5 grid of `(x, y)` coordinates within this small valid region. For each `(x, y)` point, I will generate two placements, one at `theta=0` and one at `theta=pi/2`.
           
           `x_coords = [0.07452, 0.07773, 0.08095, 0.08416, 0.08731]`
           `y_coords = [-0.08732, -0.07869, -0.07006, -0.06143, -0.05281]`
           
           These coordinates ensure that each `x` is `> 0.07442` and each `y` is `< -0.05241`. All are within surface bounds.
