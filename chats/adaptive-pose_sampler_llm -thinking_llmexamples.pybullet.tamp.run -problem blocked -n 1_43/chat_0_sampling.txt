(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5, a 0.07 x 0.07 square, on surface 0, which is defined by the points (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object is *fully* within the surface's boundaries, even when rotated.
           
           My initial thought was that since it's a square, the rotation wouldn't matter much.  However, this requires more precision than I initially appreciated. Let's delve in:
           
           I've got the object's dimensions: w = 0.07, h = 0.07.  The surface's dimensions are calculated: width (s_w) of 0.6, height (s_h) of 0.6, where `s_w = s_ux - s_lx` and `s_h = s_uy - s_ly`.
           
           The center (x, y) of the object must fit within the surface's boundaries, considering the object's dimensions and rotation.  For a given rotation `theta`, the "effective" dimensions, `effective_size_x` and `effective_size_y`, need to be considered.  With `theta`, the effective width = `W = w * abs(cos(theta)) + h * abs(sin(theta))` and the effective height = `H = w * abs(sin(theta)) + h * abs(cos(theta))`.
           
           *   **For theta = 0:** The effective width and height are straightforward: 0.07 x 0.07.  The available range for `x` (center of the object) is from 4.235 to 4.765, and for `y`, it's -0.565 to -0.035.
           
           *   **Crucial Correction:** The effective dimensions *do* change when the square object rotates! The widest AABB for a square object occurs at 45 degrees. Therefore, using the most constrained scenario, where the object can rotate, is most correct for stability for all `theta`.
           
           *   **For theta = pi/4:** `effective_size_x` and `effective_size_y` both become approximately 0.07 * sqrt(2) or 0.099. The resulting boundaries become: x:  4.2494974745 <= x <= 4.7505025255 and y: -0.5505025255 <= y <= -0.0494974745
           
           For *diversity* as requested in the instructions, I'll generate 25 placements with `theta = 0` (easy case) and 25 with `theta = pi/4` to ensure it can be placed with all angles.
           
           For both theta values, I will use a 5x5 grid for each. Each will be evenly spaced within their defined ranges.
           
           **For theta = 0:**
           *   x range: 4.235 to 4.765
           *   y range: -0.565 to -0.035
           
           **For theta = pi/4:**
           *   x range: 4.2494974745 to 4.7505025255
           *   y range: -0.5505025255 to -0.0494974745
           
           The `x` and `y` coordinates for the grids were calculated using steps determined by the number of placements (5), within their defined ranges. Then I'll combine the placements.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 10**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable, non-colliding placements for a new object (ID 10) on surface 0, given that object 5 has already been placed at (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565). I've already calculated the properties of the surface (0) and the dimensions of Object 10, which I've approximated as a square with side length s = 0.0888.
           
           To start, I've calculated the boundaries for potential placements by analyzing Object 10 with both 0-degree and 45-degree rotations. I then determined the boundaries of Object 5 based on its given location (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565), which is effectively located at surface 0's bottom-left corner.
           
           I've generated a grid of potential placements, first with a 0-degree orientation, then with a 45-degree orientation, avoiding any overlap with Object 5. I calculated the AABB of object 5 and used that information for the collision check of potential placements using both orientations.
           
           After filtering out overlapping positions, I found that the placement strategy leads to 48 valid placements.
           
           To reach the required 50 stable placements, I considered two new positions that are not from the grid (so that these positions can be unique, not repeating). Using the AABB, I validated that these two new placements do not lead to any collisions: `(0, 3.141592653589793, 4.51, -0.29)` and `(0, 3.141592653589793, 4.49, -0.31)`. These are both placed with an orientation that's the same as the already computed 0 degree orientation.
           
           Finally, I have 50 unique placements for object 10 on surface 0 with the appropriate stability conditions.
