           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom pose(v14, v15)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom graspable(v14)
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)

           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v11)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom stackable(v8, v16)
           Atom atpose(v14, v15)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v16)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes three stackable and graspable objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, and two arms, `v4` and `v6`. Initially, all three objects are supported by `v11` at their current poses. The goal is to move all three objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` to be on `v16`. The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which does not change the robot's base configuration or affect the state of the objects. Since there are no pick or place actions available, and the objects are not currently on `v16`, it is impossible to achieve the goal.
           
           The initial state shows `atpose(v8, v9)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, and `atpose(v14, v15)`. It also states that `supported(v8, v9, v11)`, `supported(v12, v13, v11)`, and `supported(v14, v15, v11)`. This means all objects are currently on `v11`.
           
           The goal requires `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. To achieve this, the robot would need to use `pick` and `place` actions to move the objects from `v11` to `v16`. However, the provided list of valid action instances only contains `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action cannot change the support relationship of any object. Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the given available actions.
