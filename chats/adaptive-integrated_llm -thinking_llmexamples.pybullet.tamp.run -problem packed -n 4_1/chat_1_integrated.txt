User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.111, -0.312, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.607, 0.795).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.178, -0.26), (0.26, -0.178)).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.259, -0.018, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.075, 0.997).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.177, 0.558, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.998, -0.057).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.219, -0.219, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.767, 0.642).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.154, -0.355), (-0.068, -0.27)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.299, -0.058), (-0.219, 0.021)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.138, 0.52), (0.216, 0.597)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Planning to Place Objects on Surface v18**
           
           Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. My objective is crystal clear: get those objects, v8, v12, v14, and v16, all stacked neatly on surface v18.  That means I've got to pick each one up, move it, and set it down in the right spot.  Simple, right?  Well, maybe not *that* simple.
           
           Here's the breakdown, starting with what I know:
           
           *   **My Starting Point:** I'm in the initial state. My arms, v4 and v6, are ready to go (handempty).  My base, v3, is good to stay put for now.
           
           *   **The Objects:** Each object (v8, v12, v14, v16) is graspable and currently residing at its own pose (v9, v13, v15, v17, respectively) supported by v11. And, each one is stackable on both v18 and v10.
           
           *   **The Goal:** Get `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)`. That means each object needs to be *supported* by v18 and *at* a specific pose on v18.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           I'm thinking step-by-step:
           1.  **Object v8:**  Pick from pose v9, place at #o2_v8 (target on v18).
           2.  **Object v12:** Pick from pose v13, place at #o2_v12 (target on v18).
           3.  **Object v14:** Pick from pose v15, place at #o2_v14 (target on v18).
           4.  **Object v16:** Pick from pose v17, place at #o2_v16 (target on v18).
           
           Key things to note:
           I must specify different continuous values to ensure that these objects do not collide. So all objects are being placed on different spots of the surface v18.
           
           I've determined I need the continuous parameters for the poses, where I use `#o2` for each object but different values, such as the following examples. These are relative to the center of v18. The Z-value should be the same as their current poses at 0.781.
           
           *   `#o2_v8`: (0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0)
           *   `#o2_v12`: (-0.06, 0.06, 0.781, 0)
           *   `#o2_v14`: (-0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0)
           *   `#o2_v16`: (0.06, -0.06, 0.781, 0)
           
           So, here's my plan of action:
           1.  **Pick:** (Using Kinematics facts to pick the objects and then place them).
               *   Pick v8 from v9
               *   Pick v12 from v13
               *   Pick v14 from v15
               *   Pick v16 from v17
           2.  **Place:**
               *   Place v8 at #o2_v8
               *   Place v12 at #o2_v12
               *   Place v14 at #o2_v14
               *   Place v16 at #o2_v16
           
           Easy. Now, let's get to work.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v8 v18 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v12 v18 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v14 v18 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v16 v18 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've received some feedback and I need to reassess my approach. The user's crucial point is that I'm limited to using only the `move_base v3 v3 #o0` action. That's a *very* restrictive constraint. Looking at the goal, which is to have various objects `on(v18)`, I realize the difficulty immediately. I need to get those objects from their initial poses on `v11` to new poses *on* `v18`.
           
           The standard way to do this in similar tasks, based on my understanding, is to use `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate objects. However, with *only* `move_base v3 v3 #o0` at my disposal, I'm completely hamstrung. This move action just moves the robot's base without affecting any objects.
           
           To clarify, I need to make the predicate `atpose(?o, ?p)` true for each object *on* `v18`. That requires changing the poses. But I *can't* change the poses without the object-manipulation actions. The `place` action, which would do this, needs a `pick` action to have been done beforehand to load the object into the gripper, and I can't even pick!
           
           Therefore, with the very limited actions I'm allowed to use, I *can't* achieve the goal. I need to explain to the user why this goal is impossible within the given framework, given the actions available and the fact that I am unable to manipulate any objects in any way.
