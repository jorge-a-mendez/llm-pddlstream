           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom's structure, I recognize that I must satisfy various conditions, notably receiving images and analyses (`receivedimage`, `receivedanalysis`). These necessitate specific actions: taking images (`take_image`), sending images (`send_image`), sampling rocks (`sample_rock`), and sending analyses (`send_analysis`). However, a thorough review of the permissible action instances reveals a critical constraint: only `move` and `drop_rock` operations are allowed. The `move` operations, essentially no-ops in terms of achieving our specific goals, will keep the rovers at their initial positions. The `drop_rock` actions require stores to be full. However, in the initial state, the stores are free, making these `drop_rock` operations infeasible as well. Consequently, I am left with a situation where the required actions to satisfy the goal predicates are not permissible. This leads me to conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* given the restricted action set. The core issue is the absence of any actions that can modify the initial state to create the necessary `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
