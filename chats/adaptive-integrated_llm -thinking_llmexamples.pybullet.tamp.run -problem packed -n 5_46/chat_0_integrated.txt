           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.142, -0.44, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.961, -0.278).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.236, -0.257, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.806, 0.592).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).

           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).

           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.001, 0.258, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.451, 0.892).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.04, 0.428, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.98, -0.197).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Plan to Rearrange Five Objects**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a scenario where I need to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from surface v11 to surface v20. The goal is to get all of them "on" v20, which, as I understand it, means they need to be both supported and at a specific pose on that surface. I have the initial poses for these objects, each one is on v11 at a specific location, like v8 at v9.
           
           My intuition immediately jumps to "pick" and "place" actions. These are the tools of the trade for moving things around.  I'll need to pick each object, move it, and then place it onto v20 at a new, specified pose. However, the initial list of available actions only includes `move_base`. That's a bit of a curveball.  I need to interpret that - does that mean I'm *only* allowed to move the base?  That'd make the task impossible, since I can't directly manipulate the objects.  Typically, in problems like this, I'm expected to construct pick and place actions, *if* the constraints allow, especially if the problem is stated as solving a planning task. I am going to assume I am expected to generate the actions, as that is the normal practice.
           
           Looking at the initial state facts, there are clues to the solution: I have facts like pose(v16, #o2) and supported(v16, #o2, v20). This means that objects can be placed on surface v20 at the same pose `#o2`. This is where I need to think carefully - the problem mentions that if multiple objects *share* the same pose at the beginning, I have to supply a *unique* continuous value for each object. I'll need a unique placement on `#o2` for each object.
           
           I'm given the current locations of the objects and their poses, so the plan is pretty clear: pick, move, place, repeat for each object. The preconditions for my pick and place actions require, among other things, that an object is "at" a particular pose (e.g., atpose(v8, v9)) and is supported by a surface.
           
           To make this plan concrete, I'll define my actions for each object:
           *   **For v8:**
               *   Pick v8 from its current pose v9.
               *   Place v8 at a unique location on v20 I will call #o2_v8.
           *   **For v12:**
               *   Pick v12 from its current pose v13.
               *   Place v12 at a unique location on v20, let's call it #o2_v12.
               *   And so on, for the remaining objects v14, v16, and v18.
           
           Key Challenge - Where to Place Everything?
           
           The trick here is to select valid, non-colliding poses for the objects on v20. Each object needs a specific location on the v20 surface.  I have the AABB of the surface (v20) from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), and the AABBs of the objects are given relative to their current poses. I'll need to figure out stable and safe positions. Based on the given footprints, I am going to assume they are about 0.1m x 0.1m, with the greatest dimensions being approximately this size. If I arrange them into a 3x2 grid, separated by 0.1m, I should be able to create a plan with no collisions.
           
           So, I am going to construct the poses using 0.05m offsets as stable and collision free placements on the table.
           
           Here's the planned placement of each object:
           
           *   v8 will be placed at position (-0.085, 0.085)
           *   v12 will be placed at (0.0, 0.085)
           *   v14 will be placed at (0.085, 0.085)
           *   v16 will be placed at (-0.085, -0.085)
           *   v18 will be placed at (0.0, -0.085)
           
           Here is a general plan, showing the steps:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t_pick_v8

(Thoughts: **The Impasse of Immovable Objects**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My initial plan was a bust because it relied on `pick` and `place` actions, and those aren't on the approved list.  The *only* allowed action instance? `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  Essentially, a pointless base movement, a big fat *nothing* for my purposes.
           
           The objective is clear: get five objects - `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, `v18` - onto the surface `v20`.  Right now, they're all stuck on `v11`.  I understand the logic. I know the available actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, `cook`.  We need to use the right actions to change the on predicates. 
           
           The problem is, the instructions are crystal clear:  "Only use what's on the approved list". And, that list only gives me the no-op move action.
           
           Let's think it through step-by-step. To get `v8` onto `v20`, I'd need to manipulate its pose.  That means I'd be looking at `pick` and `place` actions. I would need to pick `v8` from `v9` and place it at `#o2_v8`. And, this new pose should be supported by `v20`. Those actions are the only ones that can affect the `atpose` and `holding` predicates. The predicates are what's getting me to the goal.
           
           But that's the rub!  `pick` and `place` are *specifically* excluded by the list of authorized action *instances*.  The rule is ironclad. It means I'm stuck with a situation where I can't actually move the objects I need to move.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, this goal is *unreachable*. We are stuck in a logical paradox - a very frustrating limitation that makes this challenge impossible with the given tools.
