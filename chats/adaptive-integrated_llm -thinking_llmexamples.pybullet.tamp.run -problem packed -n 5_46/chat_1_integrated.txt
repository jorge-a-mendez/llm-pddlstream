           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           Object v19 is a pose with position (-0.001, 0.258, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.451, 0.892).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.04, 0.428, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.98, -0.197).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Based on the provided constraints, it's impossible to create a plan that achieves the desired outcome. The goal is to move five specific objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial positions on surface v11 to a target surface, v20.  This necessarily requires the robot to *pick* up the objects from v11 and *place* them on v20.  However, the problem statement explicitly limits the available actions to only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This severely restricts our capabilities.  No other action instances, especially pick and place, are available for the robot to move these objects.  Thus, given the limited action set, changing the objects' `atpose` facts, which are essential for changing the state of the objects as required by the goal `on`, is not possible.  With the current action instance restriction, the robot can only move the base to the same position, effectively doing nothing towards achieving the goal, therefore making it impossible.
