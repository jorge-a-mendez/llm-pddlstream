User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got a target point and need to find three suitable (x, y) base positions for the robot, all within a maximum distance of 2 from the target. The robot's orientation will automatically adjust to face the target.  The entire workspace is a 5x5 square, centered at the origin, meaning x and y coordinates are limited to the range of -2.5 to 2.5.  I have to consider fixed obstacles in the scene, which are provided as Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). I'll also be learning about potentially dynamic obstacles through feedback, but that's not relevant for this initial request.
           
           First, I'll define my operating space:  it's a 5x5 square. I need to figure out which areas within this space are valid for the robot base, considering both the distance constraint to the target and the fixed obstacles.  There's a bunch of AABBs in the scene to watch out for, including the outer boundary of the environment. I'll need to check if any of the candidate positions collide with these AABBs. A point `(px, py)` collides with an AABB `((x1, y1), (x2, y2))` if `x1 <= px <= x2` and `y1 <= py <= y2`.
           
           The key will be generating a diverse set of positions that avoid collisions. I need to find positions that are roughly evenly distributed around the target. A key element will be the vertical divider at x=0. Since the target is on the left of this wall, the robot should typically also be there to avoid it.
           
           Now, I'll go ahead and take the given target point (-1.65, -0.95), and try to find positions to generate three diverse sets of positions. I'll test each set to ensure that they are valid base positions for the robot.
           
           In the first step, I check that the coordinates are valid. The coordinates are within [-2.5, 2.5], and satisfy the distance constraint to the target point within the max range. Then, I need to check the coordinates against the given obstacles to check the validity of each set of coordinates. Each set will have the appropriate (x,y) base coordinates. Then, I can return them to the user.
           
           First candidate: (-0.15, -0.95), Second candidate: (-1.65, 0.55), Third candidate: (-0.59, -2.01).

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **The Analytical Journey to a Potential Position**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan: I've made a key realization - I messed up the target point on the last go-around. Now, it's `(0.581, 2.176)`. And guess what? This little point is *inside* a box! Specifically, obstacle 9 and, even more precisely, obstacle 19.
           
           My intuition says this is a recipe for "no line of sight," but the instructions say *never* give up. So, I'm thinking like a detective, trying to find any possible way to see around the obstacle:
           
           1.  **Below the Target:** Position the robot just below the obstacle (0.581, 1.65). It should be clear of immediate obstructions with the target directly above.
           
           2.  **Left of the Target:** Place the robot to the left of the obstacle (0.15, 2.176). Same deal – hoping to peek around the barrier.
           
           3.  **Right of the Target:** Place the robot slightly to the right of the obstacle (0.85, 2.176). Again, a different angle for a different viewpoint.
           
           The hope is to find a viewpoint from *outside* the larger "block" or *near* its edge where the target can be seen. I made sure to stay on the correct side of the central wall (x = 0) as well.
           
           These points are within the `max_range` and seem clear of the obstacles based on collision checking. The big question is whether "line of sight" is even possible when the target point is *literally* inside an obstacle. But I have to try.
