           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Problem: An Unachievable Goal**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal is a conjunction, meaning all its constituent parts must be met. I've broken down the axiom into its individual components.
           
           Four parts of the axiom are already satisfied in the initial state. However, the rest of the axiom presents a significant challenge: I need to achieve the predicates `receivedimage` for four different objectives and `receivedanalysis` for a stone and soil sample.
           
           To accomplish `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, I need to utilize the `send_image` action. This action's preconditions necessitate that I have previously taken an image using `take_image`, which in turn requires calibration using `calibrate`. I've examined the relevant initial conditions, like visible objects and modes. I've correctly identified that I can use either rover v12 or v14, and I've selected v12 for the purpose of this analysis. I devised a detailed plan of calibrate/take_image/send_image actions for the four objectives.
           
           However, a critical review of the *available actions* has turned up an insurmountable problem: none of the required actions (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, or `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`) are present in this action set. The only options are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions allows me to move closer to my goal of getting an image and analysis.
           
           To complete the goal, I would need to get the rover in a configuration above the rock/soil samples. To do this, I need to get the rover from initial position v13 to #o5 (to be above a stone) and from v15 to #o5. However, there are no actions for this.
           
           Because the only provided actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, and I'm unable to fulfill the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates with those actions, I've concluded that the overall goal `new-axiom@0()` is unachievable from the given initial state.
