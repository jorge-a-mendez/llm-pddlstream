           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unreachable Due to Base Configuration Conflict**
           
           Okay, I've got a problem. The goal is to stack several objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`) onto `v18`. My plan was straightforward: move each object from its current location on `v11` to the desired pose on `v18` using `pick` and `place` actions.  Each object has a known pose on `v18` which is supported by v18. 
           
           The initial state suggests that all the objects are stackable and supported at their respective positions on v11.  The problem lies with the robot's base configuration. All the `kin` predicates, which dictate the robot's valid arm motions, require the base to be at configuration `#o3` for the `pick` and `place` actions. However, the initial state shows the robot base is at `v3`. The only available base motion is a no-op, meaning it can't be moved. The only valid action is the futile move: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This isn't helpful, and there's no way to get from `v3` to the required `#o3`.
           
           Because the necessary base configuration for `pick` and `place` is unattainable, the preconditions for executing those actions cannot be satisfied.  Therefore, I can't move the objects, and the overall goal is currently unsolvable. My only option is to state that the goal is unreachable given the current configuration. I need to explain the conflict: The robot's initial base state is `v3`, but the arm motions `kin` predicates used for `pick` and `place` require `bconf #o3`. There is no plan to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`, therefore the goal can not be achieved given the current configuration.
