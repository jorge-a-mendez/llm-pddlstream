           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My objective is to find a plan to place objects v8, v12, v14, and v16 onto v18. Currently, these objects are supported by v11, supported by their respective poses. In my initial assessment, I've noted the available action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the robot's base but doesn't interact with the objects directly.
           
           The core challenge is that the only allowed action is moving the base, which is insufficient. The goal state requires manipulating the objects' *on* predicates, shifting them from `on(?, v11)` to `on(?, v18)`. Achieving this necessitates `pick` and `place` actions that are not explicitly provided.
           
           To satisfy `on(?o, ?r)`, both `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)` must be true. Currently, for instance, `on(v8, v11)` is true because the supported and atpose conditions are met. I would need to *pick* v8 and *place* it on v18.
           
           However, the provided list of actions is restricted. The only action given is move_base. No other action instances, such as pick or place are permitted, indicating that the problem is unsolvable. I can't modify the `atpose` and `supported` predicates without `pick` and `place`. Therefore, based on the limited available actions, the goal is unattainable.
