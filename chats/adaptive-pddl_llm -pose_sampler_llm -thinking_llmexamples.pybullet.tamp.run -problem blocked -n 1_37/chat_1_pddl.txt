           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object that is both `on v18` and of type `v17`. My first thought is to identify objects with `type v17`.  I see `v12` and `v8` fit the bill. Now, the challenge is getting one of them `on v18`.
           
           I analyze the `on` predicate. I know that `on` means being both supported and at the correct pose.  I find that `v8` is currently on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. To get either on `v18`, I'd need to manipulate their pose, and the available facts suggest a pick and place operation is necessary.
           
           Here's the problem: The ONLY available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That does absolutely nothing to change the positions of objects relevant to the goal.  It just cycles `canmove()` and `atbconf(v3)`.
           
           I delve deeper into the available actions and their preconditions and effects. To *actually* manipulate objects, I would need a `pick` and `place` action, but these are not in the permitted action instances list! This is a severe constraint.
           
           I reassess the initial state. Are there any objects ALREADY on `v18` that satisfy the type requirement?  No. I need something that is both supported on v18 and atpose on v18. No such objects exist in the initial state and are unachievable since no pick/place instance exists.
           
           Given the extremely limited action set, I am forced to conclude that the plan is *unachievable*. Without being able to change the `on` predicates via pick and place, it's impossible to satisfy the goal.  I have to report that this is an infeasible plan.
