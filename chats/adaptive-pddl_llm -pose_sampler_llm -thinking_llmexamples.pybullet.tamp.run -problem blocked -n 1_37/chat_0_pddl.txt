           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for this square object (ID 5, with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07) on surface 0, which is a square with coordinates (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0).  A stable placement means the object, even when rotated, stays entirely within the surface.  Since the problem's worded in terms of an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB), I'm assuming that the object is always treated as an AABB for containment checks, and the `theta` value is just the rotation angle relative to the global coordinate frame.
           
           Given the square geometry of both the object and the surface, and considering that rotations are relevant, I'll go with a strategy that balances efficiency with diversity to ensure proper packing.
           
           First, I'll take 25 placements at `theta = 0`.  This gives me a nice, simple grid.  For this, my AABB is 0.07 x 0.07. Then I'll generate a grid based on the surface area available. The surface available width is (0.6 - 0.07) and height is (0.6 - 0.07), so 0.53. I can place 8 points along both x and y using step size 0.07 because `floor(0.53 / 0.07) + 1= 8`.
           
           The remaining 25 placements will be at `theta = pi/4` radians.  This requires a bit more thought because the AABB enclosing the rotated object will be larger. Its new AABB dimension would be `0.07 * sqrt(2) * 0.07 * sqrt(2)`. The remaining available area now will be (0.6 - 0.07*sqrt(2)). I will find the minimum values for x and y using 0.07 * math.sqrt(2) / 2 and place those values in an x and y grid. I can now place `floor(0.5010 / 0.07 * sqrt(2)) + 1 = 6` points along both x and y.
           
           By generating 50 diverse stable placements on this grid I can complete this requirement. The x and y values for both orientations are determined by the surface min and max values with respective calculations and half sizes.
