(Thoughts: **Finalized Plan for Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, after a thorough analysis, I've constructed the following plan. It's crucial to understand a few key assumptions I had to make based on the given constraints and the specific problem context.
           
           **Assumptions:**
           
           1.  **Limited Movement:** The available actions strongly suggest the rovers (`v12`, `v14`) cannot move from their initial configurations (`v13`, `v15`, respectively). The `move` actions simply reposition rovers to the same config, so the continuous parameters (`#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` which all relate to the current location. So `#o3 = v13, #o0 = v13, #o5 = v13` (for v12).  and `#o3 = v15, #o0 = v15, #o5 = v15` (for v14)
           2.  **Schema Instantiation:** I'm interpreting "available actions" as action *schemas* that I need to instantiate, rather than literal, specific instances. This is a standard PDDL-style interpretation, which allows for the needed actions.
           
           **The Plan:**
           
           **Step 1: Image Acquisition (Using Rover `v12`):**
           
           We will take images with rover `v12` as it is already configured correctly for it.
           
           1.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2.  `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           4.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)`
           5.  `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           6.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           7.  `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10)`
           8.  `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v19, v10, v11)`
           9.  `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v19, v11)`
           10. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v20, v10)`
           11. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v20, v10, v11)`
           12. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v20, v11)`
           
           **Step 2: Analysis (Using Both Rovers):**
           
           13.  `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`  (Samples stone `v1` using rover `v12`)
           14.  `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           15.  `drop_rock(v12, v16)`
           16.  `sample_rock(v14, #o5, v5, v16)`  (Samples soil `v5` using rover `v14`)
           17.  `send_analysis(v14, #o0, #o1, v9, v5)`
           18.  `drop_rock(v14, v16)`
           
           **Outcome:** This sequence will ensure that the final state satisfies all the conditions required by the `new-axiom@0()` goal. The imagery and analytical goals are met.
           
           I am confident that this is a sound plan, *given* the implicit interpretations I made.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Problem: Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, I see the issue now. I completely overlooked the constraint on allowed action instances in my previous attempt. I need to re-evaluate this strictly based on those constraints.
           
           The allowed actions are only `move` (which, effectively, is a no-op as the configurations don't change), and `drop_rock`.  I need to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires a series of `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates to be true.
           
           I have established that in the initial state, I have `atconf(v12,v13)`, `atconf(v14,v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, but I have *no* `receivedimage` facts or `receivedanalysis` facts.
           
           Given the allowed actions:  I can't take images, sample rocks, or analyze anything because the necessary actions like `take_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` are *not* permitted. Therefore, achieving the parts of the goal relating to `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are impossible under the current constraints.
           
           Furthermore, the only state change possible comes from `drop_rock` actions, but they require `full(v12, v16)` or `full(v14, v16)` to be true, and in the initial state, I have the opposite, `free`. Even if they *were* applicable, they would only change `full` to `free` which, in the initial state is already `free` as I need. However, `drop_rock` actions can't even be executed.
           
           Consequently, because I lack the necessary actions to fulfill the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` requirements and the `drop_rock` actions themselves cannot be executed in the initial state, I conclude that the goal is currently *unachievable* within the given parameters and constraints. I need to explicitly state that the goal cannot be reached.
