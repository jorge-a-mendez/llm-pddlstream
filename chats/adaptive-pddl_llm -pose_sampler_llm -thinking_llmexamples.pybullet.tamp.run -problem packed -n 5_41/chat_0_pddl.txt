(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on a square surface. The surface is centered at the origin, with dimensions  `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. The object, also square, has a side length of approximately 0.0893766. A placement is defined by the surface index (0), rotation angle `theta`, and the object's center coordinates (x, y).
           
           Since the object is square, its rotated effective bounding box is always a square.  The rotation angle influences the effective size of this bounding box.  Specifically, the half-side length, which I'll call `h_s`, is `s/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `s` is the object's side length. This means `h_s` varies from a minimum of `s/2` at `theta = 0` (or multiples of pi/2) to a maximum of `s/sqrt(2)` at `theta = pi/4` (or pi/4 + k*pi/2).
           
           To generate a diverse set of placements, I've selected two key angles.  At `theta = 0`, the object has its smallest effective bounding box, resulting in a larger available placement area. At `theta = pi/4`, it has the largest effective bounding box. For each of these angles, I've calculated the permissible ranges for x and y, ensuring the object remains fully within the surface. I then create 5x5 grid of `(x, y)` coordinates within those ranges, covering both edges and the center, generating 25 placements per angle, resulting in a total of 50 placements.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable and Collision-Free Placements for Object ID 7**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to place this new square object, ID 7, on Surface 0 without any collisions with the already-placed object, ID 5. We've got the dimensions for both objects, and we know Object 5's successful placement. Since they're both squares, the math is simplified by using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs).
           
           First, I calculated the AABB for Object 5, remembering its successful placement.  I determined that Object 5 occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface.  This means Object 7 can't be *placed in that corner* or there would be a collision.
           
           Now, considering Object 7, I need to find the allowed range for *x* and *y* coordinates based on Surface 0's boundaries. I calculated the min and max half-side lengths for Object 7, depending on its rotation angle (theta).
           
           The main idea is: find locations such that an AABB *around* Object 7 *does not* intersect the AABB for Object 5.  This simplifies to *not* having the right or bottom side of Object 7's AABB inside the left or top side of Object 5's AABB.
           
           I've decided to use two key angles for Object 7's rotation: 0 radians and pi/4 radians.  I'll generate a grid of potential locations, and then I'll filter out any that collide with Object 5. I calculated the *exact* threshold in `x` and `y` where the collision avoidance should begin. Then I created a 10x10 grid covering all the feasible (stable) region for these angles, and I will filter the points based on the no-collision constraint. The grid is generated with a uniform distribution, covering the safe region, and so the code should pick the most uniformly-distributed 25 points.
           
           This approach ensures a robust, collision-free placement strategy.
