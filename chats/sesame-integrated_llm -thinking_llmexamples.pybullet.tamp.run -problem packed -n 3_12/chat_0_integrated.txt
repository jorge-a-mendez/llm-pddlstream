           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Object Placement**
           
           My primary goal is to strategically move three objects (v8, v12, and v14) from surface v11 to surface v16, ensuring they end up in the desired "on" relationship. The robot, equipped with two arms (v4 and v6, currently handempty), is at base configuration v3. The objects begin at poses v9, v13, and v15, respectively, all located on v11.
           
           The foundational concept is that I need to establish "atpose" for each object on v16, where they will be supported by the surface. To that end, "atpose" is a necessary precondition. As instructed in the problem statement, I've interpreted that since all three objects share the same symbolic pose object `#o2` and `#o2` is defined in the initial state, I must consider it a *placeholder* for the final continuous poses. Therefore, I will need to define a *different* continuous value for each object-surface combination using the same symbol `#o2` as a reference.
           
           The plan I devised will execute the following steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  First, I must move the robot to base configuration `#o3` because the available `kin` predicates for arm v4 require this configuration for all pick and place actions.  This will involve a `move_base` action.
           
           2.  **Pick and Place Operations (v8):**
               *   Pick v8 from v9 (on v11). I intend to use arm v4 for this operation.
               *   Place v8 at a new continuous pose, using  `#o2` as a placeholder  `#p_v8` which is on surface v16.
           
           3.  **Pick and Place Operations (v12):**
               *   Pick v12 from v13 (on v11) with arm v4.
               *   Place v12 at a new continuous pose on v16, using  `#o2` as a placeholder `#p_v12`.
           
           4.  **Pick and Place Operations (v14):**
               *   Pick v14 from v15 (on v11) with arm v4.
               *   Place v14 at a new continuous pose on v16, using  `#o2` as a placeholder `#p_v14`.
           
           To ensure safe and feasible placements on v16, I've carefully considered potential collisions. Initial object locations on v11 are separated. v16 is described as  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I plan to arrange the objects along the y-axis of v16, with the object centers at:
           
           *   v8: (0.0, -0.08, 0.831, 0.0)
           *   v12: (0.0, 0.0, 0.831, 0.0)
           *   v14: (0.0, 0.08, 0.831, 0.0)
           
           These coordinates will ensure that all objects remain within the bounds of v16. I am assuming 0.831 is the z value. I am assuming the objects are 0.1m high and the table is 0.781m high (as that is the value of the poses in the initial state). This will ensure I satisfy the geometry.
           
           The final plan will be as follows:
           
           1.  `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`
           2.  `pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           3.  `place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           4.  `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           5.  `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           6.  `pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           7.  `place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`
           
           This sequence of actions, coupled with the specified pose values, should successfully achieve the goal of placing the objects on surface v16. I will then provide the required `--Poses--:` section to meet the continuous parameters:
           
           ```
