           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, two landers, v9, several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8), and objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20). There is one camera, v10, which is onboard both rovers. There is also a store v16 available for both rovers. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to:
           `atconf(v12, v13)`
           `atconf(v14, v15)`
           `free(v12, v16)`
           `free(v14, v16)`
           `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v19, v11)`
           `receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           `type(?stone, v2)` (implicit from type(v3,v2), type(v4,v2), type(v1,v2))
           `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (meaning received analysis for at least one rock of type v2)
           `type(?soil, v6)` (implicit from type(v8,v6), type(v7,v6), type(v5,v6))
           `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (meaning received analysis for at least one rock of type v6)
           
           Let's break down the goal:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: Both rovers are already at their initial configurations.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: Both rovers currently have free storage v16.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: This requires taking images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) with mode v11 and sending them.
           4. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This requires sampling a rock of type v2 (e.g., v1, v3, or v4) and sending its analysis.
           5. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This requires sampling a rock of type v6 (e.g., v5, v7, or v8) and sending its analysis.
           
           The available actions are extremely limited, only `move` and `drop_rock`. This means the provided initial state must contain all the necessary preconditions for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis` if they are to be used. Since these actions are not in the allowed action instances list, the goal `new-axiom@0()` must be achievable without explicitly using them. This implies that the initial state must contain the post-conditions of those actions or the goal is unachievable with the given constraints.
           
           Looking at the initial state and the goal:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - For `receivedimage(...)` and `receivedanalysis(...)`, these are typically effects of `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, neither `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, nor `send_analysis` are in the allowed actions. This means that if these `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates are not true in the initial state, the goal is unreachable.
           
           Let's re-examine the `new-axiom@0()` definition provided in the problem description, not the one from the generated list of axioms. The problem description gives these axioms:
           
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v20, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           And also the following:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v20, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)
               Atom free(v12, v16)
               Atom free(v14, v16)
               Atom receivedimage(v17, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v18, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v19, v11)
               Atom receivedimage(v20, v11)
               Atom type(?stone, v2)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           These are identical axioms. This looks like a copy-paste error in the problem description, and the goal `new-axiom@0()` refers to this conjunction.
           
           Crucially, the initial state *does not* contain `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedimage(v19, v11)`, `receivedimage(v20, v11)`, nor `receivedanalysis(?stone)` or `receivedanalysis(?soil)` for any rock.
           Since the actions that produce these states (`send_image` and `send_analysis`) are not available in the allowed action instances, it is impossible to achieve the goal from the given initial state. The only available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, which do not lead to the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates becoming true. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
