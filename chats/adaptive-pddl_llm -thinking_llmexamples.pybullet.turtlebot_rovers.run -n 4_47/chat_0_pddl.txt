           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to getting some images and doing some rock analyses, then getting those results.  Let's walk through it.
           
           First, I looked at the definition of `new-axiom@0()`.  I needed to establish facts related to image reception (`receivedimage`) and rock analysis (`receivedanalysis`).  The initial state already has some of the preconditions, like the rovers being in certain configurations.
           
           To get the images, I needed to figure out how to satisfy `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`. The PDDL setup suggests using a `send_image` action. The prerequisites for this action include `haveimage` which can be achieved through a `take_image` action. To `take_image`, I first need `calibrated`, so I need to `calibrate`. This also needs rovers to be in the correct configurations to support taking and sending the images. So I thought about using both rovers, `v12` and `v14`, but both are at certain configurations in the initial state. Because `v12` could use its camera, I wanted to focus on getting `v12` to take pictures from a specific configuration, while `v14` could stay at its initial spot. So, I created a plan: use `v12` to calibrate, take the images, and send them. After taking the image, I then decided to move to getting `v12` to do rock analysis.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis`, I need to use `send_analysis`. To use this I need `analyzed` which I can do using `sample_rock`. To do `sample_rock` the rover needs to be in a good configuration. So, I found a rock of type `v2` (like `v1`) and a rock of type `v6` (like `v5`). Then, I will run the sample on rock `v1` and then run `send_analysis`, then run a drop rock and run this on rock `v5`.
           
           **The problem is that the set of allowed actions is extremely limited.** My well-laid plan relies on several actions: `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, **none** of these are in the list of valid action instances I was given. The only actions I *am* allowed to use are `move` (which does nothing meaningful in this setup because the start and goal positions are identical) and `drop_rock`. To be able to `drop_rock`, I would need the `full` precondition to be true and the only `full` fact is after the first `sample_rock`. So, I would have to have a sample rock before using `drop_rock`, but since the `sample_rock` is not listed, I cannot get a full value in the first place.
           
           **Therefore, given the constraint of only a severely limited set of allowed actions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable*.** The necessary actions to generate the required facts for the goal are simply not available to me.
