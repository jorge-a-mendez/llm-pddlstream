User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions approximately 5x5, centered at (0,0). There's a vertical wall/obstacle at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, including two large L-shaped obstacles in the bottom-left quadrant (obstacles 6 and 16 seem to be part of a larger structure) and several smaller rectangular obstacles that might represent tables or shelves. There are also some small obstacles near the top wall and the right wall. Obstacles 7-10, 17-22 are near the top wall. Obstacles 11-14 are in the top-right quadrant. Obstacle 15 is in the bottom-right quadrant.
           I will attempt to find base positions that are within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not directly in line with any obvious obstacles to the target point. I'll try to find positions on different sides of the target point to provide a diverse set of options.
           
           Target point: (0.7 0.7)
           
           Positions:
           (0.7 2.5)
           (0.7 -1.3)
           (2.5 0.7)
