           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects and their properties, including stackability, graspability, and initial poses. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are initially handempty. `v3` is the initial base configuration. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. The axiom states that `?green` is `v12` or `v8` or `v15` by substitution. The initial state contains `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. The objects `v8` and `v12` are currently on `v11` and `v14` respectively, as `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)` are true, and `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)` are true. Therefore, to achieve the goal, either `v8` or `v12` needs to be placed on `v18`. Since there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, and the only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which does not change the position of `v8` or `v12`, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`. Therefore, we need to achieve either `on(v12, v18)` or `on(v8, v18)`. This requires picking up `v12` or `v8` and placing it on `v18`. However, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available in the provided list of valid action instances. The only available action is `move_base`, which only changes the robot's base configuration and does not affect the position of other objects. Thus, the goal cannot be achieved.
