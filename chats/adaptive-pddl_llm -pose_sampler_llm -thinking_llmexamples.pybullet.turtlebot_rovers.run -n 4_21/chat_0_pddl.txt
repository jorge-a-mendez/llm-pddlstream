User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, here's the situation. I need to find three suitable locations for robot bases to reach a specific target point.  This is the first time I'm doing this for this particular target, so I'm only dealing with the fixed obstacles, no learned knowledge yet. The target has to be reachable, with the robot bases no more than two units away and staying within the workspace bounds: x=[-2.5, 2.5], y=[-2.5, 2.5]. I need to consider collisions and ensure a clear line of sight to the target.
           
           The primary constraint is the room layout itself. There's a large rectangular boundary and a vertical wall at x=0. The workspace is essentially split into two "rooms".  Since the target is located in the right room (x > 0), any robot base also needs to be located in the right room (x > 0).
           
           Let's break down the key obstacles. The walls:
           *   **Bounding Box**: From (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5).
           *   **Vertical Wall**: located at x=0
           *   **Other Obstacles**: I am aware of other small obstacles in the right room.
           
           The target point itself is at (0.1989, -1.9406).
           
           I will now generate possible positions, starting with the goal to be within a 2-unit radius of the target.
           Here are the candidate locations:
           
           1.  **Position 1:**  A location directly to the right of the target at (2.0, -1.9406), ensuring it's not blocked by other obstacles by analyzing the x and y ranges. This maintains a clear line of sight.
           
           2.  **Position 2:**  A position directly above the target point at (0.1989, -0.0406), checking that the y coordinate satisfies the y boundaries, and the absence of obstacles along the vertical line.
           
           3.  **Position 3:**  A position close to the central wall and above the target, so (0.05, 0.0539). The point is in line of sight.
           
           I've carefully considered the workspace limits, the central wall, and potential collisions with the smaller obstacles. These three positions offer a good diversity for coverage of the target: one directly right, one top, and one to the left near the central wall.  All three are within the required distance and are within the allowed x and y ranges. They all are clear lines of sight to the target and avoid the obstacles.
