           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My goal here is to find 50 stable placements for an object on a given surface.** The object's almost-square dimensions are `0.089 x 0.089`, and the surface is a square centered at the origin with side length `0.27`.  A placement is stable if the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains *fully within* the surface's boundaries.
           
           I need to determine the surface index (which will always be 0), the rotation angle (`theta`), and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center for each placement.  Since the object is almost square, I'll use the most common orientations: 0 and pi/2 radians (90 degrees).
           
           First, I calculated the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x and y) for the two orientations. The x and y range are `-0.09049` to `0.09049`.
           
           Then, I will use a 5x5 grid of `(x, y)` coordinates, calculated using the precise dimensions. I'll use the precise dimensions: `x_coords = [-0.09048998005660326, -0.04524499002830163, 0.0, 0.04524499002830163, 0.09048998005660326]` and  `y_coords = [-0.09048998005660324, -0.04524499002830162, 0.0, 0.04524499002830162, 0.09048998005660324]` to generate 5 x 5 (x,y) coordinates.
           For each of these (x, y) pairs, I'll place the object at angle 0 and angle pi/2, for a total of 50 stable placements. I will generate a list of (0, `theta`, `x`, `y`) tuples, where theta is either 0 or pi/2.
           
           I need to make sure I'm using the proper bounds based on the angle so the object is fully contained within the surface, because the exact shape and size of the object, plus its orientation, matter. I will use the highly precise dimensions when determining the proper bounds. I can now proceed to produce the tuples.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've got the feedback on object ID 5. Now, I need to figure out where to place object ID 6 without it bumping into anything already fixed in place, especially object 5.  Object 5 is stuck in the lower-left corner of the surface. I know its position is about `(-0.09, -0.09)`, and it's a bit less than 0.1 wide.
           
           Object 6, a perfect square, is a tad under 0.1 in width.  I need to make sure this new object doesn't collide with the fixed object 5, and I've got this whole surface as my playground, which runs from about `-0.135` to `0.135` in both the x and y directions.
           
           I'm starting by looking at the case where I don't rotate object 6, a rotation of zero. This simplifies things and gives me the smallest possible AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for the object, which is useful for checking. For any rotation 'theta', the AABB will change as it's a square. I'll need to account for this.
           
           For now, I can see I've got some space, except for the area blocked by object 5. So, I calculated the forbidden zone (it's in the lower-left).  I calculated the exact ranges to keep object 6 from banging into object 5.  This means I need to make sure the center of object 6 doesn't end up less than `0.0035` in x or less than `0.0035` in y.
           
           I'll start with 0 and pi/2 and pick a grid of points on the surface, but I'll skip over anything where the potential object will overlap with the range of object 5. The points need to be far enough away from the lower left to avoid the already-placed obstacle. I know I have 48 good spots in this case.
           
           To get to 50, I'll use rotation `pi/8` and calculate the bounding box for that rotation. The same check for collision with object 5 applies. I need to make sure object 6's AABB doesn't have an x or y center less than about 0.0186. So that means I can place it at the furthest corners of its allowed space. I'll add those two spots, and I'll be good to go.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan to find 50 stable placements for object 4, ensuring no collisions with previously placed objects (5 and 6) on surface 0:**
           
           1.  **Analyze the Constraints:** I've carefully reviewed the request, object dimensions, and surface boundaries. Object 4 is nearly square. The goal is to place it without overlap, and this requires checking against the bounding boxes (AABBs) of objects 5 and 6.
           
           2.  **Determine the Safe Zones:**  I calculated the AABBs for objects 5 and 6. Then, I identified the area where object 4 can be placed *without* colliding. Based on the objects' position, only placing the object to the right of object 6 (and above object 5) prevents collision. This limits object 4's x-coordinate, and therefore significantly reduces the available surface area.
           
           3.  **Create a Grid for the Valid Placements:** Based on the placement constraints, I decided to use a grid of points within the feasible region. This ensures a systematic and thorough exploration of possible stable placements. The grid will have 5 rows and 10 columns, generating 50 distinct x-y coordinate pairs. All placements will have a theta of 0.
           
           4.  **Populate Grid coordinates:** Finally, I calculated all coordinates.
