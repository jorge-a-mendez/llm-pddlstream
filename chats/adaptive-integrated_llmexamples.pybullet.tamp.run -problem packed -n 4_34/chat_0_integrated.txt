           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.069, 0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.946, -0.325).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.233, 0.135, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.071, 0.997).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.276, -0.533), (-0.194, -0.451)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.126, 0.321), (-0.031, 0.416)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.02, 0.384), (0.118, 0.482)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.193, 0.095), (0.272, 0.175)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.235, -0.492, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.636, 0.772).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.078, 0.368, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.509, 0.861).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene consists of four graspable objects: v8, v12, v14, and v16. These objects are currently at various poses on surface v11. The goal is to place all four objects on surface v18. The only available action instance is a `move_base` action that moves the robot from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This means the robot's base will not move from its initial position. The problem states that only the `move_base` action is available, which implies that no picking or placing actions are currently possible. Since the goal requires moving objects, and no pick or place actions are available, the goal is not achievable.
