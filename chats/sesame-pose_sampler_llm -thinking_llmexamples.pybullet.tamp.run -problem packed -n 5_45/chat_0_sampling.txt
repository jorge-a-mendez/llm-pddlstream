(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation for Object ID 8**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 8 on a square surface. This means the object, also square, must be fully within the surface's boundaries after applying rotation and translation.
           
           The object's dimensions and the surface's size are known. The surface is quite spacious compared to the object, giving me some breathing room. I need to make sure the object's center is within the surface bounds, taking into account how the object's effective size changes when it's rotated. I'll need to calculate this "half-width" for the rotated object.
           
           The object is square, so its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is square at any rotation. I know that if the angle of the object to the surface edge is 0 or π/2, then I have the largest allowable translations for x and y of the object. For the 0 degrees orientation, I can pick a few values like `0, 0.09, -0.09, 0.045, -0.045`, so I ensure I cover both positive and negative values. I can repeat this for the pi/8 angle, by picking values that are a little more restricted by how much rotation there is.
           
           I need to make sure that none of these will collide. Since this is the first item requested, no collisions would exist. Since there are no prior objects, there's no collision concern.
           
           I have it! I'll generate a grid of positions with both orientations and use those points as the center of the object to see if there are any that have no collisions and are a part of my 50. I have the angles, 0 and pi/8. For each angle, I will select 5 x and 5 y coordinates. In the end, the placement will be stored as (surf_idx, theta, x, y), which I can use.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got to place this new object (ID 4) on Surface 0, which is a square.  I've already got Object 8 placed there, and that's now a fixed obstacle.  I've analyzed the extents and dimensions and have the following considerations.
           
           **First**, I need to keep Object 4 within the boundaries of Surface 0. That's my "containment" check. I figured out the usable area, considering the object's half-size.
           
           **Second**, I absolutely *must* avoid collision with Object 8. It is fixed and already placed at (0, 0, 0, 0). Object 8's AABB is easy, and I’ve calculated its AABB. Object 4 is a square, and the critical thing is that, to be safe, I need to keep Object 4 far enough away from Object 8 on *all* sides.
           
           Here's the problem: if I rotate Object 4, even just a little bit from the axis-aligned position, its AABB gets bigger. This larger AABB means that if I place the object near the obstacle, the overlap will happen!  So, after testing a few rotations, I've concluded that the only way to avoid collision and stay within the bounds is to place Object 4 with a rotation of 0.
           
           So, I'm sticking with placing Object 4 axis-aligned.  I've found specific placement ranges. I will use the horizontal strip placements, top and bottom strips, and both sides of the obstacle to guarantee sufficient non-overlap. The surface is small, so only placements that are either left, right, top or bottom relative to the fixed obstacle will work.
           
           I then generated a set of 50 different placements within these narrow strips to fulfill the placement requirement. These axis-aligned placements will work.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Detailed Analysis**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of this new object (ID 5) on surface 0. This surface is defined as a square, specifically from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Two existing obstacles are in the scene: Object 8 (a square at (0, 0, 0) and Object 4 (at (0, 0, -0.0865)). These obstacles are key.  The object I'm placing is a square with side lengths of ~0.09577.  My goal is to find valid x, y, and theta (rotation) parameters for these 50 instances, ensuring they don't collide with the existing objects and stay within the surface limits.
           
           First, I define my constraints: I've got to stay within the surface boundary and avoid collisions.  I establish a helper value, `h_5(theta)`, as the AABB half-extent of Object 5 based on rotation. If I set theta = 0 or theta = pi/2, the object's AABB size is exactly the same because this shape is a square.  So, I calculate the valid x and y bounds when theta = 0, taking into account the surface bounds: `x_5` and `y_5` have to be in the range of `[-0.087115, 0.087115]`.
           
           Now, collision avoidance.  I have to ensure my object doesn't overlap the AABBs of Object 8 and Object 4.  If theta = 0, the math simplifies, so that's where I start.  I've done the AABB vs AABB calculations to derive the regions where I could place the object.
           
           I analyzed placement constraints when theta = 0.  I discovered that when Object 5 is to the left of Object 8, it will collide with Object 4; to the right of Object 8, Object 5 will not collide with Object 4; below Object 8 and above Object 8 will not cause a collision with Object 4 if certain other conditions are met. I came up with specific areas to place the object:
           *   **Region A**: x = 0.0865, and y is any value in the bounds.
           *   **Region B'**: y = -0.0865 and x can be various values
           *   **Region C'**: y = 0.0865 and x can be various values
           
           This creates 66 distinct placements; more than I need.
           Because `theta=0` is essentially the same as `theta=pi/2` I can use those values for `theta`.  I'll just alternate the values of `theta` to get 50 objects in total.
           
           I need to confirm the safety of the proposed locations:
           *   I will place the object in region A using various values for y to get 33 objects.
           *   I will place the object in regions B' and C'. 
           *   I can also place it using theta = pi/2 using these exact coordinates.
           
           The total placement set will allow for 50 placements.

           First, I define my workspace: surface 0 is a square area. Then, I define the obstacles, object 8, object 4, and object 5, noting their positions and sizes as AABBs.
           
           To place object 7, I need its AABB and, for simplicity, I will only consider `theta = 0` (axis-aligned).  I calculated the AABB (half-extent is 0.03588). 
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Surface Containment:** To be valid, object 7's center must be within a slightly smaller square than the surface bounds, to account for object 7's size.
           2.  **Collision Avoidance:**  The key is to ensure object 7's AABB doesn't overlap any of the other object's AABBs.
           
           Given the existing obstacles, I'll restrict object 7's center to an x/y coordinate pair, I need to compute the safe regions in x and y dimensions.
           With my constraints, I calculate the `x_min_surf_7, x_max_surf_7, y_min_surf_7, y_max_surf_7`,  where `x_7, y_7` is within `[-0.09912, 0.09912]`.
           
           **Collision Avoidance (theta=0):**
           
           *   **Object 8:** To avoid object 8, `x_7` must be outside `[-0.07396, 0.07396]` and/or `y_7` outside the same bounds.
           *   **Object 4:** To avoid object 4, `x_7 >= -0.00258` and/or `y_7` outside the range `[-0.08392, 0.08392]`
           *   **Object 5:** To avoid object 5, `x_7 <= 0.00274` and/or `y_7` must be outside the range `[-0.16376, 0.00376]`
           
           I've determined that due to the arrangement of the obstacles, a simple axis-aligned placement may be hard and thus, I have analyzed the scene.
           
           I have broken the regions into regions:
           
           *   **Region A:** Top Right: `(0.074, 0.099)`.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My Primary Goal: To Place a New Object (ID 6) 50 Times, While Adhering to Rules, Even if it's Not Possible.**
           
           Here's the situation I'm facing, as I understand it: I must place a square object (ID 6) of size `0.098` on a square surface (ID 0) of size `(-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)`.  I need to avoid collisions with four other objects that have already been placed: ID 8, ID 4, ID 5, and ID 7.  The key problem is that Object 8 is centrally located, and the placement area remaining after considering object 8 is smaller than object 6 itself.
           
           **The Geometry Tells Me: It's Impossible with the Rules:**
           My initial thought is to place the object axis-aligned, with `theta = 0`. I calculate the necessary AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for the new object and compare it against the bounds of the surface and the AABBs of the other objects. My analysis leads me to a geometric conclusion: **It's impossible to place this object on the surface without it colliding with Object 8.** Even by rotating the object, the bounding box becomes larger, worsening the situation. 
           
           **I Must Proceed, Despite the Impossibility.**
           The instructions explicitly state that I must provide 50 placements, even when collisions are probable. I can't quit and I must "never give up".
           
           **My Strategy: Fulfilling the Requirement by Making *Almost* Valid Placements**
           Given that a strict, collision-free solution seems impossible, my strategy becomes generating positions as close to the valid region.
           I will focus on placing the object within the surface bounds, at `theta = 0`, and attempt to place the object far away from all other objects. It is more likely to overlap with object 8 (The object on the center).
           I will distribute the locations across the surface. This is the only way to adhere to the given instructions.
