           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` stacked on `v16`.  The initial state shows them resting on `v11`, supported by it.  The key here is that to get them onto `v16`, I'm going to need a series of pick and place operations. That's a given.
           
           The action instances are severely limited.  The only one I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move_base action, from a configuration to itself,  is immediately a red flag. It's essentially a no-op that burns a "canmove" token.
           
           Looking at the preconditions for the pick action, I need a kinematic solution (`kin`) which isn't provided.  I also require that I'm at the correct base configuration and have an empty hand. The place action needs the grasp from the pick, and it also requires a safe position for the place operation on v16.  This also isn't readily available.
           
           The problem? The kinematic solutions I need to pick and place (the `kin` facts) are missing. Without them, I can't use pick and place actions, and the goal is, by the rules stated, unreachable.  The move_base action doesn't affect the spatial relationships, which are the core of achieving the on goal.
           
           Furthermore, the canmove tokens are burned by the move_base action instance and this makes it impossible to utilize pick and place actions, which both produce them.
           
           Essentially, I'm constrained to using an action that doesn't change the problem, and there's no way to manipulate the objects from their original positions onto `v16`. Therefore, this is an unsolvable problem given the limited actions.  The action instance restriction is absolute. There is no solution.
