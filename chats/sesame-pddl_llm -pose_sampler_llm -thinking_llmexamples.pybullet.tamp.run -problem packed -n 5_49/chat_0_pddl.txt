(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) with side length `s = 0.09485` on a square surface extending from `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`. The key challenge is to consider all possible rotations of the object.
           
           Since both the object and the surface are squares, I can simplify the approach. For a given rotation `theta`, the effective width (`W_eff`) and height (`H_eff`) of the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) become `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  Due to the symmetry of the object, `W_eff` and `H_eff` will always be equal. I can maximize this value at `theta = pi/4` to ensure that it fits in the space.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll take these steps:
           
           1.  **Rotation:** I'll use 10 distinct angles evenly spaced from 0 to `2pi` (exclusive). This ensures that I get a range of orientations.
           2.  **Position within the Surface:** For each rotation, I'll identify the valid region within the surface where the object's center can be placed while fully contained within the surface's boundary.
           3.  **Specific Positions:** I'll place the object in 5 different positions within this valid region: the center of the valid region, and the four corners of it. These positions ensures wide surface coverage.
           
           This strategy will result in exactly 50 placements (10 rotations \* 5 positions per rotation), each stable by design. All placements will be on surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable and Collision-Free Placements for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got this square object, ID 6, that I need to place on surface 0 without it colliding with the already placed object, ID 5. Object 5 is right in the center, and I need to come up with 50 valid placements. The goal is to generate positions that satisfy both stability (being fully within the surface) and non-collision conditions.
           
           I've already calculated some key values: object 6's side length (`s6`) and the dimensions of surface 0. I also know object 5's bounding box and effective bounding boxes, which depends on its rotation.
           
           First, I figured out the safe zone for object 6's center, considering just the surface boundaries and then calculated collision zone from the placement of object 5. My initial intuition was to put object 6 into the corners or the edges. But I quickly realized that simply choosing coordinates can result in collisions, as rotations and object shapes can change the "effective" collision zone.
           
           I explored the collision zone calculations with rotations and AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box). The effective bounding box of object 6 varies with rotation. Then, I needed to check if those regions can fit within surface 0 and still avoiding object 5. This got complex, especially with varying rotations. I needed to avoid the AABB of object 5.
           
           I figured out I should ensure no collisions by calculating the valid placement region. Basically, if there's no overlap in either x or y dimensions, there will be no collision. This helps to determine the minimum and maximum coordinates.
           
           Then I realized that angles like `pi/4` will not fit, because the object will have to go into collision-zone if rotated. It became clear that only rotations at multiples of `pi/2` (90 degrees, i.e., 0, pi/2, pi and 3pi/2) are guaranteed to provide valid locations, because the object stays aligned with the coordinate axes.
           
           I simplified things a bit: calculated the non-overlapping x and y boundaries, and figured out I could get 8 points for each valid angle. These 8 points cover all sides and corners of non-colliding regions. This will allow for 32 placements. I need 50.
           
           I expanded this to include small offsets from the axis-aligned rotations, for example, `0.1` radians, but after more detailed analysis, it ended up giving the same boundaries as before, due to the nature of the shape, boundary limits and size.
           
           I have finalized the selection, 56 placements using 7 angles that are close to the axis-aligned angles, by taking small offsets from these 4.
           With this approach, I can consistently get 50 placements that satisfy both constraints and provide a good degree of variety in placement. This is the optimal solution for these conditions.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan for placing the new object, broken down in a way that makes sense to my expert eye.**
           
           I'm tasked with placing a new object (ID 4) onto a surface (Surface 0) avoiding collisions with two existing objects (IDs 5 and 6). I need to generate 50 stable placements. I have all the geometric information - sizes, positions, and surface boundaries. I know that Surface 0 is a square, and I need to account for rotations when I calculate how the AABB changes.
           
           First, I define my boundaries. I know surface 0 is a square defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I'll use the surface half width (`surf_half = 0.135`) for calculations.  Object 5 is at the origin, and I can quickly work with its AABB. Object 6 is off-center at  `(0.0912124906816028, 0.0912124906816028)`.
           
           My main constraint is that Object 4 must be entirely within the surface bounds, and that it doesn't collide with Objects 5 or 6.  I know that for a square object, the Effective Width/Height changes with rotation. I calculate this as `W_eff = H_eff = s4 * (|cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)|)`, where `s4` is the object's size. I know I have to keep the center of the Object 4 at `(x, y)` such that its AABB doesn't overlap Obj 5 or Obj 6.
           
           To avoid a collision with Object 5, I just have to place the center far enough away. Easy.  To avoid a collision with object 6, I have to ensure its AABB does not overlap. I simplify it by defining "forbidden zones." The forbidden region around Obj 5 is, to be really safe, I make sure the center of the new object is at least `OUTER_AVOID_5 = s5_half + W_eff/2 = 0.086606`. I compute a lot of intermediate values: center offset for Obj 5 and the center location to avoid a collision.
           
           Since I am considering all angles to place this object (theta),  I realize that placing an object at pi/4 is going to cause the smallest surface area. I therefore create a set of points for theta=0, theta = pi/2, theta = pi, and theta = 3pi/2. I have to think about this in the terms of horizontal and vertical strips because there will be many overlapping collision checks.
           
           Then I get into defining collision free quadrants that will give me good diversity in terms of placements.
           
           After some analysis, I realize that it's challenging to create a strategy that works for all rotations, but I can get a diverse set of positions if I use specific angles that align with horizontal and vertical, with enough offset. I compute a series of horizontal and vertical placements that consider the offsets necessary and then provide the point for each one, such as the bottom-left corner and others, and ensure there is no collision in the x or y direction, and also ensure the points are spread out and valid. I can define 50 points by working through this process.
