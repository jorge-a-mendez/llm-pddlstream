           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, `v3` through `v18`, along with continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o1`, and `#o2`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and is initially at base configuration `v3`. Both arms are handempty and at their respective home configurations. There are three graspable and stackable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. These objects are currently at specific poses on various surfaces. For example, `v8` is at `v9` supported by `v11`, `v12` is at `v13` supported by `v14`, and `v15` is at `v16` supported by `v11`. There are also facts indicating that these objects can be placed at pose `#o2` supported by `v10` and `v18`.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing the state where `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. Also, we know `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`. This means `v8` or `v12` can be the `?green` object in the axiom. To achieve `on(?green, v18)`, we need to place either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18` at some pose.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not change the state of any object in terms of its location or properties, other than the `canmove()` predicate which is already true. It merely moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, which is effectively a no-op in terms of achieving the goal.
           
           There are no `pick` or `place` actions available, which would be necessary to move `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. Therefore, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
