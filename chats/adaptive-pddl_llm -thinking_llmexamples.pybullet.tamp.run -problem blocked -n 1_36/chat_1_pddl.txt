           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the Problem**
           
           My goal is to achieve the state described by `new-axiom@0`, which requires having an object that is both of a specific `type` and `on` a particular object (`v18`).  I identified two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that satisfy the `type` constraint. To satisfy the `on` constraint for either of these, I'd need to ensure the object is both *supported* by `v18` and *at the correct pose* (`#o2`).
           
           Initially, neither `v8` nor `v12` are in the correct pose.  `v8` is at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`.  To place either object on `v18`, I would have needed to execute a `place` action (to set the `atpose`) or `pick` (to unset the `atpose` and set a different `atpose`) action.
           
           However, the action instances available to me are severely restricted. I'm *only* allowed to execute the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action manipulates the base configuration (`atbconf`), but fundamentally does not change the position or pose of any object.
           
           Because I cannot manipulate objects' poses (via `pick` and `place`), and the `on` condition requires changing the object's pose, the goal state, unfortunately, cannot be achieved with the given constraints. I'm essentially stuck with a robot that can move its base but cannot manipulate objects.
