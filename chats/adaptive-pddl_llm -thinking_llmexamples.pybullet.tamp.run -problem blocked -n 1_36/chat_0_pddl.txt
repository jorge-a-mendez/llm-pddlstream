           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning Process for Achieving the Goal Atom new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at its definition, I see it means achieving `on(?green, v18) AND type(?green, v17)`. My expert intuition tells me this is likely a situation where I need to rearrange an object to satisfy the "on" condition and that object needs to be of the correct "type".
           
           First, I identified possible objects that satisfy the `type` requirement. From the initial state, I found `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So now, the goal becomes either achieving `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Next, I understood that `on(?o, ?r)` is true if we have `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` AND `atpose(?o, ?p)`. So to get either `v8` or `v12` "on" `v18`, I need to adjust their `atpose` facts.
           
           I analyzed the current state. `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. There are facts like `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. But I also need `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)` which are not present.
           
           This means I must *move* either `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`, which implies some planning: (1) Pick up the object from its current location, and (2) place it at `#o2`.
           
           Examining the available actions, I found only `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action doesn't let me do a pick-and-place operation, which I desperately need!
           
           So, I deduced that, without the basic *pick* and *place* actions, I can't move either object. As a result, I can't achieve `on(v8, v18)` or `on(v12, v18)`.
           The single available action has no effect on this condition.
           
           Therefore, the goal is *unachievable* within the constraints defined by the given actions.
