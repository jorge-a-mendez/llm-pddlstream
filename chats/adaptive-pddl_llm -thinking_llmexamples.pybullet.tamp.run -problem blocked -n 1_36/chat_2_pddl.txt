(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which means getting an object that's both *on* something and has a specific *type*. First, I need to figure out which object can fulfill these conditions. The initial state tells me there are two objects, `v8` and `v12`, that have the required type, `v17`. To satisfy the *on* requirement, I need to make either `v8` or `v12` be on `v18`.
           
           Examining the *on* predicate and the initial facts, I realize that to make an object be on a specific thing I need to find a way to make `v12` supported by and at a certain pose on `v18`. Given what I know about the current configuration, neither `v8` nor `v12` are currently in that position.
           
           I'll choose `v12`. I need to get `v12` on `v18`. I have to place `v12` at a pose `#o2`. I need to leverage what I know about `v12` to create the series of actions. The initial state shows `v12` is supported by `#o2`, so that's good!
           
           The initial state, though, has `v12` supported by `v14`. My plan is to move `v12` from its current pose. I'll need to use the robot arm, `v4`, which is currently empty and at base configuration `v3`. I need to figure out the series of steps. First:
           
           **Step 1: Move Base Configuration**
           
           I notice that to pick up `v12`, I need the robot base to be at a particular configuration (`#o3`). Currently, the base is at `v3`. Using the facts about `basemotion` and `atbconf` I decide to use the `move_base` action.
           
           *   **Move Base** - Move base from `v3` to `#o3` using action `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`.
           
           **State After Step 1:**
           
           Now the base config is at the right location, `#o3`.
           
           **Step 2: Pick `v12` from its Current Location**
           
           Next, I need to use the `pick` action to move the object. From the initial state, I can see how `v4`, the arm, can grasp `v12` at its current pose, using trajectory `#o4` and grasp `#o1`.
           *   **Pick Object** - Pick `v12` with the grasp action `pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           
           I verify all the prerequisites are met.
           
           **State After Step 2:**
           
           The arm is holding `v12`.
           
           **Step 3: Place `v12` at the Desired Location**
           
           Finally, I use the `place` action to move `v12`.
           *   **Place Object** - Move `v12` using the `place` action: `place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4`.
           
           **Goal Verification**
           The plan should achieve the goal of having `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)`. The last action should verify this.
           I verify all conditions and double-check to make sure there are no *unsafe* conditions preventing any action, and I verify the initial predicates and actions are correct. The given goal should be achieved.
