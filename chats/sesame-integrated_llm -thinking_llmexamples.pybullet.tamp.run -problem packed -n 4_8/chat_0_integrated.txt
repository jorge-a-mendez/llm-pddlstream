           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Objective: A Four-Object Choreography**
           
           My goal is to orchestrate a robot's actions to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their current perch (v11) to a new surface (v18). The robot has two arms, but the actions suggest we're only using arm v4. Each object needs to be picked up from its initial pose and precisely placed on v18.
           
           **The Action Plan: Pick and Place with Precision**
           
           The strategy boils down to a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions. For each object:
           
           1.  **Preparation**: First, the base might need to move to a configuration specified by `#o3` if it's not already there. The problem specifies a `bconf`, or base configuration, parameter for the pick/place actions and associated kinematics. `kin` predicates define available `bconf` values for each action, so I assume this is a necessary pre-processing step if base configurations `v3` and `#o3` are different. The current base config is `v3`, which may require a `move_base` action. If not, it can be a zero-cost operation.
           2.  **Pick:** Using arm v4, pick the object (e.g., v8) from its current pose, represented by variables like `v9` and `#o1`.
           3.  **Place:** Move arm v4 to the desired placement pose on v18.  The robot needs to provide continuous x, y, z, and rotation values for the `#o2` pose where it will place the object.
           
           I need to make sure placement on the smaller v18 surface doesn't cause any collisions. Given the layout of the current poses and object dimensions, I will try to place the objects in a 2x2 grid pattern on v18. I'll need to specify coordinates for `#o2` for each object. The quaternion for the pose also requires a continuous value, so I'll assign 0 for the theta/rotation around z for simplicity, which is a common value.
           
           **Coordination and Potential Conflicts**
           
           The robot starts with its arm empty, so there are no dependencies between moving base configuration and placing/picking. Each pick and place can start immediately after the last is finished. The base config for each pick/place action is the same (`#o3`), so one `move_base` is sufficient.  `canmove()` is handled automatically by the system.
           
           **Detailed Breakdown of the Plan**
           
           My refined plan is:
           
           1.  *Move the robot's base to the configuration `#o3`.* This is needed if the current base config (`v3`) isn't the same as `#o3`.
           2.  *Pick v8 and Place v8*. The pose of v8 must have an associated value.
           3.  *Pick v12 and Place v12*. The pose of v12 must have an associated value.
           4.  *Pick v14 and Place v14*. The pose of v14 must have an associated value.
           5.  *Pick v16 and Place v16*. The pose of v16 must have an associated value.
           
           **Crucial Continuous Parameters (Poses)**
           
           The system requires I provide the specific pose for placement for each object. For `#o2`, I will assign the following continuous poses on `v18` for each object:
           
           *   **v8:** `-0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0`
           *   **v12:** `-0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0`
           *   **v14:** `0.06 0.06 0.781 0.0`
           *   **v16:** `0.06 -0.06 0.781 0.0`
           
           Given the requirements, the robot should execute these steps successfully.
