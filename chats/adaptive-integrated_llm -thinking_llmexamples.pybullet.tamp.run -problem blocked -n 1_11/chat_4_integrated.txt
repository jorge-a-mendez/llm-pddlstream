           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.293, 0.143), (-4.207, 0.229)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, 0.186, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.606, 0.796).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Goal and Analysis:**
           
           The objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is defined as placing an object of a certain type (`?green`) onto a specific surface (`v18`).  Given the initial state, I can see that `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`, both of which are of the correct type.  My first step is to figure out if either is already on `v18`. After reviewing the current state, I confirm that neither object is initially on `v18`.  Therefore, I'll need to develop a plan to place one of these objects onto the target surface.
           
           **Planning Phase: Focusing on `v8`**
           
           For simplicity, I will choose to move `v8` to the target surface. The predicate `on(?o, ?r)` means that `?o` is on top of the object `?r`. To achieve this, I need to make `atpose(v8, ?p)` and `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` true. Luckily, `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` already exists in the initial state, meaning that placing `v8` at a known position `#p0` will satisfy the preconditions. The current position is represented by `atpose(v8, v9)`. So, the goal is to make a plan to move `v8` from pose `v9` to pose `#p0` on surface `v18`.
           
           **Action Sequencing and Precondition Assessment:**
           
           I need to first `pick` the object, then `place` it. The available actions and their preconditions are assessed:
           1. `move_base`: Needs to move the base from its current configuration (`v3`) to a suitable base configuration `#q0` where picking will happen.
           2. `pick`: The `pick` action requires the robot arm (`v4`) to be handempty. After which, the robot arm should be able to grasp `v8` from the current pose and the robot can move.
           3. `move_base`: A base configuration change is required to move the base from pick configuration `#q0` to a place configuration `#q1`.
           4. `place`: The `place` action then places the object `v8` at `#p0` on `v18`. At the end, the arm should become handempty again and the robot can move.
           
           I make sure that the robot base can move. Assumptions will be made for collision-free trajectories. In addition, I will create a full state simulation after each step to verify that all actions are feasible to achieve. For the plan to work, base configuration changes would be necessary to be able to pick and place. At each step, I will determine the preconditions needed for each action, and how to create the preconditions using previous actions.
           
           **Final Plan and State Validation:**
           
           The plan is now finalized. The continuous value for `#p0` also needs to be provided.
           - `move_base(v3, #q0, #t1)`: Move the base. State: `atbconf(#q0)`, `Negated canmove()`
           - `pick(v4, v8, v9, #g0, #q0, #t0)`: Pick `v8`. State: `atbconf(#q0)`, `atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)`, `canmove()`, `Negated atpose(v8, v9)`
           - `move_base(#q0, #q1, #t3)`: Move the base. State: `atbconf(#q1)`, `atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)`, `Negated canmove()`
           - `place(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t2)`: Place `v8`. State: `atbconf(#q1)`, `atpose(v8, #p0)`, `handempty(v4)`, `canmove()`, `Negated atgrasp(v4, v8, #g0)`
           After `place(v4, v8, #p0, #g0, #q1, #t2)`, `atpose(v8, #p0)` is true, meaning that `v8` is on top of `v18`, so `on(v8, v18)` becomes true.
           
           To determine `#p0`, I need to select a suitable x, y, z coordinate, along with a rotation. `#p0` is a pose for `v8` on `v18`. I know that in the initial state `v8` is on `v11` which partially overlaps `v18`
