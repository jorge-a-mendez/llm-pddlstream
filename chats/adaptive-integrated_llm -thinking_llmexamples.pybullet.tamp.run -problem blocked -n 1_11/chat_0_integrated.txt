User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.293, 0.143), (-4.207, 0.229)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, 0.186, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.606, 0.796).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Unreachable Goal Due to Action Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: `(new-axiom@0)`.  Breaking that down, it means I need to get an object of a specific type *on* another object, specifically `v18`.  I've identified that either `v8` or `v12` could be my target objects because they are of the correct type (`v17`).
           
           Now, the problem is, I'm severely restricted in the actions I can use.  The *only* allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This means the robot's base can only move to its current location; nothing actually *changes*.  I'm dealing with a **closed world** here, and the only "move" allowed, is moving from point A to point A.
           
           To achieve my goal of placing something *on* `v18`, I'd need a `pick` action to grasp my chosen object (either `v8` or `v12`) and then a `place` action to put it *on* `v18`.  But, critically, I can't use `pick` or `place` because they are *not* in my list of available actions!  This restriction essentially makes the problem unsolvable. I've double-checked the statement to ensure I'm not missing anything: *it states explicitly that I can only use the actions provided and, thus, the goal is unreachable*.
           
           I've carefully examined the axioms, ensuring I understand the relationship between `on`, `supported`, and `atpose`.  Achieving `on(?green, v18)` *requires* manipulating the state of the objects, and the `move_base` action simply doesn't allow such manipulation. It's essentially a no-op that restricts the robot and disallows any change. No change to the state is allowed, because `pick` and `place` are critical and absent. I've re-read the problem description very carefully. Given this constraint, there's no sequence of actions I can perform to reach the required state. The base is not allowed to move (meaning the robot also can't manipulate objects), so the task is unsolvable.
