User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.293, 0.143), (-4.207, 0.229)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.25, 0.186, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.606, 0.796).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`: A Detailed Plan**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires me to place an object of type `v17` (let's call it `?green`) onto surface `v18`. Given the available facts,  `?green` can be either `v8` or `v12`. I need to ensure  `on(?green, v18)` becomes true, meaning `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)` must hold.
           
           I've determined that both `v8` and `v12` can potentially satisfy this condition.  Let's focus on `v8` as a starting point. `type(v8, v17)` is true, and I have the information needed to place it.  I will attempt to achieve `on(v8, v18)` by placing `v8` on `v18`.
           
           My plan involves two steps:
           
           1.  **`pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`:**  Using arm `v4` to pick up object `v8` from its current pose `v9`. This action requires me to have  `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`, `atpose(v8, v9)`, `handempty(v4)`, and  `atbconf(v3)`. I've verified that all these preconditions are satisfied.  This action will result in `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`,  `~atpose(v8, v9)`, and `~handempty(v4)`.
           2.  **`place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`:** Using arm `v4` to place object `v8` at the target pose `#o2` on surface `v18`. This requires  `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`, `atgrasp(v4, v8, #o1)`, and `atbconf(v3)`.  The result will be `atpose(v8, #o2)` and `handempty(v4)`.
           
           For this plan to succeed, I have to provide the continuous value for `#o2`  a stable pose to place the object stably.
           
           **Detailed Continuous Parameter Values:**
           
           *   **`#o2` (Pose for `v8` on `v18`):** This is the key continuous parameter.  I need to define a stable placement pose for `v8` on surface `v18`.  Given the AABB data, where `v8` is described with `((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335))` and `v18` with `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. I interpret the AABB as the objects' current position, not intrinsic size. Based on surface dimensions for a stable placement pose, I determined the appropriate coordinates.
               `v8` has a size of width=0.07m and height=0.07m.
               `v18` will contain v8. The pose of v8 must fit within the y-range of v18.
               Thus, for `v8`, I propose a pose: `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`. This places `v8` (center) inside the boundaries of `v18`, so v8 is stably placed there. This makes sure that `pose(v8, #o2)` and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` are true. The y coordinate and height allows `v8` and `v18` to be stable.
           
           I am confident that with this plan and the defined pose, I will achieve `on(v8, v18)`, and consequently, the goal `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Plan Failure**
           
           Okay, so the user's right. The previous plan used actions that are invalid, and I was given a fresh look at the allowed actions, and it's just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's... not helpful. The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, translates to needing to have a green object, `?green`, of a certain type, `v17`, placed *on* `v18`. I remember from before that `v8` and `v12` are objects of the right type.
           
           But here's the rub: to get either `v8` or `v12` *on* `v18`, I need to pick them up and then place them down. That's how `on` works, right? But the *only* action I'm allowed is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That simply moves the robot's base.  It *doesn't* involve picking up or placing anything!  It's just the robot moving around a bit.
           
           So, I'm stuck. Given the required *on* relationship for the goal and the limited actions available, I can't reach the goal. It's unreachable with what I've got. The plan is a non-starter.
