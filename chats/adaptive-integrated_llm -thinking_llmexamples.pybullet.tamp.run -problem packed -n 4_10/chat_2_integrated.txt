           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.25, 0.363, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.213, 0.977).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.03, -0.469), (0.066, -0.373)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.411), (-0.12, -0.313)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.082, -0.29), (0.157, -0.216)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.204, 0.317), (0.296, 0.41)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.018, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.87, 0.493).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.362, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.31, 0.951).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.119, -0.253, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.035).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Alright, here's my breakdown of the plan to move these objects, keeping in mind I'm an expert in this field:**
           
           I'm tasked with getting four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18. The robot has two arms, but only one is needed for this. The starting point is v4 at v5 and v6 at v7, both empty-handed.  The base is initially at bconf v3.
           
           The key is that all the target objects are graspable, and currently they are supported on surface v11. The target is v18, and I know that *`on(o, r)` is true if `supported(o, p, r)` and `atpose(o, p)`.*
           
           The initial setup gives me a head start:  all four objects already have `supported(o, #o2, v18)` in the initial state.  That means I'm aiming to place them at a specific pose, designated by `#o2`, on v18. The trick here is that because *multiple* objects share the same starting pose denoted by a name that starts with a '#' symbol I need to give *each* object at this pose a unique, distinct value for it to work. 
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base:** The robot needs to be in a suitable base configuration before picking/placing. Given that the `kin` facts are all tied to the `#o3` base configuration, I have to *move the base to that point*.
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop (repeated for each object):** For each object, the process will be the same:
               *   **Pick:** Pick the object from surface v11 using arm v4.
               *   **Place:** Place the object at its assigned `#o2` on v18.
           
           Here's the detailed logic. Let's break down object v8, for example. I'll use arm v4:
              1. The action will be to move the base from v3 to `#o3`.
              2.  First I must first move the arm v4 to be at the base configuration, then move the arm v4 from pose v9 (on v11, which supports v8) to pick it up.  The *plan says* that I should define the kinematic chain. The precondition is to have the arm v4 at `#o3` the current target surface `v18`.
              3. Second, the plan indicates I should then place the object at pose `#o2` on v18.
               The same process is done for the other 3 objects with v8 using a different continuous parameter value.
           
           Collision check: The problem description lists that the safety check relies on definitions of collision-free, unsafe poses and approaches based on the negation of geometric tests. None of these facts appear in the initial state. The plan should work.
           
           Continuous values: I need to assign actual numerical values for the continuous parameters (#o0, #o1, #o2, #o3, and #o4).
           *   For base conf `(bconf)` `#o3`, I'll use (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), a central position near both v11 and v18.
           *   The surface target pose `#o2` on `v18` will be unique for each object. For stable placements, I will assume the objects sit on the surface on a 2D plane (x,y) at a `z` of 0.781 (since that appears to be the standard in this scene.) The `z` of 0.781 is a good starting place, and is the same as the initial `z` of v8, 12, 14, and 16 when `supported`.
           I will make the poses on v18 be in a grid-like fashion:
               *   v8: (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
               *   v12: (0.08, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
               *   v14: (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
               *   v16: (0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           With these steps, I can guarantee that each object is moved safely from v11 to its final spot on v18.  The actions are provided, and the continuous values are well
