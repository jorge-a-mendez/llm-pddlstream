User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.25, 0.363, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.213, 0.977).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.03, -0.469), (0.066, -0.373)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.411), (-0.12, -0.313)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.082, -0.29), (0.157, -0.216)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.204, 0.317), (0.296, 0.41)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.018, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.87, 0.493).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.362, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.31, 0.951).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.119, -0.253, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.035).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to formulate a plan to reposition four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto surface v18.  The current state shows these objects, each supported by v11, at their respective poses (v9, v13, v15, and v17). The core of the problem lies in the requirement to achieve the `on(object, v18)` goal for each object, which boils down to ensuring they are both supported and at a specific pose on v18.  I see that the target poses on v18 are initially represented by a shared parameter, `#o2`, across all the objects.  Since objects cannot physically occupy the same point simultaneously, it's clear I'll need to define distinct poses for each object on v18, renaming the shared parameter accordingly.
           
           **Action Selection and Plan Generation**
           
           Given the available actions — `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook` — the latter two are irrelevant. Also, the only `move_base` action instance provided means the robot's base will remain stationary. Thus, the solution must involve a series of pick-and-place operations. A clear strategy emerges: for each object, I'll `pick` it from its current location, and then `place` it onto v18 at its own unique, collision-free pose.
           
           **Parameter Instantiation and Continuous Values**
           
           The robot has two arms, v4 and v6. Both are currently `handempty`. My plan uses the arm v4. Each object is identified as `graspable`. The `kin` predicate is crucial to defining valid trajectories for pick and place, including base config, arm trajectory. The *key* here is creating continuous values, unique poses for each object. For `#o2`, I'll replace it with:
           *   `#p8_on_v18` for object v8
           *   `#p12_on_v18` for object v12
           *   `#p14_on_v18` for object v14
           *   `#p16_on_v18` for object v16
           
           Given these discrete substitutions and pose assignments, the sequence must be pick then place for each object. The key detail is to maintain collision-free states, given initial poses, the object sizes, and final target poses.
           
           **Formal Plan and Solution**
           
           The robot starts with canmove set and must maintain it during each subsequent action. Given that `move_base` is always `v3 v3`, the robot state is always `atbconf(v3)`. The general plan, I see, is a sequence of pick-place operations using arm v4:
           
           1.  Pick object v8 from pose v9.
           2.  Place v8 at pose `#o2` on surface v18.
           3.  Pick object v12 from pose v13.
           4.  Place v12 at pose `#o2` on surface v18.
           5.  Pick object v14 from pose v15.
           6.  Place v14 at pose `#o2` on surface v18.
           7.  Pick object v16 from pose v17.
           8.  Place v16 at pose `#o2` on surface v18.
           
           **Final Remarks:** This should work if all preconditions are met for `pick` and `place`, namely `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty` are true, and each action is collision-free. I will need to provide concrete values for the pose of each object (`#p8_on_v18`, etc.), and for the arm trajectories.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #atraj1_v8) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj2_v8) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #atraj1_v12) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj2_v12) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #atraj1_v14) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj2_v14) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #atraj1_v16) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #atraj2_v16)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Impossibility of the Task**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and the user's initial plan... well, it's immediately invalid.  They've included `pick` and `place` actions, and the allowed action list explicitly states that only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted.  Given my expertise in planning, this is a red flag right away. I know the nuances of action modelling and available operators, and the limitation imposed here fundamentally changes the nature of the task.
           
           The goal is quite clear: I need to have four objects (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`) resting on `v18`. Right now, they're all on `v11`. It's a classic rearrangement task.  The initial state provides the spatial relations: each of these objects is "atpose" at a specific location, with `v11` serving as their common support. I understand these are spatial relationships and constraints that must be handled.
           
           The challenge, however, lies in the allowed action. With only `move_base` available, the robot's base configuration can be changed, but there's absolutely no way to interact with the environment, or manipulate the objects, in a way that will affect their spatial relations.  The current setup is not feasible as described.  
           
           `move_base` can't, by its very nature, alter an object's support relationship. It's an operator for navigation, not manipulation. Given this critical constraint, I can definitively state that the goal is unattainable.  The problem description is internally inconsistent.  Either the goal must be re-considered, or the allowed actions are in conflict with the intention.
