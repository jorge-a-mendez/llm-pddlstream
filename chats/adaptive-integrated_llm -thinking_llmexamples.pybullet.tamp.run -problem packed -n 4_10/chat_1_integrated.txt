User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object

           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.25, 0.363, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.213, 0.977).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.03, -0.469), (0.066, -0.373)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.218, -0.411), (-0.12, -0.313)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.082, -0.29), (0.157, -0.216)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.204, 0.317), (0.296, 0.41)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.018, -0.421, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.87, 0.493).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.169, -0.362, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.31, 0.951).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.119, -0.253, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.035).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan I've devised to move the four objects, v8, v12, v14, and v16, onto v18.** My initial assessment of the situation shows that these objects are currently on v11 at different poses. The robot has two arms, but the kin facts indicate only arm v4 is currently equipped to handle these objects. The robot's base will remain stationary throughout, as the available base motion keeps it in the same position.
           
           The core of the plan will be a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions. For each object, I'll direct arm v4 to pick it up from its current pose and then place it onto v18. I'll need to specify a unique continuous pose, marked by `#o2`, for each object on v18 to satisfy the condition of multiple placements on the same surface.
           
           Since there's no need for base movement, only pick and place actions will be required. The key is to coordinate the robot arm v4 so that I can handle all four objects one by one and achieve the final desired configuration. I'll designate the placement area for each object with a uniquely assigned coordinate value within the given surface range.
           
           The provided information shows that the arm v4 is capable of this plan. I need to make sure the pose data is correctly constructed, and that the pose data of #o2 is unique for each object on v18.
           
           **Plan:**
           
           1.  Pick v8 from its current pose and place it on v18.
           2.  Pick v12 from its current pose and place it on v18.
           3.  Pick v14 from its current pose and place it on v18.
           4.  Pick v16 from its current pose and place it on v18.
           
           Here are the unique continuous coordinates for #o2 on v18 for each object:
           
           | Object | Location Coordinates (x,y,z,orientation) |
           |---|---|
           | v8 | (0.05 0.05 0.781 0.0) |
           | v12 | (-0.05 0.05 0.781 0.0) |
           | v14 | (0.05 -0.05 0.781 0.0) |
           | v16 | (-0.05 -0.05 0.781 0.0) |
           
           The plan appears to satisfy the given problem constraints and should effectively achieve the goal of placing all objects on v18.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Impossibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan and told it's invalid because the actions used don't match the *only* allowed action, which is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That makes sense.  The system is very restrictive here. I need to figure out *why* the goal is unreachable given these limitations.
           
           The goal is pretty straightforward: get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. I've checked the initial state, and it confirms what I suspected. The initial state shows `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are all *currently* on `v11`.  The `supported` atoms and the axioms imply this relationship.
           
           Now, the problem. The *only* action I have is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This just moves the robot. This does *nothing* to change the world state with respect to the objects. It's essentially a no-op as far as achieving the goal is concerned. The `on` predicates dictate the object positions, and the robot movement doesn't affect that relationship.
           
           Therefore, since the goal explicitly requires changing the `on` predicate for the objects, and the provided action *cannot* achieve this, the goal is *impossible* to reach with the given constraints. I'll need to explain this impossibility clearly and concisely.
