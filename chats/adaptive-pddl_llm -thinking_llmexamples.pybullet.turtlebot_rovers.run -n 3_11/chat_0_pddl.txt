           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My primary objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom requires, among other things, achieving `receivedimage` for three objectives and `receivedanalysis` for two rock types.  Initially, the plan looks straightforward. I assessed the initial state, confirming that the first four predicates in the goal conjunction (`atconf`, `free`) are already satisfied. The difficulty lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           To get the images, I would use `take_image` and `send_image`. This needs the rover to calibrate its camera, which requires `imagevisible` and that the rover is `atconf`. However, all `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates use configurations `#o3` or `#o0`, while the initial `atconf` state only places the rovers at configurations `v13` or `v15`. To get the analysis, I considered sampling the rocks and sending the analysis, requiring actions `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`. This also requires rovers at specific `atconf` locations. However, I see a problem: the provided list of *permitted* actions includes only `move` and `drop_rock`. No permitted action achieves the goal because I cannot take images or perform analysis with this restricted action set.
           
           The `move` actions are essentially no-ops, leaving the rover at its initial configuration. The `drop_rock` action can't be executed initially because `full` is initially false. This leaves me with no means to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.  Therefore, I must conclude that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* given the constraints.
