User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is (0.0, 0.0).
           The scene is enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical wall at x=0, and several smaller obstacles scattered around. Given the target is (0,0), the wall at x=0 is a major obstacle. I need to find positions that are not directly on the x=0 line, and are within 2 units of the target.
           Positions:
           (1.0 0.0)
           (-1.0 0.0)
           (0.0 1.0)
