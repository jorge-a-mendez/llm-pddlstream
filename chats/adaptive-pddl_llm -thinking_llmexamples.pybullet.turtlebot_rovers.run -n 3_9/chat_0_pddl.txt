           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to securing images of three objects (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`) and analyzing two samples (soil and rock).  The initial state provides some key facts about the rovers, their configurations, and their environment.
           
           I've traced the necessary action chains. To get the images, I'd need to `take_image`, then `send_image`.  To get the analyses, I'd need to `sample_rock`, and then `send_analysis`.  However, here's where the problem arises.  For all these actions (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`), the rovers *must* be in specific configurations—let's call them `#o3`, `#o0`, and `#o5`, respectively.  But my initial analysis reveals a critical constraint.
           
           The rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are *stuck*. They are initially at `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the only `move` actions available are effectively no-ops, just re-stating their current configuration. This implies that my ability to *change* the rovers' *current* position, which is essential to achieving any goal, is severely restricted.
           
           The `conf` predicates (e.g., `conf(v12, #o3)`) denote that a configuration *is* viable for a rover, but not that the rover *is* in that configuration. The initial state uses `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`. Therefore, as there are no actions to move between configurations, the rovers are unable to get into the specific configurations for imaging, communication, and sample collection.
           The provided move actions do not facilitate a move to `#o3`, `#o0` or `#o5`.
           
           Given these limitations, and that the only move actions are re-stating the current position, I can safely conclude that I cannot reach the target configurations necessary to fulfill the sub-goals.
           
           Therefore, the planning problem is, unfortunately, unsolvable.
