(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Generation Strategy**
           
           My primary goal is to generate 50 distinct, stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions 0.0853 x 0.0853) on a single surface (Surface 0, an AABB from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135)). I know a placement is stable if the rotated object's AABB fits within the surface's AABB.  Since the object is square, this simplifies calculations.
           
           The core idea is to vary the rotation angle (`theta`) and the object's position (`x`, `y`) on the surface. To make sure the object remains within the surface's bounds at all rotations, I need to account for the effective size of the rotated square. For any angle `theta`,  the effective size, or side of the new AABB, is `obj_side * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I will calculate a half-effective dimension to ensure proper fitting.
           
           Because of the symmetry of the square and the surface, the problem is solvable, since the rotated object will always fit inside the surface.
           
           I'm generating 50 placements. To achieve variety, I will vary `theta` evenly across the full range (0 to 2*pi), picking 50 angles. For each angle, I will determine the range of valid `x` and `y` positions by offsetting the surface bounds by the half-effective dimension.  Then, I will create 5 distinct placements for each of 10 different angles, by placing the object at the center, and 4 corner/edge centered locations, spread out around the surface. This approach will maximize spread while creating stable points.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break down this placement problem.** I've been given a successful placement for object ID 5, and now I need to figure out where to put object ID 4.  Essentially, I have a square object (ID 4) of a specific size (s_obj_4 = 0.07748689180912549) that needs to go on a surface.  The catch?  It can't collide with object ID 5, which is already sitting there, also a square, and whose side is s_obj_5 = 0.08532731252742398.
           
           I need to generate *fifty* stable placements for object 4.  The key is avoiding collisions. I am an expert, so I am going to make sure to be very accurate! Object 5 is placed at (0, 0, 0), and I need to calculate, for any rotation, a valid place to put the center of object 4. I need 50 distinct positions.
           
           First, I define some bounds. The surface is defined by (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Then, for any given rotation angle (theta), the object's effective half-dimension, half_effective_dim_4, will vary. For example, half_effective_dim_4 is s_obj_4/2 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta))).
           
           I then need to calculate valid positions. It turns out that any placement that keeps object 4's AABB outside of an AABB around the 0,0 center position will work. I will iterate theta to test many rotations, but I'll make sure to get all the valid positions for those rotations and will have 50.
           
           Essentially, I need to find 50 spots where I can put the center of object 4 that *don't* overlap the space taken up by object 5, accounting for rotation.  I also need to ensure that the placement is on the available surface.
           
           My approach: I am going to calculate the collision region for *every* theta from 0 to 2*pi, I'll calculate the bounds of where the object can be given its rotation, and from that, the center positions. I can calculate the safe regions, the placement bounds, and the forbidden regions, from where I can then generate placements.
           
           I need the final list to be 50. I am sure I can get many more than that, so this won't be a problem. This should be straightforward.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable locations for a new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, a square area with boundaries at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Two existing square objects are present as obstacles: Object 5, centered at (0, 0) and Object 4, positioned at approximately (-0.096, -0.096).
           
           To achieve this, I will adopt a systematic approach for a precise placement strategy:
           
           1.  **Iterate through rotations**: I'll consider 50 different rotation angles for Object 7, ranging from 0 to 2π.
           2.  **Calculate Effective AABB**: For each angle, I must determine the object's effective AABB by calculating its new bounding box given its square shape. This involves computing the half-effective dimensions based on rotation.
           3.  **Boundary Checks**: Ensure the object's AABB remains within Surface 0's bounds. I'll define valid x and y ranges for the object's center.
           4.  **Collision Detection**: It's crucial to prevent collisions with Object 5 and Object 4.  Using a defined function `check_aabb_collision`, I'll compare the AABBs of the new object with those of the obstacles, checking for any overlaps to rule out collisions.
           5.  **Candidate Location**: For each rotation angle, I will determine the object's center location using carefully constructed candidates as follows:
               *   Top-right corner
               *   Top-left corner
               *   Bottom-right corner
               *   Center (will check collisions)
           6.  **Find Valid Placement**: If I can't find a placement for a given angle, then I will iterate more candidates along the edges to locate a valid position.
           
           By carefully considering rotations and collision constraints, my code should identify and provide 50 stable and distinct locations.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Object Placement on a Constrained Surface**
           
           My task is to intelligently place 50 new objects (ID 6) onto a 2D surface (surface 0), ensuring each placement is stable and collision-free. This requires me to leverage my expertise in scene geometry and object collision detection.
           
           **Here's my thought process:**
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** I need to find 50 valid locations for new objects within the boundaries of surface 0, taking into account the existing placements of objects 4, 5, and 7.
           
           2.  **Surface and Object Geometry:** I begin by understanding the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for surface 0 and the AABBs of the already-placed objects. The surface is rectangular. All the prior objects are squares, which greatly simplifies things. I compute the size of these AABBs.
           
           3.  **Rotation Considerations:** I plan to consider rotations of the new objects (theta). To address this, I'll calculate the *effective* AABB dimensions for Object 6 for *each* considered angle. My goal is for the code to support rotations, even though it will start with theta=0.
           
           4.  **Valid Placement Region:** I'll determine the valid area within surface 0 for the object's center, considering its size and potential rotations. This step ensures that each object is fully contained within the surface.
           
           5.  **Collision Detection:** This is the core of the problem. For each candidate placement, I need to check if the new object's AABB collides with any of the existing objects' AABBs. I'll use a simple AABB collision check function for this.
           
           6.  **Candidate Placement Strategy:** The objective is to pick varied placements across surface 0.
           
               *   **Prioritize Available Space:** I will identify the free space and place the objects in the region.
               *   **Use Edge cases.** I have chosen to prioritize: corners, midpoints of the edges. And of course the center.
               *   **Grid Iteration.** If not found after simple candidates, I will perform a grid search to fill the gaps.
           
           7.  **Iterative Placement and Validation:** I will iterate through angles and then possible placements, checking for collisions at each step.
           
           8.  **Diversity:** My plan is to start by generating a few placements per angle and picking a placement if it's free. The approach should scale, as the goal is to find 50 diverse object placements on surface 0.
