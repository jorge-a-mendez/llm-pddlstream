(Thoughts: **Initial Analysis and Plan Formation**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective is to get three objects – v8, v12, and v14 – onto a shared support, v16.  Essentially, we need to arrange for `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`.  The initial setup indicates all three are currently supported by v11.  The problem provides key axioms: `on` is derived from `supported` and `atpose`. That points us directly toward manipulating poses.
           
           Looking at the initial state, we're given several key facts:  the robot's base configuration (`v3`), an empty arm (`v4`, `v6`), and the positions and stackability of our target objects.  Crucially, all three objects are *stackable* on v16, and they are *supported* by v11 currently. It appears we have to move their poses.
           
           The problem specifically highlights the use of `pick`, `place`, and `move_base` actions.  It's clear that the 'place' action requires our objects to be at a target pose, and that target pose is related to v16. We can infer that since `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, the goal is to place the three objects at the same pose `#o2` on top of v16. However, `#o2` might represent unique parameters for each object.
           
           **Plan Formulation and Execution**
           
           The plan will involve these steps:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  We need to get the robot base to a suitable configuration. The 'move_base' action preconditions require the robot to be *able to move* and have a valid *basemotion* fact. Based on facts, we're likely going to move from `v3` to `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick and Place Loop:**  For each object (v8, v12, v14):
               *   **Pick:**  We'll use a `pick` action to grasp the object from its current pose (v9, v13, or v15). This requires the object to be 'graspable', the arm to be 'handempty', the base to be at the correct configuration, and for the relevant *kinematic* facts to be true.  Also we need *safe* facts.
               *   **Place:**  Once grasped, we'll use a `place` action to position the object at the target pose. This also relies on having the object in the arm's grasp, having the base at the correct configuration, and the necessary *kinematic* information. Here we are using `#o2` for each of them.  The placement must also be *safe*.
           
           **Specific Action Sequence**
           
           Based on this logic, the complete plan looks like:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           3.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           4.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           5.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           6.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           7.  `(place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
           
           **Precondition Checks and Optimizations**
           
           It's critical that each step's preconditions are met. The `canmove()` predicate changes status as the action sequence is executed. The key is in the transition of states and preconditions for each action to be fulfilled. We must verify that `unsafeapproach` and `unsafepose` (if derived) are false so the plan is safe for execution. The continuous parameters will likely be resolved by a dedicated algorithm.
           
           **Cost Analysis**
           
           Minimizing cost means performing the `move_base` action only once. The order of the objects themselves won't change the cost. The key is to reduce base movement. The action `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)` ensures we are in the correct base location for pick-and-place actions, and `(move_base #o3 #o3 #o0)` has zero cost.
