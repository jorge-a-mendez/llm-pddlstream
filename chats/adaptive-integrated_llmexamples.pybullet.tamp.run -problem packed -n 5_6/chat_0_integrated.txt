           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (-0.052, -0.438, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.768, 0.64).

           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.232, -0.473), (-0.15, -0.392)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.087, -0.353), (0.183, -0.257)).

           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.15, -0.334), (-0.075, -0.259)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.191, -0.433, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.64, 0.769).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains five objects: v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, which are currently supported on v11. The goal is to move all these objects to be supported on v20. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both of which are currently empty. There is only one available action instance, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which moves the robot's base but does not change its position. This means the robot is effectively stationary.
           
           Looking at the initial state and available action instances, there are no `pick` or `place` actions available. The goal requires placing objects on `v20`. Since `pick` and `place` actions are the only way to change an object's location and therefore satisfy the `on` predicate, and no such actions are provided in the list of available action instances, the goal is unreachable. If pick and place actions were available, the strategy would be to pick each object from its current pose on `v11` and place it on a collision-free pose on `v20`. However, without these actions, the task cannot be completed.
