(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object on a surface. The object is nearly square with dimensions approximately 0.082 units by 0.082 units. The surface is a square of size 0.27 units, centered at the origin. Stability requires that the object is fully contained within the surface and doesn't collide with obstacles (which are not yet defined in this problem).
           
           To ensure diverse and stable placements, I've developed the following plan: Since the object is almost square, rotations don't drastically change its effective size. Therefore, I will define a conservative set of center points that works for any rotation.
           
           First, I need to calculate the *maximum* possible AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) dimensions when the object is rotated. This maximum occurs at a 45-degree angle (pi/4 radians). Given the object's dimensions, the *maximum* half-width and half-height for *any* rotation is approximately 0.058 units.
           
           Considering the surface's boundaries of [-0.135, 0.135] for both x and y, I calculate the safest range for the center of the object: [-0.0768, 0.0768]. To provide diverse, contained placements, I've chosen a smaller set of *x* and *y* center coordinates: [-0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07]. These provide 5 center points for *x* and 5 center points for *y*.  I am ensuring these coordinates are chosen well within those bounds.
           
           To cover diverse object orientations I will use rotations of 0 radians and pi/2 radians. Then, I will generate 50 unique stable placements, each of which is in the format of a tuple (surface index, theta, x, y).

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new task: find 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 6, dimensions 0.0963 x 0.0963) on surface 0, while avoiding collision with a previously placed square (ID 4, size 0.0823, placed at (0, 0, -0.07, -0.07)).  Surface 0 is defined as the rectangle from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My first thought is, "I need to nail down those surface boundaries and that pesky object 4." I need to calculate the bounding boxes (AABB) for both:
           
           *   **Object 4:** Centered at (-0.07, -0.07) and with its edges at (-0.111, -0.111) to (-0.029, -0.029).
           *   **Surface 0:** The surface boundaries are easy: (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Now, to fit object 6 inside the surface, the center of object 6 must be within a slightly smaller square. To do this, I figured out that if I keep rotations to 0 or pi/2, the AABB bounds extend +/- half the object side length. Using the half-width, I determined that the center *must* be within [-0.08684, 0.08684] for both x and y.
           
           Collision? I need to build the logic to avoid overlapping. I'm using classic AABB collision detection. The conditions for non-collision are: object 6 must be *to the left*, *to the right*, *above*, or *below* object 4's AABB.
           
           I created a script to systematically iterate through a grid of possible center points for object 6, within the surface bounds. For each point and each rotation (0 and pi/2), it will determine object 6's AABB then check if this AABB collides using the above conditions. I'm taking the conservative route; I set up a fairly dense grid of points, enough to pick the final result from.
           
           I identified 54 non-colliding locations; I'm picking the first 50. All good.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object, Object 7, on Surface 0. My primary concerns are ensuring Object 7 is *fully contained* within Surface 0 and avoiding collisions with two previously placed objects: Object 4 and Object 6.
           
           First, I define the geometric properties. Surface 0 is a rectangle with dimensions (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). Object 7 is nearly a perfect square with dimensions of roughly 0.091. This means its half-extents (from the center to an edge) are approximately 0.0455. Objects 4 and 6 are also defined, along with their associated dimensions and AABBs.
           
           The first constraint is containment.  The center point of Object 7 must be within a certain range to fit within the surface boundaries. The valid center range for Object 7 (using the AABB half-extents) is approximately [-0.0895, 0.0895] for both x and y.
           
           To ensure no collisions, I have to perform some collision checks.  I'm using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to simplify this. The core is the AABB collision detection.  For a candidate placement of Object 7 (considering both the center coordinates and rotation), I calculate its AABB.  Then, I check if this AABB overlaps with the AABB of Object 4 and Object 6. If no overlap occurs, the placement is valid.
           
           I've formulated a strategy:  Create a grid of candidate center points within the feasible range [-0.08, 0.08] for both x and y, stepping by 0.02. For each center point, I'll test two rotations: 0 degrees and 90 degrees.  For each combination, I calculate the object's AABB and check for any overlap with the obstacle AABBs (Objects 4 and 6).
           
           To optimize this, I created a Python script to iterate through the grid, perform AABB calculations, and identify collision-free placements. The script carefully checks for collisions between the AABBs of Object 7 with those of the existing obstacles. The result is a list of valid, collision-free placements (x, y coordinates and rotation).

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out where to place object ID 5 on surface 0, and I need 50 stable positions. Let's break this down.
           
           First, I know object 5 is a square with sides of length `0.0722`, and the surface is defined as `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I'll need to keep this in mind. More importantly, I need to consider where previous objects are and avoid collisions.  There are three existing objects to dodge:
           
           *   Object 4: at approximately `(-0.07, -0.07)` with size `0.082`.
           *   Object 6: at approximately `(-0.02, 0.06)` with size `0.096`.
           *   Object 7: at approximately `(-0.04, -0.08)` with size `0.091`.
           
           The easiest way to deal with collision detection is to use axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). Since my object is square, the AABB extents are just half the side length of the object, which is `0.0361`.
           
           To be "contained" on surface 0, the center of object 5 needs to be within `[-0.0988, 0.0988]` in both x and y.
           
           So the main thing I need is a function to check if two AABBs are colliding. Let the half extents of the new object be `obj_new_half_x` and `obj_new_half_y`, and let `obj_new_cx` and `obj_new_cy` be its center.
           Then `obj_new_min_x = obj_new_cx - obj_new_half_x`, `obj_new_max_x = obj_new_cx + obj_new_half_x`, `obj_new_min_y = obj_new_cy - obj_new_half_y`, and `obj_new_max_y = obj_new_cy + obj_new_half_y`.
           Let `obj_existing_min_x, obj_existing_max_x, obj_existing_min_y, obj_existing_max_y` define the existing object's AABB.
           
           Collision happens if `(obj_new_max_x > obj_existing_min_x AND obj_new_min_x < obj_existing_max_x)` AND `(obj_new_max_y > obj_existing_min_y AND obj_new_min_y < obj_existing_max_y)`.
           
           My strategy will be to create a grid of potential center points for object 5. The grid goes from `-0.09` to `0.09` in steps of `0.02`. This gives me 10x10=100 candidate points.
           I'll also consider each point with two orientations for the object (0 and pi/2 radians).  That gives me 200 possible placements.
           
           For each candidate, I will first check if the AABB would collide with any other object. If the position is good, it will be added to the output list.  Since I need 50 unique placements, I can stop once the list contains 50 elements.
           
           Okay, let's start analyzing some potential points. I'm going to start with the lower-left, then work around.
           
           Let's try (0.07, 0.07) as a test case. Object 5 would have x from 0.033887 to 0.106113 and y from 0.033887 to 0.106113.  This does not collide with object 4, object 6 or object 7. Therefore, (0.07, 0.07) is a valid location.  I'll add (0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.07) and (0, 1.5707963267948966, 0.07, 0.07).
           
           With the example working, I can now encode the algorithm.
           I'll iterate through `cx` and `cy` coordinates. In addition to a test for surface containment, there are AABB intersection tests against Obj4, Obj6, and Obj7. If the candidate clears the tests

           Let `obj_existing_min_x, obj_existing_max_x, obj_existing_min_y, obj_existing_max_y` define the existing object's AABB.
           
           Collision happens if `(obj_new_max_x > obj_existing_min_x AND obj_new_min_x < obj_existing_max_x)` AND `(obj_new_max_y > obj_existing_min_y AND obj_new_min_y < obj_existing_max_y)`.

Therefore, (0.07, 0.07) is a valid location.  I'll add (0, 0.0, 0.07, 0.07) and (0, 1.5707963267948966, 0.07, 0.07).
           
           With the example working, I can now encode the algorithm.
           I'll iterate through `cx` and `cy` coordinates. In addition to a test for surface containment, there are AABB intersection tests against Obj4, Obj6, and Obj7. If the candidate clears the tests
