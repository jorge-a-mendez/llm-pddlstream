           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v17 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-1.342, -0.481), (-0.408, 0.618)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.187, -0.22), (0.281, -0.125)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.211, -0.283), (-0.115, -0.187)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.023, -0.346), (0.073, -0.249)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.234, -0.172, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.238, 0.971).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.163, -0.235, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.497, 0.868).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.025, -0.297, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.491, 0.871).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to get three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all onto surface `v16`. They're currently stacked on `v11`, as the initial state indicates. My understanding of the "on" predicate is based on "supported" and "atpose." So, I need to pick them up individually and place them on `v16`. I'm going to start by getting the robot's base in the right configuration. Since `kin` predicates use `#o3` for pick and place, and I'm at `v3` initially, I might need a move_base action.
           
           For each object, I'll:
           1.  **Move the Base:** If `v3` and `#o3` are different, I need to move from `v3` to the base configuration `#o3` to meet preconditions.
           2.  **Pick:** Use arm `v4` to pick up the object from its initial pose (e.g., `v8` from `v9`).  This will fulfill all the `pick` preconditions, like having `kin` information and being at `atpose`.
           3.  **Place:** Use arm `v4` to place the object onto a new, specific pose on surface `v16`, which I'll call `#o2`.
           
           I'll repeat this sequence for `v12` and `v14`. This should total 7 actions: 1 possible move_base + 3 picks + 3 places.
           
           The problem requires me to provide continuous values for pose `#o2`. I need a single pose. But since multiple objects are placed at it simultaneously, I'm defining distinct continuous placements for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`.
           
           Here's my chosen plan:
           
           -   `v8`: placed at x = -0.08, y = 0.04
           -   `v12`: placed at x = 0.00, y = -0.04
           -   `v14`: placed at x = 0.08, y = 0.04
           -   All placed at z = 0.781. Rotation 0.
           
           This should give me stable, collision-free placements within `v16`'s boundaries. Now, I'll convert my plan into the required format.
