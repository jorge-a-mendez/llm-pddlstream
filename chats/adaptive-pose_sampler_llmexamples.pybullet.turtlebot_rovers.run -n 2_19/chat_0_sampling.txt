User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is largely enclosed by walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical barrier at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the scene, particularly in the upper right and upper left quadrants, and some near the bottom.
           
           The target is at (0.91 0.49). I need to find positions within a radius of 2 from this point. This means positions roughly within the square defined by x in [-1.09, 2.91] and y in [-1.51, 2.49]. I will also keep in mind the overall robot x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           I'll try to find points in different directions from the target, making sure to avoid known obstacles and the central x=0 barrier.
           
           1.  **Directly in front/right:** A point like (1.5, 0.49) is to the right of the target, within range, and seems clear of major obstacles.
           2.  **Below/left:** A point like (0.5, -1.0) is below and slightly left of the target, within range, and seems to avoid the central barrier. I'll need to check the small obstacles in that region.
           3.  **Above/right:** A point like (1.0, 1.5) is above and slightly right of the target. This area has some obstacles (7, 18, 20) but there might be a clear spot.
           
           Positions:
           (1.5 0.49)
           (0.5 -1.0)
           (1.0 1.5)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now (-0.6019 1.837). The previous target point (0.91 0.49) was different. The provided failures relate to the new target point, which is important. The target is in the upper left quadrant.
           
           The previous proposed positions (1.5, 0.49) and (0.5, -1.0) failed for the *current* target point, likely due to the central x=0 barrier or other obstacles obstructing the view. The current target point is to the left of the x=0 barrier.
           
           My range for positions is now within 2 units of (-0.6019, 1.837), so roughly x in [-2.6019, 1.3981] and y in [-0.163, 3.837]. Combined with the robot's overall limits, this means x in [-2.5, 1.3981] and y in [-0.163, 2.5].
           
           Obstacles in the upper left quadrant (near target):
           8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) - this is a large obstacle to the left and slightly below the target.
           10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) - this is close to the target, directly to its right and slightly below. This is likely the cause of previous LOS failures from the right.
           12: ((-1.27, 1.47), (-1.13, 1.61))
           14: ((-1.16, 2.21), (-1.02, 2.35)) - this is above and to the left of the target
           19: ((-0.65, 1.78), (-0.55, 1.88)) - this is *very* close to the target! This one is probably directly occluding.
           
           Given the target is at (-0.6019, 1.837), and obstacle 19 is ((-0.65, 1.78), (-0.55, 1.88)), this obstacle is essentially at the target point! It will be very hard to get a clear view. I need to find positions that can "look over" or "around" this obstacle.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The target is very close to obstacle 19.
           
           1.  **Directly left of target, slightly further out:** (-1.5, 1.837) - This might give a view around obstacle 19 and avoid obstacle 8. It's within range from the target.
           2.  **Below the target, avoiding central column:** (-0.6019, 0.5) - This is within range and avoids the x=0 column. It should also be clear of most obstacles in the upper region.
           3.  **Above the target, slightly right:** (-0.4, 2.2) - This position is close to the y=2.5 wall, but also might offer a view over obstacle 19, avoiding obstacle 10 and 14.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.5 1.837)
           (-0.6019 0.5)
           (-0.4 2.2)

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point has changed *again*. It is now (1.886, 1.998). The failures from the previous request relate to this new target point.
           
           My previous positions were:
           1.  (-1.5, 1.837) -- failed due to no line of sight. This is expected as it's on the opposite side of the x=0 barrier.
           2.  (-0.6019, 0.5) -- failed due to no line of sight. Also expected due to the x=0 barrier.
           3.  (-0.4, 2.2) -- collided with obstacle 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)). This is good information. My proposed point (-0.4, 2.2) falls within this AABB, confirming a collision.
           
           The current target (1.886, 1.998) is in the upper right quadrant, close to the wall and several obstacles.
           The range for positions is within 2 units of (1.886, 1.998), so roughly x in [-0.114, 3.886] and y in [-0.002, 3.998]. Combined with the robot's overall limits, this means x in [-0.114, 2.5] and y in [-0.002, 2.5].
           
           Obstacles in the upper right quadrant (near target):
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This obstacle is large and close to the target. The target itself is inside this obstacle's general area. (1.886, 1.998) is inside ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)).
           18: ((2.29, 1.82), (2.43, 1.97)) - To the right of the target.
           20: ((1.84, 1.96), (1.92, 2.03)) - *Extremely* close to the target, almost surrounding it. The target (1.886, 1.998) is contained within obstacle 20. This is similar to the last request where the target was inside an obstacle.
           
           This is a difficult situation where the target is inside an obstacle (or an obstacle is very nearly around it, 20 is a small box. 7 is a larger box encompassing it). This means I need to find positions *outside* of these obstacles but still within the max range of 2.
           
           1.  **To the right of the target:** (2.0, 1.5) - This is within range, outside of the immediate obstacles (7 and 20), and within the x=2.5 wall. This might be a good viewing angle.
           2.  **Below the target:** (1.5, 1.0) - This is within range, moves away from the cluster of obstacles, and provides a clear view.
           3.  **Left of the target, but still in the right half of the scene:** (0.5, 1.998) - This is to the left of the x=0 line, within the max range. It needs to avoid any other potential obstacles, but seems like a good diverse direction.
           
           Positions:
           (2.0 1.5)
           (1.5 1.0)
           (0.5 1.998)
