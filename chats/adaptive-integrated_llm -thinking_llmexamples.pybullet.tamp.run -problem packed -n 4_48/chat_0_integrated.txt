User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.055, -0.348), (0.021, -0.273)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.076, -0.463), (0.175, -0.364)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.228, -0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.907, 0.42).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.033, 0.281, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.158, 0.987).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.017, -0.311, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.736, 0.677).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.125, -0.413, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.935, 0.355).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.179, -0.549), (0.277, -0.45)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.011, 0.237), (0.077, 0.325)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           The goal is to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from table v11 to a surface v18 using a robot. The robot has two arms and is initially at base configuration v3. The objects are initially 'on' table v11.  The problem structure implies a Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) setting, where I need to find sequences of `pick` and `place` actions. However, the available action instances are extremely limited: only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is permitted.  Given the goal 'on' predicates, I *must* generate `pick` and `place` actions if I am to solve the problem.
           
           **Analyzing Available Actions and Preconditions**
           
           The robot state and objects are described using predicates like `on`, `atpose`, `handempty`, etc. The only available `move_base` action, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does *not* move the robot's base. It effectively re-establishes `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()`. `pick` and `place` actions require kinesthetic knowledge which, in this context, are not provided (only placeholders are noted).
             
           **The Core Contradiction and Unsolvability**
           
           Crucially, the prompt states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." This implies I can only use the specified `move_base` action instance.  Because `pick` and `place` instances are not in the list,  this restriction means that achieving the goal is *impossible*. I need to "pick" the objects and "place" the objects, and the available `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` action does not perform a meaningful base movement and, more importantly, `pick` or `place` instances are not available at all.
           
           **Reaching an Immovable Object: Conclusion**
           
           Given the provided restrictions, a valid plan cannot be generated. I cannot alter the `on` predicates that describe the initial and goal states. Any plan to place the objects on v18 requires the use of  `pick` and `place` actions that are not provided. The objective is hence unattainable using the allowed action instances.
