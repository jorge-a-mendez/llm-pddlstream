           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.055, -0.348), (0.021, -0.273)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.076, -0.463), (0.175, -0.364)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.228, -0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.907, 0.42).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.033, 0.281, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.158, 0.987).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.017, -0.311, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.736, 0.677).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.125, -0.413, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.935, 0.355).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.179, -0.549), (0.277, -0.45)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.011, 0.237), (0.077, 0.325)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Move Objects onto a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I've got a problem. I need to move four objects, let's call them v8, v12, v14, and v16, and place them all onto object v18. I'm going to have to use `pick` and `place` actions to do this. Luckily, I've got a robot with two arms, v4 and v6, and both are currently empty-handed (`handempty`). The robot's base configuration is currently v3.
           
           The ultimate goal is that each object is `on(v18)`. In order to do this, each object, v8, v12, v14, and v16, needs to be placed at a pose *p* such that `supported(obj, p, v18)` and `atpose(obj, p)` are true.
           
           I have a set of continuous parameters, which start with '#'. I see that `#o2` is a pose, and there's a bunch of `supported` facts: `supported(v16, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, `supported(v14, #o2, v18)`, and `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. This seems promising; it looks like `#o2` could be a target pose for all the objects, but there is a problem. The problem states that if multiple objects are placed on the same pose starting with '#' the continuous values need to be different for each object. Since there's a `pose(obj, #o2)` constraint for each object, and each one needs a separate pose, I have to assume that `#o2` is actually shorthand for a family of poses, or I need to use different pose names for each object.
           
           Looking at the initial state, v14 is at v15, v12 is at v13, v16 is at v17, and v8 is at v9. They are all on v11 currently. The target surface is v18.
           
           There are `kin` predicates that define the robot's capabilities with arm v4. Each predicate includes `#o1` (a grasp), `#o3` (a base configuration), and `#o4` (a trajectory). The facts are provided for picking and placing each object.
           
           I need to get each object from where it is on v11 to a spot on v18. I only have one `move_base` action: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means the robot's base can only stay in its current configuration, v3. All `pick` and `place` actions are going to require the base configuration to be v3. This is fine. Since I'm staying in one spot, v3, this constraint isn't a problem. I'll simply assume that `#o3` is equal to `v3`.
           
           The problem statement also states that only the provided actions can be used in the plan. This is fine because the actions for picking and placing are valid using these `kin` predicates, as they include the grasp `#o1`, base configuration `v3`, and trajectory `#o4`.
           
           I'll proceed assuming that `#o3` can be instantiated to `v3`, meaning all `pick` and `place` actions need `q=v3`.
           
           Since I need to place objects at the same target pose (on v18) but the problem statement says I have to provide different continuous values, I'll define distinct poses, let's say `#o2_v8`, `#o2_v12`, `#o2_v14`, and `#o2_v16`. Then, I'll instantiate `#o2` to each of these. I need to generate an 8-step plan to move them to their final destination, and since I need to give a different pose for each object, I will define a placement pose for each object.
           
           The plan looks like this for one object, v8:
           1. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4_v8_pick)`: Pick `v8` from `v9` with arm `v4`.
           2. `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #o4_v8_place)`: Place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#o2_v8`.
             I'll repeat this for v12, v14, and v16.
           
           Since the problem also states the bounding box of the target

(Thoughts: **The Impasse of a Single Action**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a very limited playing field. The user specified a list of *valid actions* and my previous approach, which involved `pick` and `place` actions, is immediately ruled out. The only action available is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This is a big problem because the goal, as I understand it, is to get four objects: `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto `v18`.
           
           My initial state analysis shows the following:
           
           *   `v14` is on `v11` because `atpose(v14, v15)` and `supported(v14, v15, v11)`.
           *   `v12` is on `v11` because `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v11)`.
           *   `v16` is on `v11` because `atpose(v16, v17)` and `supported(v16, v17, v11)`.
           *   `v8` is on `v11` because `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`.
           
           Essentially, I need to get each of those four objects off of `v11` and onto `v18`.  Given the only valid action is `move_base`, this seems impossible. I would need `pick` and `place` capabilities, or some other mechanism to manipulate these objects. But they aren't available, and simply moving my base isn't going to cut it. It's a fundamental mismatch between the goal and the available resources.  Therefore, I have to conclude that, under these severely constrained circumstances, this goal is unattainable.
