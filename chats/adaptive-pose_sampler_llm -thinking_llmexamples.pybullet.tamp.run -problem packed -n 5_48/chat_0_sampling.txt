(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5) on surface 0.  Given the object's nearly square dimensions (`size_x` and `size_y` are close), and the surface's rectangular bounding box, I can simplify the task by using a fixed rotation (`theta = 0`) for all placements. This avoids unnecessary complexity in the AABB calculations.  The key is ensuring the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface's bounds.
           
           I've calculated the object's half-extents (`half_size_x` and `half_size_y`) and determined the valid ranges for `x` and `y` coordinates to ensure stability: approximately `x in [-0.0866, 0.0866]` and `y in [-0.0866, 0.0866]`.
           
           To achieve a diverse set of 50 placements, I'll create a 10x5 grid within the valid region. This provides a reasonably even distribution of placements, with `step_x = 0.01924517011333016` and `step_y = 0.043301632754992875`.  The surface index is always 0. Thetas are all 0. The x and y values for the 50 points can be calculated and combined with surf_idx and theta.
           
           Here are the 50 placements:

(Thoughts: **Placing Object 8 on Surface 0: A Collision-Free Strategy**
           
           Okay, I've got a new object, ID 8, to place on surface 0.  Object 5 is already happily settled at (0, 0, -0.08660326550998572, -0.08660326550998575), taking up some space. I need to get object 8 stable on the surface, but *without* any collisions.
           
           Object 8 has dimensions, but I will use `theta = 0` for simplicity.  Surface 0 has its bounds, I've done the math to figure out the allowed ranges for object 8's center coordinates on that surface, considering its own size. Now for the crucial part: avoiding Object 5.
           
           Object 5's placement is in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  I've calculated its AABB, basically a bounding box, to know exactly where it is. To avoid a collision, object 8's AABB cannot overlap with Object 5's AABB.
           
           I decided a good strategy to be to place Object 8 in the top-right corner relative to Object 5. I calculated the precise minimum x and y coordinates object 8 must have to *guarantee* no collision. I divided the available space into a grid structure.
           
           To get the 50 desired placements, I generated grid points within two distinct regions: one to the right of Object 5, and one above Object 5, each guaranteed not to collide. This should provide the necessary diversity to get 50 different placements within bounds, and safe in terms of collisions. I created the grid structures with detailed calculations, and then listed the placements that resulted from these grids. And I have them now, a full set of valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Here's the plan to place Object 7 on Surface 0, avoiding collisions with the fixed obstacles, Object 5 and Object 8:**
           
           I'm aiming to find 50 stable placement locations for a new object (ID: 7) on Surface 0. Object 5 and Object 8 are already in place and must be treated as immovable obstacles. The size of the surface and object dimensions are known. I'll need to carefully calculate where to position Object 7 to prevent it from colliding with these existing objects. I have analyzed the dimensions and positions of the obstacles.
           
           **Key Calculations and Considerations:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** The surface boundaries restrict where I can place Object 7.
           *   **Object 7's Size:** This dictates the minimum distance Object 7 must maintain from the surface edges and the other objects. I will use `theta = 0` for this problem
           *   **Obstacle AABB:** I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for both Object 5 and Object 8. The AABB simplifies collision checking.
           *   **Combined Occupied Space:** By merging the AABBs of Objects 5 and 8, I can get a rough estimate of the area to avoid.
           
           **Placement Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Region Definition:** I've identified two primary regions where Object 7 can be safely placed:
               *   **Region A ("Above Both"):** This is the area above both Object 5 and Object 8, ensuring a vertical separation to avoid any overlap.
               *   **Region B ("Right of Both"):** This is the area to the right of both objects, again guaranteeing a horizontal separation.
           
           2.  **Grid Placement:** I'll establish a regular grid (8x5) for Region A and another (2x5) for Region B. These grids provide a structured method to ensure a uniform distribution of Object 7.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:** During grid generation, I will always check that Object 7's bounds are not overlapping the bounds from Objects 5 or 8's AABB.
           
           I have verified and confirmed that these regions prevent any form of collision with existing objects or surface. I can now proceed with generating the placement coordinates within the pre-defined regions.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new object (ID: 4) on Surface 0, ensuring that there are no collisions with existing objects (ID: 5, 8, and 7).
           
           **Surface and Object Details:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** Defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **New Object (ID: 4):** Has a size of approximately 0.073532 in both the X and Y dimensions.
           *   **Existing Objects (Obstacles):** I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for objects 5, 8, and 7 to understand their spatial arrangement. These objects, based on their given placements, form a contiguous block in the lower-left area of the surface.
           
           **Obstacle AABB Analysis and Free Space Identification:**
           
           I've examined the AABBs of the obstacles closely. The objects' arrangement suggests that the top right portion of Surface 0 has more available space. The region `x <= 0.036449`, `y <= 0.048535` is largely occupied, based on the combined size of all three obstacles.
           
           **Strategy for Placement:**
           
           The region `x > 0.036449`, `y > 0.048535` is the only safe area where the new object (ID: 4) can be safely placed.
           
           I will:
           
           1.  Create a 5 x 10 grid within the right portion of Surface 0.
           2.  The bottom left corner of the grid will be the bottom left boundary of the surface combined with the obstacle's total size, which is approximately (0.07321527359986846, -0.09823396982771247).
           3.  Place the new object into the grid to make sure I get a safe amount of space.
           
           This should yield the required 50 non-colliding placements for the object. This is ideal and easy to calculate.

           I've examined the AABBs of the obstacles closely. The objects' arrangement suggests that the top right portion of Surface 0 has more available space. The region `x <= 0.036449`, `y <= 0.048535` is largely occupied, based on the combined size of all three obstacles.
           
           **Strategy for Placement:**
           
           The region `x > 0.036449`, `y > 0.048535` is the only safe area where the new object (ID: 4) can be safely placed.
           
           I will:
           
           1.  Create a 5 x 10 grid within the right portion of Surface 0.
           2.  The bottom left corner of the grid will be the bottom left boundary of the surface combined with the obstacle's total size, which is approximately (0.07321527359986846, -0.09823396982771247).
           3.  Place the new object into the grid to make sure I get a safe amount of space.
           
           This should yield the required 50 non-colliding placements for the object. This is ideal and easy to calculate.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           I'm tasked with placing 50 stable instances of Object 6, a nearly square object, on Surface 0, treating Objects 5, 8, 7, and 4 as fixed obstacles with no rotation. I begin by analyzing the surface's boundaries and Object 6's dimensions to determine the valid region for the object's center without considering obstacles.
           
           The dimensions of the surface and object lead to the surface x and y bounds, then x_center and y_center valid placement values. Next I must determine where on the surface can I place this object and not collide with the obstacle AABBs.
           
           The first step is understanding the shapes and positions of these obstacles.  I have their centers and half-extents. It turns out that a grid search is the most reliable way. I start to enumerate the locations of each of these obstacles on the surface.
           
           To locate the object, a precise, step-by-step approach is crucial. The coordinates of the centers of the obstacles and their half-extents provide vital spatial information. The surface boundaries define the object's valid placement zone.
           
           The next step involves a collision check. I examine the surface, taking into account the AABBs of all the existing obstacles and define the constraints for the new object. I check for valid space to place the object based on x, y, with the surface bounds and obstacles. The approach is to check for collision between the AABB of the new object and each obstacle AABB.
           
           This systematic approach requires detailed calculations.  I need a set of valid x,y coordinates and an algorithm. I can build a 10x10 grid and filter out the results by checking for surface boundaries and collision with the AABBs of each existing obstacle.
           
           The goal is a precise and reliable solution that yields at least 50 valid placements for Object 6.
