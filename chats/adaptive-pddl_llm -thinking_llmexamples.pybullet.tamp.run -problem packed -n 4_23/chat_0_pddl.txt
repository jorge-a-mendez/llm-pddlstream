           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Feasibility Assessment**
           
           Okay, here's the situation as I see it. My objective is to place four objects (v8, v12, v14, and v16) onto a designated supporting region, v18.  Currently, they're all resting on v11 at distinct poses (v9, v13, v15, and v17, respectively). To satisfy the goal condition `on(object, v18)`, each object needs to be at its specific pose `#o2` on v18.
           
           Initially, I looked at the requirements. The solution involves picking each object from its current support (v11) and placing it onto v18 at the correct pose.  This requires `pick` and `place` actions which are predicated on the `canmove()` flag being true.
           
           However, the action instance list only provides `move_base` action, which simply moves the robot from one location to another. This action *sets* the `canmove()` flag to *false*. As a result, no `pick` or `place` operations can be undertaken.
           
           Thus, the plan is not feasible. The lack of `pick` and `place` actions, which are fundamental to achieving the "on" condition, makes this goal unattainable given the current available action instances.  I can't manipulate the objects to get them to their desired final position because the actions that could do that are not provided. The `move_base` action simply leaves the goal state unchanged. There is no way to pick up the items, and no available action to place them.
