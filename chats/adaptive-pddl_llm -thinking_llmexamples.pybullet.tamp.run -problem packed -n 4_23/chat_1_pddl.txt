               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unattainability Analysis**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan that positions objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` atop object `v18`. To achieve this, I need to ensure that each object is `supported` by `v18` and positioned at a specific pose (`#o2`). The initial state shows these objects supported by `v11` and positioned at their respective initial poses.
           
           The actions I can use are `move_base`, `pick`, and `place`. `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. The robot arm (`v4`) is `handempty` and `ataconf(v5)`, with its base initially at `bconf v3`.
           
           My initial assessment suggests that I should pick up each object from `v11` and place it onto `v18`. However, upon delving into the `kin` (kinematics) relations, which dictate the feasibility of pick and place actions, I've encountered a critical impediment. The `kin` relations specify that all pick and place actions must be performed with the robot's base configuration set to `#o3`. However, the initial state only provides `atbconf(v3)` and the only allowed `move_base` action instance is `(move_base v3 v3)`, which keeps the robot at its initial `bconf`.
           
           This means that the robot *cannot* move to the required base configuration `#o3` to execute any of the pick or place actions. Since achieving `atbconf(#o3)` is a necessary precondition for picking and placing any of the objects, and given the available actions, it's impossible to reach that configuration, I must conclude that the given goal is currently *unreachable* with the specified initial state and available actions.
