(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, which is an AABB centered at (0,0). Object ID 5 has dimensions of approximately 0.074185 x 0.074185 (almost a square), which I'll call `obj_size`.  A stable placement requires the object's AABB to be entirely within the surface's AABB.  The object can be rotated, and I need to account for this.
           
           To start, I define the key parameters: `obj_size_x`, `obj_size_y` and `surf_0_lower_x`, `surf_0_lower_y`, `surf_0_upper_x`, `surf_0_upper_y`. I calculate the effective dimensions of the rotated object's AABB using the formula `effective_x = abs(obj_size_x * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * sin(theta))` and `effective_y = abs(obj_size_x * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_size_y * cos(theta))`, where `theta` is the rotation angle.  Because the object is nearly square, the rotation's impact on these dimensions will be limited.  However, this makes a rotation of `pi/4` (45 degrees) the worst case to consider.
           
           The surface 0 has a width and height of 0.27. I approximate the object's size as `0.074185`.  For `theta = 0`, the effective dimensions are close to the object size which helps to start calculations.
           
           I then determine the valid center coordinates (x, y) for placement, ensuring the object's AABB remains within the surface's AABB for a given rotation. The centers can be in a square with side length of approximately 0.0979 at `theta = 0`.  Then I analyze `theta = pi/4` and derive the valid range for `(x, y)` which is approximately 0.0825.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll select several rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2). For each angle, I derive the valid x and y ranges. Because of the symmetry, this should provide enough range. Since `s_x = s_y`, I compute the `effective_dim(theta)` as `S * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to simplify computations.
           
           For each rotation angle, I create a 5x2 grid of (x, y) coordinates within the allowed range. These 10 placement candidates, spread around the surface, are enough to meet the 50 placement goal, as it provides enough variety.  This structured sampling, ensures a robust set of object poses.
           
           The final output is a list of tuples in the format `(0, theta, x, y)`: `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` representing valid placements.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to position object with ID 4 (a square, by the way) on surface 0 without it bumping into the already-placed object with ID 5. I've got the dimensions and placement data for both objects, and I'm treating this as a classic collision avoidance problem with a few wrinkles.
           
           First, I figured out the bounding box (AABB) of object 5, which is currently sitting in the bottom-left corner of the surface.  This AABB will be my "no-go" zone for object 4. I carefully calculated the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of object 5, based on its size and placement angle (which is 0 degrees, making things simpler). The x-range of that box is about [-0.135, -0.06] and y-range is also [-0.135, -0.06].
           
           Next, I need to understand where I *can* place object 4. Since it is a square, its effective dimensions do not change with rotation. The valid placement region for object 4 will be restricted by the surface boundaries and object 5's AABB. I want to generate a series of safe positions for it.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Generate Candidate Positions:** I'll set up a grid within the surface boundaries. First, I will establish a rectangle (AABB) centered on the surface where the object can be centered. Then, I check all of them to make sure no two of the two AABB boxes (object 4 and object 5) overlap.
           
           2.  **Rotation Check**: Since the object can be rotated, I am going to make some calculations with the objects rotated to check each combination of placement angle and (x, y) coordinates.
           
           3.  **Collision Check:** Then, for each potential position and angle, I will do a rigorous collision check between the AABBs of objects 4 and 5. This is the heart of the matter. My collision check will boil down to one of two conditions: the minimum x of Object 4's bounding box has to be to the right of the maximum x value of the Object 5 bounding box or the minimum y of Object 4's bounding box has to be above the maximum y value of Object 5's bounding box. That will ensure that there are no overlaps.
           
           4.  **Repeat and Save:** If the test fails, I'll discard that placement. I'll need to repeat the test with enough placements to make the total placements number to 50. I then will save the "safe" positions (x, y, theta) as my output.
           
           So, it's a mix of geometric reasoning and iterative testing. If I implement the loops, I will have all of the valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: A Comprehensive Plan**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable locations for a new, almost-square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, taking into account two existing objects (IDs 5 and 4). This is a spatial reasoning problem where the key is to avoid any collisions.
           
           My first thought is to break this down into smaller, manageable chunks. I’ll start by understanding the "forbidden" zones defined by the existing objects. I need to calculate their AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) to do this. I've already determined those:
           
           *   **Object 5 (ID 5):** Occupies the region `[-0.135, -0.0608149459294511] x [-0.135, -0.060814945929451125]`
           *   **Object 4 (ID 4):** Occupies the region `[-0.135, -0.04108538876466116] x [-0.04695730561766942, 0.04695730561766942]`
           
           Next, I need to understand the dimensions of my new object. Its size is very close to a square: `0.07272871770907702` x `0.07272871770907707`. This means I can simplify the math by working with an "effective" size that is consistent regardless of rotation.  I've chosen to use 0.072728717709077045 as this number.
           
           Now, strategy. I'll take a two-pronged approach.
           
           1.  **Placement with 0 rotation**.  I can generate a grid of candidate placements. For each candidate location, I will calculate its AABB and check for any intersection with the AABBs of objects 4 and 5.
           
               Given the nearly square form of this shape, the simplest approach is to make a 25 element grid of points in the free space to the right, and then find five more points in the top left corner (without overlap) to make 30 places. To guarantee placement of these points, I will use line segments with gaps. I determined the precise dimensions of a set to generate the first placement locations (with `theta = 0.0` rotations), but found I needed to adjust the boundaries to avoid collisions. I will also place some at a 0.0 rotation, ensuring they don't overlap.
           2.  **Placement with rotation = pi/2**: Generate a grid in the same manner as above. Then I'll check each.
           
           I'll iterate through these grids, checking for valid, collision-free placements. Using AABBs, intersection checks are computationally cheap. If I encounter a collision during AABB checks, I'll discard that location.
           
           Finally, I will use a reliable collision function to verify my calculations and identify any gaps in my logic or small numerical errors. I will ensure all 50 locations are valid!
