           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Plan to New Axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which boils down to getting two images and two analyses.  Initially, the rovers (`v12`, `v14`) are at `v13` and `v15` respectively, and they're free to do their thing.
           
           Since there's no way to move the rovers beyond their starting configs, I'm assuming that the continuous parameters starting with `#` in the initial state effectively *refer* to the current positions.  This interpretation is key: any `comvisible` or `imagevisible` predicates that use a '#' configuration *actually* mean the rover uses it's current pose or orientation to achieve the task.
           
           With that in mind, my plan is:
           
           **For analysis:**
           
           1.  Rover `v12` (`v13`) samples rock `v3` using `sample_rock(v12, v13, v3, v16)`
           2.  `v12` sends that analysis to lander `v9` using `send_analysis(v12, v13, #o1, v9, v3)`.
           3.  Similarly, `v14` (`v15`) samples rock `v8`.
           4.  `v14` sends its analysis.
               
           **For images:**
           
           1.  `v12` captures `v17` via `calibrate` and `take_image`  (`v13`).
           2.  `v12` sends that image.
           3.  `v14` captures `v18` via `calibrate` and `take_image` (`v15`).
           4.  `v14` sends that image.
           
           This approach *assumes* the '#' configurations are effectively the current rover poses due to the lack of allowed moves.  The prompt's continuous value rule only applies to configurations, not rays (`#o1`, `#o4`).  Given the current configuration, all preconditions become true: all tasks are achievable. This interpretation hinges on the fact that only self-loop `move` actions are permitted. Therefore, the problem is solvable, and all goals are reachable!

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(sample_rock v12 v13 v3 v16) , (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v3) , (sample_rock v14 v15 v8 v16) , (send_analysis v14 v15 #o1 v9 v8) , (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (calibrate v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v14 v15 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (send_image v14 v15 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Re-Evaluating Plan Feasibility**
           
           Okay, the user flagged that the previous plan used actions outside the allowed action instances. Time to dive back in. I need to figure out if it's even *possible* to achieve the goal with this severely restricted action set.
           
           First, let's refresh the allowed actions: we've got a couple of no-op `move` actions and some `drop_rock` actions dependent on `full` preconditions.
           
           The goal is to satisfy `receivedimage` for two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, and `receivedanalysis` for rocks of types `v2` and `v6`. I know that `take_image` followed by `send_image` can get me `receivedimage`, and `sample_rock` followed by `send_analysis` can get me `receivedanalysis`.
           
           But here's the kicker: none of those crucial actions (`take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, or even `calibrate`) are in the allowed list! My current analysis confirms what I suspected: I can't achieve those target predicates with only `move` and `drop_rock`.  The `drop_rock` actions are irrelevant here since they require the `full` precondition, which is false initially. I can't change that with a `move` and I don't see any mechanism to make it true.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint of *only* using the provided actions, this goal is utterly unreachable. The problem is unsolvable with the current action instance restrictions. I need to circle back and inform the user.
