           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this, given my expertise in planning and problem-solving:
           
           My goal is `new-axiom@0()`. Looking at the definition, it has a conjunction of several conditions. The first four conditions `atconf` and `free` are already true in the initial state, which is great.  However, the core of the problem lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. I need to achieve those.
           
           To get `receivedimage(?o, ?m)`, I need to use the `send_image` action. The preconditions are clear: I'll need `comvisible`, `objective`, `mode`, `haveimage`, and `atconf`, and I need to avoid any `blocked` rays.
           
           Now, to get `haveimage(?v, ?o, ?m)`, I'd use the `take_image` action. This has its own preconditions related to `imagevisible`, the camera being onboard, the camera supporting the mode, the rover's configuration, and calibration, along with avoiding any blocked rays. 
           
           So the process looks like I need to calibrate a camera, take the picture, and then send it. The available objects are: rovers, cameras, modes, objectives to image, and the lander. I'll pick rover `v14` and camera `v10` because they are already linked via `onboard(v10, v14)` and `supports(v10, v11)`. The configuration of `v14` is `v15` according to the initial state, and I can assume that there are no blocked rays. 
           
           Now, here's where things get tricky. I need to use the `calibrate` action to make sure the camera has imagevisible, and I need the configuration to be consistent for actions like `take_image`. The problem is, there's a disconnect between my actions and what's possible in the given scene. The facts imply that `v14` is at `#o3` for imaging, but the initial state says it's at `v15`.  While the system may implicitly handle the differences between these positions, there are no actions for me to move the rover to the correct configurations. Also, I don't see any `calibrate`, `take_image` or `send_image` actions available to me. The only actions available are *move* and *drop_rock*.
           
           This is a problem!  I've thoroughly checked the provided action instances.  I can only use `move` actions to move the rover and `drop_rock`. No `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, or `send_analysis` actions are included, so it's impossible for me to satisfy the `receivedimage` predicates because the required actions are not available.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can't be achieved from the initial state with the provided actions. The `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts are not present, and the actions to make them true are not given. So, I will not return any plan.
