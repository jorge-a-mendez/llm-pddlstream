User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.331, -0.192, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.019).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.367, -0.228), (-4.295, -0.156)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects, some of which are stackable and graspable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently empty. There are three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. `v8` is on `v11` at pose `v9`, `v12` is on `v14` at pose `v13`, and `v15` is on `v11` at pose `v16`. The robot is at base configuration `v3`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true.
           From the initial state, we know `type(v8, v17)` and `type(v12, v17)`. So either `v8` or `v12` can be the `?green` object.
           We also know `stackable(v8, v18)` and `stackable(v12, v18)`.
           The goal requires one of these objects to be `on` `v18`. Since neither `v8` nor `v12` is currently on `v18`, we need to pick one of them and place it on `v18`.
           
           Let's choose `v8` as the `?green` object.
           `v8` is currently at `v9` on `v11`. We need to move it to `v18`.
           We have `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` for picking `v8` from `v9`.
           We also have `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` for placing `v8` at `#o2` on `v18`, since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state.
           
           However, the only available action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action does not change the state of any object or achieve any of the necessary preconditions to pick or place objects. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of available actions.
