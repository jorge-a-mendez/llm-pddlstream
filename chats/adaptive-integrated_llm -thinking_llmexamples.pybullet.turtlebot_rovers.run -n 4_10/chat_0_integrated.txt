           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`**, and I've carefully analyzed the conditions that define it.  Expanding the axiom, I see a set of prerequisites: certain objects must be *at* specific configurations, and I need to gather and transmit images and analyses.
           
           I started by checking the initial state against the 'atconf' and 'free' conditions; they are all satisfied.  However, the core of the problem lies in the need for `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. To get `receivedimage(O, M)` and `receivedanalysis(R)`, I'd need to use actions such as `send_image` and `send_analysis`. However, according to the prompt I must only use a specific set of given "valid action instances", and these actions are *not* included.
           
           I've examined the given `move` actions. These are limited and don't allow the robots to move to configurations that are necessary for either taking images or communicating with the lander. Furthermore, the available `move` actions are self-loops; the robot remains in the same configuration. This makes moving the robot to the appropriate configurations impossible.
           
           The available continuous parameters `#o0` and `#o3` are crucial for the image and communication operations. It's clear that the rovers need to be at configurations such as `#o3` for images and `#o0` for communication. However, no `move` action explicitly allows the rovers to *reach* these configurations.
           
           The prompt explicitly states, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."  Since the crucial actions, such as `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` that are needed to satisfy the goal, are *not* included in the allowed list, achieving the goal is impossible.
           
           I've thoroughly checked all available information, including constraints on action instances and configurations and I am forced to conclude that **the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.**
