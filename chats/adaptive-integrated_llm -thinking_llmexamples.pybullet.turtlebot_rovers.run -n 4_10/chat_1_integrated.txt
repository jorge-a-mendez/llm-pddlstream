           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Thinking on Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to some key conditions: specific images must be received, analyses for certain rock types are needed, and the rovers need to be in their original configurations.
           
           First, I see the conditions that I already have, so I need to get the image received (v17, v18, v19, v20). I also need to make sure I am receiving analysis from a rock that is v2 (stone) and also from a rock that is v6 (soil).
           
           Since the initial conditions are set, I need to focus on what's missing: those *receivedimage* and *receivedanalysis* predicates.  I've got two rovers at my disposal: `v12` and `v14`. I'll use rover `v12` for all the heavy lifting, as both rovers can access cameras/stores in their initial state. `v14` will stay put.
           
           I know I can `take_image` using a `take_image` predicate to get `haveimage`, and then `send_image` to actually get the `receivedimage` condition met. Same with analysis:  `sample_rock` to get the `analyzed` and then use `send_analysis` to send it and get `receivedanalysis`.
           
           So, the plan unfolds like this:
           
           1.  **Image Collection and Transmission (Rover v12):**
               *   Move from current configuration (v13) to a location (#o3) where the images are visible.
               *   Calibrate the camera.
               *   Take the four required images.
               *   Move to a com location (#o0)
               *   Send all four images to the lander (v9).
           
           2.  **Rock Analysis and Transmission (Rover v12):**
               *   Move to a sampling configuration (#o5).
               *   Sample one of the type `v2` rock (rock v4).
               *   Move to a comm config (#o0).
               *   Send the analysis of rock v4 (from our data, it is a rock of type v2).
               *   Move back to sampling config and drop the v4 rock.
               *   Sample one of type v6 (rock v7).
               *   Move back to comm config.
               *   Send the analysis of rock v7 (from our data, this is a soil sample, type v6).
               *   Drop the rock sample
           
           3.  **Return to Initial Configuration (Rover v12):**
               *   Move back to the start location.
           
           That takes care of the image and rock analysis conditions. Now, the final thing to do is make sure that the axiom `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` remains true. Since `v14` doesn't move and *v12* ends the plan at location `v13`, the axiom will be met.
           
           Now for the *continuous* stuff. I need to make some continuous calculations for positioning. The prompt says *I must compute a reasonable continuous object value*.
           -   `#o0`: For `comvisible`. This will make the rover be able to communicate with the lander. Location: `(0.0, -1.0)`. This point gives a reasonable view of the lander for communication, since the starting location will not be able to send an image.
           
           -   `#o3`: For `imagevisible`.  We need to make it able to see the images. We will choose a location for the camera. Location: `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
           
           -   `#o5`: For the `above` predicate, where sampling can occur. We'll set this location to be the center to get all rocks: `(0.075, -0.665)`. This will allow me to sample.
           
           *I just need to determine that those coordinates are appropriate for all the objectives.*
           
           Since everything is in initial configuration and `free(v12,v16)` and `free(v14,v16)` remain true, I think it will be ok and be able to receive images and analyses to meet the goal condition.
           
)

Model:     **My Thinking on Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's the game plan. The goal, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to some key conditions: specific images must be received, analyses for certain rock types are needed, and the rovers need to be in their original configurations.
           
           First, I see the conditions that I already have, so I need to get the image received (v17, v18, v19, v20). I also need to make sure I am receiving analysis from a rock that is v2 (stone) and also from a rock that is v6 (soil).
           
           Since the initial conditions are set, I need to focus on what's missing: those *receivedimage* and *receivedanalysis* predicates.  I've got two rovers at my disposal: `v12` and `v14`. I'll use rover `v12` for all the heavy lifting, as both rovers can access cameras/stores in their initial state. `v14` will stay put.
           
           I know I can `take_image` using a `take_image` predicate to get `haveimage`, and then `send_image` to actually get the `receivedimage` condition met. Same with analysis:  `sample_rock` to get the `analyzed` and then use `send_analysis` to send it and get `receivedanalysis`.
           
           So, the plan unfolds like this:
           
           1.  **Image Collection and Transmission (Rover v12):**
               *   Move from current configuration (v13) to a location (#o3) where the images are visible.
               *   Calibrate the camera.
               *   Take the four required images.
               *   Move to a com location (#o0)
               *   Send all four images to the lander (v9).
           
           2.  **Rock Analysis and Transmission (Rover v12):**
               *   Move to a sampling configuration (#o5).
               *   Sample one of the type `v2` rock (rock v4).
               *   Move to a comm config (#o0).
               *   Send the analysis of rock v4 (from our data, it is a rock of type v2).
               *   Move back to sampling config and drop the v4 rock.
               *   Sample one of type v6 (rock v7).
               *   Move back to comm config.
               *   Send the analysis of rock v7 (from our data, this is a soil sample, type v6).
               *   Drop the rock sample
           
           3.  **Return to Initial Configuration (Rover v12):**
               *   Move back to the start location.
           
           That takes care of the image and rock analysis conditions. Now, the final thing to do is make sure that the axiom `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` remains true. Since `v14` doesn't move and *v12* ends the plan at location `v13`, the axiom will be met.
           
           Now for the *continuous* stuff. I need to make some continuous calculations for positioning. The prompt says *I must compute a reasonable continuous object value*.
           -   `#o0`: For `comvisible`. This will make the rover be able to communicate with the lander. Location: `(0.0, -1.0)`. This point gives a reasonable view of the lander for communication, since the starting location will not be able to send an image.
           
           -   `#o3`: For `imagevisible`.  We need to make it able to see the images. We will choose a location for the camera. Location: `(-1.0, 1.0)`.
           
           -   `#o5`: For the `above` predicate, where sampling can occur. We'll set this location to be the center to get all rocks: `(0.075, -0.665)`. This will allow me to sample.
           
           *I just need to determine that those coordinates are appropriate for all the objectives.*
           
           Since everything is in initial configuration and `free(v12,v16)` and `free(v14,v16)` remain true, I think it will be ok and be able to receive images and analyses to meet the goal condition.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Configuration Strategies**
           
           The previous attempt to find valid rover positions failed due to collision and reachability issues. I need to re-evaluate how to define configurations, specifically for rover *v12*, to successfully complete its tasks.
           
           The initial plan was disrupted by a collision error at a certain configuration for *#o0* and a reachability error for configuration *#o3*. To find valid values, I'm now taking into account:
           
           *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** I must avoid collision with the obstacle *v21*, which is a wall located at *x = 0*. The previous *#o0* value resulted in a collision.
           *   **Line-of-Sight and Distance:** Configurations must ensure the rover can "see" required targets (e.g., lander *v9* for communication, objective *v18* for imaging) and the rover must be within the specified communication and imaging ranges.
           *   **Reachability:** Movement between different configurations must be possible; therefore, a path must exist. This is particularly challenging considering *v21* might restrict movement between the positive and negative *x* regions.
           
           Considering these, my revised plan involves rover *v12* only, which:
           
           *   Will occupy configuration **#o0 at (-0.1, -1.0)** for communication with the lander *v9*.
           *   Will occupy configuration **#o3 at (-0.1, 1.0)** for imaging of the objectives *v17, v18, v19, v20*.
           *   Will occupy configuration **#o5 at (0.5, -0.5)** for sampling the rocks *v4* and *v7*.
           
           The selection of these points is critical. To stay clear of the obstacle *v21*, all configurations are selected outside the range of  *x = (-0.05, 0.05)*. Additionally, the rover must be able to reach these positions from its initial position, which means paths must exist between these configurations that avoid *v21*, especially crossing from the positive-x region to the negative-x region, and vice versa.
           
           The problem includes requirements: the rover *v12* has to image all the objectives, sample the rocks of both types, and send both the images and the analyses to the lander. The goal is achievable if `haveimage` and `analyzed` properties are local to the rover.
           
           So, the rover will traverse configurations:
           1.  From the initial position, it moves to *#o3* at (-0.1, 1.0) and starts imaging.
           2.  It then moves to *#o5* at (0.5, -0.5) and samples the rocks.
           3.  Lastly, it moves to *#o0* at (-0.1, -1.0) and sends everything to the lander.
           4.  Then, it returns to the starting position.
           
           **This revised strategy must now be tested and verified, especially regarding the reachability from one point to another despite the obstacle *v21*.**

(Thoughts: **My Revised Plan for Rover Configuration**
           
           Okay, so I've gotten feedback that my earlier attempts at configuring the rover for communication and imaging are running afoul of obstacle *v21*. Specifically, my chosen x-coordinates were falling within the problematic range of -0.05 to 0.05. I need to rethink these positions. I'm going to assume a stricter collision detection and focus on avoiding that zone entirely.
           
           For the communication phase (#o0), I need to reach the lander, *v9*, at coordinates (-1.9, -2.0). I'll place #o0 at (-1.0, -1.5). This location is out of the danger zone and close enough to v9. The distance of 1.03m is within the 4m communication range.
           
           For imaging (#o3), things get trickier. The initial problem description is a bit vague, given that I need to be able to see targets on both sides of *v21*. After some consideration and assuming the initial state facts for `imagevisible` are valid, I'm going with (1.0, 0.5) for #o3. That puts it on the same side as the rover's initial position, but avoids *v21*. While this may be farther than 2m from some objectives, the initial problem explicitly declares that vision is possible with those locations, so I must presume the vision predicate is valid.
           
           For sampling (#o5), I've chosen (0.6, -0.5). That's near the sampling points, avoiding the collision zone.
           
           The revised plan is as follows:
           
           1.  Move to #o3 (image)
           2.  Calibrate
           3.  Take images of all four objectives.
           4.  Move to #o5 (sample)
           5.  Sample rocks v4 and v7
           6.  Move to #o0
           7.  Send the images of all objectives
           8.  Send the analysis of v4 and v7
           9.  Drop the samples
           10. Return to the starting position.
           
           The goal is to provide continuous values for each rover configuration to satisfy all the conditions. The values chosen should be reachable for v12 and be in the proper vision/communication distance. I am assuming that the `imagevisible` predicates listed in the initial state are valid, even if the distance to targets might be greater than 2m for my chosen coordinates.
           
           Let's hope these revised positions work!

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revising Configurations for Enhanced Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so the previous configurations weren't cutting it due to potential issues with reachability and collision with `v21`. My goal is to craft a new plan that overcomes these limitations. I'm focusing on three critical configurations: `#o0` for communication, `#o3` for imaging, and `#o5` for sampling.  The challenge is to ensure these positions are reachable by `v12` from the starting point `v13 (1.0, -1.75)` while avoiding collision with `v21` at `x = (-0.05, 0.05)`.  
           
           I need to keep the rover's operations on the positive X side as much as possible, as this simplifies avoiding collision with `v21`. The only exception is the `#o0` configuration, which *needs* to be on the negative X side for communication with the lander `v9`.
           
           Here's my revised plan for specific coordinates:
           
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):**  Instead of the original, I'm now proposing `(1.5, 2.0)`. This places the rover on the positive X side, out of `v21`'s reach, while still ensuring the necessary visibility for imaging targets. Distance calculations confirm these points are within the required 2m image range. The system assumes a general `imagevisible` function for all targets.
           
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):** My preferred point is `(0.7, -0.3)`. This gives me an "above" position relative to both `v4` and `v7`, which is a good central sampling point. This again keeps it away from the collision zone.
           
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):** To communicate with the lander and stay on the side opposite the rock obstacle, I'll go with `(-1.0, -2.0)`. This puts the rover within the 4m communication range of the lander `v9` and allows for an initial trajectory to avoid collision.
           
           The plan structure stays the same: moving between these configurations to image, sample, communicate, and send images and analyses.  The key is the revised coordinates to enable successful rover action.
           
           I have re-checked the rock configurations and all looks correct. After a final PDDL verification, it seems like these new configurations will be functional. I am ready to rerun the planning system.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Plan Generation and Refinement for Rover Task**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan for the rovers to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which involves imaging objectives, analyzing rock samples, and communicating the results.  I've been given a PDDL problem in the `rovers` domain. The primary focus is achieving the goal state.
           
           The initial state reveals two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, two rovers, with `v12` starting at `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.  I've decided to leverage `v12` for all imaging and sampling tasks, while `v14` remains stationary.  I will be performing each action to get the `new-axiom@0()`, including imaging objectives with camera `v10` in mode `v11` and analyzing rock samples of types `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil).
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal dictates that images of the objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) are received, and the analysis of stone and soil samples must be delivered. There's a vertical obstacle, `v21`, located at x=0, which I'll be keeping in mind.
           
           My strategy involves identifying optimal configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) for the rover to perform its tasks. The primary challenge is avoiding collisions with `v21` and ensuring reachability between these configurations. I am relying on the existing `motion` predicates to provide general reachability between these configuration points. Any "not reachable" errors previously encountered were due to *specific coordinate* choices I initially made.
           
           Therefore, I need to make some tweaks:
           
           1.  **Imaging Pose (#o3):** Considering the initial state of the objective locations, the rover's initial position, and collision avoidance, I will position the imaging configuration `(#o3)` at coordinates `(0.7, 1.0)`. This position facilitates efficient imaging of all objectives while staying on the positive X-axis.
           
           2.  **Sampling Pose (#o5):** The sampling pose `(#o5)` will be positioned at `(0.7, 0.0)` for effective sampling of the rock samples, particularly those of type v2 and v6.
           
           3.  **Communication Pose (#o0):**  The communication pose `(#o0)` will be positioned at `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This position accommodates communication with the lander `v9`, which is located in the negative X region.
           
           The plan will now proceed as follows:
           
           1.  `v12` moves to `#o3 (0.7, 1.0)`.
           2.  `v12` takes images of all objectives.
           3.  `v12` moves to `#o5 (0.7, 0.0)`.
           4.  `v12` samples the stone.
           5.  `v12` moves to `#o0 (-1.0, -1.0)`.
           6.  `v12` sends images and stone analysis.
           7.  `v12` drops the stone.
           8.  `v12` moves to `#o5 (0.7, 0.0)`.
           9.  `v12` samples the soil.
           10. `v12` moves to `#o0 (-1.0, -1.0)`.
           11. `v12` sends the soil analysis.
           12. `v12` drops the soil.
           13. `v12` returns to the initial position `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           This plan utilizes the rovers, their capabilities (cameras, stores), and communication effectively to fulfill the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. I am confident that by implementing these carefully selected coordinates, I have designed a plan that satisfies the initial conditions, constraints, and objective requirements.

Model:     **Plan Generation and Refinement for Rover Task**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan for the rovers to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which involves imaging objectives, analyzing rock samples, and communicating the results.  I've been given a PDDL problem in the `rovers` domain. The primary focus is achieving the goal state.

           Configuration #o3 = (1.0 1.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **A Revised Approach to Rover Configurations**
           
           I'm revisiting the configuration choices for the rover, specifically focusing on the problematic areas identified in previous runs. The goal is to find feasible configurations that avoid collisions, ensure reachability, and satisfy the constraints of image visibility and communication.
           
           My initial error stemmed from a misunderstanding of the collision detection.  Specifically, the configuration `(-1.5, -1.5)` for communication (`#o0`) was deemed to collide with the lander (`v9`). After re-examining the lander's AABB, it appears my interpretation was off. However, to be extra cautious, and given the geometric interpretation of the problem, I will err on the side of space and move the configuration further away from `v9`. I'm proposing a communication point at `(-1.3, -1.6)`. This location should avoid any collision with the lander. Furthermore, I've confirmed that this configuration is within the 4-meter communication range.
           
           The imaging configuration (`#o3`) presented a significant challenge. The initial attempt, `(1.0, 1.0)`, failed due to reachability issues. Further, I re-read the problem description and found an issue. There is an implicit assumption in the initial states: if something is "visible" by "imagerange", it is assumed to be true. I'll lean on this property and assume the visibility preconditions for my plan. I'll move `#o3` to `(1.5, -1.5)`. This satisfies the visibility predicates with `imagerange`.
           
           The sampling configuration (`#o5`) is planned to be at `(0.7, -0.3)`, which avoids the central obstacle, `v21`.
           
           With these adjustments, I'm confident that these new configurations will be collision-free, reachable, and satisfy the required constraints. The plan remains the same.
