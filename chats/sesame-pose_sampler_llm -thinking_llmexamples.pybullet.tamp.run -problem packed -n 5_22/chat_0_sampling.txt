           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy**
           
           My plan is to find 50 stable placements for a square object on a square surface. Since there's only one surface (index 0), I just need to determine the rotation angle (`theta`) and the (x, y) coordinates of the object's center for each placement. I'll utilize the surface bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` and the object dimensions `size_x = 0.0896` and `size_y = 0.0896`.
           
           First, I'll calculate the valid center positions for `theta = 0` (and effectively `pi/2`, `pi`, `3pi/2` since the object and surface are square).  I'll then create a 7x7 grid of center points within these limits, resulting in 49 placements. I've already determined that for `theta=0`, the center's x and y ranges are approximately [-0.0902, 0.0902].  I'll then use the coordinates of this grid to give these placements.  These placements will be the bulk of my set.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'll use `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees) and place the center at (0, 0). The center (0,0) is stable for any rotation since the object size is smaller than the surface.  This should provide a good mix of orientations and locations, ensuring stable placements within the given surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: placing object 5 (a small square) on surface 0, making sure it doesn't bump into object 8, which is already set in place. I'm aiming for 50 stable placements in total.
           
           Here's my plan:
           
           1.  **Acknowledge the Constraint:** First, I figured out the bounding box of object 8 using its dimensions and placement coordinates to get its AABB, which occupies the bottom-left corner of the surface. Now, I need to account for it.
           2.  **Establish General Placement Bounds:** I began by calculating the safe area for object 5 on surface 0, *ignoring* object 8 for now. I calculated the limits of where object 5 could possibly fit on the surface if object 8 wasn't there. This defines the overall area.
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:**  This is the tricky part! I need to ensure that the object won't collide with object 8. I will define a region that overlaps with object 8's AABB. I then created the collision-free space.
               *   To avoid any collision, the *entire* bounding box of object 5 must avoid the bounding box of object 8.
               *   I'll generate placements with theta = 0 for the first 45 placements.
               *   I need to make sure the center of object 5, *plus* the object's half-width, doesn't overlap object 8. Any placements left/below/right/above of object 8 are fine, and I can have `x_center` and `y_center` for object 5, and the general formula must follow that the object must be entirely in the safe area.
               *   This led to a specific collision-free region calculation on the surface.
           4.  **Rotation (theta = pi/4):** I'll use `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees) rotation for the final 5 placements, considering the increased dimensions of the object due to the rotation. The logic here is similar: calculate the new effective size, find the surface limits, and then derive the collision-free space. The bounding box of object 5 gets bigger at `pi/4`. I will set the collision check using that `effective_width`.
               *   I determined the new limits of where object 5 could fit when rotated and found the new collision-free region for the rotated object.
           
           The goal is a good spread of placements while making certain they're collision-free! I'll generate the grid with the center values for `theta=0`, check for collision with the bounds, and pick five additional valid placement positions when rotated.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 7) on surface 0, making sure they don't collide with objects already there (IDs 8 and 5).  I'll use a straightforward approach: first calculating where object 7 can stably sit (without falling off the surface), and then I'll use a simplified strategy to make the collision checks much easier.
           
           I start by finding the valid placement ranges for object 7.  The surface is a square, so this translates into a maximum and minimum x and y position for the object's center. I then calculate collision exclusion zones in order to avoid all previous obstacles. I consider the sizes and positions of objects 8 and 5. This simplifies to checking whether I can place the new object entirely *above* the previously placed ones, ensuring the new object's bottom edge sits above the top edges of the other objects. The y-threshold I need to satisfy is `-0.00435535219390839`.
           
           To generate placements, I'll create a grid of possible positions. I divide the available space into a grid of 10 rows and 5 columns. I've designed the grid to have each row at least at the specified `y` threshold. This ensures all the generated placements will be entirely above previously placed objects (both y-wise and therefore x-wise, making sure it does not collide with their x-ranges. These positions will be used for placements at a rotation of 0 radians. If I can't generate enough non-colliding positions with this strategy, I will need to refine it.

(Thoughts: **My strategy for placing the new object (ID 4) involves a few key steps.** First, I need to understand where the existing objects (IDs 8, 5, and 7) are located and, importantly, the space they occupy. I've calculated their AABBs at a rotation of zero degrees to make the collision detection easier.  I'm using the surface bounds provided. I'll initially find placement candidates with 0 rotation as it reduces the complexity of calculations. I can then rotate these to the given orientation.
           
           I then plan to generate a list of candidate placements. For these placements, I'll calculate whether the AABB of the new object would intersect with the AABBs of any of the existing objects. AABB-AABB collision is efficient. If there's no collision, the placement is valid.
           
           I'll be smart about where I start to place the new object. Instead of sampling everywhere, I'll aim to utilize the space that the existing objects don't occupy. 
           I'm running a comprehensive, AABB-based collision check to rule out any placements that overlap.
           
           To be diverse, I'm generating approximately 50 placements at various locations with zero or 45 degrees, and that's it.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I need to place 50 stable instances of object 6 on surface 0, making sure to avoid collisions with the existing objects 8, 5, 7, and 4. I've analyzed the surface and the bounding boxes of the existing objects, using their dimensions and current placements (assuming a rotation of 0 for these past placements to keep things simple).
           
           **The Scene:**
           
           Surface 0 is a square,  `-0.135` to `0.135`. I've calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects.
           
           *   Object 8 is in the bottom-left.
           *   Object 5 is near the bottom-middle and right.
           *   Object 7 occupies a region in the middle-left.
           *   Object 4 is near the top-left.
           
           My strategy is to find 50 valid placements. To do this, I will check for AABB collisions.
           I’ll start by generating a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for object 6, and testing each candidate point, for object 6 at theta = 0. If I don't get 50, I’ll augment it by considering object 6 rotated by `pi/4`.
           
           **Placement Generation and Validation:**
           
           I've made a collision check function to check if the new object collides with the previously placed ones, using AABB overlap conditions.
           I have a robust function for this.
           
           I'll proceed to generate candidate placements, first with theta=0 using a 10x10 grid. Then, for cases where that does not result in enough placements, I will test a 7x7 grid, using `pi/4` rotations for object 6. With this structure, there is a very high probability to get 50 valid placements.
           
           In Python, the grid will range from `[-0.08551778706716529, 0.08551778706716529]`, with x, y values at even intervals. The rotation uses a scaled half-extent, so the checks will be quick and efficient. I have also added a check for bounds violations.
