           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera (v10) and a storage unit (v16). There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19) to be analyzed or imaged. The lander (v9) is the communication target. The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state that requires several sub-goals to be met:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true initially.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true initially.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: Rover v12's storage v16 is free. This is true initially.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: Rover v14's storage v16 is free. This is true initially.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective v17 using mode v11 has been received.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective v18 using mode v11 has been received.
           7.  `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: An image of objective v19 using mode v11 has been received.
           8.  `type(?stone, v2)`: Some rock of type v2 exists. (Implicitly, this means we need to analyze a rock of type v2).
           9.  `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: Analysis of a rock of type v2 has been received.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: Some rock of type v6 exists. (Implicitly, this means we need to analyze a rock of type v6).
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Analysis of a rock of type v6 has been received.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve these:
           
           *   **Imaging objectives:**
               *   Rover v12 can image v17, v18, v19.
               *   Rover v14 can image v17, v18, v19.
               *   Camera v10 supports mode v11.
               *   To `take_image`, the camera needs to be `calibrated`.
               *   To `send_image`, the rover needs to `haveimage`.
           *   **Analyzing rocks:**
               *   Rocks v1, v4 are of type v2.
               *   Rocks v5, v7, v8 are of type v6.
               *   Rock v3 is of type v2.
               *   To `sample_rock`, the rover needs to be `above` the rock and have `free` storage.
               *   To `send_analysis`, the rover needs to have `analyzed` the rock.
           
           The provided available action instances are very limited: `move` and `drop_rock`.
           Since `move` actions simply put the rover at the same configuration (`v13` to `v13`, `v15` to `v15`), they don't change the state in a way that helps with the goal. `drop_rock` requires `full` storage, which is not true initially and cannot be made true with the available actions.
           
           Crucially, the provided list of allowed actions only includes `move` actions that result in the rover staying at the same configuration, and `drop_rock` actions. None of the actions needed to take images (calibrate, take_image, send_image) or analyze rocks (sample_rock, send_analysis) are present in the list of allowed actions. Without these actions, it is impossible to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is unreachable with the given allowed action instances.
           
           The goal is unreachable because none of the necessary actions to `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` are available in the provided list of allowed actions. The only available actions are `move` (which doesn't change the configuration) and `drop_rock` (which requires a full store, and there's no way to sample a rock to make the store full).
