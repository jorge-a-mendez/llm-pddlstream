User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.18, 0.227, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.761, 0.649).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.109, -0.385), (-0.01, -0.286)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.137, 0.34), (-0.046, 0.432)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.059, -0.336, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.928, 0.373).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.139, 0.187), (0.22, 0.267)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.092, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.98, 0.2).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. They are currently at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively, all supported by `v11`. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`. Since `v16` is a surface, and not an `object` type for which `stackable` is defined with a corresponding `type` predicate (e.g. `sink`, `stove`), this implies that `v16` is a table or a similar surface.
           
           The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`. Both are currently at specific arm configurations (`v5` and `v7` respectively) and are handempty. The robot's base is at configuration `v3`.
           
           The only available action instance for `move_base` is moving from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This means the robot's base will not move from its current position. This is important as it implies the robot needs to be able to reach all objects from its current base configuration `v3`.
           
           The problem specifies several `kin` facts, which are crucial for picking and placing. All `kin` facts are associated with arm `v4`, base configuration `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`. This means arm `v4` will be used for all pick and place operations, and the base will effectively stay at `v3` (as implied by the available `move_base` action, and `#o3` being a computed `bconf` value, which must be `v3`).
           
           The goal is to have `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all on `v16`. This means each object needs to be picked from its current pose and placed onto a new pose on `v16`. The new poses are represented by `#o2`. The problem states `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`, indicating that `#o2` is the target pose on `v16` for all three objects. Since they are different objects, they will need different poses with this name.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           1. **Pick v8**: `v8` is at `v9` and supported by `v11`. We need to use `kin(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to pick it.
           2. **Place v8**: Place `v8` at a new pose (`#o2`) on `v16`. We will use `kin(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           3. **Pick v12**: `v12` is at `v13` and supported by `v11`. We need to use `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to pick it.
           4. **Place v12**: Place `v12` at a new pose (`#o2`) on `v16`. We will use `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           5. **Pick v14**: `v14` is at `v15` and supported by `v11`. We need to use `kin(v4, v14, v15, #o1, #o3, #o4)` to pick it.
           6. **Place v14**: Place `v14` at a new pose (`#o2`) on `v16`. We will use `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           For `#o2` poses, we need to provide concrete collision-free placements on `v16`. `v16` has AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. `v8` has AABB `((-0.109, -0.385), (-0.01, -0.286))`, `v12` has `((0.139, 0.187), (0.22, 0.267))`, and `v14` has `((-0.137, 0.34), (-0.046, 0.432))`. The poses need to be within the bounds of `v16`.
           The z value is given in the existing poses as 0.781. We can use the same z value for the new poses on `v16`. We should place them slightly offset from each other to avoid collisions.
           
           Since the base does not move, we don't need to specify `move_base` actions other than the one given. The `canmove()` predicate will be set after each pick/place, and unset by the base movement. However, since the base stays in place and `move_base` has an empty cost for (v3, v3, #o0), we can assume it's implicitly handled or not needed to explicitly call `move_base`.
           
           Let's find suitable coordinates for placing `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. `v16` is a square surface centered at (0,0).
           Let's choose these poses for `#o2` on `v16`:
           - For `v8`: (0.0, -0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           - For `v12`: (0.0, 0.05, 0.781, 0.0)
           - For `v14`: (-0.05, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           
           These are relative to the center of `v16`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action represents the robot moving its base from configuration `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action essentially means the robot's base does not move.
           
           The goal is to have `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. Achieving this goal requires picking objects and placing them. However, no `pick` or `place` actions are listed as valid action instances. Without these actions, the robot cannot manipulate any objects. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal from the initial state with the given valid actions.
