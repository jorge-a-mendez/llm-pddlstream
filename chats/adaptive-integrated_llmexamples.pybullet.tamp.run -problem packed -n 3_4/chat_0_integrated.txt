           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.1, 0.386, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.791, 0.612).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.058, 0.343), (0.143, 0.428)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.23, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.869, 0.494).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.13, 0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.583, 0.812).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.182, 0.175), (0.278, 0.271)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.174, 0.387), (-0.085, 0.476)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom supported(v14, v15, v11)
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom bconf(v3)

           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v14, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains three graspable objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. There are two arms: `v4` and `v6`. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`. Currently, all three objects are supported by `v11` at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively. Since `v16` is a surface with AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)), we need to find suitable collision-free poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Since the only available action is `move_base`, and it doesn't change the state of the objects or their positions, the goal is unreachable. The current problem setup does not provide any `pick` or `place` actions that would allow the robot to move the objects to the target surface `v16`. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved with the given actions.
