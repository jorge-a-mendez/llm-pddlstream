(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Generating 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placement configurations for a square object on a given square surface. The object's dimensions are defined, as are the surface's boundaries. Stability is defined as the object being fully contained within the surface, regardless of its rotation.
           
           Initially, I considered the implications of the object's rotation (theta). My immediate thought was that the object's dimensions might be interpreted as representing its *axis-aligned bounding box* (AABB), where the given dimensions are always those of its AABB *after* rotation. However, to ensure general stability, I opted to interpret the problem more conservatively and generally. I decided that, given the phrasing of the problem, the object's given dimensions likely represent its *intrinsic* dimensions, and therefore the AABB must adapt as it rotates.
           
           To account for this rotation, I recognize that the object's AABB will change with rotation, with the largest possible AABB occurring at a 45-degree angle. This means that my safe placement strategy must account for the maximum possible AABB size to prevent any collision. The maximum AABB edge is the side length times the square root of 2, divided by 2.
           
           Using this understanding, I calculate the safe placement area by subtracting this maximum half-extent from the surface boundaries. This ensures that even when the object is maximally rotated, it remains fully contained. Based on the calculated safe area, I generate a grid of x and y coordinates (5x5). To reach 50, for each of these x and y grid points I will have two different angles (theta = 0, and theta = pi/4). This means that I have a total of 50 different placements for the object.
           
           To ensure robustness, this approach uses conservative constraints.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Finding 50 Stable Positions for Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've received confirmation that Object 4 (ID: 4) is now successfully placed in the scene at coordinates (-0.0795, -0.0795) with a rotation of 0 radians.  Its dimensions are 0.07835 x 0.07835.  I've calculated its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB), which is simply its extents due to the 0 rotation.
           
           Now, I need to find 50 stable positions for a new square object, Object 5 (ID: 5), with side length 0.09666, on the same surface (surface 0).  The surface boundaries are -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           First, I determine the safe range for Object 5 to stay *within* the surface, considering its maximum half-extent during possible rotations. This is crucial for *stability*. With Object 5's side length, that safe center range is roughly -0.066 to 0.066.
           
           However, I must avoid collisions with the placed Object 4, which is also a square.  I've already calculated Object 4's AABB.
           
           To do this, I will generate a grid of potential (x, y) center points *within* the safe surface area and then for each grid point, I will consider two rotations: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. I will then test for collision with object 4 using my AABB method.
           
           The most stable approach would be to calculate Object 5's AABB based on its center location and each individual rotation *each time* I test for collision. I will make use of the fact that it is a square, and I'll use the AABB properties I've defined to determine if the x-axis and y-axis regions overlap.
           
           I will use an expanded grid to ensure I find enough *valid*, collision-free placements and then filter for those that do not collide. A 7x7 grid should provide 98 total potential locations when combined with the two rotations that I need to test. I can then take the first 50 valid, collision-free placements.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID: 6**
           
           Okay, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, while carefully avoiding collisions with two existing objects, ID 4 and ID 5. This requires a systematic approach.
           
           First, I've got to understand the geometry. Object 6 is a square with a side length of approximately 0.0988. I also have the surface dimensions: a square area from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  Object 4 and 5 are also squares, and I have the center and side length information for both, allowing me to calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) to use for collision detection.
           
           To start, I'll calculate the maximum half-extent of Object 6, which is crucial for determining safe regions to search within the surface. I will then define a grid of candidate center points within the surface, at a finer granularity, using a 9x9 grid, which is 81 points, instead of a 6x6 grid. I'll need to consider two possible rotations: 0 and pi/4 radians.
           
           For each potential placement, I'll calculate Object 6's AABB based on its rotation, and then rigorously check for collisions with the AABBs of Object 4 and Object 5. If no collisions are detected, I'll add that placement to the list of valid options.
           
           I've tested the collision detection logic with a sample point and have confirmed that the process works as expected.
           
           I will execute the script with the refined search grid and the more inclusive safe placement region, including all rotations, until 50 valid, collision-free placements are identified.
