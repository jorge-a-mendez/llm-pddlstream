User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.239, 0.311, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.51, 0.86).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.14, 0.512), (0.21, 0.582)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.124, -0.59), (0.208, -0.506)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.016, -0.351), (0.074, -0.261)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.286, 0.264), (-0.191, 0.359)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.175, 0.547, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.704, 0.71).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.166, -0.548, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.622, 0.783).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.029, -0.306, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.183, 0.983).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning the Stacking Operation**
           
           My goal is to place all objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) onto surface v18.  This means each object needs to be both *supported* by v18 and *at* a specific pose on v18.  Currently, these objects are on v11.  The problem gives me a basic set of actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, and defines the structure and use of parameters.  I can't use actions not listed in the prompt. I know the robot has two arms, both initially "handempty". The robot's base configuration doesn't change from `v3`, so I don't need to consider moving the base.
           
           Since all objects start and end on the same surface (`v18`), the task can be simplified to a series of `pick` and `place` actions, one for each object.  All objects are graspable, stackable on `v18`, and all are defined with a generic grasp `#o1`. The initial problem state defines the necessary `supported` condition for the target state. I must supply the continuous values for `pose` starting with '#'.
           
           For the `pick` and `place` actions, I will need to find trajectories, denoted by a new '#' object (e.g., `#t1_v16_pick`).  I will make the simplification that a valid sequence of these actions can be found, but I have no need to define `kin` actions. I assume that `unsafepose`, `unsafeapproach`, and `unsafeatraj` will not be violated. I will also use the first arm (`v4`) to perform the actions.
           
           I will define unique target poses for each object on v18, each pose represented by `#o2`. These target poses are:
           (#o2 v16 v18): (0.05 0.05 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v14 v18): (-0.05 0.05 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v12 v18): (0.05 -0.05 0.781 0.0)
           (#o2 v8 v18): (-0.05 -0.05 0.781 0.0)
           
           With these target poses defined, the plan will be:
           
           1.  `pick(v4, v16, v17, #o1, v3, #t1_v16_pick)`
           2.  `place(v4, v16, #o2_v16, #o1, v3, #t2_v16_place)`
           3.  `pick(v4, v14, v15, #o1, v3, #t3_v14_pick)`
           4.  `place(v4, v14, #o2_v14, #o1, v3, #t4_v14_place)`
           5.  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #t5_v12_pick)`
           6.  `place(v4, v12, #o2_v12, #o1, v3, #t6_v12_place)`
           7.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #t7_v8_pick)`
           8.  `place(v4, v8, #o2_v8, #o1, v3, #t8_v8_place)`
           
           This plan ensures that each object is picked from its initial location, and placed on `v18` at the designated pose with valid conditions, thereby satisfying the stated goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #t1_v16_pick) , (place v4 v16 #o2 v16 #o1 v3 #t2_v16_place) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #t3_v14_pick) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v14 #o1 v3 #t4_v14_place) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #t5_v12_pick) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v12 #o1 v3 #t6_v12_place) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #t7_v8_pick) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v8 #o1 v3 #t8_v8_place)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analyzing the Action Space and Goal Infeasibility**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan with a bunch of `pick` and `place` actions, but the user has flagged them as invalid. They're right. My allowed action instances are severely limited.  The only thing I'm *allowed* to do is `move_base` from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`.  Effectively, I'm stuck doing nothing in a loop.
           
           Now, the goal is to have objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all *on* `v18`. Looking at the initial state, those objects are currently *on* `v11`.  The key constraint here is that the robot can't actually *do* anything to move those objects around.  I've got the `atpose` and `supported` predicates, but they don't help me achieve the goal with these restrictions.
           
           Since I can't `pick` or `place` anything, moving objects from `v11` to `v18` is simply impossible.  Therefore, the plan is infeasible, given the current limitations.
