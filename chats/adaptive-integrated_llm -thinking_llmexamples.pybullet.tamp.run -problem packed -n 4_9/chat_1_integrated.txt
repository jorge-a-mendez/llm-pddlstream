User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.239, 0.311, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.51, 0.86).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.14, 0.512), (0.21, 0.582)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.124, -0.59), (0.208, -0.506)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.016, -0.351), (0.074, -0.261)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.286, 0.264), (-0.191, 0.359)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.175, 0.547, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.704, 0.71).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.166, -0.548, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.622, 0.783).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.029, -0.306, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.183, 0.983).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to create a plan to move objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` from their initial locations on surface `v11` to the target surface `v18`. I'm working under the constraints that I can only use the provided actions and that I must provide specific collision-free poses for objects with `#o2` placeholders in the problem definition.
           
           Initially, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` are at poses `v9`, `v13`, `v15`, and `v17` respectively, and supported by `v11`.  My robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, but both are `handempty`. My base configuration `v3` is at `bconf`.  The key challenge is to determine collision-free and stable poses for these objects on `v18`. The poses are the crucial "continuous values" the problem demands. `v18`'s AABB is  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I've determined that a straightforward "pick and place" strategy is the most suitable, given my constraints. The initial `kin` predicates allow for the robot arm `v4` to perform `pick` and `place` actions.  My plan involves the following sequence of actions:
           1.  Pick up `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`.
           2.  Place `v8` onto a calculated pose on `v18`.
           3.  Pick up `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`.
           4.  Place `v12` onto a calculated pose on `v18`.
           5.  Pick up `v14` from `v15` using arm `v4`.
           6.  Place `v14` onto a calculated pose on `v18`.
           7.  Pick up `v16` from `v17` using arm `v4`.
           8.  Place `v16` onto a calculated pose on `v18`.
           
           The robot base needs to stay in `v3` as the motion primitive `move_base` only allows from `v3` to `v3`.
           
           The core difficulty lies in calculating those specific and collision-free poses for each object on `v18`. Because the initial state features `pose(object, #o2)` for each object, I must interpret `#o2` as a set of *unique* poses, one per object on `v18`. Thus, I need to provide `#o2_for_v8`, `#o2_for_v12`, `#o2_for_v14`, and `#o2_for_v16` values to satisfy the continuous parameter requirements. I must ensure these values respect the geometries of the objects and the target surface.
           
           I've carefully considered the AABBs of all objects and the surface area of `v18` to devise collision-free placements. The largest object dimension is around 0.095m, which means that a line is no good. I have to create a 2x2 grid. Since `v18` has a size of 0.27m in both x and y. I have derived the following target poses with z = 0.831 (surface level assumed to be 0.781 plus assumed object height of 0.05 / 2):
           
           -   `(#o2_for_v8 v8 v18): (0.06 0.06 0.831 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2_for_v12 v12 v18): (-0.06 0.06 0.831 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2_for_v14 v14 v18): (-0.06 -0.06 0.831 0.0)`
           -   `(#o2_for_v16 v16 v18): (0.06 -0.06 0.831 0.0)`
           
           These are within the surface bounds.
           
           The plan assumes that, while not explicitly listed, `pick` and `place` actions are implicitly available given the `kin` facts. If this is not correct, the task is unsolvable. I will need to construct the `pick` and `place` actions using the values in this reasoning. I

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`.

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Unachievable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a challenge. The user's feedback makes it crystal clear: the plan I originally proposed simply won't work. I had been relying on `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate these objects - `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` - and deposit them on `v18`. Classic stuff. However, the system's constraints are brutally clear. The *only* valid action instance I was given is a simple base movement: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Essentially, the robot can just... sit where it is. It can't pick things up or put them down.
           
           Given this, achieving the objective of moving these objects to the target surface is flat-out impossible with the given action instance.  The plan is fundamentally flawed because it relies on operations that are explicitly *not* supported within the constraints. I need to communicate this clearly and concisely. My conclusion is that the goal is not achievable under the provided restrictions, and I need to explain the reasoning behind this in my response.
