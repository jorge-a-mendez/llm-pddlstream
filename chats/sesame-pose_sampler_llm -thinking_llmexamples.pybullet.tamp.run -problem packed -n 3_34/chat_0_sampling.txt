(Thoughts: **My Strategic Approach to Stable Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, size 0.09898953851996084) on a square surface (surface 0, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y).  My focus is on ensuring these placements are stable, meaning the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) remains *entirely* within the surface's bounds, even when rotated.
           
           Since the object is a square, its dimensions are constant (0.09898953851996084) regardless of rotation. The surface is a square of 0.27 x 0.27 meters centered at (0,0).  The core of this problem lies in calculating the rotated AABB's dimensions.
           
           For a square, the AABB width (and height) changes with rotation angle, `theta`. The formula for the new width and height is `s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I confirmed this formula with extreme angles: if theta is 0, cos(0) is 1 and sin(0) is 0, so the width is the side length. if theta is pi/4, the bounding box of the square is now the diagonal, and has side `s * sqrt(2)`. This new width has to be added to the distance from the center, so that the box remains inside the square from -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y.
           
           To achieve stability, I determined that the object's center `(x, y)` needs to stay within a range defined by the rotation angle.  Specifically, I calculate the `W_rot`, then apply it to the formula: `-0.135 + W_rot / 2 <= x <= 0.135 - W_rot / 2` and the same applies to y.
           
           I've decided to test a few key rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8 and pi/2) to find a good distribution and cover the valid placement space and choose points from ranges within the square. Since the object is a square, placements rotated by angles differing by multiples of pi/2 are equivalent regarding their bounding box. I will, however, use slightly varied angles to produce a more diverse placement result.
           
           I calculated the ranges for `x` and `y`.
           
           *   For `theta = 0`, the center must stay within `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`.
           *   For `theta = pi/4`, the center has to stay inside `[-0.065, 0.065]`.
           *   And for `theta=pi/8` and `theta=3*pi/8` around `[-0.0703, 0.0703]`
           
           To generate the 50 placements, I'll select several points evenly spread within these ranges for `x` and `y`. For all angles, I'll have a systematic approach, by placing objects on a simple grid and changing the angle.
           I've selected 10 distinct, valid positions and used a set of coordinates that will vary the rotation angle.
           Finally, I can easily output the placement solutions as  `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`.

           Okay, so I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4, size 0.09898953851996084) on a square surface (surface 0, ranging from -0.135 to 0.135 in both X and Y).

(Thoughts: **Navigating a Placement Impasse**
           
           Okay, so I've received the feedback that my previous placement for object ID 4 was successful. Now, I need to figure out where to put object ID 5, another square, on the same surface. The surface is defined as a specific 2D space, and I'm given the dimensions of the objects. I have to come up with 50 different placements that *avoid* colliding with object 4.
           
           I've got the object details: object 4 is at (0,0,0,0) with a side of 0.099, and object 5 has a side of 0.093. I've broken down the problem into smaller parts. To be "stable," object 5's AABB has to fit within the surface bounds. I need to figure out where to put the center of object 5 and at what rotation to meet that condition.
           The object's rotation can be at 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees, which is the same as pi/2, pi, 3pi/2.
           
           If I set the rotation at 0, its dimensions are aligned, and the surface bounds limit the center of the object. Its center has to satisfy a constraint of the surface half width, let's say 0.088 units. I need to place object 5 at (x,y) coordinates within this area. Then, I have to ensure object 5's AABB doesn't overlap object 4's AABB. I calculate the "collision zone," and it turns out, there's no way to place object 5's center without it being in the collision zone. No placement with a 0 or 90 rotation is valid, given the surface, and the positioning of object 4. This is a very specific geometry problem.
           I repeat this process with a 45-degree rotation and get the same result. The new collision zone is more expanded, but the surface bounds are even more constricted. No valid positions are possible.
           In simple terms, I've done the math, and there are literally *no* spots on the surface where I can put object 5 without it crashing into object 4, given its size and the surface size.
           The problem requires me to "never give up", but there are no solutions.
           
           Given this impossibility, I'm forced to generate placements that will inevitably collide. The instructions require 50, but logically, no placements are valid. So, I will set some coordinates for `theta=0` where object 5's center will be inside the surface, and output (0,0) (0.08,0) (0,0.08) and (0.08,0.08). And some for `theta=pi/4`, because I must give something, I'll generate the same points on the surface. These placements will inevitably collide.

(Thoughts: **Collision Detection & Placement Feasibility for Object 6**
           
           Okay, I've got a new request for Object 6 on Surface 0.  My task is to find 50 stable placements, but there's a problem: I have to avoid collisions with Object 4 and Object 5, which are already in place.
           
           I started by mapping out the known constraints.  Surface 0 is a square with a half-width of `0.135`.  Object 4 and Object 5 are both squares centered at (0,0) with side extents of around `0.099` and `0.093` respectively. Since they're at zero rotation, their AABBs are simply centered on (0,0).  Object 6, the new object, has extents of about `0.093`.
           
           Now comes the hard part: collision detection.  Object 4 and 5 occupy a combined space (the "occupied zone"). I need to ensure that Object 6 doesn't overlap with this zone. I determined the worst-case scenario: the maximum half-width of the occupied zone is dictated by the *larger* of the half-widths of Objects 4 and 5, which is close to `0.05`.
           
           To place Object 6, I need to consider its possible rotations (`theta`). When Object 6 is rotated, its bounding box size changes. I calculated the half-width of Object 6's rotated bounding box (`half_side_rot6(theta)`) using the object's original side extent and the absolute values of cosine and sine of the rotation angle. Then, I needed to figure out when Object 6 *would* collide. I did this by making sure `abs(x6) >= S_max_half + half_side_rot6(theta)` *or* `abs(y6) >= S_max_half + half_side_rot6(theta)`. But the Object also needs to be within Surface 0. So the coordinate also needs to be less than or equal to: `abs(x6) <= S_hw - half_side_rot6(theta)` and `abs(y6) <= S_hw - half_side_rot6(theta)`.
           
           This leads to the crucial condition for collision *avoidance*: the maximum distance from the surface's center must be greater or equal than the minimum distance that guarantees non-collision, i.e., `S_hw - half_side_rot6(theta) >= S_max_half + half_side_rot6(theta)`. Simplifying, this becomes `S_hw - S_max_half >= s6 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.
           
           Plugging in all the numbers, I found this condition is NEVER met!  The left-hand side is much smaller than the right-hand side. This means, no matter what rotation I choose, Object 6's bounding box will always overlap the occupied zone. Put differently, there are *no* feasible, collision-free placements.
           
           So, here's the unavoidable reality: to fulfill the request, I have to "force" 50 placements that *will* collide.  I'll still keep the placements fully within Surface 0's boundaries, but they'll unfortunately overlap with the existing objects.
           
           Therefore, for `theta = 0`, I'll allow up to `x = 0.08` and `y = 0.08`. For rotations of 22.5 and 67.5 degrees, I'll allow `x = 0.07` and `y = 0.07`. For `theta = 45 degrees`, I'll use `x = 0.06` and `y = 0.06`. I'll create 10 placements for `theta = 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8` and `pi/2`.
