User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions from -2.5 to 2.5 in both x and y. There are several rectangular obstacles within this room, including a long, thin one along the y-axis at x=0, and some smaller boxes in various locations, particularly in the upper half of the room. I need to find 3 positions for the robot base that are within 2 units of the target point, avoiding collisions with these fixed obstacles. Since I am not given the full geometry and will receive feedback on collisions and line-of-sight, I will try to propose diverse positions around the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not too close to the known obstacles.
