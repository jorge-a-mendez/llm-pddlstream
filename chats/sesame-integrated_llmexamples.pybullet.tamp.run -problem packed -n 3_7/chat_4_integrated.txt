           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.
           
           The system attempted the following plan in the past, but it failed:
           
           ```
           Action(name='move_base', args=('v3', '#q3', '#t8'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v8', 'v9', '#g2', '#q3', '#t3'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q3', '#q4', '#t12'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v8', 'p3', '#g2', '#q4', '#t4'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q4', '#q2', '#t17'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v12', 'v13', '#g1', '#q2', '#t2'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q2', '#q5', '#t15'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v12', 'p4', '#g1', '#q5', '#t10'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q5', '#q1', '#t16'))
           Action(name='pick', args=('v4', 'v14', 'v15', '#g0', '#q1', '#t1'))
           Action(name='move_base', args=('#q1', '#q0', '#t13'))
           Action(name='place', args=('v4', 'v14', 'p5', '#g0', '#q0', '#t0'))
           ```
           
           This was because the following function call did not succeed: `test-cfree-pose-pose:('v12', 'p4', 'v8', 'p3')->()`
           This means that some details about the scene geometry made it impossible to execute the sequence of actions. If the failure occurs after placing on any pose that does not start with '#', it may be due to using a combination of invalid poses.As the expert, you may decide to choose additional poses, providing their continuous values using any free pose starting with '#'. 

Model:     The scene contains three objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. All of them are currently placed on `v11`, a large surface. The goal is to place all three objects on `v16`, a smaller stackable surface.
           
           The previous plan failed because placing `v12` at `p4` caused a collision with `v8` at `p3`. This indicates that `p3` and `p4` are too close to each other for `v8` and `v12` to be placed simultaneously without collision. Since `v16` is a smaller surface, we need to find suitable collision-free poses on it for all three objects. We can utilize the `#o2` pose to place objects, and since it is specified that `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`, we can infer that `#o2` refers to a general collision-free region on `v16` for any of the three objects. We will need to compute distinct continuous values for `#o2` for each object to avoid collisions.
           
           The initial state shows that:
           - `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`.
           - `v12` is at `v13` on `v11`.
           - `v14` is at `v15` on `v11`.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to pick up each object from its current location and place it on `v16` at a collision-free pose. We will use `arm v4` for all pick and place operations, and `bconf #o3` for the base configuration.
           
           Here's a revised plan:
           1. Move the robot base to a configuration `v3` which is the current configuration.
           2. Pick `v8` from `v9`.
           3. Place `v8` at `#o2` on `v16` (providing a specific value for `#o2_v8`).
           4. Pick `v12` from `v13`.
           5. Place `v12` at `#o2` on `v16` (providing a specific value for `#o2_v12`, making sure it doesn't collide with `v8`).
           6. Pick `v14` from `v15`.
           7. Place `v14` at `#o2` on `v16` (providing a specific value for `#o2_v14`, making sure it doesn't collide with `v8` or `v12`).
           
           For the continuous values of `#o2`, we need to ensure that the AABBs of the objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` do not overlap when placed on `v16`. `v16` has an AABB of ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). The objects have the following AABBs:
           - `v8`: ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           - `v12`: ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035))
           - `v14`: ((0.192, -0.469), (0.273, -0.387)) - This object is larger than v16, which is an issue. Let's re-evaluate.
           
           Upon closer inspection, the bounding box of `v14` (minx 0.192) extends beyond `v16` (maxx 0.135). This means `v14` cannot be fully contained within `v16`. Therefore, it's impossible to place `v14` on `v16` and satisfy the `supported` predicate, which implies full containment for stability. Since the goal requires `on(v14, v16)` (which implies `supported(v14, p, v16)`), and `v14` cannot be supported by `v16`, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The information given is that `stackable(v14, v16)` is true, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)` is given in the initial state. This would imply that there is a valid pose for `v14` on `v16`. However, the AABB information contradicts this. Given the AABB of `v14` and `v16`, `v14` is too large for `v16`.
           
           Given that `v14` cannot physically be placed on `v16` (based on AABB), the goal is unreachable.
           
           However, since I am instructed to "never give up", I will assume that the `supported` predicate overrides the AABB information if there is a contradiction, and that a valid pose for `v14` on `v16` *does* exist, even if it seems geometrically impossible from the AABB data. I will assume the provided `supported(v14, #o2, v16)` is valid and try to find suitable positions for `#o2`.
           
           For #o2 on v16:
           v16 AABB = ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))
           v8 AABB = ((-0.035, -0.035), (0.035, 0.035))
           v12 AABB = ((0.015, -0.035), (0.085, 0.035))
           v14 AABB = ((0.192, -0.469), (0.273, -0.387))
           
           Let's assume the z-coordinate for placing on v16 is 0.781 + height_of_v16 / 2. Since v16 is given as just a 2D AABB, we will assume a standard tabletop height for the objects being placed on it. Let's use 0.782 as the common height as seen in p3, p4, p5.
           
           For `v8` (AABB width 0.07, height 0.07):
           Place at x=-0.08, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0 to keep it within v16. Max X for v8 would be -0.08 + 0.035 = -0.045, Min X would be -0.08 - 0.035 = -0.115. Both are within v16's [-0.135, 0.135].
           
           For `v12` (AABB width 0.07, height 0.07):
           Place at x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0. Max X for v12 would be 0.0 + 0.085 = 0.085, Min X would be 0.0 + 0.015 = 0.015. Both are within v16's [-0.135, 0.135]. Overlaps with v8. This won't work.
           
           Let's place them linearly on v16.
           v8: (x=-0.08, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0) - AABB (-0.115, -0.045) on x axis.
           v12: (x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0) - AABB (0.015, 0.085) on x axis. Still overlaps with v8 by v8's max x being -0.045.
           Let's try to place them side by side.
           v8: x=-0.08, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0
           v12: x=0.08, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0. AABB (0.095, 0.165) which is too far for v12.
           Need to be more careful. The AABBs for objects are given as relative to their center.
           v8: center at (x,y), then minx = x-0.035, maxx=x+0.035
           v12: center at (x,y), then minx = x+0.015, maxx=x+0.085
           v14: center at (x,y), then minx = x+0.192, maxx=x+0.273
           
           Let's re-evaluate placement on v16:
           v16: x from -0.135 to 0.135, y from -0.135 to 0.135.
           Let's use a rotation of PI/2 for v12 to fit it in x direction better.
           v12 is 0.07 long in X, 0.07 long in Y.
           v8 is 0.07 long in X, 0.07 long in Y.
           v14 is 0.081 long in X, 0.082 long in Y. But its x-coordinates are large, 0.192 to 0.273. It implies that for a center (0,0), it's far to the right. This is usually not how AABBs are defined for objects. Usually, AABBs are relative to the object's origin. Assuming they are relative to object's pose.
           If pose is (x,y,z), then AABB (x+minx, y+miny) to (x+maxx, y+maxy).
           
           Let's assume the AABBs are given as the extent of the object in its local frame, and we're placing the object with its origin at the given pose.
           
           v8: width 0.07, height 0.07. Place at (-0.08, 0.0, 0.782, 0.0). Occupies x from -0.115 to -0.045, y from -0.035 to 0.035.
           v12: width 0.07 (0.085-0.015), height 0.07 (0.035 - (-0.035)). Place at (0.0, 0.08, 0.782, 0.0). Occupies x from 0.015 to 0.085, y from 0.045 to 0.115. These two don't collide.
           v14: width 0.081, height 0.082. This object is still a problem given its AABB values if those are relative coordinates.
           If its AABB is ((0.192, -0.469), (0.273, -0.387)), it means that it is not centered at the origin of its own frame, and if we place its reference point at `(x,y)`, the object would extend from `(x+0.192, y-0.469)` to `(x+0.273, y-0.387)`. This is a very unusual definition for object AABB.
           
           Let's assume the AABB given for `v14` is the actual global coordinates for `v14` *when it is at its current pose v15*. This interpretation makes the problem impossible for `v14` to be placed on `v16`, as `v16` max x is 0.135.
           
           If `v14` can be placed on `v16`, it means there's an implicit transformation that centers the object, or the AABB describes the object's *dimensions* rather than its *extents from a local origin*. Let's assume the latter for now: the ranges given are for calculating the width and height of the object (e.g., width = 0.273 - 0.192 = 0.081, height = -0.387 - (-0.469) = 0.082). With these dimensions, `v14` can fit on `v16`.
           
           If `v14` is 0.081 wide and 0.082 tall, let's place it:
           v8: (x=-0.08, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0) -> AABB: [-0.115, -0.045] x [-0.035, 0.035]
           v12: (x=0.0, y=0.08, z=0.782, theta=0.0) -> AABB: [0.015, 0.085] x [0.045, 0.115] (assuming 0.015 and 0.085 are relative to center for calculation, then we add 0.015-0.035 and 0.085-0.035 for a centered object, it is still (-0.02, 0.05). Let's use simpler AABB interpretation for v12 and v8: width 0.07, height 0.07 centered.)
           
           Corrected interpretation for AABB (width/2, height/2):
           v8: half-width 0.035, half-height 0.035
           v12: half-width 0.035, half-height 0.035
           v14: half-width 0.0405, half-height 0.041
           
           v16: [-0.135, 0.135] in x, [-0.135, 0.135] in y
           
           Let's try to place them in a row along the y-axis to maximize x-range for the robot.
           #o2_v8: (x=0.0, y=-0.08, z=0.782, theta=0.0) -> occupies x: [-0.035, 0.035], y: [-0.115, -0.045]
           #o2_v12: (x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.782, theta=0.0) -> occupies x: [-0.035, 0.035], y: [-0.035, 0.035]
           #o2_v14: (x=0.0, y=0.08, z=0.782, theta=0.0) -> occupies x: [-0.0405, 0.0405], y: [0.039, 0.121]
           All are within v16's [-0.135, 0.135] x [-0.135, 0.135].
           This configuration leads to collisions for sure.
           
           Let's use a different arrangement. The previous plan tried p3, p4, p5 which are all close. We need to space them out.
           Given v16 size is 0.27 x 0.27.
           Objects are roughly 0.07x0.07.
           Let's place them at corners or near edges.
           Pose for v8: x=-0.08, y=-0.08, z=0.782, theta=0.0. AABB in global frame: [-0.115, -0.045] x [-0.115, -0.045]. Collision-free within v16.
           Pose for v12: x=0.08, y=-0.08, z=0.782, theta=0.0. AABB in global frame: [0.045, 0.115] x [-0.115, -0.045]. Collision-free with v8 and within v16.
           Pose for v14: x=0.0, y=0.08, z=0.782, theta=0.0. AABB in global frame: [-0.0405, 0.0405] x [0.039, 0.121]. Collision-free with v8, v12 and within v16. This should work.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', v35) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies, I overlooked the `atbconf` precondition for the `pick` and `place` actions, and did not include `move_base` actions to set the base configuration. The `kin` predicates define the base configuration `(#o3)` as required for the `pick` and `place` actions, and `v3` is the initial base configuration. Therefore, a `move_base` action to `#o3` is necessary before the first `pick` action, and subsequent `move_base` actions might be required if `#o3` is not static. However, given that `#o3` is used as a parameter in `kin` for various `pick` and `place` actions, it seems that the robot is intended to operate from this specific base configuration. The available actions also include `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` and `move_base #o3 #o3 #o0`.
           
           Let's use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` to move to the required base configuration `#o3` once, then perform all pick and place operations from there.
           
           The base configuration `v35` was mentioned in the `kin` predicates in the initial state as `kin(v32, v33, p3, v34, v35, v36)`, `kin(v32, v37, p4, v34, v35, v36)`, and `kin(v32, v38, p5, v34, v35, v36)`. However, the `pick` and `place` actions in the available actions list use `#o3` for the base configuration. My plan used `#o3` which is defined as `bconf(#o3)` and also has `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `basemotion(#o3, #o0, #o3)`. It seems I should have used `#o3` as the `atbconf` parameter for pick/place. The previous plan did use `#o3`, and I failed to include the `move_base` action to transition from `v3` to `#o3`.
