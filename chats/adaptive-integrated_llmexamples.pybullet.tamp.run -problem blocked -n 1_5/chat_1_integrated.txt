User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.761, 0.368), (-4.69, 0.438)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.725, 0.403, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.71, 0.704).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects, some of which are already placed at specific poses, and others that are movable. There are two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and two hands, `handempty(v4)` and `handempty(v6)`. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which by the given axioms, is true if `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)` are true for some object `green`. Looking at the initial state, we see that `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true. This means that either `v12` or `v8` could be the `green` object. Also `v18` is a surface. We need to place either `v12` or `v8` on `v18`. From the initial state, `v8` is currently at `v9` on `v11` and `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`.
           
           Let's choose `v8` as the object we want to place on `v18`.
           Currently, `v8` is at `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. We need to move `v8` to a new pose on `v18`. The available `kin` facts indicate that `v4` can interact with `v8` at `v9` and also at `#o2`. This `#o2` pose is supported by `v10` and `v18`.
           
           The current plan is to use arm `v4` to pick up `v8` from `v9` and then place it at `#o2` which is on `v18`. The `move_base` action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is the only action instance available for `move_base`.
           
           --Plan--:
           (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)
           
           --Poses--:
           (#o2 v8 v18): (4.5 0.15 0.8 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     My apologies. I made a mistake by using `pick` and `place` actions that were not explicitly listed in the allowed action instances. Given the extremely limited set of available action instances, only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` is allowed.
           
           The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which requires `on(?o, v18)` and `type(?o, v17)`. In the initial state, we have `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`.
           The current state is:
           `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, v9, v11)`.
           `atpose(v12, v13)` and `supported(v12, v13, v14)`.
           
           For the goal to be satisfied, either `v8` or `v12` needs to be `on v18`. This means their `atpose` predicate must point to a pose that is `supported` by `v18`.
           From the initial state, no object `v8` or `v12` is `on v18`. Since the only available action is `move_base`, which only changes the robot's base configuration and not the position of any objects, it is impossible to achieve the goal from the initial state. The `pick` and `place` actions are necessary to move objects, but they are not available in the provided list of valid actions.
