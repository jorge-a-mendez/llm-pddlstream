(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0. This involves understanding the object's dimensions, the surface's constraints, and defining what constitutes a stable placement.
           
           The object has dimensions of approximately 0.098 x 0.098, which is nearly square. Surface 0 is a square AABB with bounds (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135), giving it a side length of 0.27. A placement is defined by (surf_idx, theta, x, y), where stability means the object's rotated AABB is fully contained within the surface's AABB.
           
           To assess stability, I need to account for rotation. When rotated by an angle θ, the object's effective width and height change. For a given rotation θ, the effective width is computed as `obj_w * |cos(θ)| + obj_h * |sin(θ)|`, and the effective height is `obj_w * |sin(θ)| + obj_h * |cos(θ)|`. The stability condition ensures that the center of the rotated object remains within the allowed region of the surface.
           
           Given that the object is nearly square, it is useful to use the value s = 0.098 for the calculations. The maximum effective side occurs at 45 degrees, which is `s * sqrt(2)`. For this specific object, the maximum effective dimension is 0.13858. The surface has dimension of 0.27.
           
           The strategy to generate placements involves two parts:
           1.  **Rotation:** I'll sample 10 different rotation angles, ranging from 0 to 9π/8.
           2.  **Position:** For each angle, I calculate the allowable x and y center ranges. In each `theta` step, I'll place the object at the center of the surface (0, 0), which is usually valid, and at the four corners of the allowable bounding box given `theta`.
           
           This method will yield 50 unique stable placements. This gives a broad sweep of potential object positions and rotations within surface 0.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got object ID 4, which is almost a square, and I need to find 50 stable placements on surface 0, avoiding collision with object ID 5, which is already centered there. I'll need to figure out how to generate the valid placements for this square object.
           
           First, I need to understand what "stable placement" means here. Then, I will focus on 4 major rotation angles: 0, pi/2, pi, and 3pi/2.
           
           I know that to find these, I will create small rectangles to cover the space so that I can figure out the valid placements.
           
           My main concern is collisions, especially with object 5. To check for collision, I will consider an object to be placed if:
           1. `abs(x_A - x_B) < (w_A + w_B) / 2` AND `abs(y_A - y_B) < (h_A + h_B) / 2`.
           This means two objects are colliding.
           
           To deal with this, I'm going to only consider the 4 cardinal directions and the angles within them to generate these placement rectangles.
           
           I've determined that the maximum effective size of object 4 (considering rotations) is almost as large as its original dimensions, because the object is nearly a square. Therefore, the stable placement range is only around the outer edges of the surface.
           
           To guarantee no collision, I will focus on finding the safe boundaries of where the edges of object 4 can be located relative to object 5. After that, I will place 12 rectangles around the edges in a L shape to cover the object. This will be repeated for all the major 4 rotations.

(Thoughts: **Surface Placement Strategy for a Square Object**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with figuring out 50 stable locations for this new square object (ID 6) on surface 0.  I need to make sure it doesn't collide with the two objects already placed there: Object 5 (a small square centered at the origin) and Object 4 (in the bottom-left corner).
           
           My first move is to understand the boundaries. Object 6 is a square with a side length of ~0.076. The surface itself is a square, 0.27 x 0.27. I know that since object 6 is a square, regardless of rotation angle, its "effective" width and height will always be the same. This is good, simplifies things. I'll need to figure out these valid regions for the center of object 6, which must be between -0.096 and 0.096.
           
           I've calculated the collision areas of the obstacles. Object 5 has an AABB box around zero, Object 4 extends along the bottom-left corner of the surface.  I've also calculated the possible center ranges based on various rotation angles. Basically, I need to create a buffer zone around the existing objects.
           
           Let's break it down: I'm focusing on finding areas where I can place the center of Object 6, for different angles (0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2). So, I'm working with the idea of calculating the AABB, or axis-aligned bounding box, for the object 6 and checking the non-collision conditions. The condition for no collision, or AABB overlap can be applied for each obstacle.
           
           To make things simpler, since it's a square object, I can use 0 degrees rotation and generate 25 points. Then the same coordinates will be reused for 90 degrees rotation.  I can divide the surface into four major zones: to the right of Object 5, to the left of Object 5, above Object 5, below Object 5.
           
           After testing the non-collision conditions, I found, for theta = 0, with a grid or surface.
           * 4 top-right points at approx `x=0.09` & `y=0.09`
           * 4 top-left points at approx `x=-0.09` & `y=0.09`
           * 4 bottom-right points at approx `x=0.09` & `y=-0.09`
           * 8 center points to fill in safe space.
           I then pick the 25 points. So for each point I have theta, (x, y) coordinates. These can be easily rotated for the second half of the points.
           
           So, the strategy is: calculate safe center coordinates, use a specific grid pattern or coordinate points to populate the area. Calculate these safe values for the object 6's AABB. Then populate the surface. After generating the points, I repeat for the second angle.
           
           This should give me those 50 stable placements, all non-colliding and perfectly covering the surface. I am sure I can make this plan.
