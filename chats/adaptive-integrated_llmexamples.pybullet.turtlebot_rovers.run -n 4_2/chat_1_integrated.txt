           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.472, 1.884), (-0.399, 1.956)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.511, 1.953), (0.604, 2.046)).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires that `receivedimage` predicates are true for all objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) with mode v11, and `receivedanalysis` predicates are true for rock type v2 (stone) and v6 (soil).
           
           The initial state defines two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a store v16 that is free. Rover v14 has camera v10 onboard, which supports mode v11. Rover v12 also has camera v10 onboard.
           Both rovers are at known configurations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15). There are also unknown configurations defined by '#' symbols, like #o0, #o3, #o5.
           
           To achieve the `receivedimage` goals, the rovers need to:
           1. Calibrate the camera.
           2. Take an image of each objective.
           3. Send the image to the lander v9.
           
           To achieve the `receivedanalysis` goals, the rovers need to:
           1. Sample rocks of type v2 (stone) and v6 (soil).
           2. Send the analysis to the lander v9.
           
           The rocks of type v2 (stone) are v1, v3, v4.
           The rocks of type v6 (soil) are v5, v7, v8.
           
           Rover v14 is at v15 ((-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)) and v12 is at v13 ((1.0, -1.75, 3.142)). Lander v9 is at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Objectives:
           v17: ((1.925, 1.799), (2.004, 1.877))
           v18: ((0.511, 1.953), (0.604, 2.046))
           v19: ((-0.472, 1.884), (-0.399, 1.956))
           v20: ((-1.928, 1.991), (-1.838, 2.08))
           
           Rocks:
           v1: ((-1.43, 0.79), (-1.348, 0.871)) (type v2, stone)
           v3: ((2.068, 1.366), (2.152, 1.45)) (type v2, stone)
           v4: ((0.852, -0.767), (0.928, -0.69)) (type v2, stone)
           v5: ((-2.062, 0.391), (-1.956, 0.497)) (type v6, soil)
           v7: ((1.802, -1.483), (1.921, -1.363)) (type v6, soil)
           v8: ((1.133, 1.87), (1.257, 1.993)) (type v6, soil)
           
           The initial state includes `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`. This means rover v14 can sample all rocks if it moves to configuration #o5.
           Similarly, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)` for rover v12.
           Since both rovers are capable of sampling, we can split the work. Rover v14 is initially at v15 which is closer to some of the rocks, let's use v14 to sample rocks. Rover v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75), which is closer to lander v9 ((-1.9, -2.0)), making it suitable for communication.
           
           For taking images and sending them, both rovers have `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates defined for different objectives and the lander from configuration #o3 and #o0 respectively.
           Rover v14 can take images of all objectives and send them. Rover v12 can also take images of all objectives and send them.
           Let's use rover v14 for sampling and sending analysis, and rover v12 for imaging and sending images.
           
           Plan:
           Rover v14 will:
           1. Move to #o5 to sample rocks.
           2. Sample one stone (e.g., v1) and one soil (e.g., v5).
           3. Move to #o0 to send analysis.
           4. Send analysis for the sampled rocks.
           
           Rover v12 will:
           1. Move to #o3 to calibrate and take images.
           2. Calibrate camera.
           3. Take images of all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20).
           4. Move to #o0 to send images.
           5. Send all four images.
           
           This strategy ensures that both rovers are utilized efficiently and all parts of the goal are covered.
           Note: Since `conf(v14, v15)` and `conf(v12, v13)` are initial, we consider them fixed and use them as starting points. The continuous parameters #o0, #o3, #o5 need to be assigned.
           
           Let's calculate approximate configurations for #o0, #o3, #o5 to satisfy the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates while being collision-free and reachable.
           Lander v9 AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           Rover v12 at v13: (1.0, -1.75, 3.142)
           Rover v14 at v15: (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0)
           
           For `comvisible`:
           - `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`: Rover v12 (1.0, -1.75) needs to see v9 (approx -1.9, -2.0). A configuration for v12 like (0.0, -1.75) or similar would work for communication. Let's place it roughly between v13 and v9, but closer to v13 to reduce movement cost. For example, a point like (0.5, -1.75) is about 0.5 units away from v13 and 2.5 units from v9, which is within the 4-unit comrange.
           - `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`: Rover v14 (-1.0, -1.75) needs to see v9 (approx -1.9, -2.0). A configuration for v14 like (-1.5, -1.75) is about 0.5 units away from v15 and 0.5 units from v9, which is within range.
           
           To simplify, let's use one #o0 value for both rovers that is generally a good spot to communicate with v9. Since v14 is already closer to v9, we can move it to a location that works for communication. Let's choose #o0 closer to v14.
           
           For `imagevisible`:
           Rover v12 and v14 need to see v17, v18, v19, v20. These objectives are in various directions.
           v17: (approx 1.9, 1.8)
           v18: (approx 0.5, 2.0)
           v19: (approx -0.4, 1.9)
           v20: (approx -1.8, 2.0)
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, <objective>)`: v12 is at v13 (1.0, -1.75).
           To see v17 (1.9, 1.8), v18 (0.5, 2.0), v19 (-0.4, 1.9), v20 (-1.8, 2.0), #o3 should be a configuration that allows visibility to these objectives. Given the coordinates, a configuration around (0, 0) or slightly north of rovers might be suitable. Let's try (0.0, 0.0) for #o3 for v12 for all image captures.
           v12 at v13 (1.0, -1.75). Moving to (0.0, 0.0) means dist is sqrt(1^2 + 1.75^2) approx 2 units.
           From (0.0, 0.0):
           - to v17 (1.9, 1.8): dist approx sqrt(1.9^2 + 1.8^2) approx 2.6, within 2.
           - to v18 (0.5, 2.0): dist approx sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.0^2) approx 2.06, within 2.
           - to v19 (-0.4, 1.9): dist approx sqrt(0.4^2 + 1.9^2) approx 1.94, within 2.
           - to v20 (-1.8, 2.0): dist approx sqrt(1.8^2 + 2.0^2) approx 2.69, within 2.
           This implies (0.0, 0.0) might be a bit too far for all objectives for imagevisible. A point closer to the objectives and within range of the current rover position for a `move` might be better. Let's assume #o3 is close enough to the objectives and rover can move there. The `imagerange` is 2. The `imagevisible` predicates are provided, so we just need to assign a valid pose to #o3 for v12 that allows line-of-sight to the objectives from that pose. A configuration for v12 at (0.0, 1.0) would be closer to the objectives and potentially satisfy the range for all. Distance from v13 to (0.0, 1.0) is sqrt(1^2 + 2.75^2) approx 2.9, which is large for a move.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configuration #o3 for v12.
           Objectives are around y=2 or y=1.8. Let's set #o3 for v12 to be at (0.0, 1.8) to be close to the objectives for taking images.
           From v13 (1.0, -1.75) to (0.0, 1.8) is sqrt(1^2 + 3.55^2) = 3.7. This is fine for a move.
           From (0.0, 1.8):
           - to v17 (1.9, 1.8): dist = 1.9. OK.
           - to v18 (0.5, 2.0): dist = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.29) approx 0.5. OK.
           - to v19 (-0.4, 1.9): dist = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.17) approx 0.4. OK.
           - to v20 (-1.8, 2.0): dist = sqrt(1.8^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(3.24 + 0.04) = sqrt(3.28) approx 1.8. OK.
           So, #o3 for v12 can be at (0.0, 1.8).
           
           For `above(v14, #o5, <rock>)`: v14 is at v15 (-1.0, -1.75).
           Rocks are at various locations.
           v1: (-1.4, 0.8)
           v3: (2.1, 1.4)
           v4: (0.9, -0.7)
           v5: (-2.0, 0.4)
           v7: (1.8, -1.4)
           v8: (1.1, 1.9)
           These rocks are quite spread out. It is unlikely that one single #o5 position can be "above" all of them. "above" means the rover is positioned directly over the rock. This implies that the x,y coordinates of the rover should be within the AABB of the rock. This cannot be true for all listed rocks simultaneously for a single #o5. However, the `above` predicate in PDDL usually means the robot is in a configuration to interact with the rock (e.g., sample). We must assume the initial `above` predicates are valid for *some* interpretation of #o5 and we only need to provide *one* such #o5 that works for the selected rock.
           
           Let's pick v1 (stone, (-1.4, 0.8)) and v5 (soil, (-2.0, 0.4)). Rover v14 is at (-1.0, -1.75).
           To be above v1, #o5 could be, for example, (-1.3, 0.8).
           To be above v5, #o5 could be, for example, (-2.0, 0.4).
           It is impossible for one #o5 to be above multiple disparate rocks. Given the action instance `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16`, this suggests we are looking for a single configuration #o5 that allows sampling one chosen rock. We only need to sample *one* stone and *one* soil.
           
           Let's use v1 as the stone (type v2) and v5 as the soil (type v6).
           For v14 to sample v1 (stone), #o5 for (v14, v1) could be, e.g., (-1.38, 0.83), which is inside the AABB of v1 ((-1.43, 0.79), (-1.348, 0.871)).
           For v14 to sample v5 (soil), #o5 for (v14, v5) could be, e.g., (-2.0, 0.44), which is inside the AABB of v5 ((-2.062, 0.391), (-1.956, 0.497)).
           
           Since the plan needs to pick a single #o5 for `sample_rock`, we must choose one rock to sample first. Then we need another `sample_rock` for the other type, which would implicitly require another #o5, or move action, but the available actions show `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16`. This implies that the same #o5 works for all "above" listed rocks or we need to move. However, `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)` and `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, v15)` exist. This means we can move to #o5 and then back. And then use #o5 for another rock. This suggests #o5 must be a single configuration. This is only possible if all rocks are within a small radius or the definition of `above` is very loose.
           
           Let's assume the provided `above(v14, #o5, vX)` predicates are true in a way that allows us to sample rocks sequentially at different locations, or the #o5 for sampling v1 and #o5 for sampling v5 could be different instances of the same #o5 symbol (which is not how continuous parameters typically work). Let's interpret that #o5 is a general "sampling pose" and we can move between specific 'above' locations, but the PDDL actions use one #o5. The most reasonable interpretation is that #o5 describes a particular configuration that can be used for sampling. The problem description states "if your plan uses some object #<name>... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies a unique configuration for each `#name`. So, for `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16` to be valid for a single plan and a single #o5, it means that from #o5, v14 can sample both v1 and v5. This is geometrically unlikely unless they are very close.
           
           Let's check the distance between v1 and v5.
           v1: ((-1.43, 0.79), (-1.348, 0.871))
           v5: ((-2.062, 0.391), (-1.956, 0.497))
           These are relatively far apart (distance approx sqrt(0.6^2 + 0.4^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.52) approx 0.7 units). One fixed #o5 cannot be above both.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` implies that `receivedanalysis` should be true for *types* v2 (stone) and v6 (soil), not for specific rocks. Therefore, we just need to sample one rock of type v2 and one of type v6.
           
           Let's choose specific rocks that are close for sampling with rover v14.
           For type v2 (stone): v1 ((-1.43, 0.79)) or v4 ((0.852, -0.767)) or v3 ((2.068, 1.366)).
           For type v6 (soil): v5 ((-2.062, 0.391)) or v7 ((1.802, -1.483)) or v8 ((1.133, 1.87)).
           
           Given v14 starts at v15 (-1.0, -1.75):
           - Closest stone: v1 (-1.4, 0.8). dist from v15 to v1 is sqrt((-1.4 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.8 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (2.55)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 6.5) = sqrt(6.66) approx 2.58.
           - Closest soil: v5 (-2.0, 0.4). dist from v15 to v5 is sqrt((-2.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.4 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (2.15)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4.62) = sqrt(5.62) approx 2.37.
           These rocks are not close to each other. So a single #o5 for both `sample_rock` actions is problematic.
           
           Let's reconsider the axioms and initial state. `new-axiom@0()` has a conjunction that includes `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`. This means we need at least one rock of type stone and one of type soil to be analyzed and their analysis sent. The `sample_rock` action makes `analyzed(v, r)` true. The `send_analysis` action makes `receivedanalysis(r)` true.
           The predicates `type(?b: object, ?t: object)` means `?b` is of type `?t`. So, `type(v1, v2)` means v1 is a stone (type v2).
           
           It is likely that the plan expects that one instance of `#o5` might be the sampling location for one rock, and the rover would need to move to another sampling location for the second rock. However, the available actions list only uses `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16` etc. without an action to change the #o5 parameter. This is a common PDDL issue when continuous parameters are abstractly named. Given the problem description, we must choose *one* `#o5` value.
           
           The only way `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16` can both be executed with the same `#o5` is if `#o5` is a configuration that is "above" both v1 and v5. This is geometrically impossible for discrete AABBs that are not overlapping. This implies an interpretation error or a hidden flexibility for `#o5` for sampling.
           However, I must assume the available action instances are valid if their preconditions are met.
           Let's assume that if `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are in the initial state, the system means that #o5 is a *generic sampling pose*, and the `sample_rock` action can be applied by moving to the specific pose for each rock. But the plan generation should not use any actions that are not explicitly provided. And the motion actions are like `motion(v14, #o5, #o2, #o0)`. This implies #o5 is a fixed point.
           
           Let's look at the given axiom again:
           `Axiom new-axiom@0() Conjunction Atom atconf(v12, v13) Atom atconf(v14, v15) Atom free(v12, v16) Atom free(v14, v16) Atom receivedimage(v17, v11) Atom receivedimage(v18, v11) Atom receivedimage(v19, v11) Atom receivedimage(v20, v11) Atom type(?stone, v2) Atom receivedanalysis(?stone) Atom type(?soil, v6) Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)`
           
           The `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` means that *some* rock of type v2 has `receivedanalysis` and *some* rock of type v6 has `receivedanalysis`. We don't need all stones or all soils analyzed. Just one of each type.
           
           So, the plan:
           1. Rover v14 samples v1 (stone, type v2) at #o5.
           2. Rover v14 samples v5 (soil, type v6) at #o5. (This step requires a strong assumption that #o5 is valid for both, or there is implicit movement. Based on the rules, it must be the same #o5 value). I will select an #o5 that works for one rock, and then assume the PDDL system is fine with it. If it fails, I'll revise. Let's provide #o5 as the center of rock v1.
           3. Rover v14 moves from #o5 to #o0 to send analysis.
           4. Rover v14 sends analysis for v1.
           5. Rover v14 sends analysis for v5.
           6. Rover v12 moves from v13 to #o3.
           7. Rover v12 calibrates at #o3 to see v17.
           8. Rover v12 takes images of v17, v18, v19, v20 at #o3.
           9. Rover v12 moves from #o3 to #o0 to send images.
           10. Rover v12 sends images of v17, v18, v19, v20.
           
           Let's consider the geometry again for #o5 to be a valid configuration for `sample_rock` for both v1 and v5. This is indeed problematic. The only way it could work is if the "above" predicate has a larger radius than the rock AABB, or if #o5 is a *name* for a configuration specific to that (rover, rock) pair. The problem statement says "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This implies a *single* value for #o5. If I choose #o5 to be above v1, it won't be above v5.
           
           This is a critical issue. The problem asks for a plan that *achieves the goal*. If the stated actions cannot be performed because of geometric constraints, then the goal is unreachable.
           However, I am given `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` in the initial state for the same #o5. This is a contradiction if #o5 is a single point that must be within the AABB of the rock. It's more likely that the 'above' predicate in PDDL means 'can sample this rock from this general pose #o5', and the specific geometry for each sample is handled by the underlying planner, or that I must choose one representative rock for each type to sample.
           
           Given the goal requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, I need to perform `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` for at least one stone and one soil.
           Let's select v1 (stone) and v5 (soil).
           I will assume that #o5 allows sampling of both v1 and v5, as implied by the initial state `above` facts. I will provide a single value for #o5, which will be arbitrary, e.g., somewhere central to the two rocks but reachable by the rover. Or, I should choose an #o5 that is above one rock, and explain that the other is not achievable. This is a dilemma.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameter #o5 is a "generic sampling configuration" and for each `sample_rock` action the robot moves to the precise location over the specific rock (implicitly, not an explicit action). The continuous value for #o5 would then be a representative one that allows this. Let's provide #o5 as the center of v1. The `above` facts in the initial state are `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`. This implies that *from this #o5*, both v1 and v5 are "above". This is only plausible if #o5 is not a single point *above* the rock, but a "region" or state variable. However, I need to provide a single (x,y) for #o5.
           I must choose *one* (x,y) for #o5. I will make #o5 for rover v14 a pose slightly above rock v1.
           If the actions `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16` and `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16` are both valid given #o5 for v1, then it means the `above` predicate is not strictly about `(x,y)` of the rock but more about the robot's capability in that generic configuration.
           
           Let's proceed with the plan and define the configurations.
           
           For rover v14 to sample v1 (stone):
           #o5 for v14: v1 ((-1.43, 0.79), (-1.348, 0.871)). Let's use (-1.38, 0.83).
           Distance from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.38, 0.83) = sqrt((-1.38 - (-1.0))^2 + (0.83 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.38)^2 + (2.58)^2) = sqrt(0.1444 + 6.6564) = sqrt(6.8). This is okay for a `move`.
           
           For rover v12 to take images:
           #o3 for v12: Objectives are at y=~2. Let's use (0.0, 1.8) as discussed.
           Distance from v13 (1.0, -1.75) to (0.0, 1.8) = sqrt((0.0 - 1.0)^2 + (1.8 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (3.55)^2) = sqrt(1 + 12.6025) = sqrt(13.6025) approx 3.69. This is okay for a `move`.
           
           For both rovers to send analysis/images to lander v9:
           Lander v9: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). Let's use its center (-1.9, -2.0) as target.
           #o0 for v14: v14 starts at (-1.0, -1.75). To communicate with v9, let's put it at (-1.5, -1.8).
           Distance from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.5, -1.8) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-0.05)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.2525) approx 0.5.
           Distance from (-1.5, -1.8) to v9 center (-1.9, -2.0) = sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.2) approx 0.44. This is within 4.
           #o0 for v12: v12 starts at (1.0, -1.75). To communicate with v9, let's put it at (-0.5, -1.8).
           Distance from v13 (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.5, -1.8) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-0.05)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(2.2525) approx 1.5.
           Distance from (-0.5, -1.8) to v9 center (-1.9, -2.0) = sqrt((-1.4)^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 0.04) = sqrt(2.0) approx 1.41. This is within 4.
           
           I need to provide a *single* value for #o0 for each rover, as per the problem description "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". For comvisible, the target object is v9. So #o0 for v12 should be different from #o0 for v14 (though they share the same #o0 symbol in the PDDL). I will use the configuration names from the PDDL. So, #o0 for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and #o0 for `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)` are distinct conceptually. The problem states `conf(v12, #o0)` and `conf(v14, #o0)` as initial state, so it implies two distinct config values for the single #o0 parameter. The problem statement refers to `#<name>` (e.g., #o0) as the "configuration name". So, `#o0` could potentially be instantiated to different values depending on the rover.
           
           Let's use `conf_v12_com` for `v12`'s `#o0` and `conf_v14_com` for `v14`'s `#o0`.
           And `conf_v12_img` for `v12`'s `#o3`.
           And `conf_v14_sam` for `v14`'s `#o5`.
           
           The problem description: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate."
           
           This means for each `conf(rover, #<name>)` I use in an `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, I must provide a value.
           For example, for `conf(v12, #o0)`, since `#o0` is used in `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`, I need a value.
           Similarly for `conf(v14, #o0)` with `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           For `conf(v12, #o3)` with `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`.
           For `conf(v14, #o3)` with `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`. However, I've chosen v12 for imaging, so v14 won't use #o3 for imaging.
           For `conf(v12, #o5)` with `above(v12, #o5, v4)`. However, I've chosen v14 for sampling, so v12 won't use #o5 for sampling.
           For `conf(v14, #o5)` with `above(v14, #o5, v1)`. This is used.
           
           So the configs I need to define:
           - `#o0` for v12 (for communication with v9)
           - `#o0` for v14 (for communication with v9)
           - `#o3` for v12 (for image taking)
           - `#o5` for v14 (for sampling)
           
           Let's make sure the plan doesn't try to reuse objects when not allowed.
           The problem statement: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           Here, for communication, the target is `v9` for both rovers. So, for `(v12, v9)` and `(v14, v9)` with predicate `comvisible`, I need to specify `#o0` for each.
           For imaging, the target objects are `v17, v18, v19, v20`. I'm using `v12` for all, and the predicate is `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, vX)`. Here, the configuration parameter is `#o3` for rover `v12`. It is not changing for each target object. So one `#o3` for `v12` is needed.
           For sampling, the target objects are `v1` and `v5`. I'm using `v14` for both, and the predicate is `above(v14, #o5, vX)`. One `#o5` for `v14` is needed.
           
           Revised continuous values:
           - `#o0` for `v12` communicating with `v9`: (0.5, -1.75) (ray #o1)
           - `#o0` for `v14` communicating with `v9`: (-1.5, -1.8) (ray #o1)
           - `#o3` for `v12` imaging objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20`: (0.0, 1.8) (ray #o4)
           - `#o5` for `v14` sampling rocks `v1, v5`: (-1.38, 0.83) (no ray, implicitly `above` position)

Model:     The previous attempt failed due to collisions and reachability issues with the chosen continuous configurations. I need to redefine #o0, #o3, and #o5.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the configurations based on the collision and reachability feedback.
           
           **Collision for #o0 (v14 for v9):**
           `#o0 = (-1.5 -1.8)` for rover `v14` at target `v9` is in collision with `v9` itself. This means the rover is trying to occupy the same space as the lander. The rover should be *near* the lander, not *inside* it.
           Lander `v9`: AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.34555], upper=[-1.3953, -1.65445])
           My chosen #o0 (-1.5, -1.8) is within the lander's AABB. I need to choose a point outside the lander's AABB but within communication range (4 units).
           Let's keep `v14` for communication with `v9`. `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           A point like (-1.0, -2.2) is outside the lander's AABB and close to `v15`.
           Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, -2.2) = 0.45. Reachable.
           Distance from (-1.0, -2.2) to center of `v9` (-1.9, -2.0) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.2)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.85) approx 0.92. This is well within comrange (4 units).
           So, for `#o0` for `v14` with `v9`, let's try `(-1.0 -2.2)`.
           
           **Collision for #o3 (v12 for v17, v18, v19, v20):**
           `#o3 = (0.0 1.8)` for rover `v12` is in collision with `v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This is a thin wall or obstacle at x=0.0.
           This means my chosen x-coordinate for #o3, which was 0.0, is directly inside an obstacle. I need to move to x slightly to the left or right.
           Let's keep `v12` for imaging. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Objectives:
           v17: (1.925, 1.799)
           v18: (0.511, 1.953)
           v19: (-0.472, 1.884)
           v20: (-1.928, 1.991)
           Given the obstacle `v21` is at `x=0.0`, I need to choose an x-coordinate that is not 0.0.
           If I choose a positive x, e.g., `x=0.5`. Let's try `(0.5, 1.8)`.
           Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (0.5, 1.8) = sqrt((0.5 - 1.0)^2 + (1.8 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (3.55)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 12.6025) = sqrt(12.8525) approx 3.58. Reachable.
           From (0.5, 1.8):
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = 1.4. OK (within 2).
           - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = 0.2. OK.
           - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (0.1)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.82) approx 0.9. OK.
           - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = sqrt((-2.3)^2 + (0.2)^2) = sqrt(5.29 + 0.04) = sqrt(5.33) approx 2.3. This is outside imagerange (2 units).
           So (0.5, 1.8) for #o3 for v12 is not suitable for v20.
           
           I need a position for v12 that can see all objectives within range 2 and avoids v21.
           Let's try a negative x-coordinate, e.g., `x=-0.5`. Let's try `(-0.5, 1.8)`.
           Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (-0.5, 1.8) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (3.55)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 12.6025) = sqrt(14.8525) approx 3.85. Reachable.
           From (-0.5, 1.8):
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = 2.4. This is outside imagerange (2 units).
           
           It seems a single configuration for `v12` cannot satisfy all image-taking goals. This is a problem with the assumption that one #o3 works for all objectives. The problem statement says: "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all)".
           
           This means that if I want `v12` to take images of `v17, v18, v19, v20` from #o3, but #o3 is actually tied to `(v12, v17)`, then I need a different #o3 for `(v12, v18)`, etc.
           However, in the initial state, the predicate is `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, etc., *using the same #o3*. This implies that one #o3 should work for all. This is a conflicting interpretation given my geometric calculation.
           
           I must adhere to the PDDL initial state, which lists `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, vX)` for multiple objectives, implying that one configuration `#o3` should allow seeing all of them. The `imagerange` is 2.
           Let's find a compromise. Objectives' approximate locations:
           v17: (1.9, 1.8)
           v18: (0.5, 2.0)
           v19: (-0.4, 1.9)
           v20: (-1.8, 2.0)
           
           Midpoint roughly (0.05, 1.925). This is still at x=0.0 which has an obstacle.
           Let's try to put `#o3` for `v12` at `(0.1, 1.8)` to avoid the `v21` obstacle.
           From (0.1, 1.8):
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = 1.8. OK.
           - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.2) approx 0.45. OK.
           - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.26) approx 0.5. OK.
           - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = sqrt(1.9^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 0.04) = sqrt(3.65) approx 1.91. OK.
           This seems to work for all objectives with `imagerange` of 2 units.
           Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (0.1, 1.8) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (3.55)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 12.6025) = sqrt(13.4125) approx 3.66. Reachable.
           So, for `#o3` for `v12` for imaging, let's use `(0.1, 1.8)`.
           
           **Reachability for #o5 (v14 for v1 and v5):**
           `#o5 = (-1.38 0.83)` for rover `v14` at target `v1` is not reachable.
           `#o5 = (-1.38 0.83)` for rover `v14` at target `v5` is not reachable.
           This is a `robot base` reachability issue. This means the robot cannot move its base to this exact coordinate. Maybe it's too far from current position, or there's an obstacle.
           Initial position of `v14` is `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           Rock `v1` is at ((-1.43, 0.79), (-1.348, 0.871)).
           Rock `v5` is at ((-2.062, 0.391), (-1.956, 0.497)).
           My previous chosen #o5 was (-1.38, 0.83). Distance from `v15` was 2.58. This should be reachable for a rover. There must be an obstacle or terrain constraint not explicitly given, or the calculation for reachability has stricter limits.
           Given the action instance `sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16`, I must make #o5 reachable by v14.
           Let's choose another pair of rocks. How about v4 (stone) and v7 (soil)?
           `v4`: ((0.852, -0.767), (0.928, -0.69))
           `v7`: ((1.802, -1.483), (1.921, -1.363))
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           To be above `v4`, let's try `(0.89, -0.73)`.
           Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(0.89, -0.73)` = sqrt((1.89)^2 + (1.02)^2) = sqrt(3.5721 + 1.0404) = sqrt(4.6125) approx 2.14. This is a reasonable distance.
           This configuration `(0.89, -0.73)` would be used for #o5 for `v14` for sampling `v4` and `v7`.
           Let's verify if `v7` is "above" or reachable from this new #o5.
           `v7` center approx `(1.86, -1.42)`.
           Distance from `(0.89, -0.73)` to `(1.86, -1.42)` = sqrt((0.97)^2 + (-0.69)^2) = sqrt(0.9409 + 0.4761) = sqrt(1.417) approx 1.19. This means that if #o5 is above v4, it is not above v7. This geometric contradiction persists.
           
           I will use the interpretation that the *existence* of `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` in the initial state means that a valid #o5 *exists* to allow sampling for both, even if it's not a single physical point above both, and I only need to provide *one* such point that is reachable. The problem specifies that I should define a single `conf(rover, #name)` value. Given this, the system should allow both `sample_rock` actions if `above` predicates are true for that #o5, as per the initial state. I will pick a reachable point that is above one of them (e.g., v1) and trust the PDDL system to handle the implicit flexibility of `above` when using the same #o5 for different rocks.
           
           Let's re-evaluate reachability. A rover base might have an AABB. No AABB is given for rovers. I assume a point robot for simplicity.
           Could "not reachable for robot base" mean it's too far from `v15`?
           My previous distance was 2.58 from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.38, 0.83). This seems like a perfectly reasonable distance for a rover to move.
           The only reason it might be "not reachable" is if there's an obstacle in between, which I don't know from the AABBs.
           
           Let's pick an #o5 that is closer to v15. How about trying to sample v4 (stone) and v7 (soil) using v14?
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           `v4` (stone) center approx `(0.89, -0.73)`. Distance from `v15` to `(0.89, -0.73)` approx 2.14.
           `v7` (soil) center approx `(1.86, -1.42)`. Distance from `v15` to `(1.86, -1.42)` approx 2.8.
           These rocks are even further apart from each other than v1 and v5.
           
           Perhaps I should choose rocks closer to `v14`'s initial position or use `v12` for sampling if it's better placed.
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rocks:
           `v1` (stone) center (-1.38, 0.83)
           `v3` (stone) center (2.11, 1.4)
           `v4` (stone) center (0.89, -0.73)
           `v5` (soil) center (-2.0, 0.44)
           `v7` (soil) center (1.86, -1.42)
           `v8` (soil) center (1.19, 1.93)
           
           From `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75):
           - To `v4` (stone, 0.89, -0.73): dist sqrt((-0.11)^2 + (1.02)^2) = sqrt(0.0121 + 1.0404) = sqrt(1.0525) approx 1.02. This is very close.
           - To `v7` (soil, 1.86, -1.42): dist sqrt((0.86)^2 + (0.33)^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 0.1089) = sqrt(0.8485) approx 0.92. This is very close.
           So `v12` is much better positioned to sample `v4` (stone) and `v7` (soil). These two rocks are also closer to each other than v1 and v5.
           `v4` AABB: ((0.852, -0.767), (0.928, -0.69))
           `v7` AABB: ((1.802, -1.483), (1.921, -1.363))
           Still too far for one #o5 to be "above" both simultaneously.
           
           I am forced to assume that the PDDL initial state `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` implicitly means that the planner (or the continuous layer) handles reaching the *exact* above pose for each specific rock when `sample_rock` is called, and my job is just to provide *a valid reachable configuration for #o5* from which this sampling capability is generally available. If this interpretation is wrong, the problem is ill-posed for a single #o5 value to be "above" multiple distant rocks.
           
           Let's switch roles:
           - `v12` for sampling: Sample `v4` (stone) and `v7` (soil).
           - `v14` for imaging: Images `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
           
           New configurations:
           
           1.  **#o5 for `v12` for sampling `v4` and `v7`:**
               `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               To be above `v4` (stone, (0.89, -0.73)), let's set `#o5` for `v12` at `(0.89, -0.73)`.
               Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.89, -0.73)` = sqrt((-0.11)^2 + (1.02)^2) = approx 1.02. This should be reachable.
           
           2.  **#o3 for `v14` for imaging objectives `v17, v18, v19, v20`:**
               `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               Objectives:
               v17: (1.9, 1.8)
               v18: (0.5, 2.0)
               v19: (-0.4, 1.9)
               v20: (-1.8, 2.0)
               Again, need to avoid `v21` at `x=0.0`.
               Let's try `(-0.1, 1.8)` for `#o3` for `v14`.
               Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.1, 1.8)` = sqrt((0.9)^2 + (3.55)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 12.6025) = sqrt(13.4125) approx 3.66. Reachable.
               From `(-0.1, 1.8)`:
               - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = 2.0. OK (within 2).
               - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = sqrt(0.6^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.4) approx 0.63. OK.
               - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = sqrt(0.3^2 + 0.1^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.1) approx 0.31. OK.
               - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = sqrt(1.7^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(2.89 + 0.04) = sqrt(2.93) approx 1.71. OK.
               This works for all objectives for `v14`. So, for `#o3` for `v14` for imaging, let's use `(-0.1, 1.8)`.
           
           3.  **#o0 for `v12` communicating with `v9`:**
               `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
               Let's try `(0.0, -2.2)`. (avoids `v21` and isn't too close to `v9`'s AABB boundary).
               Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.0, -2.2)` = sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (-0.45)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.2025) = sqrt(1.2025) approx 1.09. Reachable.
               Distance from `(0.0, -2.2)` to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` = sqrt((-1.9)^2 + (0.2)^2) = sqrt(3.61 + 0.04) = sqrt(3.65) approx 1.91. OK (within 4).
           
           4.  **#o0 for `v14` communicating with `v9`:**
               `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
               Let's try `(-1.0, -2.2)` as before.
               Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.0, -2.2)` = 0.45. Reachable.
               Distance from `(-1.0, -2.2)` to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` = approx 0.92. OK (within 4).
           
           This revised assignment seems to resolve the collision and reachability issues.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous attempt encountered significant issues with collisions and reachability for almost all chosen continuous configurations. This indicates a more complex environment than initially assumed, with hidden obstacles and/or stricter reachability constraints for the rovers. I need to be more careful in selecting configurations, moving them further away from known obstacles and adjusting based on the "not reachable" feedback.
           
           Let's re-examine each problematic configuration.
           
           **1. Collision for #o0 (v12 for v9):**
           `#o0 = (0.0 -2.2)` for `v12` is in collision with `v21` (thin wall at `x=0.0`) and `v22` (AABB around (0.22, -2.21)).
           This confirms `x=0.0` is problematic, and also a small region to the right of `x=0.0` near `y=-2.2` is blocked.
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` is at `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           I need a position for `v12` to communicate with `v9` that avoids `x=0.0` and the region of `v22`.
           Let's try moving `v12` for communication to a position with a significantly negative x-coordinate, far from `v21` and `v22`. For example, `(-0.7, -2.0)`.
           Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.7, -2.0)` = `sqrt((-1.7)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(2.89 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(2.9525)` approx `1.72`. This should be reachable.
           Distance from `(-0.7, -2.0)` to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` = `1.2`. Within comrange (4 units).
           This avoids `v21` and `v22`.
           
           **2. Reachability for #o0 (v14 for v9):**
           `#o0 = (-1.0 -2.2)` for `v14` is not reachable.
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Lander `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           The previous configuration (-1.0, -2.2) was very close to `v15` (distance 0.45). "Not reachable" could imply it's too close to some unseen obstacle, or the ground is uneven, or the motion system cannot achieve such a precise configuration directly below itself, or even more likely the target is too close to the obstacle `v9` despite being outside its AABB.
           Let's try to move `v14` further away from `v9`'s AABB boundary.
           Perhaps a position with `y = -1.5`, to be above the lander on the y-axis, and slightly to the left in x. For example, `(-2.0, -1.5)`.
           Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-2.0, -1.5)` = `sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(1 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(1.0625)` approx `1.03`. Reachable.
           Distance from `(-2.0, -1.5)` to `v9` center `(-1.9, -2.0)` = `sqrt((0.1)^2 + (-0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(0.01 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(0.26)` approx `0.51`. Within comrange (4 units).
           This should avoid collision with `v9` and be reachable.
           
           **3. Collision for #o3 (v14 for v17, v18, v19, v20):**
           `#o3 = (-0.1 1.8)` for `v14` is in collision with `v21` (at `x=0.0`) and `v23` (AABB lower=(-0.75, 1.75, 0.0), upper=(-0.25, 2.25, 0.1)).
           This means `x=-0.1` is also problematic, and the area around `x=-0.5` between `y=1.75` and `y=2.25` is blocked.
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           Objectives:
           v17: (1.9, 1.8)
           v18: (0.5, 2.0)
           v19: (-0.4, 1.9)
           v20: (-1.8, 2.0)
           I need to find a position for `v14` to take images that avoids `v21` (`x=0.0`) and `v23` (`x` between -0.75 and -0.25).
           Let's try a positive x-coordinate, outside these blocked ranges. For example, `x=0.6`. Let's use `(0.6, 1.8)`.
           Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(0.6, 1.8)` = `sqrt((1.6)^2 + (3.55)^2)` = `sqrt(2.56 + 12.6025)` = `sqrt(15.1625)` approx `3.89`. This should be reachable.
           From `(0.6, 1.8)`:
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = `1.3`. OK (within 2).
           - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = `sqrt((-0.1)^2 + (0.2)^2)` = `sqrt(0.01 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(0.05)` approx `0.22`. OK.
           - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = `sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (0.1)^2)` = `sqrt(1 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(1.01)` approx `1.0`. OK.
           - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = `sqrt((-2.4)^2 + (0.2)^2)` = `sqrt(5.76 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(5.8)` approx `2.4`. This is outside imagerange (2 units).
           Again, a single configuration for `v14` to see all objectives is challenging.
           
           Let's try to assign `v12` for imaging again. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Obstacles `v21` (at `x=0.0`) and `v23` (`x` between -0.75 and -0.25).
           Objectives:
           v17: (1.9, 1.8)
           v18: (0.5, 2.0)
           v19: (-0.4, 1.9)
           v20: (-1.8, 2.0)
           
           How about `(0.2, 1.8)` for #o3 for `v12`? It avoids `x=0.0` and `v23`.
           Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.2, 1.8)` = `sqrt((-0.8)^2 + (3.55)^2)` = `sqrt(0.64 + 12.6025)` = `sqrt(13.2425)` approx `3.63`. Reachable.
           From `(0.2, 1.8)`:
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = `1.7`. OK.
           - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = `sqrt((0.3)^2 + (0.2)^2)` = `sqrt(0.09 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(0.13)` approx `0.36`. OK.
           - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = `sqrt((-0.6)^2 + (0.1)^2)` = `sqrt(0.36 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(0.37)` approx `0.61`. OK.
           - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = `sqrt((-2.0)^2 + (0.2)^2)` = `sqrt(4 + 0.04)` = `sqrt(4.04)` approx `2.01`. This is *just* outside imagerange (2 units).
           
           The problem is trying to find a single point from which all objectives are within 2 units. This might be impossible with the given scene geometry and obstacles.
           Could the `imagevisible` predicate not strictly require a direct line of sight within the 2-unit range from the configuration itself, but rather that the rover *can* get to a position near #o3 to take the image?
           The problem statement: "has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate. The maximum distance from the rover to the target is 2 for `imagevisible` and 4 for `comvisible`." This is strict.
           
           If one rover cannot image all objectives from a single #o3, the plan becomes more complicated, requiring multiple calibrate/take_image steps at different configurations. However, the available actions list doesn't show `imagevisible(v12, #o3a, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3b, #o4, v18)` for distinct #o3a, #o3b. It only lists `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, vX)`. This implies a single #o3.
           
           This means a single #o3 for *all* imaging is unlikely to work due to range constraints. This makes the goal "receivedimage(v17, v11)... (v20, v11)" unattainable if one #o3 must serve all.
           If I have to choose one #o3 that works for at least *some* objectives, then the goal might still be problematic because the axiom requires all of them.
           
           Is it possible that #o3 in `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)` *does* refer to a specific (rover, target) pair, and is *not* the same configuration for all targets, even if it has the same name `o3`?
           "If the plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name."
           This sentence strongly suggests that I should interpret each `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, vX)` as needing its *own* `#o3` configuration, specific to that `vX`. But the initial state lists `conf(v12, #o3)`, implying a single #o3. This is a crucial contradiction.
           
           Let's assume the continuous parameter `o3` in `conf(v12, o3)` can refer to different physical configurations depending on its usage in `imagevisible`. I will define a unique configuration for `v12` for each objective. This implies using different #o3 parameters, but the actions only use `o3`. This means I would have to use four `move` actions and four `calibrate` actions, etc.
           
           No, this is not how continuous parameters in PDDL work. `#o3` is a single variable for `v12`. I need to find *one* spot for `v12` from which it can see `v17, v18, v19, v20` within range 2, avoiding obstacles. This seems impossible.
           
           Let's check the objects' AABBs to see if any of them are inside the vision range.
           v17: (1.925, 1.799), (2.004, 1.877)
           v18: (0.511, 1.953), (0.604, 2.046)
           v19: (-0.472, 1.884), (-0.399, 1.956)
           v20: (-1.928, 1.991), (-1.838, 2.08)
           
           The best spot `(0.2, 1.8)` was 2.01 units from `v20`. If I shift `(0.2, 1.8)` to `(0.0, 1.8)` to get closer to `v20`, it collides with `v21`. If I shift `y` further up to `(0.2, 1.9)`:
           From `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.2, 1.9)` = `sqrt((-0.8)^2 + (3.65)^2)` = `sqrt(0.64 + 13.3225)` = `sqrt(13.9625)` approx `3.73`. Reachable.
           From `(0.2, 1.9)`:
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = `sqrt(1.7^2 + (-0.1)^2)` = `sqrt(2.89 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(2.9)` approx `1.7`. OK.
           - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = `sqrt(0.3^2 + (0.1)^2)` = `sqrt(0.09 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(0.1)` approx `0.31`. OK.
           - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = `0.6`. OK.
           - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = `sqrt((-2.0)^2 + (0.1)^2)` = `sqrt(4 + 0.01)` = `sqrt(4.01)` approx `2.002`. This is still slightly over 2.
           
           This means it is geometrically impossible to satisfy the `imagevisible` preconditions for `v12` from a single configuration `#o3` for all objectives simultaneously, given the strict 2-unit range.
           Therefore, the task goal `receivedimage(vX, v11)` for all four objectives cannot be achieved if it relies on a single `#o3` configuration.
           
           This means the task is likely impossible as currently set up due to geometric constraints and the way continuous parameters are defined. Unless the problem implies that I should use multiple `move` actions to go to different #o3 locations, but this is not reflected in the `imagevisible` predicates that take a *single* #o3.
           
           Given the constraints, I will try to use *two* rovers for imaging.
           Let `v12` image `v17, v18` (closer to v12's side) and `v14` image `v19, v20` (closer to v14's side).
           This is only possible if the initial state contains `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v20)`, which it does. It also contains `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           So, I will define a `#o3` for `v12` for `v17, v18` and a different `#o3` for `v14` for `v19, v20`.
           This aligns with the problem statement: "you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair". This strongly suggests `(v12, v17)` uses one `#o3`, `(v12, v18)` uses another, etc. But the PDDL uses `#o3` as a single symbol for all `imagevisible` for `v12`, which is `conf(v12, #o3)`. This is still a critical contradiction.
           
           The most straightforward interpretation of the PDDL is that `conf(v12, #o3)` implies a *single* location for `#o3` for `v12`. I must choose one. If I cannot find one, the goal is unreachable.
           Given the previous feedback, it's virtually impossible to find one single `#o3` configuration for a rover that has line-of-sight to all four objectives within 2 units, while avoiding `v21` and `v23`.
           
           This suggests the goal as stated, requiring `receivedimage` for all four objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20) from *one* rover at a *single* #o3, is unreachable.
           
           However, I will re-read the axiom for `new-axiom@0()`. It is stated as:
           `Atom receivedimage(v17, v11) Atom receivedimage(v18, v11) Atom receivedimage(v19, v11) Atom receivedimage(v20, v11)`
           This requires ALL of them.
           
           Let's rethink the `imagevisible` part. Given `v21` is a thin wall at `x=0.0`.
           `v23` is between `x=-0.75` and `x=-0.25`.
           Objectives:
           v17: (1.9, 1.8)
           v18: (0.5, 2.0)
           v19: (-0.4, 1.9)
           v20: (-1.8, 2.0)
           
           For `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           To image `v17` and `v18`: Let's try `(0.5, 1.0)`.
           From `(0.5, 1.0)`:
           - to `v17` (1.9, 1.8): dist = `sqrt(1.4^2 + 0.8^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 0.64)` = `sqrt(2.6)` approx `1.6`. OK.
           - to `v18` (0.5, 2.0): dist = `1.0`. OK.
           - to `v19` (-0.4, 1.9): dist = `sqrt((-0.9)^2 + 0.9^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.81)` = `sqrt(1.62)` approx `1.27`. OK.
           - to `v20` (-1.8, 2.0): dist = `sqrt((-2.3)^2 + 1.0^2)` = `sqrt(5.29 + 1)` = `sqrt(6.29)` approx `2.5`. This is outside the range.
           
           The problem specifically allows for different values for `#o<name>` for *each* `(rover, target object)` pair. So, I will define four separate `o3` configurations for `v12` to address this. However, the action `take_image` explicitly uses `#o3`. This means I need to `move` to different `#o3` locations. The problem has:
           `Atom conf(v12, #o3)`
           `Atom imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`
           `Atom imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `Atom imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)`
           `Atom imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
           
           The list of actions is:
           `((take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11))`
           ...
           This implies that *one* `#o3` for `v12` is enough for all imaging, and its value must satisfy all conditions simultaneously.
           
           Since I cannot find a single point `o3` for `v12` to image all 4 objectives, and `o3` for `v14` failed similarly, I conclude that the `receivedimage` part of the `new-axiom@0()` goal is unreachable.
           I am forced to state that the goal is unreachable.
           
           If I *had* to deliver a plan under the assumption that `o3` (and `o5`, `o0`) can take multiple values, even if the PDDL syntax implies otherwise, then I would need:
           - `o3_v12_v17`, `o3_v12_v18`, `o3_v12_v19`, `o3_v12_v20`
           - `o5_v12_v4`, `o5_v12_v7`
           - `o0_v12_v9`
           - `o0_v14_v9`
           
           But this would require me to create new continuous parameters, which is not allowed. I can only provide values for `#o<name>` that are *already* in the initial state. And `#o3` for `v12` is only one symbol.
           
           Therefore, the problem, as described with the given PDDL domain and initial state, is unsolvable given the geometric and reachability constraints.
           
           Let's consider if there is any other way to fulfill `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           The axioms are `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of many atoms. If even one part is unattainable, the whole goal is unattainable.
           I've already identified that finding a single collision-free and range-satisfying `o3` for a rover to image all 4 objectives is geometrically impossible for the given obstacles and ranges.
           
           Final check on sampling for `v12`.
           `#o5 = (0.89 -0.73)` for `v12` (for `v4` and `v7`) was "not reachable".
           `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Rock `v4` center approx `(0.89, -0.73)`. Distance from `v13` to `(0.89, -0.73)` was 1.02. This should be reachable.
           Could it be that the robot base AABB collides with something, or `0.89` x-coordinate is blocked? No explicit obstacle AABB is around (0.89, -0.73).
           
           I am unable to resolve the geometric constraints under the implied rules of a single configuration parameter (#o3 for imaging, #o5 for sampling). If the problem implies that despite the single name, I should provide multiple distinct (rover, object, configuration_name) pairs, that is ambiguous given the "conf(v12, #o3)" implies a single configuration for `o3` with `v12`.
           
           Given the strong negative feedback for multiple configurations, I will stick to the literal interpretation that `#o3` and `#o5` each refer to a *single* configuration per rover. With this, the imaging goal is definitely not achievable.
           
           No plan can be generated. The goal is unreachable.
