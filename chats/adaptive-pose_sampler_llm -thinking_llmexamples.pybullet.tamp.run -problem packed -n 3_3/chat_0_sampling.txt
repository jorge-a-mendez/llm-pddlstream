(Thoughts: **Placing an Object 50 Times on a Surface**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions: 0.08877093373982109, 0.08877093373982103) on surface 0, defined by the bounds `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. A placement is stable if the object is fully contained within the surface. The object can rotate. Since the object is very close to a square (w, h = s), I'll treat it as such.
           
           I've determined that the maximum AABB dimensions of the object, even when rotated, are approximately `side * sqrt(2) = 0.08877093373982109 * 1.41421356237 = 0.125556`. The surface width and height are 0.27, so the object easily fits.
           
           To ensure even coverage, I'm generating 49 placements at theta=0. The AABB dimensions at theta=0 are approximately the original dimensions. To calculate the allowed range for the object's center (x, y), I used the surface bounds and the object's width/height. I will make a grid of 7x7 points, spaced evenly within this allowed range, for x and y coordinates.
           
           For the 50th placement, I'm choosing a different orientation: theta = pi/4. The AABB at theta=pi/4 is larger, but still fits. I've placed this object at the center of the surface `(0, 0)` with theta = pi/4. This will give coverage that is diverse both in location and rotation. The object will fit in the range of `(-0.0722, 0.0722)`.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, here's the game plan for placing this new square object (ID 4) while avoiding a previously placed, non-fixed obstacle (ID 5).  I've got the dimensions of the square object and the surface boundary, and I'm leveraging the feedback on the successful placement of object 5.
           
           First, I analyzed object ID 4.  It's a perfect square with a side length, which I'll denote as `s = 0.09315941411764728`. This leads to a half-dimension value `half_s`.  I'm keeping the object at `theta = 0` for simplicity.
           
           Next, I've got the boundaries of the placement surface `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.  I've done the preliminary calculations for object placement within this surface, establishing the minimum and maximum coordinates for the object's center at `theta = 0`, without considering any obstacles.
           
           Now, the crucial step: avoiding object ID 5. I have its center coordinates, as well as its dimensions `(w5, h5)`, which I have already done a preliminary calculation for its position.  
           
           Object 5 has an AABB that largely occupies the bottom-left of the surface. To avoid overlap, I can either place object 4 above and to the right of object 5, or I have to ensure the two AABB regions never overlap.  I re-evaluated the collision check. I can define collision as `x_center - half_s >= x_max5` OR `y_center - half_s >= y_max5`, where `(x_center, y_center)` is the center of object 4. Then, I can filter my locations to meet this criteria to define a list of valid locations.
           
           To get the 50 valid placements, I generate an evenly spaced grid of points that covers most of the surface area. I can then filter out colliding points by implementing the conditions I've created above. I've re-reviewed my collision check and refined the process of generating valid points by systematically checking if `x_center >= 0.00035` OR `y_center >= 0.00035`.  These values were calculated using the known positions of object 5 and the dimensions of the new object.
           
           Finally, I'll go through the grid I created to populate a list of non-overlapping positions. Then, I'll take the first 50 points I generated.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new task: place object ID 6 on surface 0, and I need to come up with 50 stable placements, avoiding collisions with objects ID 5 and ID 4, which are already in place.
           
           First things first, I've got the geometry. Surface 0 is a nice, neat rectangle, and object ID 6 is almost a square, which simplifies things.  I calculated the AABB dimensions of the object as 0.0988, which translates to a half-dimension of 0.0494.  Given the surface's boundaries, this means the center of ID 6 has a valid range to move around.
           
           Next, I considered the obstacles: ID 5 and ID 4. I've got their dimensions and placements, and I calculated their AABBs.  Now comes the crucial part – collision avoidance.  I've got the calculations to check if the center of ID 6 would overlap with the AABBs of ID 5 or ID 4.
           
           I decided on a strategy. I'll create a grid of potential center points within the valid range for ID 6. Because of the square shape of the object, checking it at `theta=0, pi/2, pi, 3*pi/2` won't change the size or placement, but I'll add `theta=pi/4` (45 degrees) for diversity. For the most part, though, I'm focusing on the AABB. I initially created a 7x7 grid.
           
           I started iterating through this grid, checking for collisions with ID 5 and ID 4 at each point.  It quickly became clear that the lower part of the surface is heavily occupied. Most of the points in the bottom rows were colliding. I looked carefully at what happens when the object ID 6 would be placed near either ID4 or ID5.
           
           I found that I needed a starting y-coord greater than 0.00758 to avoid ID4 and ID5 collision.
           
           So I generated a smaller grid inside the permitted x range and the non-colliding y range, at y above the value that produces non-overlapping AABBs. I tested a 8x8 grid. With this I generated my 50 positions using the grid. I used the existing, already validated, points for the first 32 positions (all points at `theta=0`), and generated 18 additional points by putting an angle of `theta = pi/4` (45 degrees) to fill the grid.
