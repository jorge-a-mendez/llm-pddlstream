           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Thought Summary:**
           
           Okay, I need to find three suitable robot base positions around a given `target_point`. These positions must be within a distance of 2 from the target and located within the x and y ranges of [-2.5, 2.5]. Crucially, I have to avoid collisions with the provided fixed obstacles, which are represented as AABBs. My priority is avoiding collisions and generating diverse positions. I'll rely on the existing feedback to handle line-of-sight concerns for now.
           
           First, I define a collision check function. A point collides with an AABB if it falls within the rectangle's x and y boundaries. I also account for the environment boundaries by ensuring a point stays within x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5]. I realized the bounding walls are slightly outside the defined range, so I adjusted the bounds checking.
           
           For position generation, I'll generate points around the target within a 2-unit radius. I'll use various angles and distances (radii) to ensure the positions are diverse. I need to test those generated points to ensure they are collision-free. I considered a strategy using circles of different radii and multiple angles from the target to generate several candidates and then apply the collision test. I determined I needed to refine the collision test to account for the actual boundary conditions.
           
           I've been given a `target_point` and its coordinates. Let's assume it is `(0.9, -0.6)`. I need to find positions `(bx, by)` where the distance from the target to the base is less than or equal to 2.
           
           After analyzing the fixed obstacle definitions, and their relative placements in the environment, I generate potential candidates with different angles and radii. I need to be careful with the central vertical wall and the placement of the other small rectangular obstacles. I have computed various positions. I selected three collision-free candidate positions:
           1.  `(1.96, 0.46)`
           2.  `(-0.16, -1.66)`
           3.  `(0.9, -1.6)`
           
           I manually verified that these are less than 2 units away from the target and do not collide with any obstacle.
           
           These candidates are strategically chosen to ensure diversity and meet the specified criteria.

(Thoughts: **Refining My Approach for Target Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've been given some feedback on my previous attempts, and I need to adapt my strategy. I'm taking this new target: `(-1.8568, 2.0422)`. The key takeaway from the previous feedback is the central wall (`((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`). I messed up the last time by getting too close, so I need to maintain a wider berth. Line of sight is also a huge factor. The general goal is simple: find valid positions that are within a distance of 2 from the target and avoid the obstacles.
           
           From my analysis, I determined that, for a negative x-coordinate target, placing my base on the same side, to the left of the central wall, is the key to maintaining line of sight.
           
           Let's dive in. The target I'm working with is, again, `(-1.8568, 2.0422)`. My first observation is the location: it's in the top-left quadrant of the area, making me lean towards placements on the left.
           
           The challenge? The target is *inside* obstacle 20, which is `((-1.9026, 1.9963), (-1.8110, 2.0880))`. This completely changes the game. This means that my target will likely be evaluated as obstructed, no matter the position I choose. I've carefully reviewed this, and I'm aware that this might mean *all* my positions may get a 'no line of sight' error, but I need to give it my best shot. I must provide positions that would *theoretically* have line of sight if the target wasn't inside an obstacle. I cannot simply give up.
           
           So, given the constraints of a distance of 2, the fixed obstacles in the area, and my now-ingrained need to stay to the target's side of the central wall, I'm proposing the following positions:
           
           1.  **`(-2.35, 2.04)`:** Placed directly left of the target, this position is at a distance of 0.5 from the target. It's a bit to the left of the obstacle 8. I am hoping for a good line of sight.
           2.  **`(-2.2, 1.0)`:** This one is placed below the target, at a distance of 1.09 from the target, and should offer a clear view from obstacle 15 and 8.
           3.  **`(-1.0, 1.5)`:** This position is slightly to the right of the other positions, but is still on the left side of the wall. At a distance of 1.01 from the target, it's a good alternative to the other points.
           
           I understand the likely "no line of sight" issue, given that the target is inside an obstacle. I am doing my best to adapt to the constraints given and trying to find positions. The hope is that by keeping the robot base position clear from the other obstacles in the playing area, there is a better chance of success.

(Thoughts: **The Strategy for Navigating Obstacles**
           
           Okay, so I'm back at it, trying to figure out the best spots for these robot bases relative to the target: (-1.8568, 2.0422). I've got to consider my past failures—specifically, those pesky obstacles and walls.  The key here is avoiding collisions and staying within a range of 2 from the target while ensuring the robot stays within the bounds of  x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]. 
           
           The failures have given me insight. First off, I'm pretty sure I have to stay clear of the central wall.  Secondly, I'm now clear that the target is smack dab inside two obstacles:  20 and 8. That likely means line-of-sight is a pipe dream.  So, I need positions that meet these criteria: are collision-free (I've concluded R = 0.1), and within the target range. I also need to make sure I consider the left boundary wall (obstacle 4).
           
           Based on those failures, and to guarantee this isn't my fate, I've got a new game plan: 
           
           1.   **The Target's Location is Key:** Since the target is within obstacle 8 and 20, line of sight is out of the question, so focus on collision-free positions.
           2.   **X-Coordinate Restrictions:** I'll keep the robot base x-coordinate less than -0.1 to avoid the central wall.
           3.   **Avoidance of Boundary Wall:** The robot's x must be greater than -2.45.
           4.   **Obstacle 8 & 20 Exclusion:** Since I'm very familiar with these obstacles, they must be avoided. Their x-range is approximately from -2.25 to -1.75, so I either go to the left or right.
           
           **Possible Spots**
           
           Now, I'll propose three spot suggestions.
           
           1.  (-1.0, 2.0): I'll place a base *right* of the obstacles. This is in range and should avoid all walls and collisions.
           2.  (-1.8, 0.5): Position to be below the target and avoid collisions.
           3.  (-2.0, 0.8): A bit farther left and also below the target to avoid obstacles.
           
           I believe these three bases meet all the requirements.

(Thoughts: **My Current Analysis and Proposed Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new target point: approximately (0.42, 1.88).  This time, I need to generate *three* potential robot base positions.  Before I start, I need to remind myself of the lessons learned from previous failures, especially the ones involving the central wall and the problematic obstacles in the target's vicinity. The target is smack-dab inside an obstacle, which is going to make line-of-sight tricky, if not impossible. My job is to give you safe, collision-free base positions, so I'll focus on that.
           
           The key considerations here are:
           
           1.  **Central Wall:** The robot has to be on the *right* side of the central wall (x > 0.1) to have any chance. This one's non-negotiable.
           
           2.  **Obstacle 9 and 19:**  These are the biggest headaches. The target is inside obstacle 19, and close to obstacle 9.  I need to make sure the robot base *avoids* them completely.  With an assumed robot radius of 0.1, that means:
               *   `x < 0.15` OR `x > 0.85`
               *   `y < 1.65` OR `y > 2.35`
               To be safe, I'm going to lean towards avoiding the whole area altogether.
           
           3.  **Max Range:** The robot has to be within a distance of 2 from the target.
           
           With this in mind, I'm proposing these three base positions:
           
           1.  **(1.5, 1.88):**  This puts the robot far to the right of the target and obstacles 9/19.  This clears both obstacles. The distance to the target is 1.08, so within the range.
           
           2.  **(0.42, 1.0):**  This positions the robot *below* obstacles 9/19.  The distance to the target is 0.88, inside range and the robot avoids the critical region.
           
           3.  **(1.0, 1.5):**  A bit to the right and slightly below. This gets the robot in a different angle. The distance is 0.69, within range.
           
           I've carefully checked all these positions against the relevant constraints. They respect the max range, avoid the central wall, and steer clear of those pesky local obstacles.  These should be safe locations for the robot base. Let's see what the system thinks!

Model:     **My Current Analysis and Proposed Robot Base Positions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new target point: approximately (0.42, 1.88).  This time, I need to generate *three* potential robot base positions.  Before I start, I need to remind myself of the lessons learned from previous failures, especially the ones involving the central wall and the problematic obstacles in the target's vicinity. The target is smack-dab inside an obstacle, which is going to make line-of-sight tricky, if not impossible. My job is to give you safe, collision-free base positions, so I'll focus on that.
           
           The key considerations here are:
           
           1.  **Central Wall:** The robot has to be on the *right* side of the central wall (x > 0.1) to have any chance. This one's non-negotiable.
           
           2.  **Obstacle 9 and 19:**  These are the biggest headaches. The target is inside obstacle 19, and close to obstacle 9.  I need to make sure the robot base *avoids* them completely.  With an assumed robot radius of 0.1, that means:
               *   `x < 0.15` OR `x > 0.85`
               *   `y < 1.65` OR `y > 2.35`
               To be safe, I'm going to lean towards avoiding the whole area altogether.
           
           3.  **Max Range:** The robot has to be within a distance of 2 from the target.
