(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 4**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) with dimensions 0.0859 x 0.0859 on a surface (surface 0) defined by the AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).  The goal is to provide (surf_idx, theta, x, y) values for each placement.
           
           Because the object is square, I know that its half-extents (hx and hy) are equal to 0.0859 / 2 = 0.04295.  I need to consider how the object's rotation (theta) affects the required x and y center placement. For any rotation theta, the required center offsets are determined by the object's effective half-extents, effective_hx and effective_hy.
           
           The maximum effective half-extent occurs at theta = pi/4 (or multiples of pi/2) and is approximately 0.06074 (hx * sqrt(2)).  To ensure the object is *fully* within the surface bounds, the object's center must be within a safe region calculated using these effective half-extents.
           
           For theta = 0, the safe x range is [-0.09205, 0.09205] and y range is [-0.09205, 0.09205].  For theta = pi/4, this becomes [-0.07426, 0.07426] for both x and y.  To guarantee stability across all orientations, I'm defining a general safe region across theta values, which is the intersection of these valid regions, and which covers a maximum offset.
           
           I've decided to use a combination of rotations to provide a diverse set of placements. I'll use a grid of values.  Specifically, I'll generate 25 placements at theta = 0 with `x` and `y` coordinates spaced from -0.09 to 0.09.  I'll then generate another 25 placements at theta = pi/4 with `x` and `y` coordinates spaced from -0.07 to 0.07, ensuring these coordinates are strictly within the calculated bounds. This results in the complete set of placements required.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: ID 5 After ID 4**
           
           Alright, I've got the feedback about placing object ID 4 down, and it went well on surface 0. Now it's time to position object ID 5. Object 5 is also a square, with dimensions: `0.08422 x 0.08422`. I'll calculate the half-extents, `hx5` and `hy5` which will both be `0.04211`.
           
           Surface 0 is defined as a square region:  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I need to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for object ID 5 within that area, ensuring they don't overlap with the already placed object ID 4.
           
           First, I've to define the AABB of object ID 4, which is currently at `(-0.09, -0.09)`.  Object 4's half-extents are calculated as `0.042951`. Therefore, object 4 occupies approximately  `[-0.13295, -0.04705] x [-0.13295, -0.04705]` on the surface.
           
           I'll consider the same two orientations as before, `0` and `pi/4` (45 degrees).
           
           For `theta = 0`, the effective half-extents are the same, `0.04211`. The valid center range for `x` and `y` will be restricted by the surface boundaries:  `[-0.0928, 0.0928]`. Since the region of object 4 is approximately `[-0.133, -0.047] x [-0.133, -0.047]`,  I will calculate the collision by testing all points within the center range.
           
           Using a grid of 25 points, I'll calculate collision by evaluating overlapping AABBs.
           
           After filtering all calculations I determined that it is best to avoid overlapping with any region the first object exists in. This limits the choices.
           
           I'll generate a list of collision-free placement configurations.
           
           I repeated a similar process for `theta = pi/4`, using a smaller candidate center range: `[-0.075443, 0.075443]`.
           
           Then I checked the 25 configurations.
           
           I then realized I needed more ways to generate the 50 configurations, so I considered a rotation of `pi/2`.
           
           By using `21` non-colliding points I'm sure of the validity for this angle.
           
           I then chose 13 points to use for the next rotation of `pi/2`.
           
           The total: 21 + 16 + 13 = 50. All non-colliding placement configurations were tested.

(Thoughts: **My plan for placing Object 6 involves a meticulous strategy to ensure stability and avoid collisions.** I'm aiming for 50 secure placements on Surface 0, taking into account previously placed, and therefore restricted, objects: Object 4 and Object 5.
           
           **First, I've calculated the essential dimensions and extents.** Object 6 is a square with a known size, allowing me to derive its half-extents. Surface 0's dimensions are also clear, providing the physical boundaries within which I can work. I've also carefully computed the AABBs of both Object 4 and Object 5 and their respective center coordinates.
           
           **The heart of my method is an efficient grid-based approach combined with rotation.** I'll systematically generate potential placements on a fine grid within the bounds of Surface 0. For each candidate location and a series of predefined rotations, I'll calculate the object's AABB.
           
           **The collision detection is crucial.** I've set up a system to check for overlap between Object 6's AABB and those of Object 4 and Object 5. A collision is determined if there is any overlap in the x or y directions.
           
           **My reasoning is as follows:** First, with the dimensions of object 6 I had two options, either generate the placements manually or through a Python script. If I started the placements manually, they would take a lot of time. Therefore I decided to create them programmatically to speed up the process.
           To determine how many placements I could generate for any value of rotation, I first checked the limits of how far I can translate the object in each direction based on the maximum rotation that I will consider.
           The AABB checking method I came up with can be applied for any angle.
           For any two given points (cx1, cy1) and (cx2, cy2), the algorithm checks whether there is a collision between their corresponding AABBs.
           
           The first strategy would be to get 17 placements for the theta=0 and theta=pi/2 cases.
           Then I tried to increase the number of placements with small changes, however it didn't give good results.
           
           I took the decision of generating all stable placements for the theta=0 on a dense grid and then filtering them.
           In the end, I need a list that is generated by using a 19x19 grid.
           
           So, I'm going to generate a list of collision free `(cx, cy)` pairs. Next, I am going to select the first 25 pairs and add those pairs with theta=0. Then I am going to select the next 25 and set the theta=pi/2.
           
           Now, I'm confident that I have a reliable and robust process to identify 50 distinct, safe placements for Object 6, optimizing for both stability and collision avoidance.
