User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.424, -0.061), (-4.337, 0.027)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.381, -0.017, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.145, 0.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the thought process: I need to figure out a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Breaking it down, `new-axiom@0()` means `Atom on(?green, v18) and Atom type(?green, v17)`.  I need to figure out which object, represented by `?green`, to move. Looking at the starting facts, `v8` and `v12` are the only objects with the right `type`. Let's choose `v8`. Now the goal simplifies to `on(v8, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` which will tell us how the object is supported by a *pose*, *p*. So I need the predicate `supported(v8, ?p, v18)`. Looking at the initial state,  `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` seems like the right fit. This makes my goal `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9`.  My task is to *move* `v8` from pose `v9` to pose `#o2`. I know that the most basic action needed is the *pick* and *place* action. So, the overall strategy to achieve `atpose(v8, #o2)` is:
           1.  **Pick** up `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           2.  **Place**  `v8` at the target pose `#o2`.
           
           Now, let's analyze the available *actions* and preconditions:  The actions available are `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. `pick` and `place` are the relevant actions since the goal involves moving and placing an object.  The `move_base` action changes the base configuration and doesn't change `atpose`.
           
           For `pick` the precondtions look like `kin(?a, ?o, ?p, ?g, ?q, ?t)`,  `atpose(?o, ?p)`,  `handempty(?a)`, and `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(?o, ?p, ?g)` which ensures that the action is *executable*.
           
           So, to pick `v8`, I'll need `kin(arm, v8, v9, #o1, bconf, atraj)`.  The grasp, `#o1`, base conf, arm conf are *continuous* values I need to address.  `atpose(v8, v9)` and `handempty(arm)` already in the starting facts are true. The `atbconf` needs the robot base position. But `bconf` has no available base configuration to move to in the initial state so I will have to instantiate it as v3 since that is the only bconf in the initial state.
           
           Let's check the preconditions for `pick`: I can pick with `v4`, assuming `#o3` is `v3` and `#o4` exists for a plan. I will check for *collision* too. Since the statement also says that *facts not stated are false*,  so, `cfreeapproachpose(v8, v9, #o1, v12, v13)` must be false, so it is assumed it is safe to proceed and negate approach.
           
           Now, for *placement*, similar checks and considerations apply.  We need to look at if `unsafepose` exists.  Since there aren't *facts* in the initial state to ensure `cfree_pose_pose`  and `cfreeapproachpose` so, the plan to place the object should be executably.
           
           I need to come up with the `#o2` value for the plan to work. For `v8` to be on `v18`,  the AABB bounds will be used as the place target, and the z-value, in relation, will need to be at `z=0.8` to match the given height for other objects.
           
           Therefore, the plan:
           1. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2. `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           Costs and Continuous Values:
           The cost for pick and place are 1, so the total cost is 2, also the plan requires a `#o2` continuous pose value. Based on the position of the given AABB for each object, `#o2` will be (4.5, -0

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan's Limitations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a plan and it seems there's a fundamental issue. The user pointed out a discrepancy: my initial plan uses `pick` and `place` actions, but those actions are *not* included in the "valid action instances" list. That's a deal-breaker.
           
           Let's re-examine this. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to wanting `v8` to be on `v18` and for `v8` to be a certain type, which it already is. Effectively, my real goal is to get `v8` onto `v18`. That means achieving `on(v8, v18)`. Breaking that down, I need `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)`.  
           
           Looking at the initial state, `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true. Therefore, the core of the problem becomes making sure `v8` is in the position `#o2`, represented by `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           The problem is clear: I need to move `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) to `#o2`. This *demands* `pick` and `place` actions, right?  But the only valid action I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This means I can *only* move the base of the robot.  There's no way to actually manipulate `v8`!
           
           If the plan specifically disallows `pick` and `place` actions, the robot can't change the position of `v8`. It's a closed system.
           
           So, given the limitations, the goal of getting `v8` to `#o2` is **unachievable**. The robot is effectively unable to manipulate `v8` because it cannot execute the required `pick` and `place` actions. I need to remember the list of *valid* actions is the only set of actions I can use, and currently, it is impossible. This constraint is crucial. I'm stuck.
