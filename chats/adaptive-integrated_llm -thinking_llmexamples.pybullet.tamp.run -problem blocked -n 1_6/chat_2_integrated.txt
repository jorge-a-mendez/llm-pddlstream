User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.424, -0.061), (-4.337, 0.027)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.381, -0.017, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.145, 0.989).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Goal and Proposed Plan**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means getting an object of a certain type onto a specific surface, `v18`.  From what I'm seeing, there are two objects of that type, `v8` and `v12`.  `v18` is a table-like surface, and the initial state already supports the "on" condition for both objects (supported).
           
           My initial instinct was to try and put `v8` onto `v18` since it's already kind of close. However, upon deeper analysis, I realized that doing so might cause a collision with `v15` which is currently sitting on the same surface. The object `v8` and `v15` are close, there would be unsafeapproach predicate that would be violated, so that would not be the best approach.
           
           So, I'm pivoting.  `v12` seems like the better target.  It's on a different surface, and, most importantly, there are no other objects nearby, thus its approach poses are likely safe.
           
           The plan I've landed on is quite straightforward: **pick `v12` from its current pose, and then place it onto `v18`**. This should satisfy the `on` predicate of the goal.
           Picking and placing need to make sure collision does not happen. And it seems that with my analysis, v12 does not have any potential collisions.
           
           **Refinement of the Plan**
           
           Now, I need to pinpoint the "how". I will pick up `v12` and then place it on the target surface, specifically `v18`. From my previous analysis, `v18`'s aabb is ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)). I'll need to compute a suitable target pose within those bounds for the object to be safely placed.
           
           I can't just pick any place on the surface; I have to check for collisions with other objects currently on the surface, which, as it seems, are not present. So, I need to calculate a collision free pose on `v18` and make that as my intermediate point.
           So I choose an object's collision free location as an intermediate point: (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) and I will specify the plan below.
           
           **Final Plan**
           
           Here's the finalized plan, keeping in mind the collision-free considerations:
           
           1.  **`pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4`**:  Pick `v12` from its initial pose.
           2.  **`place v4 v12 (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0) #o1 #o3 #o4`**: Place `v12` on `v18` at pose (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0).  This new pose ensures no overlaps with existing objects.
           
           I've checked the constraints, and this plan should successfully achieve the desired state, fulfilling the goal of `new-axiom@0()`.

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Refined Plan for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so the previous plan failed because the `atbconf(#o3)` condition wasn't satisfied when the `pick` action was executed. I need to address that directly. Currently, `atbconf(v3)` is true, but the `pick` and `place` actions both *require* `atbconf(#o3)`. My solution is to insert a `move_base` action.
           
           I have a few `move_base` actions available, but the one that makes the most sense is `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This should move the base from its current position, `v3`, to the target, `#o3`, satisfying the required condition.
           
           Therefore, the revised plan looks like this:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`: This action sets the `atbconf(#o3)` condition and removes the previous `atbconf(v3)`.
           2.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`: Now that the base is in the right location, this `pick` action's precondition is satisfied.
           3.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`: The `place` action should also work as the `atbconf(#o3)` condition remains true due to the `move_base` action.
           
           Now, I need to make sure the continuous values for the `#o2` parameter are also correct. The goal is to place `v12` on `v18`. From the AABB of `v18`, I can determine its center point, which is approximately (4.5, -0.3). I'll also assume that the Z height of the object remains consistent with its previous pose, let's say 0.8. Thus, I need to set `#o2` to `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           I've also double-checked the initial state and all the necessary facts related to `#o3`, `basemotion`, `bconf`, and the kinematic relationships. Everything seems consistent, and with these adjustments, I am confident that this new plan should be valid and lead to the successful placement of the object.
