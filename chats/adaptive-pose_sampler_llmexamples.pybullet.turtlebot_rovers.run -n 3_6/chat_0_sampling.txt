User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene has a large central obstacle and several smaller obstacles around the perimeter. The outer bounds are at x and y from -2.5 to 2.5. Obstacles 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 form a large cross-like structure or a "frame" around the center, with obstacle 0 being the central square region from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). However, given the other obstacles (1, 2, 3, 4) define a frame, this implies obstacle 0 is the entire permissible area for the robot. Obstacle 5 is a vertical bar at x=0. There are also smaller square obstacles (7, 8, 9, 10) in the upper half of the environment. Several very small obstacles (11-21) are scattered.
           
           The target point is (1.2000000000000002 0.7000000000000001). I need to find three base positions within a max distance of 2 from this point. I should avoid the known obstacles.
           
           The target is in the first quadrant.
           Obstacles in the first quadrant include:
           7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - a square in the upper right
           11: ((0.77, 0.60), (0.88, 0.72)) - a very small obstacle near the target.
           12: ((1.52, -0.33), (1.66, -0.19)) - in the fourth quadrant, not relevant for now.
           15: ((2.10, 0.18), (2.24, 0.33)) - in the first quadrant, lower right.
           17: ((2.08, 0.38), (2.21, 0.51)) - in the first quadrant, lower right, close to 15.
           20: ((1.75, 2.04), (1.84, 2.13)) - in the first quadrant, upper right, close to 7.
           
           The target (1.2, 0.7) is close to obstacle 11. Specifically, (1.2, 0.7) is slightly to the right and above obstacle 11. I should avoid positions that are directly between obstacle 11 and the target.
           
           I will try positions in various directions from the target, ensuring they are within the max_range of 2.
           
           1.  **Directly right of the target:** (1.2 + 1.5, 0.7) = (2.7, 0.7). This is outside x-bounds. So, (1.2 + 0.5, 0.7) = (1.7, 0.7). This avoids obstacle 11.
           2.  **Below the target:** (1.2, 0.7 - 1.5) = (1.2, -0.8). This avoids obstacle 11. This also seems clear of other obstacles.
           3.  **Above the target:** (1.2, 0.7 + 1.5) = (1.2, 2.2). This is close to obstacles 7, 9, 10. I'll try (1.2, 0.7 + 1.0) = (1.2, 1.7). This is close to 7, 9, 10. Let's try (1.2, 0.7 + 0.5) = (1.2, 1.2). This avoids 11.
           4.  **Left of the target:** (1.2 - 1.5, 0.7) = (-0.3, 0.7). This seems clear.
           
           Let's try:
           (1.7, 0.7) - to the right, far from obstacle 11.
           (1.2, -0.8) - below, seems clear.
           (0.2, 0.7) - to the left, far from obstacle 11 and not too close to the x=0 obstacle. This is within range (distance from (1.2, 0.7) is 1.0).
           
           Positions:
           (1.7 0.7)
           (1.2 -0.8)
           (0.2 0.7)
           

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

           The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The previous target point was different from the current one. The feedback indicates that the previous target point was at (-2.08, 1.98), and my proposed positions (1.7, 0.7), (1.2, -0.8), and (0.2, 0.7) failed.
           Specifically:
           - (1.7, 0.7) and (1.2, -0.8) had no line of sight to (-2.08, 1.98). This is expected as they are quite far from the target and likely obscured by the central obstacle (0) or the vertical obstacle (5) at x=0.
           - (0.2, 0.7) collided with obstacle 5, which is at x=0. This confirms that positions with x very close to 0 are problematic due to obstacle 5.
           
           Now, the target point is (1.2000000000000002 0.7000000000000001). This is the *same* target point as in the first request, which means the previous failures are irrelevant to this specific target's geometry/LOS. However, I can still use the lesson that the previous positions (1.7, 0.7), (1.2, -0.8), and (0.2, 0.7) were not validated as successful for *any* target by the system and thus it's better to try new ones or refine based on current target.
           The collision with obstacle 5 at x=0 for (0.2, 0.7) is a general piece of knowledge that I should keep in mind for any target.
           
           For the target (1.2, 0.7):
           Obstacle 11: ((0.77, 0.60), (0.88, 0.72)) is very close to the target. I should avoid placing the robot directly between obstacle 11 and the target.
           
           Let's re-evaluate based on the target (1.2, 0.7) and the general knowledge of obstacles.
           1.  **To the right of the target:**
               A position like (1.7, 0.7) is still a good candidate, as it is 0.5 units away from the target, within the 2-unit range. It is to the right of obstacle 11, so line of sight should be good there. It is also not close to x=0.
           2.  **Below and to the right of the target:**
               A position like (1.7, 0.2) is within range (sqrt((1.7-1.2)^2 + (0.2-0.7)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25+0.25) = sqrt(0.5) approx 0.7), and is below the target and clear of obstacle 11. It is also clear of obstacles 15 and 17 as they are further to the right.
           3.  **Above and to the right of the target:**
               A position like (1.7, 1.2) is within range (sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.5) approx 0.7). This is to the right and above obstacle 11 and not too close to the upper obstacles 7, 9, 10.
           
           Let's try these three:
           (1.7, 0.7)
           (1.7, 0.2)
           (1.7, 1.2)
           
           All these positions are at x=1.7, which is far from the x=0 obstacle. They are also within 0.75 distance from the target, well within the max_range of 2.
           
           Positions:
           (1.7 0.7)
           (1.7 0.2)
           (1.7 1.2)
