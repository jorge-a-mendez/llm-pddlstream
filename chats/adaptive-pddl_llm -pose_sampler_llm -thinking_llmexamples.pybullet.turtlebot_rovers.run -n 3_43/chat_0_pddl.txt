           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal is Unachievable**
           
           As an expert in planning within the rovers domain, I immediately recognized the structure of the `new-axiom@0()` goal: a conjunction of several conditions, with the core challenge centered around achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. My analysis systematically broke down the goal into its components, carefully examining the initial state for each condition.
           
           The early conditions – involving rover locations and storage – were readily satisfied in the initial state. However, the crux of the problem lies in the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These necessitate the execution of `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively. Furthermore, achieving `receivedanalysis` demands the application of `sample_rock`.
           
           My analysis followed the necessary action preconditions for `send_image`, which is `haveimage`, and its subsequent action, `take_image`, and then how `sample_rock` actions affect analysis.
           
           However, the provided constraint—that only actions explicitly listed are valid—created a critical impasse. The list of valid actions only included `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither `send_image`, `send_analysis`, `take_image`, `sample_rock`, nor `calibrate` are included in the action list. The ability to calibrate and take pictures is missing, and the only permitted action to deal with a rock is `drop_rock`.
           
           Given that no available actions can achieve the predicates needed to meet the goal, and no available actions can allow any information to be acquired (including picture taking and rock sampling), the logical conclusion is that the goal is unattainable under the given constraints.
           
           I would have used the `v14` rover, assuming continuous variables could be equated to `conf` locations if `move` actions were absent.  This would reduce the work needed to formulate a plan.
