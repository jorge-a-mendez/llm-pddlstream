           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unachievable with Available Actions**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, specifically to ensure that there's an object, let's call it `?green`, which is both of `type(?green, v17)` and `on(?green, v18)`.  Given the initial state, I identified that `v8` and `v12` could potentially be `?green` because they are both of the required type.
           
           My strategy involves looking at how to make an "on" statement true. To have `on(?green, v18)` true, I need to have the object, `?green`, supported by and at a specific pose. Since `v18` is the target object, I need to find a way to place either `v8` or `v12` upon `v18`.
           
           Analyzing the current state reveals that `v8` is on `v11`, and `v12` is on `v14`. To get either of them onto `v18`, I would need to perform `pick` and `place` actions. However, the available actions are severely limited.  The only permitted action instance is a `move_base` action, which simply moves the base configuration, but does not affect the positions of the objects in the world.
           
           Therefore, because I can't reposition any objects using the allowed actions, and since the target pose for my object is not present in the current pose, I cannot modify the world state to satisfy the `on(?green, v18)` requirement.  Consequently, the goal is unachievable given the restriction to only a single `move_base` action.
