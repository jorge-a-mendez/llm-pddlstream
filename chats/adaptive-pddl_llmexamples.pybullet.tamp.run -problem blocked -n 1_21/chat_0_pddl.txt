           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and several objects: `v8`, `v12`, and `v15`. All three objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable and stackable. `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are currently at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v16` respectively. `v8` is on `v11`, `v12` is on `v14`, and `v15` is on `v11`. `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. The robot is at base configuration `v3` and both arms `v4` and `v6` are at their respective arm configurations `v5` and `v7`. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom derived from `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. In this specific problem, `?green` is `v8`. Therefore, the goal is to have `v8` on `v18`.
           
           Currently, `v8` is on `v11` (derived from `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)`). To achieve the goal, `v8` needs to be moved from `v11` to `v18`. This involves picking up `v8` and then placing it on `v18`. However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of `v8` and does not help to achieve the goal of placing `v8` on `v18`. There are no pick or place actions available in the given list of action instances. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed actions.
