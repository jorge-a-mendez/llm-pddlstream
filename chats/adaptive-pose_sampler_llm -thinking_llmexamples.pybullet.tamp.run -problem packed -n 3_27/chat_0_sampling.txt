(Thoughts: **Finding 50 Stable Placements**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a square object (side 0.0956) on a square surface (0.27 x 0.27).  To ensure stability, the object must be fully contained within the surface's boundaries, regardless of its rotation.  The key is to determine the maximum effective bounding box of the object at any rotation.
           
           For a square, the effective half-extent calculation simplifies.  The most critical point occurs at a 45-degree angle.  I calculated the maximum effective half-extent to be `s / sqrt(2)`, where `s` is the side length.  This leads to a maximum value of approximately `0.0676`.
           
           To create stable placements, I considered two orientations: aligned with the axes (0 degrees) and rotated by 45 degrees (`pi/4`).  For each orientation, I defined a safe range for the center's x and y coordinates, ensuring the object wouldn't extend beyond the surface. I then created 25 evenly spaced (5x5 grid) placements for each orientation, totaling 50 stable positions.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed Object 5, and now I need to figure out where to put Object 6 on the surface without any overlap.  Here's the plan I'm going to follow:
           
           1.  **Understand the Setup:** I have the placement data for Object 5 (surface 0, centered around (-0.08, -0.08) with a specific size and AABB range). I know Object 6 is essentially a square, and I have its dimensions.
           
           2.  **Surface Limits:**  I need to stay within the surface's boundaries, which I've calculated to be within (-0.135, 0.135) for both x and y.
           
           3.  **No Collisions (The Hard Part):** Object 5 is in the lower-left corner of this space.  I need to ensure no part of Object 6's AABB collides with Object 5's AABB.  I've calculated the collision threshold based on half-extents.
           
           4.  **Placement Strategy:** I'm going to create a 10x10 grid of possible center points for Object 6 on the surface. These points will be roughly evenly spaced.
               *   I'll make sure each point is within the surface bounds.
               *   I'll then rigorously check whether that placement causes Object 6's AABB to overlap with Object 5's AABB.
               *   I'll generate the list of placements for theta = 0, and ensure all placements avoid Object 5's current position.
               *   I'll make an optimized list of 50 non-colliding (valid) locations.
           
               To calculate the grid, I'm going to make sure to avoid the collision region.
           
           5.  **Output:** After the loop, I'll have a list of 50 valid placements for Object 6.

(Thoughts: **Surface Packing Strategy for Object ID 4 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to get 50 stable placements for Object ID 4 (a square, roughly 0.095 x 0.095) on Surface 0, which is a 0.27 x 0.27 square.  The trick is, I've got to avoid the existing objects (Obstacle ID 5 and ID 6) already placed on the surface.
           
           First, I need to account for rotations. I'll consider two:  zero degrees and 45 degrees. The math tells me that since the object is square, the effective bounding box changes depending on the rotation.
           
           Hereâ€™s the breakdown.
           
           1.  **Obstacle Detection:** I've carefully calculated the AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) for both Object 5 and Object 6. Think of them as rectangular "keep-out zones." Object 5 is a square centered roughly at (-0.08, -0.08) with a bounding box of approximately \[(-0.1278, -0.1278), (-0.0322, -0.0322)]. Object 6 is roughly at (-0.096, 0.006) and the bounding box is around \[(-0.135, -0.0317), (-0.058, 0.0444)].
           
           2.  **Valid Placement Region:** I've figured out the maximum and minimum X and Y coordinates that Object 4 can be placed within and stay inside Surface 0, taking into account its bounding box *and* its rotation.
           
           3.  **Collision Avoidance:**  For each rotation, I'll generate a grid of potential placement positions within the valid region. At each grid point, I check if Object 4's bounding box would overlap with either Object 5's or Object 6's. If it does, that position is discarded. I am building the grid and testing all possible positions now.
           
           4.  **Rotation and Grid Resolution:** I will generate 2 grids - One for zero rotation, and a second for pi/4 rotation. The grid will contain 15x15 = 225 positions each.
           
           5.  **Output:** The script will output an array of `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)` tuples.  The process will terminate when 50 valid placements are generated and written to `placements`.
           
           The goal here is a quick but robust packing routine that works well given the constraints.
