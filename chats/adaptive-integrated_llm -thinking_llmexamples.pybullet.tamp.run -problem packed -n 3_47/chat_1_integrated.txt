User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           #o3: object
           #o4: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.202, 0.315), (0.276, 0.389)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.083, 0.236), (0.013, 0.332)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.239, 0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.03).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.204, 0.327), (-0.115, 0.416)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.035, 0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.498, 0.867).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.16, 0.372, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.164).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Decomposition for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to get three objects, `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`, all *on* `v16`.  The initial state shows them stacked on `v11`. My goal is to use the robot arm, `v4`, to pick them up and place them on `v16`. Since all the `kin` facts involve `v4`, that's the arm I'll be using.
           
           The key is this: I need to calculate where to place each object on `v16`. The PDDL uses `#o2` as a placeholder for a pose. Because I have multiple objects on a small surface, I can't use the same continuous value for all three. So, although the plan uses `#o2`, I need *three* distinct continuous values representing *each object's* target pose. I need to make sure I pick a stable arrangement that fits on the target surface (`v16`).
           
           The robot's base can't move, only from `v3` to `v3`. The `kin` facts indicate valid grasps and trajectories.  Based on the surface's AABB (which is small), my strategy is to arrange the three objects in a row along the x-axis, centered on the y-axis, all at the same height to ensure stability on surface `v16`.
           
           My plan is:
           
           1.  Move the base, which will be a no-op from `v3` to `v3`.
           2.  Pick `v8` from its current pose `v9`.
           3.  Place `v8` onto `v16` at a calculated pose, which I'll call `#o2_v8`.
           4.  Pick `v12` from its current pose `v13`.
           5.  Place `v12` onto `v16` at a calculated pose, `#o2_v12`.
           6.  Pick `v14` from its current pose `v15`.
           7.  Place `v14` onto `v16` at a calculated pose, `#o2_v14`.
           
           The calculated poses, `#o2` (values will follow the pattern) are:
           *   For v8,  (-0.098, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For v12, (-0.0165, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)
           *   For v14, (0.076, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Evaluating the Feasibility of the User's Plan**
           
           Okay, I've received a plan from the user, and my task is to evaluate its validity given the constrained set of allowed actions. Immediately, I see the problem. The permitted actions are limited to just `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  My previous analysis, which likely included `pick` and `place` operations, is clearly now invalid. This restricted action set presents a significant challenge.
           
           The goal they've set is to achieve `Conjunction (Atom on(v8, v16)) (Atom on(v12, v16)) (Atom on(v14, v16))`. In simpler terms, to have objects v8, v12, and v14 all stacked on top of object v16. I can see from the initial state provided that these objects are currently supported by v11, which gives us `on(v8, v11)`, `on(v12, v11)`, `on(v14, v11)`.  To move them to v16, I'd naturally think about using `pick` and `place` actions, the standard approach.
           
           However, the only allowed action is movement. The `move_base` action doesn't modify the `on(?o, ?r)` predicates.  It's simply a relocation maneuver. Given this constraint, it becomes readily apparent: there's no way to reach the desired goal state using only movement. I must, therefore, conclude that the goal is not achievable under these specific action restrictions.
