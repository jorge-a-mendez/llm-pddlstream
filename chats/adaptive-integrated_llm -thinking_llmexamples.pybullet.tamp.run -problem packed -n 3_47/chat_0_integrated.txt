User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v3: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.083, 0.236), (0.013, 0.332)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.16, 0.372, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.986, -0.164).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.239, 0.352, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, -0.03).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.202, 0.315), (0.276, 0.389)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.204, 0.327), (-0.115, 0.416)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.035, 0.284, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.498, 0.867).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom stackable(v14, v10)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so the task is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Simple enough, right? I just need to move them from their current locations on `v11`.  My initial thought was to use a pick-and-place strategy, you know, classic robot stuff.  I'd grab each object with an arm (either `v4` or `v6`),  place it on a new pose on `v16`, and voila! Problem solved.  I'd have to find the correct poses, `p_new`, for each object to satisfy `supported(object, p_new, v16)`. No problem, usually I'd just let the planner handle the finer details like kin, grasps, trajectories, and such, assuming I have the domain predicates.
           
           But then, I hit a snag. A big one.  The problem statement, in no uncertain terms, dictates that I can *only* use the action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's it. Nothing else.  No `pick`, no `place`, no nothing. Just a base motion that does absolutely nothing, a no-op, unless I want to move the base (which I don't).
           
           This is a problem.  A *big* problem.  My expert knowledge tells me that the only way to modify `atpose` (where an object *is*), which is key to achieving the goal, is through `pick` and `place` actions.  I need to change an object's location, so I need to `pick` it from its current pose and `place` it onto the target.
           
           The instructions specifically state I can't deviate from the given action instances, and I must adhere strictly. While often in planning, a list of *primitive actions* would be provided and the planner synthesizes complex actions through composition, here it is explicit that *only* the given actions can be used.  This has led me to a dead end.
           
           I've re-read the problem statement multiple times, looking for a hidden clause, a subtle hint, *anything* that might allow me to break free from this constraint. I can't synthesize any other actions, nor is there any other action I can use. I could try and interpret `#o0` as something other than a no-op, but the action simply moves the base. This is a very clear constraint.
           
           Therefore, given the constraint to only utilize the available action instance `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, I must conclude that the goal is *unreachable*.  The required actions for moving the objects (pick and place) are not permitted. It's a fundamental issue. The robot, as it stands, is physically incapable of achieving the desired outcome.
