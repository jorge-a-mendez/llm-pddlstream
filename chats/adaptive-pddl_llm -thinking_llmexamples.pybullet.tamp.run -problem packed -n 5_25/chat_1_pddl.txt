           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Generation Analysis and Conclusion**
           
           My objective is to construct a plan that achieves the goal state of having objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` all `on` object `v20`. The `on` predicate is defined by `supported` and `atpose` predicates. Analyzing the initial state, these goal objects are currently `on v11`.  To achieve the goal, I need to manipulate these objects to be positioned on `v20`.
           
           My initial thought is that a sequence of "pick" and "place" actions will be necessary, which is a standard approach to this kind of planning problem. The available actions are "move_base", "pick", "place", "clean", and "cook".  However, given that only `on` predicates are involved in the goal, I can disregard "clean" and "cook." The available "move_base" action instance, `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does not result in movement, so this doesn't seem to be a crucial action.
           
           Examining the problem state, I identified that each target object (`v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18`) is supported by `v11` in the initial state and can be supported by `v20` when they are at pose `#o2`. I have identified all objects have an associated 'grasp' action (`#o1`) and a robot arm, `v4`, that is `handempty`. There are `kin` facts relating the arm, initial poses, and target poses for each object to its place location (`#o2`). This solidifies my understanding that I will need a "pick" and "place" for each of the target objects.
           
           Given the existing situation, the action of "pick" and "place" would be a valid solution for me to construct, allowing each of the target objects to be manipulated as intended.  For example, to move `v12`, the plan would have: `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, v3, #o4)` followed by `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           Upon careful review of the instructions, I see that I have a provided list of valid "action instances". Furthermore, I see this critical constraint: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The list includes only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies that I am strictly constrained to using this action, which does nothing.
           
           Despite the fact that a sequence of "pick" and "place" is the optimal way to meet the end condition, I cannot create such actions. Therefore, this goal is unreachable.
