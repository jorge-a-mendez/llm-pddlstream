           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.16, -0.44, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.881, -0.473).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.062, -0.38), (0.156, -0.286)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, 0.25), (-0.216, 0.321)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.109, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.849, 0.529).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.208, -0.489), (-0.111, -0.392)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` at `v9`, `v12` is on `v11` at `v13`, and `v14` is on `v11` at `v15`. All objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are graspable. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both are handempty. The robot is at base configuration `v3`. `v16` is a stackable surface. There is a continuous parameter `#o2` which is a pose for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16` or `v10`. Since the goal is to place them on `v16`, we need to find suitable collision-free poses on `v16`. Since the only action available is `move_base`, and it doesn't change any `on` predicates, the goal is unreachable with the given actions. However, I must provide a plan. It is likely that the problem expects me to infer some pick and place actions, but since they are not explicitly listed in the available action instances, I cannot use them directly. Assuming this is a bug in the problem description, and I am implicitly allowed to use `pick` and `place` actions that achieve the goal, I'll attempt to construct a plan using those.
           
           The `kin` predicates specify that `v4` can interact with `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` to pick them from their current poses (`v9`, `v13`, `v15` respectively on `v11`) and place them at `#o2` on `v16`.
           
           The plan would involve:
           1. Picking `v8` from `v9` on `v11`.
           2. Placing `v8` at a new pose (`#o2`) on `v16`.
           3. Picking `v12` from `v13` on `v11`.
           4. Placing `v12` at a new pose (`#o2'`) on `v16`.
           5. Picking `v14` from `v15` on `v11`.
           6. Placing `v14` at a new pose (`#o2''`) on `v16`.
           
           Since the problem requires that if an object starting with '#' is used, a continuous value must be provided for it, I'll provide three distinct poses for `#o2` on `v16` for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14`. I will assume that the objects are relatively small compared to the surface `v16`, which has AABB ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). I'll try to place them centrally within `v16`, offset from each other.
           
           For this problem, the only explicitly allowed action is `move_base`. If I am to follow that strictly, no plan can be produced. However, given the context of a TAMP problem and the predicates provided, it seems very likely that `pick` and `place` actions are expected to be used, and the list of available actions is incomplete or implies that `pick` and `place` actions could be generated.
           
           Given the phrasing "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan.", I cannot use `pick` and `place` actions. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the provided actions.
           
           Since the prompt also says "Never assume that any precondition is true by default: it must either be explicitly stated in the initial state, or be achieved by a previous action (and not undone by another action).", and "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan.", I must strictly adhere to the provided list of allowed action instances.
           
           The only provided action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action does not change the `on` predicate, which is the goal. Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
