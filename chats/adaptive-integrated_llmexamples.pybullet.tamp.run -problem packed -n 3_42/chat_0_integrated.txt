           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.252, 0.285, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.715, 0.7).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.287, 0.25), (-0.216, 0.321)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.16, -0.44, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.881, -0.473).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.109, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.849, 0.529).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.062, -0.38), (0.156, -0.286)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.208, -0.489), (-0.111, -0.392)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires placing objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` onto `v16`. Currently, `v8` is on `v11` at `v9`, `v12` is on `v11` at `v13`, and `v14` is on `v11` at `v15`. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, which are at configurations `v5` and `v7`, respectively. The robot base is at `v3`. The only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`, which means the robot base is not going to move, which means the robot arms need to reach all objects from its current location.
           
           All three objects need to be placed on `v16`. The initial state also provides the fact `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`. This means we can use `#o2` as a pose to place all three objects on `v16`. Since there's only one continuous pose `#o2` specified for `v16`, we need to place each object at a different location on `v16`. We will pick them up from their current locations, `v9`, `v13`, and `v15`, and place them on `v16` at newly computed poses.
           
           Since there are no pick and place actions available in the action instances, this means that the problem is unsolvable because the robot cannot pick up objects to place them on the target surface. The only available action is `move_base`, which does not change the state of `on(?o, ?r)`. Therefore, the goal cannot be achieved.
