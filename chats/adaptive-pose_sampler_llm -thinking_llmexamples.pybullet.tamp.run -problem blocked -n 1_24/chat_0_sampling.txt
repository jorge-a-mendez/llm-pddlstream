(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's my plan for placing object ID 5, with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07, stably on surface 0. My goal is to generate 50 unique placements.  Given that surface 0 is defined by the bounding box `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, I need to determine the valid placement region. Since the object is square-ish, I'll use `theta = 0` for all placements.
           
           First, I calculate the object's half-extents: `hx = hy = 0.035`.  Then, I determine the valid x and y ranges for the object's center to ensure it's fully contained within the surface's bounds.  This translates to `4.235 <= x <= 4.765` and `-0.565 <= y <= -0.035`.  This gives me a valid rectangular area.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I'll create a grid within this valid region.  I'll use a `8x7` grid (56 placements total). This will give me a good even distribution.  I calculate the spacing between placements in both x and y to construct the grid.  I need to make sure `dx` and `dy` are not too small.  This will give me `dx = 0.53 / 7` and `dy = 0.53 / 6`.
           
           I'll iterate through the grid, calculating the x and y coordinates for each placement:
           
           *   X values will be from `x_min_valid + i * dx` for i from 0 to 7.
           *   Y values will be from `y_min_valid + j * dy` for j from 0 to 6.
           
           From here, I'll generate the placement coordinates. The angle is always `0`. The surface index will always be `0`. I have everything I need to output the 50 placements.  I will round the output coordinates to 10 decimal places to maintain precision.  Since this is the first placement attempt, I won't use previous collision data.  I'm confident this grid approach will provide a good set of stable placements.

(Thoughts: **My Approach to Placing the New Object**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of how I'm going to handle this: I've got a new object (ID 10) that needs to be placed on a surface (ID 0). The surface is defined by the range `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.  The object's dimensions are almost square (about 0.098 x 0.098 units).  I also have to avoid a collision with a previously placed object (ID 5) that's located at (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565).
           
           First, I calculated the valid center range for object 10 on the surface, which is roughly `x in [4.25, 4.75]` and `y in [-0.55, -0.05]`.  Since the object is almost square, I'm starting with a rotation of 0 degrees (`theta = 0`).
           
           Next, I need to make sure the object doesn't collide with object 5, which occupies a bounding box of roughly `[4.2, 4.27]` in X and `[-0.6, -0.53]` in Y.
           
           To ensure no collisions, I needed to check that the bounding boxes of the two objects did not overlap.
           
           Here's how I'm avoiding collisions:
           
           *   **Collision Detection:** I determined that a collision occurs if `cx` (the x-coordinate of the object's center) is in the range of `[4.249036189649609, 4.319036189649609)` *and* `cy` (the y-coordinate of the object's center) is in `[-0.5509638103503906, -0.4809638103503906)`.
           *   **Safe Placement:** Thus, for a non-colliding placement, the object's x-coordinate, `cx`, *must* be greater than or equal to approximately 4.319, and/or the y-coordinate, `cy`, *must* be greater than or equal to approximately -0.48.
           
           I'm generating 50 non-colliding placements by creating a grid across a rectangular region. The x-range of the rectangular region starts slightly to the right of the collision area, which is `4.319036189649609`, and goes to `4.750963810350391`.  For the y-range I can use the entire surface range.
           
           So, I'm creating a grid of 50 points within a region that meets all the criteria: it's on the surface and guaranteed to be collision-free with the pre-placed object.
