           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of this planning problem. My primary objective is to reach the state described by `new-axiom@0()`. This translates to establishing `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  Immediately, I recognize a key dependency:  `?green` needs to be an object with the correct `type`. I see from the initial state that objects `v8` and `v12` both have `type(., v17)`.
           
           My initial thought is to try `?green = v8`. This means I need to make `on(v8, v18)` true. From the axiom definitions, 'on' relies on 'supported' and 'atpose'. I see in the initial state that `v8` is *currently* supported by something, but it is *not* on v18.
           
           Here's the problem: To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need to ensure `atpose(v8, #o2)` since I also see `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. *However*, the actions I'm allowed to use is just `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action *doesn't* touch object poses; it's just about the robot's base. The other way to affect the position is to use actions like `pick` and `place`, but those aren't available to me. I need to pick up `v8`, change it's position, and place it down to make the goal true.
           
           Because I can't move the objects, I won't be able to satisfy the `on` predicate using `v8` as the object. So, I will need to consider `v12` as a possible assignment to `?green`. I go through the exact same logic, checking what needs to be made true and realize the same problem: I need to reposition the object `v12`, but I cannot.
           
           Therefore, since the only action I can use does not affect the positions of the objects and the goal relies on positioning an object on `v18`, I must conclude that `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* within the constraints of this planning problem. The available action set is insufficient to manipulate object poses, a fundamental requirement for the goal's satisfaction.
