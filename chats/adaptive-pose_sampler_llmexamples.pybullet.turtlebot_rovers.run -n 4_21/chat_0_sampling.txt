User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is enclosed by walls at x = -2.5, x = 2.5, y = -2.5, and y = 2.5. There's a vertical obstacle (obstacle 5) at x=0, spanning the entire y-range. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered around the scene, including a large one at (-2.4, -2.35) to (-1.4, -1.65). I'll try to find positions that are not too close to the obstacles, and spread out in different directions from the target point.

Model:     The previous positions all failed because they were likely on the wrong side of the obstacle at x=0 (obstacle 5), or other obstacles blocked the line of sight to the target point (-1.94, 1.81). I need to find positions that are on the left side of obstacle 5 and also avoid the large obstacle 6 at (-2.4, -2.35) to (-1.4, -1.65), and other smaller obstacles in the top-left quadrant.

Model:     The previous attempts for the target point (0.38, 2.14) failed. It seems that being on the left side of the x=0 obstacle is still problematic, or perhaps there are other obstacles blocking the view. The target is in the top-right quadrant, near y=2.14. Obstacles 9, 10, 11, 21, and 22 are in that general area. I should try to place the robot in the top-right quadrant, avoiding obstacles in that region.

Model:     The previous attempts for the target point (2.05, 1.95) failed. It seems my chosen positions were either too far (not reachable for robot base) or blocked (no line of sight). The target point is in the top-right corner, very close to the wall and near obstacle 7 ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and obstacle 19 ((2.006, 1.904), (2.104, 2.002)). I need to find positions that are within max_range 2 from the target and also avoid collisions with the walls and these obstacles. I will try positions that are closer to the target point and slightly spread out.
