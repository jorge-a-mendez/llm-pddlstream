(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for a Nearly Square Object**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a small, nearly square object (ID 5) on a flat surface (surface 0). The object has dimensions roughly `0.0817 x 0.0817`. Surface 0 is a square AABB defined by the points `(-0.135, -0.135)` and `(0.135, 0.135)`.  I need to find a combination of surface index, rotation angle (theta), and (x, y) coordinates for the object's center that ensures the object is entirely within the surface and stable (supported by the surface).
           
           Given that the object is almost square, when rotated, the effective AABB dimensions will change but stay similar (ranging from `~0.0408` to `~0.0578`).  I calculated the new half-extents (`hw`, `hh`) of the object's rotated AABB to be:  `hw = 0.5 * (obj_width * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_height * abs(sin(theta)))` and `hh = 0.5 * (obj_width * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_height * abs(cos(theta)))`. This means the allowed placement area, based on these ranges, will be smaller the larger the bounding box dimensions from rotation are. For instance when theta = 0, the AABB extents are minimum, and a wider range for placement. However, at theta= pi/4, the bounding box extents are maximum and the available placements are confined to a smaller region.
           
           Given that the original surface 0 is centered at (0, 0), with half-extents 0.135, the allowable range for the center (x, y) will be:  `min_x + hw <= x <= max_x - hw` and `min_y + hh <= y <= max_y - hh`. The final code iterates through 10 evenly spaced angles from 0 to 9*pi/10 (exclusively), to allow for rotation and placements across surface. For each of the angles I calculated the new bounded placements, the x and y center coordinates, such that there is more uniform distribution of the object on the surface. These values are:

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement of Object ID: 4 to Avoid Collision with Object ID: 5**
           
           Okay, so I've successfully placed object `ID: 5` at the origin on surface 0, and now it's time to figure out where to place a new, nearly square object `ID: 4` on the same surface. The tricky part? I *have* to make sure these two objects don't bump into each other. Here's my thought process:
           
           First, I know the size of `ID: 4` and the surface dimensions.  I also know `ID: 5` is centered at the origin, and its dimensions are also given. I'm going to leverage the fact that `ID: 5` is already in a stable position and its position relative to the origin.
           
           I've got the necessary information: `ID: 4`'s width, height and also know the surface dimensions. So let's start by mapping out the surface, taking into account the dimensions of `ID: 4` and its various rotations.  I will be generating a total of 10 different rotations (angles) ranging from 0 to 9*pi/10.
           
           To tackle the collision problem, my plan is to create a set of candidate placement positions for `ID: 4` across the surface, and for each candidate position, check whether the position causes a collision or not.  So, I will iterate through all 10 angles, and for each angle, I will generate 25 positions.
           
           Here's how I will do it:
           
           *   **Rotation:** I'm going to generate positions for `ID: 4` for 10 different rotations (theta).
           
           *   **Bounding Boxes:**  First, the dimensions of the bounding boxes are calculated.  Next, I'll calculate the safe zone of each rotation, using the dimensions of each object.
           
           *   **Point Generation:** I will create 5x5 different `x` and `y` locations, totaling to 25 positions.
           
           *   **Collision Check:** I will check for each of these 25 positions if any collision happens or not.
           
           I will repeat this process for all 10 theta values. The aim is to generate 50 valid placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID: 6)**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for a new square object (ID: 6) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with two previously placed objects (ID: 5 and ID: 4). Surface 0 is a square area defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. ID: 6's dimensions are approximately 8.4cm x 8.4cm.
           
           The core strategy is:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** First, I've calculated the minimum and maximum boundaries for the new object (ID 6) for different angles within the surface area. I'm taking the previous object positions into account. I know object (ID:5)'s position is around (0,0), and object (ID:4)'s is at about (-0.092, -0.092).
           
           2.  **Calculate Effective Side:** I need to account for rotation. I’m computing the effective “half-side” of the square (ID: 6) object for various rotation angles. For a given angle, I compute `hw` and `hh`. I know because the object is square, this will always be equal. `hw` and `hh` will impact the size of the box I must calculate to make sure placement is valid.
           
           3.  **Surface Containment:** I use `hw` and `hh` to ensure the object's center point falls within the boundaries of surface 0. Using the formula `[-0.135 + effective_half_side <= x <= 0.135 - effective_half_side]` and the equivalent for `y`.
           
           4.  **Collision Avoidance:** The key is to avoid collisions. I need to know where the AABBs overlap. The AABB of ID: 6 must not intersect with the AABBs of ID: 5 and ID: 4. I will check for intersections using a standard collision detection function.
           
           5.  **Placement Strategy:**
               *   I will iterate through ten different angles, ranging from 0 to 9π/10 radians, to get variety in rotation.
               *   For each angle, I will calculate the `hw` and `hh`.
               *   I will compute the valid range for the center (x, y) coordinates.
               *   I will generate candidate x and y values within the determined ranges, creating a grid of possible placement locations. I need to be more mindful of these "centers", as I know I'm very close to a corner of the current objects.
               *   I will then test each (x, y) combination against the known object AABBs for collisions and, if no collisions exist, I will accept them as a valid placement.
               *   I will continue testing until I find 50 valid, collision-free placements.
           
           To optimize the search, I've implemented a collision check function that efficiently tests for AABB overlap. I will be careful to identify the valid zones of object placement and avoid sampling that leads to frequent collisions.
