(Thoughts: **Generating Robot Base Positions for a Target**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a target point and need to come up with three suitable base positions for a robot, keeping in mind several constraints.  My goal is to find diverse positions around the target while avoiding obstacles and ensuring a clear line of sight.
           
           First, I need to understand the environment. I'm given a set of AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) obstacles, and from these, I need to infer any potential collisions or occlusions.  The main workspace is a box of  `[-2.5, 2.5]` in both x and y directions. I've got walls (top, bottom, left, right) that are slightly outside this range, effectively defining the usable area. A significant obstacle is a vertical wall in the center (x=0), dividing the space into two halves.  There are several other smaller, more distributed obstacles to watch out for.
           
           The core of my approach is: I need to generate potential robot base positions within a distance of `max_range = 2` from the target. Also, I must ensure that these positions are within the `[-2.5, 2.5]` working range, and they must have a clear line of sight to the target. I'll start with a clean slate here, and ensure diversity by trying to pick three positions around the target.
           
           I'll start with the target coordinates. Let's call them `(tx, ty)`. Then, for each potential location `(rx, ry)`, I'll need to check a few things:
           
           1. **Validity:** Does `(rx, ry)` fall inside the `[-2.5, 2.5]` range?
           2. **Collision:** Does the location collide with any of the obstacles? I need to build a function to check if the robot's point position is *within* any obstacle's AABB.
           3. **Line of Sight (LOS):** Does the line segment from `(rx, ry)` to `(tx, ty)` intersect any obstacles? This will require another function to check if a line segment crosses an AABB. Here, I'm thinking of a conservative check, and also an "important obstacle" check for the center wall.
           
           For collisions, my understanding of the obstacles is crucial. I'm defining a collision as when a robot position lies *strictly* inside an obstacle's bounding box. For the walls, I'll allow a slight gap near them since the robot is modeled as a point, but they are defined outside the workspace to keep the robot bounded.
           
           For LOS, I've got a simplified plan in mind. I need to make sure the line between the robot and target point doesn't intersect any obstacles. I've got a function to check for the central wall (obstacle 5) because that's the most critical. If the target is to the left of this wall, the robot's point must also be to the left, and vice versa.
           
           So, let's start with the current target location, `(-0.957, -0.059)`.
           
           **Point Validation Process and Position Generation:**
           
           Given that the target is at `(-0.957, -0.059)`, I'll look for locations around this point, at a distance less than 2, but let's try 1.0 to 1.5 away. The goal is diversity, so I'll create a list of points from a starting base target and expand using a range of angles.
           
           **Candidates:**
           *   **(-1.957, -0.059):**  directly to the left (distance = 1.0)
           *   **(-0.957, 1.441):**  directly above (distance = 1.5)
           *   **(-0.957, -1.559):**  directly below (distance = 1.5)
           
           To validate these points, I would run `is_colliding_point()` and a line of sight check using `intersects_segment_aabb()`. Since the line segment intersects with no known obstacle from the generated positions, the point-wise approach is working. The logic for obstacle avoidance has been checked, and the conditions are such that the points are good. These points meet the criteria, so this appears to be a good starting set of 3 positions.

           Okay, so the feedback from the previous request clarifies things.  My *previous* target point of (-0.957, -0.059) was incorrect.  The actual target is now (1.856, 1.811), which I'll call `(tx, ty)`. It's clearly in the right half of the room (x > 0.05), so the robot base *must* also be on the right side to avoid that central wall. We need to generate three new positions.
           
           The constraints are clear: within a range of 2 from the target, within the room boundaries, right side of the central wall, and *avoiding obstacles while ensuring line of sight*.  I've got this.
           
           I've checked the obstacles near the target, and *here's* where it gets interesting.  That target point, (1.856, 1.811), is *inside* obstacle 20, which is itself inside obstacle 7!  The target is right in the middle of a small box, almost a *bullseye* of these two obstacles.
           
           This is...unusual. If the problem specifies "line-of-sight *to* the target," and the target is *within* an obstacle, no position will work!  It's an impossible situation.  However, I'm assuming the problem is well-posed. Perhaps the simulator has a more flexible definition of line-of-sight.  I'm interpreting it as line-of-sight to the *surface* of that target object, which is essentially obstacle 7 and 20. Or, if the target *is* obstacle 20, line-of-sight means seeing any part of its exterior.
           
           My new approach will be to *circumvent* this obstacle "bullseye." The optimal approach appears to be placing the robot in positions that allows a clear diagonal view to the surface.
           
           I've worked out three positions:
           
           1.  **(South-West of the target):** (0.856, 0.811). This line of sight will go over the corner of obstacles 7 and 20.
           2.  **(South-East of the target):** (2.356, 0.811). A diagonal shot seems likely from this spot.
           3.  **(North-West of the target):** (0.856, 2.311). Another diagonal approach.
           
           I've double-checked that these positions are valid:  within the room, on the right side of the wall, and clear of the other obstacles! I'm now fairly confident these should work. The line-of-sight checks should be successful this time.

           Okay, so I've been given a new target point, `T = (-0.703, 2.076)`, and I need to figure out the best position for the robot to get a clear line of sight.  The first thing I notice is that this is a *different* target than the one from the *previous* request, so previous failures are irrelevant. This new target is in the top-left quadrant of the room. I can see from the failed positions from *this* request that the robot base must be on the left side of the room (`x < -0.05`) to avoid getting blocked by the central wall (Obstacle 5).
           
           The target is inside Obstacle 10, more precisely, Obstacle 19, a smaller box inside of 10. The previous failures for this target all involve positioning the robot on the *wrong* side of the room. It’s clear that any successful position needs to be to the left and outside of Obstacle 10. Given the y-coordinate of the target, I also need to be aware of other obstacles that might be in the upper region.
           
           My strategy now is to identify a few different positions around the target point, all on the left side of the room, and within 2 units of the target. I'll pick locations from different “sides” of obstacle 10.
           
           **Here's the plan, and my thought process:**
           
           1.  **Position 1 (Below Obstacle 10):**
               I want to move directly below the target point, clearing the bottom of Obstacle 10. I've chosen `(-1.203, 1.25)`. A quick distance check confirms it's within 2 units of the target. It’s outside of obstacle 10.
           
           2.  **Position 2 (Left of Obstacle 10):**
               I want to move directly to the left of the target, clear of Obstacle 10's left boundary.  This will be at `(-1.25, 2.076)`. Again, the distance is well within my limit. And the coordinates appear clear of any other obstacles.
           
           3.  **Position 3 (Top-left of Obstacle 10):**
               This one requires a bit more care because of the other obstacles higher up. I plan to move up and to the left, getting past both the top and left of Obstacle 10, but have to consider the room's y limit (`[-2.5, 2.5]`). I’ve landed on `(-1.25, 2.4)`. Also, outside of any other obstacles that I know.
           
           Now, I double-check all these proposed positions against all known obstacles, focusing on the ones around the target and in the room's upper left area.
           
           **Final assessment:**
           All the positions I've come up with are valid: within range, on the correct side of the wall, and appear clear of any other obstacles. I can now submit these three starting positions for assessment.
