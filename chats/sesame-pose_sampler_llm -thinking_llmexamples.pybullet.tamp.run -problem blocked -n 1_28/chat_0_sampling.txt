(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the User's Placement Request**
           
           I've been tasked with finding 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, which is defined as a rectangle between (4.2, -0.6) and (4.8, 0.0). The object is a small square (0.07 x 0.07). A placement is considered stable if the object's entire bounding box remains within the surface's boundaries.
           
           To generate these 50 placements, I've used the following strategy. First, I determined the object's effective bounding box dimensions, which change with its rotation (theta). Because the object is a square, the effective box dimensions depend on the absolute value of cos(theta) and sin(theta), repeating every pi/2 radians.
           
           I've chosen ten different angles (thetas) across the full range of 0 to 2*pi, ensuring a variety of orientations. For each of these angles, I then calculated the allowable x and y ranges for the object's center. Using these ranges, and centering the Y-axis value, I evenly distributed the x-axis center points, leading to five different x positions for each angle and a single Y value. That produces 50 total placements across all angles. Each of these placements is stable because they fall within the bounds of the surface.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 10**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 10) on a given surface (surf\_idx 0).  The surface's bounding box is `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`. The new object has dimensions of approximately `0.089 x 0.089`, which I'll treat as a square with side length `s = 0.088960933158422`.
           
           Based on prior experience with similar placements (object ID 5), I learned that boundary errors frequently occurred. A previous placement failed because the calculated object's AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) extended beyond the surface's AABB.  To prevent this, I need to accurately calculate the object's effective size and adjust the allowed placement area.
           
           The core idea is this: When a square is rotated, its AABB expands. The extent of the rotated AABB is determined by the formula  `effective_side = s * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`, where `theta` is the rotation angle.  To ensure the object remains within the surface, I need to shrink the usable placement area by half of the `effective_side` in all directions. I'll calculate `half_effective_side = effective_side / 2`.
           
           For each rotation angle, I will determine the permissible range for the object's center `(x, y)`:
           -   `min_x_center = surf_lower_x + half_effective_side`
           -   `max_x_center = surf_upper_x - half_effective_side`
           -   `min_y_center = surf_lower_y + half_effective_side`
           -   `max_y_center = surf_upper_y - half_effective_side`
           
           If these ranges are not valid, meaning that `min_x_center` is greater or equal to `max_x_center` or the same holds for the y-coordinates, I will skip the rotation. For valid ranges, I will calculate `y_center` as the midpoint:
           - `y_center = (min_y_center + max_y_center) / 2`.
           To calculate x-coordinates, I will generate a range of values between `min_x_center` and `max_x_center` equally spaced. If `min_x_center` is equal to `max_x_center`, then I use just one x coordinate, otherwise I generate 5 such points, based on `(max_x_center - min_x_center) / (num_x_positions - 1)`.
           
           To achieve the 50 placements, I will sample 10 angles between 0 and 2*pi, and for each rotation angle, I will generate 5 evenly spaced `x` coordinate positions.
           
           Finally, I have re-validated the calculation against the previous boundary failures to ensure correct placements. I have also re-verified the implementation in code, to ensure accurate calculations. The resulting 50 placements are expected to be valid.
