           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a vertical wall in the middle (box 5). Many smaller obstacles are scattered throughout the room, some forming patterns (like 7, 8, 9, 10, which are in a line). I will try to find positions for the robot base by considering a circle of radius 2 around the target point and selecting points that avoid the known obstacles. I will also try to keep a diversity of positions, trying different "sides" of the target point.

Model:     The previous target was (-0.593 1.894).
           - (0.43, 0.0) failed due to no line of sight. This implies obstacles between (0.43, 0.0) and (-0.593, 1.894). Given obstacle 5 is at x=0, this is plausible.
           - (0.0, 1.96) collided with obstacle 5 (the wall at x=0). This makes sense as x=0 is exactly on the wall.
           - (0.43, 2.4) collided with obstacle 1 (top wall) and obstacle 9 (0.25 to 0.75 x, 1.75 to 2.25 y). The target is at y=1.894, so a y of 2.4 is very close to the top wall. And an x of 0.43 is within obstacle 9.
           
           My strategy will be to avoid x=0, avoid y positions very close to 2.5, and avoid the areas of obstacles 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20, 21 as they are in the upper part of the room. I will try to stay on the same side of the x=0 wall as the target. The target is (-0.593, 1.894), so I'll prioritize negative x values.

Model:     The previous target was (-0.593 1.894).
           - (0.43, 0.0) failed due to no line of sight. This implies obstacles between (0.43, 0.0) and (-0.593, 1.894). Obstacle 5 (x=0 wall) likely blocks the view.
           - (0.0, 1.96) collided with obstacle 5 (the wall at x=0).
           - (0.43, 2.4) collided with obstacle 1 (top wall) and obstacle 9 ((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
           - (-0.593, -0.106) collided with obstacle 17 ((-0.44, -0.01), (-0.34, 0.08)). The proposed y was too close to 0.
           - (-2.0, 1.894) collided with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)) and obstacle 21 ((-2.18, 2.05), (-2.09, 2.14)). The proposed x was in the middle of these obstacles.
           
           My strategy needs to be more careful. The target (-0.593, 1.894) is in the upper-left quadrant.
           I need to avoid:
           - x=0 wall (obstacle 5).
           - Top wall (obstacle 1)
           - Obstacles around the target like 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 20, 21.
           - Obstacle 17 around y=0.
           - General no-line-of-sight from positive X side due to wall 5.
           
           So, I will focus on the negative x side, but avoid the dense obstacles in the top-left corner. I will try to place the robot further down, below the cluster of obstacles 6, 8, 14, 21. Also, I will ensure x values are not too extreme (close to -2.5) to avoid colliding with boundary 4.

Model:     The current target point is (1.924, 1.954).
           Let's analyze the previous failures. The previous target was (-0.593, 1.894), and some proposed positions for that target were also evaluated against the *new* target (1.924, 1.954). This implies that a previous position which was no-LOS for (-0.593, 1.894) might also be no-LOS for (1.924, 1.954) if the occluder is in between them.
           
           For the target (1.924, 1.954):
           - (-1.5, -1.0) failed with no line of sight. This is expected as the x=0 wall (obstacle 5) is between this position and the target.
           - (-1.0, 0.5) collided with obstacle 12 ((-1.07, 0.52), (-0.93, 0.66)). This position was right on an obstacle.
           - (-0.5, 0.5) failed with no line of sight. Again, the x=0 wall is likely the cause.
           
           The current target (1.924, 1.954) is in the upper-right quadrant. This means I should focus on the positive x side of the room to avoid obstacle 5 (the x=0 wall). I also need to be careful of obstacles in the upper-right:
           - Obstacle 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) - This is a large obstacle right around the target.
           - Obstacle 11: ((1.40, 1.91), (1.53, 2.04)) - Also near the target.
           - Obstacle 13: ((1.84, 0.32), (1.98, 0.46))
           - Obstacle 16: ((2.00, 0.57), (2.14, 0.71))
           - Obstacle 20: ((1.88, 1.91), (1.96, 1.99)) - This one is *inside* obstacle 7 and very close to the target.
           
           Given the target (1.924, 1.954), it is very close to obstacle 7 (which has corners at (1.75, 1.75) and (2.25, 2.25)), and even obstacle 20 is inside obstacle 7. I need to be careful not to collide with obstacle 7.
           I will try to place the robot around the target, avoiding obstacle 7. I will try positions:
           1. Directly below the target, within range, avoiding obstacle 7.
           2. To the right of the target, within range, avoiding obstacle 7.
           3. To the left of the target, within range, but carefully, as obstacle 11 is there.
           
           Target point: (1.924 1.954)
           Positions:
           (1.924 0.5)
           (2.4 1.954)
           (1.0 1.954)
