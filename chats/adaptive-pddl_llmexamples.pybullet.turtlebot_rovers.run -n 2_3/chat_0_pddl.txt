           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, v12 and v14, both at different initial configurations. They both have a camera (v10) onboard, which supports mode v11. There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18). The rovers also have a store (v16) for samples, and both stores are currently free. The lander is v9. The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied if both rovers are at their initial configurations, their stores are free, images of both objectives v17 and v18 are received in mode v11, and rocks of type v2 and v6 are analyzed and received.
           
           From the provided initial state, we know:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: both rovers are at their initial configurations.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: both rovers' stores are free.
           - `objective(v17)` and `objective(v18)`.
           - `mode(v11)`.
           - `rock(v1), rock(v3), rock(v4), rock(v5), rock(v7), rock(v8)`.
           - `type(v1, v2), type(v3, v2), type(v4, v2)`.
           - `type(v5, v6), type(v7, v6), type(v8, v6)`.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to ensure the following conditions are met:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`: These are already true.
           2. `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`: These are already true.
           3. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This requires taking images of v17 and v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and sending them to the lander v9.
           4. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means we need to analyze at least one rock of type v2 (e.g., v1, v3, or v4) and send its analysis.
           5. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means we need to analyze at least one rock of type v6 (e.g., v5, v7, or v8) and send its analysis.
           
           The given list of allowed action instances only includes `move` and `drop_rock` actions, and these actions don't contribute to the goal of receiving images or analyses, or are unnecessary as the initial state already satisfies parts of the goal. Specifically, `move` actions will change the `atconf` state, which would make the `new-axiom@0` condition of `atconf(v12, v13)` or `atconf(v14, v15)` false. `drop_rock` actions are for when the store is full, but the stores are already free. The crucial actions like `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`, and `calibrate` are not listed as valid action instances. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of allowed actions.
           
           The goal is not achievable with the provided list of allowed action instances.
