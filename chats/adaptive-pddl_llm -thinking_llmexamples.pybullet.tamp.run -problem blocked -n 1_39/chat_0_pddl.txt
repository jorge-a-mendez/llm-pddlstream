           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Analysis for `Atom new-axiom@0()` in the `pr2-tamp` Domain**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` both *on* `v18` and of *type* `v17`.  The "type" condition immediately narrows down the possibilities to objects `v8` or `v12`, both of which are of the correct type.
           
           To satisfy the "on" condition,  I need to find an object, and I can have either `v8` or `v12` as that object,  which is both *supported* by `v18` *and* currently *at the pose* of `v18`.  Looking at the facts, both `v8` and `v12` are supported by `v18` *at* the continuous parameter pose `#o2`.  However, they are *currently* at different poses: `v8` is at `v9` and `v12` is at `v13`.
           
           The only way to modify an object's pose is through `pick` and `place` actions.  Those actions need facts about kinematic relationships, represented by the `kin` predicate.  Unfortunately, there are *no* `kin` facts provided in the initial state.  Therefore, I can't determine how to configure the robot's arm to interact with either `v8` or `v12`.
           
           With the `kin` facts missing, both `pick` and `place` are impossible.  The only action available, a base movement `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, does nothing useful – the base is already at `v3`, so it effectively does nothing.  This means I can't move either object to the desired pose `#o2`.  The goal is unachievable given the initial state and the lack of kinematic information. I need to know how to interact with `v8` or `v12`, but there's no information to do that.
