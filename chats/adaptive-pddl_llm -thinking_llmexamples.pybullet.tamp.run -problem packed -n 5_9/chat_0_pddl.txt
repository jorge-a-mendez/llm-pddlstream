           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v20)
               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. My objective is straightforward: get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` *on* `v20`.  `on` is defined by `supported` and `atpose`, as expected.  A quick check of the initial state reveals the problem: all the target objects are currently *on* `v11`, not `v20`.  So, the plan is simple: I need to pick them up from `v11` and place them on `v20`.
           
           The wrinkle, as always, lies in the *actions*. I have `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`, but the crucial constraint is: I can *only* use the actions provided in the `available action instances` list. And the kicker? The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move_base action does nothing useful!
           
           To achieve the goal, I *need* `pick` and `place` actions to manipulate the objects and change their positions.  But they're not available.  The absence of these key actions effectively renders the problem unsolvable.  It's a classic case of an incomplete action set for the required state change. This is a very clear and fundamental constraint problem. I will not generate a plan since it is provably impossible to find a plan for a goal.
