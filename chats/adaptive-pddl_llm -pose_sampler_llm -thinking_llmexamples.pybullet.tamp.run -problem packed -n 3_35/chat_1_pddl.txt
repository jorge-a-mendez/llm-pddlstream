           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Goal and My Approach**
           
           My objective is to achieve the goal of placing objects v8, v12, and v14 onto surface v16 (`on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, `on(v14, v16)`). Given my expertise, I quickly recognize that this involves manipulating the objects to be supported by and at a pose on v16.
           
           **Breaking Down the Situation**
           
           I've examined the initial state and identified key elements: the arms (v4 and v6), the graspable objects (v8, v12, v14), the surfaces (v11, v10, v16), and the robot's base configuration. Crucially, I see that v8, v12, and v14 are currently supported by v11, but I know where they need to be. There are facts about the pose of all three objects at `#o2` supported by `v16`. I also have grasp facts for each object using grasp `#o1`, and the appropriate kinematic facts (`kin`) to move them. The robot's base is static at `v3`.
           
           **The Strategic Plan**
           
           Given the preconditions, the plan I've devised centers around a sequence of pick-and-place actions using arm v4. Each object will be picked from its current position on v11 and placed at pose `#o2` on surface v16.
           
           **Detailed Execution**
           
           1.  **V8:** I will instruct arm v4 to pick up v8 from its initial position (v9) using grasp `#o1` and the predefined kinematics (`#o3`, `#o4`).  Then I will move the object to pose `#o2` on surface v16.
           2.  **V12:** Using the same logic, I will instruct arm v4 to pick up v12, then move it to pose `#o2` on surface v16.
           3.  **V14:** Again, I'll direct v4 to pick up v14, then place it on v16 at `#o2`.
           
           **Base Configuration and Assumptions**
           
           I analyzed the available actions, especially `move_base`. Given the preconditions and `atbconf(v3)`, it appears that the robot's base configuration won't need to change for this sequence. I will assume the `NegatedAtom` preconditions (unsafe pose/approach/trajectory) are satisfied to plan the actions.
           
           **Final Thoughts**
           
           With the execution of these pick-and-place steps, I am confident that I can achieve the desired final state. Each placement will satisfy the goal conditions, and the sequence ensures that the robot moves the objects to the target location.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Unachievable Goal with Given Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been presented with a challenge. The previous plan had some invalid actions, leaving me with only `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  That's a problem, because it's clear the goal involves manipulating object poses, something this action can't accomplish.
           
           Let's break this down. The goal is to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` all *on* `v16`.  My axioms tell me that to be "on" something, an object needs to be supported at a certain pose.  I'm given that `#o2` is a valid supporting pose on `v16` for all three objects.
           
           However, currently `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` are at poses `v9`, `v13`, and `v15` respectively.  The only action I have available, `move_base`, is essentially a no-op in terms of object poses.  It *cannot* change the `atpose` facts.  It just moves the base.
           
           Given that I need to change these object poses to achieve the goal, and that the only action available doesn't touch object poses, I'm stuck.  I'd need `pick` and `place` actions at a minimum to make this work, but they weren't in the list of valid action instances.
           
           So, bottom line: the goal is unachievable with the provided action set. I need to be able to pick up, move, and place objects to satisfy the goal.
