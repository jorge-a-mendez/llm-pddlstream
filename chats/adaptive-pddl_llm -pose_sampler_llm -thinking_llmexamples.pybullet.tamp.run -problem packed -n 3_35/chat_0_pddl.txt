           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.** My goal is to come up with 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 4) of size 0.08675972099168916 x 0.08675972099168916 on a square surface (surface 0) defined by the coordinates (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  A placement is characterized by the surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x,y coordinates of the object's center. For stability, the object has to be fully contained within the surface, and right now, there can't be collisions as no other objects are placed.
           
           Since the object is a square, the problem simplifies. To find a placement, I must account for the bounding box of the rotated square.  The amount of space I need to subtract from each side of the surface depends on the rotation angle.  A key insight is using `(obj_w/2) * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to calculate the effective half-width of the object, which is needed to calculate the bounds for the x,y coordinates of the object's center.
           
           To get the 50 placements, I'll systematically vary the rotation angle and then carefully choose the x,y coordinates. I'll test 5 angles: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2.  I'll compute the allowed range for x and y for each of the 5 theta values.  For each range, I'll then use a 5x2 grid of points to select the coordinates for the center of the object.
           
           I've calculated the x,y coordinates by using the specific theta values to make up the coordinates for the object's center.  The format is (surf_idx, theta, x, y) where the values correspond.  This strategy will guarantee a wide variety of placements that are all stable within the surface bounds.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 (Avoiding ID 4)**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've got the successful placement of object ID 4 locked in, and now I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, ensuring they don't collide with object 4. I've calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for object 4, which is currently situated in the bottom-left corner of the surface.
           
           To guarantee no collisions, I'll generate placements for object 5, focusing on different regions on the surface. These regions include the top-left, top-right, bottom-right quadrants, and the central area. The central part will be especially scrutinized so that no collision with object 4 will occur.
           
           I will iterate through the common 5 rotation angles to ensure diversity in placement: 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2.
           
           For each rotation, I will calculate object 5's effective half-extents. Then I will determine the region safe from collision by taking into account object 4's coordinates.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I will choose 5 `x` values from the range `[-0.088369888, 0.088369888]` and 2 `y` values from the range `[-0.001610167, 0.088369888]`.
           The same approach will be used for different angles with proper parameters.
           
           So, I'll generate 5 different orientations with several x and y coordinates each to make up a total of 50 different positions. These positions will not include the areas that can lead to collision with the object 4. This way, I'll be certain that the generated object 5 positions will be both on the board and collision-free.

(Thoughts: **Successful Placement Strategies for a New Object**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with generating 50 collision-free placements for a new square object (ID 6) within a defined surface. I've broken down the problem logically and created a systematic approach. The surface is rectangular and already has two objects placed on its bottom-left side.
           
           First, I identified the constraints: the new object must fit within the surface boundaries and avoid collisions with the existing objects (Objects 4 and 5). I meticulously calculated the bounding boxes (AABBs) for Objects 4 and 5, based on their placement coordinates, dimensions, and the crucial assumption that they are perfectly axis-aligned (theta = 0.0). These AABBs define the "occupied space" that the new object must avoid.
           
           Next, I determined valid placement regions.  I focused on placing the new object either to the right of, or above the existing block of objects.  I calculated the half-extent of the new object which depends on its rotation (theta). The effective half-extent (`eff_half_s_6`) needs to be calculated for each rotation.
           
           For collision avoidance, I considered two main scenarios:
           1.  **To the Right:** Place the new object entirely to the right of the combined AABB of Objects 4 and 5. This requires ensuring the minimum x-coordinate of the new object's center is sufficiently far right.
           2.  **Above:** Place the new object entirely above the combined AABB.
           
           I decided to prioritize placing to the right of the stack as it seems like a more reasonable space to be found. 
           
           I then calculated valid x and y placement coordinates, for 5 different rotations `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3pi/8`, `pi/2`. 
           For each rotation, I calculated the valid range for the center of the new object.
           
           I calculated 10 placements for the case where the rotation is 0 degrees and the new object can be placed adjacent to the right of the stack. After which, for each subsequent rotation angle, I performed the same calculations and generated the same set of placement points.
           
           This method ensures that the generated placements are both contained within the surface and collision-free with the existing objects.
