User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           #o4: object

           v10: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.412, -0.585), (-4.333, -0.507)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.372, -0.546, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.069, 0.998).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.227, -0.602), (4.429, 0.242)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the conjunction `Atom on(?green, v18), Atom type(?green, v17)`. The variable `?green` needs binding, and inspection of the initial state leads me to conclude that `?green` should be `v12`. Therefore, my initial goal simplifies to achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Expanding the `on` predicate, I find it decomposes into `Conjunction: Atom supported(?o, ?p, ?r), Atom atpose(?o, ?p)`. This means to have `on(v12, v18)`, I must ensure both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true for some pose `?p`.
           
           Reviewing the initial state, I note the presence of: `graspable(v12)`, `pose(v12, v13)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `supported(v12, v13, v14)`, `type(v12, v17)`, `stackable(v12, v18)`, `pose(v12, #o2)`, and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. Critically, `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is already present, meaning the necessary pose `?p` is `#o2`. Thus, the core of my plan focuses on achieving `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is located at `v13` (`atpose(v12, v13)`). To transfer it to `#o2`, I need a plan involving the actions of picking and placing. Specifically, I'll need to `pick` `v12` from `v13` and `place` it at `#o2`.
           
           Available actions associated with `v12` are identified: `((pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4))` and `((place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4))`.
           
           My plan, therefore, is:
           
           1.  **Pick:** `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
               *   Preconditions that must hold include: `kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (given), `atpose(v12, v13)` (given), `handempty(v4)` (given),  `atbconf(#o3)` (assumed to be a common initial condition, as I have no base movement actions), `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v12, v13, #o1)` (I'm assuming this is true, that there are no collisions unless explicitly stated otherwise), and `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)` (I'm assuming no collisions unless explicitly stated otherwise).
               *   Effects:  `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`, `canmove()` (reaffirms an existing fact), and `NegatedAtom atpose(v12, v13)` (moves the object from its original pose) `NegatedAtom handempty(v4)` (the arm is no longer empty, which is a key effect).
           2.  **Place:** `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`
               *   Preconditions that must hold include: `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (given), `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)` (achieved by the `pick` action), `atbconf(#o3)` (assumed true), `NegatedAtom unsafepose(v12, #o2)` (I'm assuming no collisions unless explicitly stated otherwise), `NegatedAtom unsafeapproach(v12, #o2, #o1)` (I'm assuming no collisions unless explicitly stated otherwise), and `NegatedAtom unsafeatraj(#o4)` (I'm assuming no collisions unless explicitly stated otherwise).
               *   Effects: `atpose(v12, #o2)` (This crucially achieves my goal!) `handempty(v4)`, and `canmove()`, `NegatedAtom atgrasp(v4, v1

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Precondition fact ('atbconf', #o3) is not satisfied!`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Problem Unsolvable Due to Missing Initial Condition**
           
           My initial analysis of the failed plan focused on the preconditions of the `pick` action. Specifically, I realized that `atbconf(#o3)` wasn't explicitly present in the initial state, even though the robot's base configuration, `#o3`, was defined.  I initially thought the `move_base` action could help, but it requires `atbconf(#o3)` as a *precondition* and *doesn't* produce it from nothing.
           
           This led me to re-examine the fundamental principle of the problem's interpretation: "Any fact not explicitly stated in the initial state is false." Applying this to `atbconf(#o3)` means the robot *is not* at base configuration `#o3` initially.
           
           Because both `pick` and `place` actions depend on `atbconf(?q)`, and in all our instances, `?q` is `#o3`,  these actions cannot be executed. The `move_base` action also has `atbconf(#o3)` as a precondition.  Therefore, no basic robotic action is possible.
           
           I thoroughly checked axioms and action definitions, but there's no way to establish `atbconf(#o3)` from the given initial state.  The robot is essentially immobilized.
           
           The goal `on(v12, v18)` requires moving `v12` to `#o2`. This movement demands `pick` and `place` actions, which, as I've established, are impossible.
           
           Double-checking the available actions, I can confirm that every `pick`, `place`, and `move_base` action instance relies on `atbconf(#o3)`. Since `atbconf(#o3)` is false initially and unachievable, the problem is unsolvable. I am certain that no plan can be constructed to achieve the goal given the constraints.
