           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`: A Detailed Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` condition, which boils down to placing an object of a specific type ("green") onto the surface `v18`. From my initial analysis, there are two potential candidates for this object: `v8` and `v12`.  The best plan depends on the robot's capabilities and current scene geometry, given the constraints of the planning system.
           
           The first step is to assess the geometry and then to determine the best plan. The `new-axiom@0()` can be represented as `on(?green, v18)`. With an initial analysis of available objects in the initial state, the system determined that both `v8` and `v12` were of the necessary `type` to be used to satisfy `?green`. The system is looking for an `object` that is on the `v18`.
           
           **My Strategy**
           
           My plan will focus on moving `v8` as it is closer to the target surface `v18` compared to `v12`. I know that to place an object `on` a surface, I need to find a suitable *pose* for the object. This comes from my knowledge of the `on` axiom: to achieve `on(object, surface)` I need to satisfy `supported(object, pose, surface)` and `atpose(object, pose)`.
           
           From the initial state, I can see that `v8` is initially at a pose represented by `#p0`. My plan involves picking `v8` from its current location, repositioning the robot's base, and then placing `v8` at the appropriate pose on the surface `v18`. I will also perform several collision checks as I move through the state space.
           
           **Plan Steps and Rationale**
           
           1.  **Move Base (move\_base v3 #q0 #t1):** I need to position the robot's base to allow for a grasp action.  The initial base configuration is `v3`. I will move to a new base configuration designated by `#q0`. This will allow me to execute a pick action in step 2. This is my base configuration transition that will satisfy the preconditions.
           
               *   **Preconditions:** I must verify several conditions, including that the robot can move (`canmove()`), the initial configuration is set, and ensure no collisions. The effect will include setting the new base configuration to be the current configuration for `v3` and will also set the state of the configuration for `#q0`.
           2.  **Pick (pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0):** I will execute the `pick` action to grasp `v8` from its current pose `v9`. This picks `v8` using the robot's `v4` and places the object `v8` in a `grasp`.  This will set the `atgrasp` condition to be true and the robot is no longer `handempty`.
           
               *   **Preconditions:** This will require conditions such as `kin`, to verify the correct action instance, `atbconf`, to make sure that we are in the configuration for grasping, `atpose`, for the pick pose, and collision checks. This action relies on the robot base configuration set in step 1.
           3.  **Move Base Again (move\_base #q0 #q1 #o0):** Following the picking operation, I will reposition the robot's base to a new configuration, `#q1`. This move will place the robot base to be ready to execute the `place` action.
           
               *   **Preconditions:**  I must verify that the robot can move, and the base configuration for movement is met.  Again, this will require collision checks.
           4.  **Place (place v4 v8 #p0 #g0 #q1 #t2):** The final action is to place `v8` onto the designated surface `v18` at pose `#p0` held in the grasp.  This satisfies the goal.
           
               *   **Preconditions:** The requirements are very similar to `pick`, but the `atgrasp` condition is critical. Additionally, I will need to verify that `bconf #q1` is the current base configuration, and I will need to account for collisions.
           
           **Critical Pose Calculation for `p0`**
           
           To determine an appropriate pose for `#p0`, I need to ensure that the object `v8` is fully supported by surface `v18`.  I have to determine the coordinates for placing the object on the target surface.  For my calculations, I use the known axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for `v8` and `v
