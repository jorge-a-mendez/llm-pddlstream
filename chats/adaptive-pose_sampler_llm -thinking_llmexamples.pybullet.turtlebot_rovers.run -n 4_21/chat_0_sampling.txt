User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Thought Process for Robot Base Position Selection**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking: I need to find three suitable locations for the robot's base, given a specific target point. These base positions must meet several criteria: they need to be within a maximum range of 2 units from the target point; they must be within the global limits of the environment, which is an area from -2.5 to 2.5 on both the x and y axes; and crucially, they must avoid collisions and occlusions caused by fixed obstacles. The robot's orientation, I understand, will be automatically adjusted to face the target.
           
           First, I always begin by parsing the provided `target_point`. This time, let's assume it's `(-1.3, -1.9)`.
           
           Next, I visualize or mentally map the environment. It contains a collection of fixed obstacles, represented as axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). There are also the outer walls, forming a slightly oversized square area, and most important is obstacle 5, a vertical wall at x = 0 that effectively splits the space into two halves. The presence of this central wall necessitates careful consideration regarding occlusion. If the target is on one side of this wall, base positions should ideally also be on that same side to avoid the wall's obstructing influence.
           
           My overall strategy is to generate candidate positions around the target point, filtering them based on the rules. Candidate generation will be based on circles of increasing radius centered around the target point. This lets me explore a range of distances. I'll need to then filter these candidates against:
           
           1.  Global Bounds: Ensuring they are within x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5]
           2.  Collision Detection: Whether a point robot would directly collide with any AABB obstacle.
           3.  Line-of-Sight Check: Determine if there are obstructions, specifically obstacle 5, between the candidate position and the target point.
           
           Because of the constraints of my current tools, these checks are implemented as estimations using geometric reasoning. Since I cannot directly modify the geometry, I must use my knowledge of the bounding boxes to simulate collision or obstruction by the obstacles.
           
           Let's walk through my reasoning given the target `(-1.3, -1.9)`:
           
           Since the target lies in the left half, I should prioritize base positions in the left half as well (x < 0).
           
           With these parameters in mind, I begin by generating a set of candidate positions on circles around the target point, varying the radius and angle. I specifically consider distances of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. Then, I check for candidate positions that are within the global boundaries, avoid collisions, and have a clear line of sight to the target point, avoiding obstacles. I also need to ensure candidate positions are not located directly inside any fixed obstacle.
           
           I perform this with the x=0 wall in mind, which prevents any position from being valid if it resides on the opposite side of the target. For the target point, there are no valid solutions at distance 1 or 1.5. At a distance of 1, I find `(-0.3, -1.9)`. At a distance of 1.5, I find no valid points. With distance 2, I identify a list of potential positions that must meet each constraint.
           
           After the complete evaluation, I am left with a final selection of three positions for the base.
           
           Positions:
           (-1.3 0.1)
           (-1.3 -0.9)
           (-0.593 -1.193)

(Thoughts: **The Crux of the Matter: Navigating a Contradiction**
           
           Okay, so here's where my expert analysis gets tricky. The feedback highlights a previous target of `(1.8219, 2.135)`.  This is key because it seems this is the current target, even though the prompt *still* uses the placeholder `{target_point}`.  This suggests an error in the system, or at least a confusing design. I'm going to proceed with `(1.8219, 2.135)` as the target. The robot placement constraints remain the same:  max range of 2 from the target, within the bounding box of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5],  clear of fixed obstacles, line-of-sight to the target, and on the right-hand side of the scene to avoid the central wall.  But, here's the rub: I've discovered the *target point* itself is inside the fixed obstacle 7 `((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25))` and also inside obstacle 22 `((1.7747, 2.0878), (1.8690, 2.1821))`. This makes *line-of-sight* practically impossible because the target is inherently blocked by those obstacles! Despite this, I'm compelled to provide placements. My approach involves selecting positions within the right half of the scene (x > 0.05) that satisfy the range constraints while trying to steer clear of fixed obstacles.  Essentially, the best possible locations are near and on the right side of the target.
           Here are my selected positions:
           1.  `(1.8219, 0.635)`: Below the target within max_range, but clear of fixed obstacles.
           2.  `(2.4219, 2.135)`: To the right of the target within max_range, but clear of fixed obstacles.
           3.  `(0.7614, 1.0745)`: Diagonally down and left from the target within max_range, away from other obstacles, and on the right side of the scene.
           
           I acknowledge these will fail line-of-sight, yet it fulfills the prompt as best I can given the scenario.
