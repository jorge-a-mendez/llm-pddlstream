User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object

           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-0.242, -0.121, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.495, 0.869).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.106, -0.387), (-0.01, -0.292)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.138, -0.38), (0.232, -0.286)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.295, -0.568), (-0.208, -0.481)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.29, -0.169), (-0.194, -0.073)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.058, -0.34, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.967, 0.256).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.185, -0.333, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.974, -0.227).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.251, -0.525, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.597, 0.802).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unachievable Due to Action Instance Restrictions**
           
           Okay, so the task is to get objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` onto surface `v18`. Initially, they're all on `v11`, which is straightforward enough to visualize. The robot, has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, and a base at `v3`. The only action instance I'm allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This is a bit of a head-scratcher because it's essentially a no-op - the robot can't actually *do* anything useful.
           
           Breaking down the goal, I need to get each object on `v18`.  That requires picking each object from its initial pose (e.g., `v8` from `v9`) and placing it on `v18` at a specified pose (e.g., at `v8_on_v18_pose`).  The initial state helpfully gives me `pose` and `supported` predicates, indicating where the objects can be *placed* on `v18`, so that part's fine, although I will need to instantiate a different pose variable for each object, as `#o2` is a symbolic placeholder.  I can also utilize the fact that all of the objects are `graspable` and that a single grasp will work for all of them.
           
           Now, the problem is that I don't have *any* `pick` or `place` action instances in the allowed list!  The only action instance is `move_base`.  This is a critical constraint.  The instructions explicitly state, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since the problem requires me to move objects *from* v11 *to* v18 (an action not explicitly achievable by move base), I need to be able to pick them up from the initial position, which means I would need instances of pick. Since only *move_base* is allowed, I cannot pick or place, and thus cannot achieve the goal. Therefore, the problem is fundamentally unachievable given the constraint on allowable action instances.
