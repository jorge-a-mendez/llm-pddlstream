(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           I'm tasked with generating 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6) on a rectangular surface. The object is nearly square with dimensions (0.08220853623560564, 0.0822085362356057), and the surface is a square AABB defined by ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)). A placement is stable if the object's AABB is fully within the surface.
           
           To achieve this, I'll calculate the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates (x, y) for various rotation angles (theta). The key is that the effective dimensions of the object change with rotation.  Since the object is almost square, rotations of 0 and 90 degrees (or pi/2 radians) will have very similar effects.
           
           My approach is as follows:
           
           1. **Calculate Effective Dimensions:** For a given rotation `theta`, I'll determine the object's effective width and height using its original dimensions and the rotation angle.  Specifically,  `effective_sx = abs(obj_sx * cos(theta)) + abs(obj_sy * sin(theta))` and `effective_sy = abs(obj_sx * sin(theta)) + abs(obj_sy * cos(theta))`.
           
           2. **Determine Valid Center Ranges:** Using the effective dimensions and the surface's boundaries, I calculate the minimum and maximum allowable x and y center coordinates for that rotation.
           
           3. **Generate a Grid of Placements:** For a set of diverse rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2, 5*pi/8, 3*pi/4, 7*pi/8, pi), I create a grid of (x, y) placements within the valid ranges. A 3x3 grid will give me 9 potential positions for each of the 9 chosen angles.
           
           4. **Iterate and Collect:** I'll loop through the angles and placements, accumulating valid (theta, x, y) combinations until I have 50 unique stable placements.
           
           This approach will provide a good distribution of stable placements across the surface, considering different orientations of the object.  The nearly-square nature of the object simplifies calculations and makes rotations of 0 and pi/2 very similar.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 7**
           
           I've been tasked with placing object ID 7 on surface 0, ensuring it doesn't collide with the already placed object ID 6. Object 7 is almost a square with dimensions 0.09385791543287697 x 0.09385791543287703, and I need to generate 50 stable placements. I'll need to account for possible rotations.
           
           First, I need to understand object 6's positioning. It's at (0, 0.0, -0.09389573188219718, -0.09389573188219715), and I'll use its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) to define its occupied space. Then I need to figure out object 7's valid positions, considering rotation and collision avoidance. 
           
           Since I need to find 50 placements, and object 6 is in the lower-left, I anticipate having to reject candidates that would overlap with object 6. Thus, I'll need to sample more placements than I need, and then filter out the collisions. I'll take a grid approach, varying both x and y positions and exploring different rotations (angle of theta). 
           
           I need to pre-compute the AABB for object 6, which is pretty straight forward.
           
           The effective bounding extents are the key. For a given angle (theta), the AABB of object 7 changes. And in the edge cases (i.e., at 0 degrees), the overlap check is also simpler.
           
           My strategy involves:
           
           1.  **Defining object 6's AABB.** Using the supplied data, I'll calculate the minimum and maximum x and y extents of its AABB.
           2.  **Iterating through rotation angles.** For each angle (I'll sample from 0 to 7pi/8), I'll calculate object 7's effective half-extents (hx_eff and hy_eff).
           3.  **Determining Valid Placement Ranges.** For each angle, I will determine the range of valid positions x and y on surface 0, considering the object's dimensions and the surface boundaries.
           4.  **Generating Position Candidates.** Within these valid ranges, I'll create a grid of x,y positions. I will be doing 3x3 per rotation, which, for 7 rotations, gives me a number of points to sample (potential for rejecting a few that overlap).
           5.  **Collision Checking.** For each (x, y) candidate, I'll calculate object 7's AABB and check if it collides with object 6's AABB.
           6.  **Adding Non-Colliding Placements.** If there's no collision, I'll add the placement (surface index, theta, x, y) to my list of placements.
           7.  **Early Exit:** Once I have 50 placements, I'll stop searching, and return my list.
           
           I'll check the collision carefully at each iteration. I have all the bounds so the process should produce the 50 desired stable placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects ID 6 and ID 7, both of which are already placed. Object 5 is a square with size `0.07765666682454042`. Surface 0 is a square area centered at (0,0) with half-extents of (0.135, 0.135).
           
           Object 6's AABB is approximately `[-0.135, -0.05279] x [-0.135, -0.05279]`, and Object 7's AABB is approximately `[-0.135, -0.04114] x [-0.04693, 0.04693]`.  Since they partially overlap, I need to account for both when considering collision. I've calculated the min and max X and Y extents for each existing object.
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate placements, AABB-based on the object's dimensions and rotation. Then check these placements against the bounding boxes of the existing objects.
           
           I'll start by defining the bounding boxes of the existing objects.  Then, for various rotations of Object 5, I'll calculate the valid range for the object's center based on the surface limits and effective object half-extents. Then I will generate a grid of candidate positions (3x3 grid) within the valid range for the center. After that, I iterate through these candidate positions at these rotational settings to check for collisions against objects 6 and 7 using their AABBs. I'll continue this process until I've found 50 valid, non-colliding placements.
           
           When generating the candidate positions, I account for potential edge cases such as the situation when the valid placement area for object 5 is too small or if the `x_min_center` equals `x_max_center`. Also the use of angles with intervals of pi/8. I confirmed my intersection check logic, and my data structures.
