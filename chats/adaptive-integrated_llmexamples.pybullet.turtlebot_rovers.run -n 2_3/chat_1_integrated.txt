           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v1 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((1.959, -0.777), (2.065, -0.672)).

           Object v15 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           Object v9 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).

           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a conjunction of conditions. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists an object of type `v2` (which represents 'stone'). In the initial state, `v1`, `v3`, `v4` are of type `v2`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a rock of type `v2` has been received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists an object of type `v6` (which represents 'soil'). In the initial state, `v5`, `v7`, `v8` are of type `v6`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of a rock of type `v6` has been received.
           
           From the initial state, we need to achieve the following:
           *   Receive images of `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Receive analysis of a `v2` type rock (e.g., `v1`, `v3`, or `v4`).
           *   Receive analysis of a `v6` type rock (e.g., `v5`, `v7`, or `v8`).
           
           Let's plan to achieve these:
           
           **Image Reception:**
           *   To get `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, we need to `take_image` and then `send_image`.
           *   Both `v12` and `v14` have onboard camera `v10` supporting mode `v11`.
           *   Both `v12` and `v14` have `imagevisible` predicates for `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3` with ray `#o4`.
           *   Both `v12` and `v14` have `comvisible` predicates to lander `v9` at configuration `#o0` with ray `#o1`.
           
           We can use `v12` to take and send images for both `v17` and `v18`.
           1.  Calibrate camera `v10` on `v12` at `#o3` for `v17` (or `v18`). `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           2.  Take image of `v17`. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           3.  Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication. `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o0)` (or `#o3` to `#o0` if current is `#o3`)
           4.  Send image of `v17`. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           5.  Move `v12` back to `#o3` (or stay at `#o0` and calibrate/take image for `v18` if possible, but the `imagevisible` is at `#o3`). `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o3)`
           6.  Calibrate camera `v10` on `v12` at `#o3` for `v18`. `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           7.  Take image of `v18`. `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           8.  Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication. `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           9.  Send image of `v18`. `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           
           **Analysis Reception:**
           *   To get `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, we need to `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.
           *   Both `v12` and `v14` have free stores.
           *   Both `v12` and `v14` are above multiple rocks at configuration `#o5`.
           
           Let's use `v14` for sampling and sending analysis.
           1.  Move `v14` to `#o5` for sampling. `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o5)`
           2.  Sample a type `v2` rock, e.g., `v1`. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)`
           3.  Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication. `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           4.  Send analysis of `v1`. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`
           5.  Drop the rock `v1`. `(drop_rock v14 v16)` (This makes the store free again for the next sample)
           6.  Move `v14` back to `#o5` for sampling. `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7.  Sample a type `v6` rock, e.g., `v5`. `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16)`
           8.  Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication. `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9.  Send analysis of `v5`. `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           
           Let's combine these steps. We need to be careful with the configuration changes. The initial `atconf` are `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`.
           
           **Plan for v12 (images):**
           1.  `v12` is at `v13`. We need to move it to `#o3` for `imagevisible`.
               `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o3)`
           2.  Calibrate `v10` for `v17`.
               `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3.  Take image of `v17`.
               `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4.  Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication.
               `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           5.  Send image of `v17`.
               `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           6.  Move `v12` back to `#o3` to take the second image.
               `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o3)`
           7.  Calibrate `v10` for `v18`.
               `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           8.  Take image of `v18`.
               `(take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           9.  Move `v12` to `#o0` for communication.
               `(move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           10. Send image of `v18`.
               `(send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           
           **Plan for v14 (analysis):**
           1.  `v14` is at `v15`. We need to move it to `#o5` for `above`.
               `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o5)`
           2.  Sample rock `v1` (type `v2`).
               `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v1 v16)`
           3.  Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication.
               `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           4.  Send analysis of `v1`.
               `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`
           5.  Drop the rock to free the store.
               `(drop_rock v14 v16)`
           6.  Move `v14` back to `#o5` to sample another rock.
               `(move v14 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7.  Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`).
               `(sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16)`
           8.  Move `v14` to `#o0` for communication.
               `(move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9.  Send analysis of `v5`.
               `(send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           
           All conditions of the `new-axiom@0` should be met by these actions.
           The initial state already has `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`, `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v5, v6)`.
           
           Let's determine coordinates for the continuous parameters:
           *   `#o3` (rover v12/v14, ray #o4, target v17/v18): This is for `imagevisible`. Max distance 2.
               *   `v17` AABB: ((-0.732, 2.021), (-0.634, 2.12))
               *   `v18` AABB: ((-1.931, 2.049), (-1.834, 2.146))
               *   A good spot for `v12` (from `v13` = (1.0, -1.75)) to see `v17` (near (-0.7, 2.0)) or `v18` (near (-1.9, 2.0)) is problematic for distance. `v13` is at (1.0, -1.75).
               *   A good spot for `v14` (from `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75)) to see `v17` (near (-0.7, 2.0)) or `v18` (near (-1.9, 2.0)). For `v18`, `v14` is closer. For `v17`, `v14` is also closer than `v12`. Let's assume the continuous planner finds a valid config for `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17` and `v18`. A reasonable configuration for `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17` and `v18` might be around (0.0, 1.0) or (0.0, 0.0) for both, or perhaps it can rotate in place. The range is max 2.
               Let's check the given `imagerange` facts: `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)` and `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)`. Similarly for `v14`. This implies `#o3` is a configuration from which both `v17` and `v18` can be imaged by either rover. A single `#o3` for both objectives. Let's try to find a single point to image both `v17` ((-0.7, 2.0)) and `v18` ((-1.9, 2.0)). A point like (-1.3, 0.5) might work for both.
               Let's pick an example for `#o3` for `v12` for `v17`: `v17` is around (-0.68, 2.07). `v13` is (1.0, -1.75).
               Let's pick an example for `#o3` for `v12` for `v18`: `v18` is around (-1.88, 2.09).
               This implies `#o3` is a single pose from which `v12` can image both `v17` and `v18`. Similarly for `v14`. Given the AABBs for `v17` and `v18` are both in the top-left quadrant, and `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) are at the bottom, a single config for imaging both is challenging if not a specific angle, unless the config itself is close to the objectives.
               Let's assume `#o3` for `v12` is at (0.0, 1.0).
               For `v12` to `v17`: `distance = sqrt((0.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (1.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.732^2 + (-1.021)^2) = sqrt(0.5358 + 1.0424) = sqrt(1.5782) approx 1.25`. This is within 2.
               For `v12` to `v18`: `distance = sqrt((0.0 - (-1.931))^2 + (1.0 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(1.931^2 + (-1.049)^2) = sqrt(3.7287 + 1.1004) = sqrt(4.8291) approx 2.19`. This is just outside 2. So (0.0, 1.0) is not good for both for v12.
               Let's try a config for `#o3` (for v12 imaging v17):
               (0.0, 0.0) -> v17: `sqrt((0.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.732^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.5358 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.62) approx 2.14` - too far.
               Let's try a configuration specific to `v12` and `v17`. A good candidate for `#o3` for `v12` imaging `v17` would be around `(-0.5, 0.5)`. From `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.5, 0.5)` is possible.
               `Distance v12_o3_v17 = sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.5 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.232^2 + (-1.521)^2) = sqrt(0.0538 + 2.3134) = sqrt(2.3672) approx 1.54`. This is within 2.
               Now for `v12` imaging `v18` from `(-0.5, 0.5)`:
               `Distance v12_o3_v18 = sqrt((-0.5 - (-1.931))^2 + (0.5 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(1.431^2 + (-1.549)^2) = sqrt(2.047 + 2.399) = sqrt(4.446) approx 2.1`. This is slightly over 2.
               This means `#o3` might refer to two different poses implicitly, or there's a single pose that works for both. Given the PDDL uses `#o3` for both, we assume there exists one. Let's pick an average target location of `v17` and `v18`: `((-0.732-1.931)/2, (2.021+2.049)/2) = (-1.33, 2.035)`. A config for `v12` could be `(-1.3, 0.5)`.
               `Distance v12_o3_v17 = sqrt((-1.3 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.5 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.568)^2 + (-1.521)^2) = sqrt(0.3226 + 2.3134) = sqrt(2.636) approx 1.62`. Good.
               `Distance v12_o3_v18 = sqrt((-1.3 - (-1.931))^2 + (0.5 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.631^2 + (-1.549)^2) = sqrt(0.398 + 2.399) = sqrt(2.797) approx 1.67`. Good.
               So, `#o3` for `v12` to image `v17` and `v18` could be `(-1.3, 0.5)`.
           
           *   `#o5` (rover v12/v14, target rocks): This is for `above`.
               *   Rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) are scattered. We need a single `#o5` from which `v1` and `v5` (or any other v2/v6 pair) can be sampled.
               *   `v1` (type v2): ((1.959, -0.777), (2.065, -0.672))
               *   `v5` (type v6): ((-1.334, -1.445), (-1.194, -1.306))
               *   `v14` is at `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75). `v5` is nearby.
               *   A good config for `#o5` for `v14` to be `above` `v5` would be `(-1.2, -1.35)`.
               `Distance v14_v15_to_o5 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.2))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.35))^2) = sqrt(0.2^2 + (-0.4)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.2) approx 0.45`. This is a reasonable move distance.
               From `(-1.2, -1.35)`, `v14` is above `v5`.
               We also need to sample `v1` from `#o5`. This is challenging if `#o5` is a single configuration for multiple, distant rocks.
               Let's check the facts: `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, etc. This suggests `#o5` is a single configuration that is "above" multiple rocks. This implies either the rocks are clustered, or `#o5` is a very general configuration. Given their AABBs, they are quite spread out. `v1` (near (2.0, -0.7)), `v5` (near (-1.2, -1.3)). It's very unlikely a single config for `#o5` would be "above" all of them.
               This could mean that `#o5` is implicitly a different pose for each (rover, rock) pair. However, the PDDL uses a single `#o5` argument.
               Let's assume there is a single `#o5` that works for sampling both `v1` and `v5` by `v14`. Given the locations, it would be extremely large or very central.
               Alternatively, the "above" predicate might be true if the rover's end-effector is above it. However, in this domain, it usually means the rover's base is in a particular pose such that a sampling arm can reach.
               If `#o5` is a specific location for `v14`, and `v1` (stone) and `v5` (soil) are what we are targeting, it is very unlikely for `#o5` to be above both.
               However, the provided initial state includes `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`. This means such a configuration `#o5` exists.
               Let's pick `#o5` for `v14` to be around the center of the workspace, say (0.0, 0.0), and assume it can reach.
               `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Moving to `(0.0, 0.0)` for `#o5`.
               `Distance v14_v15_to_o5 = sqrt((-1.0 - 0.0)^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(1.0^2 + 1.75^2) = sqrt(1.0 + 3.0625) = sqrt(4.0625) approx 2.01`. This is a plausible distance.
           
           *   `#o0` (rover v12/v14, ray #o1, target v9): This is for `comvisible`. Max distance 4.
               *   `v9` (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)) - near (-1.9, -2.0)
               *   `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   For `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (near (-1.9, -2.0)), a config like `(-1.5, -1.8)` for `#o0` would be close and `comvisible`.
               `Distance v14_v15_to_o0 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.2525) approx 0.5`. This is a reasonable move distance.
               For `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (near (-1.9, -2.0)). A config like `(-0.5, -1.8)` for `#o0` might work.
               `Distance v12_v13_to_o0 = sqrt((1.0 - (-0.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt(1.5^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(2.2525) approx 1.5`. This is also a reasonable move distance.
               Let's choose a single `#o0` for both `v12` and `v14` to communicate with `v9`. A config like `(-1.0, -1.8)`.
               `Distance v12_v13_to_o0 = sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(4.0 + 0.0025) = sqrt(4.0025) approx 2.0`. Within 4.
               `Distance v14_v15_to_o0 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt(0.0^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(0.0025) approx 0.05`. Within 4.
               So `#o0` as `(-1.0, -1.8)` works for both.
           
           The trajectory `#o2` is an arbitrary continuous parameter representing the motion path. We do not need to specify values for it.

Model:     The previous plan failed because some configurations were either unreachable or in collision. Let's re-evaluate the continuous parameters based on the feedback.
           
           **Reachability and Collision for #o3 (imagevisible):**
           The rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). The previous `#o3` was `(-1.3, 0.5)`. The distance between `v13` and `(-1.3, 0.5)` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.3))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(2.3^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(5.29 + 5.0625) = sqrt(10.3525) approx 3.2`. This distance might be too large for a simple move or within the specified motion capabilities in this abstract domain. Let's try to find a reachable `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17` and `v18`.
           `v17` is around `(-0.7, 2.0)`, `v18` is around `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           The rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. It's challenging to find a single pose within 2 units of both `v17` and `v18` that is also reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           Let's analyze the problem again. The initial state has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This implies a single `#o3` for `v12` can see both. Similarly for `v14`.
           Given the objects are quite far apart, and the image range is 2, it is very hard for a single pose to be within 2 units of both `v17` and `v18`.
           However, we must assume that such `#o3` configurations exist because they are listed in the initial state as `imagevisible` predicates. The issue is likely finding the specific collision-free and reachable coordinate.
           
           Let's rethink `v12` to `v17` and `v18`.
           If `v12` could get to, for example, `(0.0, 1.0)`, it is `sqrt((1.0-0.0)^2+(-1.75-1.0)^2) = sqrt(1^2+2.75^2) = sqrt(1+7.5625) = sqrt(8.5625) approx 2.9` distance from `v13`. This is getting long.
           Let's try a `#o3` closer to `v13` but still able to image the targets.
           For `v12` (at (1.0, -1.75)) to image `v17` ((-0.7, 2.0)) or `v18` ((-1.9, 2.0)):
           Perhaps a more optimistic position for `#o3` for `v12` to see `v17` is `(0.0, 0.0)`.
           `Distance v12_o3_v17 = sqrt((0.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.732^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.5358 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.62) approx 2.14`. This is still too far.
           It's possible that `#o3` is a different configuration for imaging `v17` vs `v18`. But the PDDL defines it as a single object `#o3`.
           Let's re-examine `imagerange(v12, #o3, v17)` and `imagerange(v12, #o3, v18)`. This implies a SINGLE #o3 from which BOTH v17 and v18 are within image range for v12.
           This problem seems to be trying to find a configuration that can image multiple distant objects, which is geometrically difficult given the range constraint.
           Let's assume there is an image configuration for `v14` as it is closer to `v18`.
           `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           `v17` at `(-0.7, 2.0)`
           `v18` at `(-1.9, 2.0)`
           For `v14` to image `v18`: `(-1.9, 2.0)`. A config like `(-1.5, 0.5)` might work for `v14`.
           `Distance v14_o3_v18 = sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.931))^2 + (0.5 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.431^2 + (-1.549)^2) = sqrt(0.185 + 2.399) = sqrt(2.584) approx 1.6`. This is good.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) approx 2.3`. This is a reasonable move distance.
           From `(-1.5, 0.5)`, `v14` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.5 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.768)^2 + (-1.521)^2) = sqrt(0.589 + 2.313) = sqrt(2.902) approx 1.7`. This is also good.
           So, let's use `(-1.5, 0.5)` for `#o3` for `v14`.
           
           **Collision for #o5 (above):**
           The previous `#o5` was `(0.0, 0.0)` for rover `v14` to sample `v1` and `v5`. This was in collision with `v19: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))`. This obstacle is a thin wall along the y-axis at x=0.
           So `(0.0, 0.0)` is indeed in collision. We need a different `#o5`.
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           It's still very unlikely that one `#o5` exists "above" both. The problem statement says `above(v14, #o5, v1)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are true in the initial state. This implies such a single `#o5` exists.
           Since `(0.0, 0.0)` is in collision, we need to choose a `#o5` that is not at `x=0`.
           Let's try `#o5` for `v14` as `(0.5, 0.0)`. This would avoid `v19`.
           `v14` starts at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Move to `(0.5, 0.0)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o5 = sqrt((-1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) approx 2.3`. This is a reasonable move distance.
           
           **Reachability for #o0 (comvisible):**
           The previous `#o0` was `(-1.0, -1.8)`. It was deemed unreachable for both `v12` and `v14`.
           `v9` (lander) is near `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Let's try a `#o0` closer to `v9` for both, and check reachability.
           For `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0). A config like `(-1.5, -1.8)` is very close to `v15`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o0 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.2525) approx 0.5`. This is very reachable for `v14`.
           Now for `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to reach `(-1.5, -1.8)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o0 = sqrt((1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.8))^2) = sqrt(2.5^2 + 0.05^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(6.2525) approx 2.5`. This distance is plausible for a move.
           And `(-1.5, -1.8)` is `sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.8 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.2) approx 0.45` from `v9`, which is well within 4 for `comvisible`.
           So, let's use `(-1.5, -1.8)` for `#o0`.
           
           Revised plan with `v14` doing image capturing and `v12` doing rock sampling. This is to avoid complex pathfinding for `v12` to objectives `v17, v18` far away.
           **Goal conditions:**
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: (Achieved by `v14`)
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: (Achieved by `v14`)
           7. `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type `v2`): (Achieved by `v12`)
           8. `receivedanalysis(v5)` (type `v6`): (Achieved by `v12`)
           
           **Plan for v14 (images):**
           1.  `v14` is at `v15`. Move to `#o3` (new: `(-1.5, 0.5)`).
               `(move v14 v15 #o2 #o3)`
           2.  Calibrate `v10` for `v17`.
               `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)`
           3.  Take image of `v17`.
               `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)`
           4.  Calibrate `v10` for `v18`. (Note: Calibrate is needed each time `take_image` is called, unless the PDDL is interpreted differently. It de-calibrates the camera)
               `(calibrate v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)`
           5.  Take image of `v18`.
               `(take_image v14 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)`
           6.  Move `v14` to `#o0` (new: `(-1.5, -1.8)`) for communication.
               `(move v14 #o3 #o2 #o0)`
           7.  Send image of `v17`.
               `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)`
           8.  Send image of `v18`.
               `(send_image v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)`
           
           **Plan for v12 (analysis):**
           1.  `v12` is at `v13`. Move to `#o5` (new: `(0.5, 0.0)`).
               `(move v12 v13 #o2 #o5)`
           2.  Sample rock `v1` (type `v2`).
               `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16)`
           3.  Move `v12` to `#o0` (new: `(-1.5, -1.8)`) for communication.
               `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           4.  Send analysis of `v1`.
               `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1)`
           5.  Drop the rock to free the store.
               `(drop_rock v12 v16)`
           6.  Move `v12` back to `#o5` (new: `(0.5, 0.0)`) to sample another rock.
               `(move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)`
           7.  Sample rock `v5` (type `v6`).
               `(sample_rock v12 #o5 v5 v16)`
           8.  Move `v12` to `#o0` (new: `(-1.5, -1.8)`) for communication.
               `(move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)`
           9.  Send analysis of `v5`.
               `(send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v5)`
           
           This looks like a more robust plan given the corrected configurations.

Model:     The previous configurations failed again due to reachability and collision issues. The continuous values are proving tricky. Let's analyze the new feedback carefully.
           
           **Reachability of #o3 for `v14` (images):**
           `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. The previous `#o3` was `(-1.5, 0.5)`.
           The distance between `v15` and `(-1.5, 0.5)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.3125) approx 2.3`. This distance was considered reasonable but is now explicitly reported as "not reachable for robot base". This implies the robot's motion capabilities are more restricted than a simple Euclidean distance check.
           
           Let's reconsider which rover is best suited for imaging `v17` and `v18`.
           `v17` is near `(-0.7, 2.0)`. `v18` is near `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Both `v17` and `v18` are quite far north of both rovers. Given the 2-unit image range, and the limited reachability, it might be challenging to find a single `#o3` configuration for either rover that satisfies all conditions.
           However, the initial state *guarantees* that `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, and similar for `v14` exist. We need to find the correct coordinates.
           Since the `imagerange` is 2, and the objectives are at y=2.0, the rover's y-coordinate for `#o3` needs to be at least y=0. If the initial position is at y=-1.75, it has to move quite a bit.
           
           Let's assume the rover can move along an axis and that movement is limited along one axis, or a diagonal path is more costly.
           Maybe moving closer to the objectives on the Y-axis is the issue.
           Let's try a `#o3` configuration for `v14` (from `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`) that is slightly north-west of `v18` (approx `(-1.9, 2.0)`).
           Perhaps `(-1.7, 0.0)` for `#o3`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.7))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.7^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.49 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.5525) approx 1.88`. This is a reasonable move distance.
           From `(-1.7, 0.0)` for `v14` to image `v18`: `sqrt((-1.7 - (-1.931))^2 + (0.0 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.231^2 + (-2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.0533 + 4.198) = sqrt(4.2513) approx 2.06`. This is slightly over 2.0 range. So this won't work.
           
           This is very difficult if the movement is restricted.
           Let's try to make the `#o3` configuration as close as possible to the target y-coordinate, and as close as possible to the rover's initial x-coordinate.
           For `v14` to image `v17` ((-0.7, 2.0)) and `v18` ((-1.9, 2.0)):
           Let's try `(-1.3, 0.0)` for `#o3`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.3))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.1525) approx 1.77`. This is a better move distance.
           From `(-1.3, 0.0)` for `v14` to image `v17`: `sqrt((-1.3 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.568)^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.3226 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.407) approx 2.09`. Still slightly over image range.
           
           It seems the `imagerange` of 2 and the `imagevisible` predicate combined with the object locations make finding a single `#o3` challenging. However, we *must* assume such a pose exists. I will try a pose close to the average of `v17` and `v18` that is closer to the rovers' start y-coordinate, even if it is near the range limit.
           
           **Reachability of #o5 for `v12` (sampling):**
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`. The previous `#o5` was `(0.5, 0.0)`.
           The distance between `v13` and `(0.5, 0.0)` is `sqrt((1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.3125) approx 1.82`. This distance was also considered reasonable but is now "not reachable for robot base".
           
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           For `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) to sample `v1` and `v5`.
           A config for `v12` to be "above" `v1` `(2.0, -0.7)` would be around `(2.0, -0.7)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_v1 = sqrt((1.0 - 2.0)^2 + (-1.75 - (-0.7))^2) = sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (-1.05)^2) = sqrt(1.0 + 1.1025) = sqrt(2.1025) approx 1.45`. This is reachable.
           A config for `v12` to be "above" `v5` `(-1.2, -1.3)` would be around `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_v5 = sqrt((1.0 - (-1.2))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.3))^2) = sqrt(2.2^2 + (-0.45)^2) = sqrt(4.84 + 0.2025) = sqrt(5.0425) approx 2.24`. This is also a plausible move.
           Since the PDDL initial state states `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, it implies there is a single `#o5` that works for both. This means `#o5` must be somewhere central.
           Let's choose a `#o5` for `v12` that is at the center of the world, `(0.0, -0.7)`. This is not in collision with `v19`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o5 = sqrt((1.0 - 0.0)^2 + (-1.75 - (-0.7))^2) = sqrt(1.0^2 + (-1.05)^2) = sqrt(1.0 + 1.1025) = sqrt(2.1025) approx 1.45`. This seems reachable.
           
           **Collision for #o0 (comvisible):**
           The previous `#o0` was `(-1.5, -1.8)`. It was in collision with `v9` (lander) itself. This is critical. `v9` is `AABB(lower=[-2.4047, -2.3455502384913305, 0.0], upper=[-1.3952999999999998, -1.6544497615086693, 0.40766007847975994])`.
           A point `(-1.5, -1.8)` is within the x-range `[-2.4, -1.39]` and y-range `[-2.34, -1.65]` of `v9`. So `(-1.5, -1.8)` is inside the lander. This is an invalid configuration.
           We need `#o0` to be *near* `v9` for communication but *not in collision* with `v9`.
           Let's try a point just outside `v9`'s bounding box. For example, `(-1.0, -1.8)` was rejected before as unreachable.
           Let's try `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`. To `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o0 = sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + (-0.75)^2) = sqrt(4.0 + 0.5625) = sqrt(4.5625) approx 2.13`. This seems reachable.
           From `(-1.0, -1.0)` to `v9` (near `(-1.9, -2.0)`): `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 1.0^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 1.0) = sqrt(1.81) approx 1.34`. This is within 4 for `comvisible`.
           For `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. To `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o0 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0.0^2 + (-0.75)^2) = sqrt(0.5625) approx 0.75`. This is very reachable.
           The point `(-1.0, -1.0)` is not in collision with `v19` (at `x=0`) and it's outside `v9`. This looks like a promising `#o0`.
           
           **Revised strategy for #o3 (imagevisible):**
           Let's use `v14` to take images. It starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Targets are `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)` and `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           Maybe `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `#o3` for `v14`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-1.75)^2) = 1.75`. This is very reachable.
           From `(-1.0, 0.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.268)^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.0718 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.1562) approx 2.03`. This is just outside 2.0 range.
           This implies there's no single configuration for `#o3` that can image both `v17` and `v18` from a reachable location using `v14`.
           This indicates a fundamental problem with the interpretation of `#o3` or the problem's geometric constraints.
           If `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` mean that there's a configuration for `v12` to see `v18` and *the same* configuration for `v12` to see `v17`, then such a configuration must exist.
           
           What if the objectives are close to obstacles and the line-of-sight is blocked?
           The problem statement says `#o4` is the ray. The `blocked(?y)` axiom checks `~test-cfree-ray-conf-negative(?y, ?v, ?q)`.
           Let's assume there is a `#o3` configuration for `v14` and that it is within range. Let's try `(-0.5, 0.0)` for `v14` for imaging, hoping to be reachable and in range.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.5))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.3125) approx 1.82`. Still seems reachable.
           From `(-0.5, 0.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-0.5 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.232^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.0538 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.1382) approx 2.03`. Still out of range.
           
           This implies the `imagevisible` predicates in the initial state are extremely hard to satisfy given the `imagerange` constraint.
           Is it possible the `imagerange` is an upper bound on distance, and it just means an object is within 2 distance? Not that it has to be exactly 2.
           The problem setter must have expected a solution to be found within these constraints.
           Perhaps the coordinate system is different, or the map provided is misleading. Given I'm forced to assume the PDDL initial state is correct, I'll attempt to fulfill the task as specified.
           
           If `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) can't reach a good position for images, what about `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`)?
           `v12` to `#o3`: try `(0.5, 0.0)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o3 = sqrt((1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.3125) approx 1.82`. This also seems reachable.
           From `(0.5, 0.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((0.5 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(1.232^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(1.517 + 4.084) = sqrt(5.601) approx 2.36`. Out of range.
           
           It appears impossible to find an `#o3` for either rover that is within 2 units of *both* `v17` and `v18` *and* reachable from their starting positions, based on my geometric calculations and the given feedback.
           I'm going to proceed with the plan assuming such configurations exist, but I cannot accurately compute them that satisfy all requirements, especially the reachability for robot base part for which I don't have enough information about robot kinematics. However, I must provide *some* coordinate. I will try to use coordinates that are physically plausible even if previous attempts have been rejected.
           
           Let's retry `#o3` for `v14` closer to the objectives, assuming the "reachable" constraint means the path is traversable, not just Euclidean distance.
           Let's try `#o3` for `v14` at `(-1.3, 1.0)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.3))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.6525) approx 2.76`. This is a long distance, but if it is reachable it might satisfy image range.
           From `(-1.3, 1.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.3 - (-0.732))^2 + (1.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.568)^2 + (-1.021)^2) = sqrt(0.3226 + 1.0424) = sqrt(1.365) approx 1.16`. This is good.
           From `(-1.3, 1.0)` to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.3 - (-1.931))^2 + (1.0 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.631^2 + (-1.049)^2) = sqrt(0.398 + 1.1004) = sqrt(1.4984) approx 1.22`. This is good.
           So, `(-1.3, 1.0)` for `#o3` seems to work for image range for `v14`. Let's hope it's reachable.
           
           **Revised strategy for #o5 (sampling):**
           Let's use `v12` to sample rocks. It starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           Let's try `#o5` for `v12` at `(0.5, -0.7)`. This is not in collision with `v19` (x=0).
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o5 = sqrt((1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - (-0.7))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-1.05)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 1.1025) = sqrt(1.3525) approx 1.16`. This seems very reachable.
           From `(0.5, -0.7)` to `v1` (near `(2.0, -0.7)`): This is "above". The geometric condition for "above" is not explicitly given, but generally it means the rover is close enough and can deploy an arm. `(0.5, -0.7)` is reasonably close to `(2.0, -0.7)` and `(-1.2, -1.3)` assuming the rover has a decent reach for sampling.
           
           **Revised strategy for #o0 (comvisible):**
           The previous `#o0` `(-1.5, -1.8)` was in collision with `v9`.
           Let's try `#o0` for both rovers to be `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This is outside `v9`'s bounding box.
           `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. To `(-1.0, -1.5)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o0 = sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(4.0 + 0.0625) = sqrt(4.0625) approx 2.01`. This seems reachable.
           From `(-1.0, -1.5)` to `v9` (near `(-1.9, -2.0)`): `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.5 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.06) approx 1.03`. This is well within 4 for `comvisible`.
           `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. To `(-1.0, -1.5)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o0 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.0625) approx 0.25`. This is very reachable.
           This `#o0` looks good.
           
           The plan structure will remain the same.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The persistent issue with "not reachable for robot base" indicates that my Euclidean distance calculations are not sufficient for determining reachability. The robot's motion model or environment constraints must be more complex. The collision with `v20` for `#o5` is a new obstacle to consider.
           
           Let's re-analyze the feedback:
           
           **Reachability of #o3 for `v14` (images):**
           `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. The previous `#o3` was `(-1.3, 1.0)`. This was rejected as unreachable.
           Objectives: `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`, `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           Since `v14` is starting at `(-1.0, -1.75)` and the objectives are far north, it seems the Y-axis movement for the robot base is severely restricted. Given the range of 2 for `imagevisible`, the robot needs to be quite close to the objectives. If moving far north is not possible, achieving `imagevisible` might be impossible with the current robot.
           However, `imagevisible` predicates are present in the initial state, implying a solution exists. This forces me to pick values that are highly improbable geometrically based on simple Euclidean distances, but are "reachable" in the hidden, more complex motion model.
           
           Let's try to put `#o3` very close to one of the objectives. For `v14` and `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           Let `#o3` for `v14` be `(-1.9, 0.5)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + (-2.25)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 5.0625) = sqrt(5.8725) approx 2.42`. This is still a long distance.
           From `(-1.9, 0.5)` to `v18`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.931))^2 + (0.5 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.031^2 + (-1.549)^2) = sqrt(0.000961 + 2.399) = sqrt(2.4) approx 1.55`. This is within range.
           From `(-1.9, 0.5)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.5 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-1.168)^2 + (-1.521)^2) = sqrt(1.364 + 2.313) = sqrt(3.677) approx 1.91`. This is also within range.
           So, `(-1.9, 0.5)` for `#o3` for `v14` works for imaging both targets and I will hope it's reachable.
           
           **Collision for #o5 for `v12` (sampling):**
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`. The previous `#o5` was `(0.5, -0.7)`. This was in collision with `v20: AABB(lower=(0.651, -0.869), upper=(0.782, -0.738))`.
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           The obstacle `v20` is a small box around `(0.7, -0.8)`.
           We need an `#o5` for `v12` that is not `(0.5, -0.7)` and is clear of `v20`.
           Let's try to move `#o5` for `v12` away from `v20` along the x-axis, perhaps to `(0.0, -0.7)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o5 = sqrt((1.0 - 0.0)^2 + (-1.75 - (-0.7))^2) = sqrt(1.0^2 + (-1.05)^2) = sqrt(1.0 + 1.1025) = sqrt(2.1025) approx 1.45`. This seems reachable.
           `(0.0, -0.7)` is clear of `v19` (at `x=0` only applies to obstacles, not rover itself unless it is the obstacle) and `v20`.
           So, let's use `(0.0, -0.7)` for `#o5` for `v12`.
           
           **Reachability of #o0 for both `v12` and `v14` (comvisible):**
           The previous `#o0` was `(-1.0, -1.5)`. This was rejected as unreachable for both.
           `v9` (lander) is near `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           The lander `v9` is bounded by `x` from `-2.4` to `-1.39` and `y` from `-2.34` to `-1.65`.
           We need `#o0` to be close to `v9` but not in collision and reachable from both rovers.
           If `-1.0, -1.5` is not reachable, we need a configuration that is even closer to their starting positions while still being `comvisible` to `v9` and not colliding.
           Perhaps `(-0.5, -1.7)` for `#o0`. This is outside of `v9`.
           For `v12` from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, -1.7)`:
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o0 = sqrt((1.0 - (-0.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.7))^2) = sqrt(1.5^2 + (-0.05)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(2.2525) approx 1.5`. This is a reasonable move distance.
           For `v14` from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.5, -1.7)`:
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o0 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.7))^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-0.05)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.2525) approx 0.5`. This is very reachable.
           From `(-0.5, -1.7)` to `v9` (near `(-1.9, -2.0)`):
           `Distance to v9 = sqrt((-0.5 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.7 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(1.4^2 + 0.3^2) = sqrt(1.96 + 0.09) = sqrt(2.05) approx 1.43`. This is well within 4 for `comvisible`.
           This seems like a better `#o0`.
           
           The plan structure will remain the same.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The feedback consistently points to reachability and collision issues, indicating my understanding of the robot's motion capabilities and the environment's finer details is incomplete. The specific `AABB` for obstacle `v19` is `(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0)` to `(0.05, 2.5, 0.1)`, meaning it's a wall centered at `x=0`. My previous `#o5` for `v12` at `(0.0, -0.7)` was directly on this wall, causing a collision.
           
           Given the continuous rejections, I will try to use the *exact* configurations already present in the initial state for the rovers (`v13` for `v12` and `v15` for `v14`) as much as possible, as these are inherently reachable and collision-free. However, the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates are only true for the continuous parameters `(#o0, #o3, #o5)`, so I must provide values for them.
           
           Let's carefully re-evaluate what is available in the initial state to minimize movements and rely on proven configurations.
           
           Initial state:
           *   `atconf(v14, v15)` where `v15` is `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           *   `atconf(v12, v13)` where `v13` is `(1.0, -1.75)`
           
           **Re-evaluating #o3 (imagevisible):**
           The feedback indicates that `(-1.9, 0.5)` for `v14` to image `v17`/`v18` is not reachable. This is problematic because `v14` is at `(-1.0, -1.75)`, and `v17`/`v18` are at `y=2.0`. A large y-movement is required.
           However, the `imagevisible` predicates are given for `#o3` for both `v12` and `v14`. This implies *some* configuration exists for each rover to image both targets.
           If `v14` can't reach, maybe `v12` can, or perhaps the given `imagevisible` implies a very specific path is needed.
           Let's try to put `#o3` very close to the objects themselves, assuming the "not reachable" constraint is only for long distance moves, and a shorter, more "optimal" path exists.
           
           For `v14` (`-1.0, -1.75`), objectives `v17` (`-0.7, 2.0`), `v18` (`-1.9, 2.0`).
           Let's try `#o3` for `v14` at `(-1.0, 0.0)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = 1.75`. This is a relatively short move.
           From `(-1.0, 0.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.268^2 + 2.021^2) = sqrt(0.0718 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.1562) approx 2.03`. Still just outside 2.0 range.
           This is incredibly frustrating. The `imagerange` is so tight relative to the starting positions and objective locations, it's virtually impossible to find a single point within range of both and reachable. The system must have a specific intended `#o3` configuration. I will try to select a point on the boundary of the image range of one and hope it makes sense for the other.
           
           Let's assume the continuous planner should prioritize being in range over path length as long as the path is 'possible'. I will put `#o3` for `v14` directly at `(-1.0, 0.0)` and hope it is implicitly good enough. The small `0.03` over range could be rounding or a minor oversight in range calculation.
           
           **Re-evaluating #o5 (above):**
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           Obstacle `v19` is at `x=0`. So `x=0` is blocked. My previous `(0.0, -0.7)` was bad.
           We need an `#o5` for `v12` that is not on `x=0` and is reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           Let's try `(0.5, -1.0)` for `#o5` for `v12`. This is on the right side of `v19`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o5 = sqrt((1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-0.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.5625) = sqrt(0.8125) approx 0.9`. This is a very reachable move.
           This is `(0.5, -1.0)`. This configuration is not in collision with `v19` or `v20` (which is around `(0.7, -0.8)`).
           This configuration `(0.5, -1.0)` should be able to sample `v1` and `v5`. It is much closer to `v1` than to `v5`, but "above" might imply arm reach.
           
           **Re-evaluating #o0 (comvisible):**
           The previous `#o0` `(-0.5, -1.7)` was rejected as unreachable for both.
           `v9` (lander) is near `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
           `v12` is at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v14` is at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           The lander `v9` bounds are `x` from `-2.4` to `-1.39` and `y` from `-2.34` to `-1.65`.
           We need a point *not* in collision with `v9` and reachable.
           Let's choose `#o0` as `(-1.0, -1.0)`. I previously tried this and it seemed reasonable, but was eventually rejected for `unreachable`. This makes me think the "unreachable" is based on a very strict definition of the motion model.
           
           I am forced to provide values that *I calculate* to be reachable/collision-free/in-range, even if the system has rejected similar values before. This is because the problem explicitly states that a plan exists and requires me to find continuous values.
           
           Let's try `(-0.7, -1.5)` for `#o0`.
           For `v12` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.7, -1.5)`: `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.7))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(1.7^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(2.89 + 0.0625) = sqrt(2.9525) approx 1.71`. Reasonable.
           For `v14` `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-0.7, -1.5)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.7))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.1525) approx 0.39`. Very reachable.
           From `(-0.7, -1.5)` to `v9` `(-1.9, -2.0)`: `sqrt((-0.7 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.5 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(1.2^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.69) = 1.3`. Within range.
           This `#o0` looks okay.
           
           Given the extreme difficulty in finding working configurations, I will stick to the same general plan and provide what I calculate to be the best possible coordinates.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The constant rejections on reachability indicate a very constrained and non-Euclidean interpretation of robot motion, or very complex obstacles not explicitly described by AABBs. My current strategy of calculating plausible coordinates is failing because the underlying motion model is not simple distance. The only guaranteed "reachable" points are the initial `v13` and `v15` themselves, and any intermediate points explicitly given in `motion` predicates.
           
           Let's look at the `motion` predicates in the initial state. They include references to `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` in motions from `v13` or `v15` and back to themselves, or between these new configurations. This is critical.
           For example:
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`: `v12` can move from `v13` to `#o0`. This means `#o0` *must* be reachable from `v13`.
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`: `v12` can move from `v13` to `#o3`. `#o3` must be reachable.
           *   `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`: `v12` can move from `v13` to `#o5`. `#o5` must be reachable.
           And similarly for `v14` from `v15`.
           
           The fact that these motion predicates are given for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` implies that these configurations *are* indeed reachable from the respective rover's starting position. The `test-cfree-ray-conf-negative` in the `blocked` axiom and the general setup suggest that I should infer the *existence* of valid coordinates from the PDDL initial state rather than trying to compute them from scratch with insufficient knowledge of the underlying robot base. The system's rejections are effectively saying my *guessed coordinates* for these *existing* PDDL objects are incorrect.
           
           However, I am *required* to provide continuous values for `#<name>` configurations if they are used. The challenge is that I don't know the full motion model or the exact nature of implicit obstacles.
           
           I will try a different approach. Instead of calculating a "best guess" based on Euclidean distance and AABBs, I will place the configurations in the *general vicinity* of where they need to be, but with minimal deviation from each rover's starting position along one axis, hoping that the "reachable" property relies on this. This is a heuristic guess, given the geometric information has repeatedly led to failures.
           
           **For `v14` (images of `v17` and `v18`):**
           `v14` starts at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           Targets `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)` and `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           If `#o3` should be reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, perhaps it can only move a small distance in x, or y.
           Given `imagerange` is 2, and `v17/v18` are at `y=2.0`, the rover must get to `y>=0` approximately. This is a large y-motion.
           Let's make `#o3` for `v14` `(-1.0, 0.0)`. This should be "reachable" by moving only along Y axis from `v15` (assuming straight line motion is simple).
           Range check from `(-1.0, 0.0)`:
           To `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.268^2 + 2.021^2) = sqrt(0.0718 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.1562) approx 2.03`. Still barely out of range.
           This leads me to believe the problem is designed such that these image points *must* be within range and reachable. The coordinates I compute are not.
           What if `v12` is better for imaging?
           `v12` starts at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           Let `#o3` for `v12` be `(1.0, 0.0)`.
           To `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`: `sqrt((1.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(1.732^2 + 2.021^2) = sqrt(3.00 + 4.08) = sqrt(7.08) approx 2.66`. Too far.
           This is quite problematic. I will choose a `#o3` point that is likely to be reachable and in range, assuming some leeway. I'll stick with `(-1.0, 0.0)` for `v14` imaging. The `.03` difference could be insignificant in the actual calculation.
           
           **For `v12` (sampling `v1` and `v5`):**
           `v12` starts at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           Obstacle `v19` is at `x=0`. `v20` is `((0.651, -0.869), (0.782, -0.738))`.
           We need an `#o5` that avoids both.
           Let's try `#o5` for `v12` at `(1.5, -1.0)`.
           `Distance v12_v13_to_o5 = sqrt((1.0 - 1.5)^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (-0.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.5625) = sqrt(0.8125) approx 0.9`. Very reachable.
           ` (1.5, -1.0)` is clear of `v19` and `v20`. This should work.
           
           **For `comvisible` (`#o0` to `v9`):**
           `v9` is `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.39, -1.65))`.
           The previous `(-0.7, -1.5)` was rejected as unreachable.
           This means movements in `x` from `v12` `(1.0, -1.75)` to `x=-0.7` might be difficult.
           If `(-0.7, -1.5)` is unreachable from `v12`, then how about something closer to `v13`'s `x`?
           Let `#o0` be `(0.0, -1.7)`. This is at `x=0`, but `v19` is a thin wall. A rover might be able to position itself along the edge.
           However, `(0.0, -1.7)` is in collision with `v19`. I'm failing at geometry again.
           
           Let's try to infer from what we have. If `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` exists, then `#o0` must be reachable *and* collision-free for `v12`. I am failing to deduce such a coordinate.
           
           Since the system expects a numerical coordinate for these continuous parameters, I'm stuck in a loop of guessing and getting rejected. The problem states I *must* provide values. The only remaining strategy is to pick values that are *very* close to the rover's initial positions, assuming that any required "reachability" for `imagevisible` or `comvisible` means rotating in place or very small shifts, and that these parameters `(#o0, #o3, #o5)` are effectively "named poses" that the system already knows are correct.
           
           Let's choose these positions:
           *   `#o3` (for `v14` imaging): `(-1.0, 0.0)`
           *   `#o5` (for `v12` sampling): `(1.5, -1.0)`
           *   `#o0` (for communication): `(-1.5, -1.5)` (This is a point just outside the lander `v9` bounds and close to `v14`. Let's check `v12` to `(-1.5, -1.5)` from `(1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(2.5^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(6.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(6.3125) approx 2.5`. This is a long move for `v12`. But it is *inside* the x-range of `v9` and *within* the y-range too, so it's in collision with `v9`.)
           
           This is deeply problematic. The geometric information provided (AABBs) and the `imagerange`/`comrange` constraints seem at odds with the "reachable" and "collision-free" feedback given my simple interpretation.
           
           I will try again, trying to keep points away from obstacles and as close to the target objects as possible, prioritizing `comvisible` for `v14` (closer to `v9`) and `imagevisible` for `v14` (closer to `v17`/`v18`), and `above` for `v12` for `v1` (closer to `v12`).
           
           Final attempt with a revised strategy:
           **Rover Assignment:**
           *   `v14` handles all image and communication tasks (closer to `v17`, `v18`, `v9`).
           *   `v12` handles all sampling tasks (closer to `v1`).
           
           **`#o3` for `v14` (images of `v17`, `v18`):**
           `v14` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`, `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           Let `#o3` be `(-1.5, 0.0)`.
           Distance from `v14` start: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - 0.0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-1.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 3.0625) = sqrt(3.3125) approx 1.82`. Hope this is reachable.
           From `(-1.5, 0.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.732))^2 + (0.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.768)^2 + (-2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.5898 + 4.0844) = sqrt(4.6742) approx 2.16`. Out of range. This is the root cause of the image problem.
           There simply isn't a single point `(-1.x, 0.y)` reachable from `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` that is within 2 units of *both* `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)` and `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           
           This implies the PDDL initial state, particularly the `imagevisible` predicates, combined with the `imagerange` constraint, creates an impossible situation if interpreted geometrically as a single pose for `#o3`. However, the problem statement says "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is false." so these `imagevisible` predicates *must* be true.
           
           Since I am asked to provide a plan and configurations, I must assume a configuration exists even if I can't derive it based on simple geometry. I'll provide a configuration that is *within* range of `v18` and *as close as possible* to `v17` within that range, for `v14`. I'll pick `(-1.5, 1.0)`.
           From `(-1.5, 1.0)` to `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-0.732))^2 + (1.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-0.768)^2 + (-1.021)^2) = sqrt(0.5898 + 1.0424) = sqrt(1.6322) approx 1.27`. In range.
           From `(-1.5, 1.0)` to `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.931))^2 + (1.0 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.431^2 + (-1.049)^2) = sqrt(0.1857 + 1.1004) = sqrt(1.2861) approx 1.13`. In range.
           So `(-1.5, 1.0)` is good for range. Now for reachability from `v14` `(-1.0, -1.75)`:
           Distance: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.5))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 7.5625) = sqrt(7.8125) approx 2.79`. This is a long path. But it must be reachable.
           
           **`#o5` for `v12` (sampling `v1`, `v5`):**
           `v12` `(1.0, -1.75)`. `v1` `(2.0, -0.7)`, `v5` `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           Obstacle `v19` at `x=0`. `v20` `((0.651, -0.869), (0.782, -0.738))`.
           Let `#o5` be `(0.5, -1.5)`. This is clear of `v19` and `v20`.
           Distance from `v12` start: `sqrt((1.0 - 0.5)^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.5))^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + (-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.3125) approx 0.56`. Very reachable.
           
           **`#o0` for `v14` (communication to `v9`):**
           `v14` `(-1.0, -1.75)`. `v9` is `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.39, -1.65))`.
           Let `#o0` be `(-1.0, -1.0)`. This point is outside `v9`.
           Distance from `v14` start: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.75)^2) = 0.75`. Very reachable.
           Distance to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.0 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 1.0^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 1.0) = sqrt(1.81) approx 1.34`. In range.
           
           This set of configurations seems most geometrically plausible given the constraints, and prioritizes shortest moves.

Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The situation continues to be challenging due to persistent "not reachable" errors and new collision obstacles. The geometric understanding from the AABBs seems insufficient to satisfy the underlying constraints of the environment and robot.
           
           Let's break down the new feedback:
           
           1.  **`#o3 = (-1.5, 1.0)` for `v14` (imaging) is not reachable.**
               *   `v14` starts at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   `v17` is near `(-0.7, 2.0)`, `v18` is near `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
               *   The `y`-movement from -1.75 to 1.0 is still proving to be the main issue. It seems the rover cannot traverse such distances on the y-axis, or there are unstated obstacles. However, the `imagevisible` predicates are in the initial state, implying these are achievable.
               *   Given the image range of 2, and the targets at y=2.0, a y-coordinate for `#o3` around y=0.0 to y=1.0 is essential. If such points are unreachable, then the image task is impossible. This implies my interpretation of "reachable" from simple distance is wrong.
           
           2.  **`#o5 = (0.5, -1.5)` for `v12` (sampling) is in collision with `v21: AABB(lower=(0.494, -1.294), upper=(0.619, -1.169))`. Also not reachable for target `v5`.**
               *   `v12` starts at `v13` `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`, `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
               *   The obstacle `v21` is a small box around `(0.55, -1.2)`. My chosen `#o5 = (0.5, -1.5)` is too close to `v21` (lower y-bound is -1.29).
               *   Also, `(0.5, -1.5)` for `v12` to target `v5` `(-1.2, -1.3)` is not reachable. This indicates that moving `v12` from `x=1.0` to `x=0.5` is fine, but the target `v5` is at `x=-1.2`, which implies a movement across `x=0`, potentially crossing `v19`.
           
           3.  **`#o0 = (-1.0, -1.0)` for both `v12` and `v14` (communication) is not reachable.**
               *   `v9` (lander) is near `(-1.9, -2.0)`.
               *   `v12` `(1.0, -1.75)` and `v14` `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   The point `(-1.0, -1.0)` is a short move for `v14` and a longer but seemingly plausible move for `v12`. Its consistent rejection as "not reachable" implies a major restriction on pathfinding that is not explicitly described.
           
           **Revised Strategy:**
           
           Given the repeated failures with reachability, I must assume that the configurations defined for the *motion predicates* in the initial state are the *only* configurations that are considered reachable by the system.
           Let's list the relevant motion predicates again:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o0)`
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)`
           `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o5)`
           
           This means the values I provide for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *must* be the same for both `v12` and `v14` if I intend them to use the same named continuous parameter. This is consistent with how the `conf` predicates are used for `#o0, #o3, #o5` without specifying which rover.
           If the system provides `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`, then `v13` to `#o3` is reachable. And if `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` is true, then `#o3` must be a valid point for `v12` to see `v17`.
           
           My only option left is to use the initial `atconf` for the rovers directly in `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, if those options exist. But they don't; only `#o0, #o3, #o5` are used.
           
           This leads to a paradox: The initial state predicates imply that configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` exist and satisfy visibility/above constraints for specific rovers. However, every coordinate I've chosen for these parameters (even those that seem geometrically sound) has been rejected for reachability or collision.
           
           I will try to make minimal changes from the rover's initial positions, assuming that the "reachable" property is more about small localized adjustments.
           
           **New Attempt:**
           
           **`#o3` (imaging `v17`, `v18`):**
           Let's assign imaging to `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`).
           The issue is the `y`-coordinate for `v17`/`v18` is `2.0`. A point must be `y >= 0`.
           I need to put `#o3` at a location reachable from `(-1.0, -1.75)` and within range of `v17` and `v18`.
           Let's pick `#o3` to be `(-1.0, 0.0)`. Distance from `v14` is `1.75`. Still, this was rejected as unreachable before, and was out of range for targets.
           This configuration is problematic. I'm going to choose `#o3` for `v14` to be *very* close to `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           Let `#o3` be `(-1.9, 1.0)`.
           Distance from `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + (-2.75)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 7.5625) = sqrt(8.3725) approx 2.89`. This is a very long path. I'm forced to assume this is somehow reachable.
           From `(-1.9, 1.0)` to `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.732))^2 + (1.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt((-1.168)^2 + (-1.021)^2) = sqrt(1.364 + 1.042) = sqrt(2.406) approx 1.55`. In range.
           From `(-1.9, 1.0)` to `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`: `sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.931))^2 + (1.0 - 2.049)^2) = sqrt(0.031^2 + (-1.049)^2) = sqrt(0.000961 + 1.100) = sqrt(1.1009) approx 1.05`. In range.
           This `#o3` is geometrically sound for range.
           
           **`#o5` (sampling `v1`, `v5`):**
           Let's assign sampling to `v12` (at `(1.0, -1.75)`).
           `v1` is near `(2.0, -0.7)`. `v5` is near `(-1.2, -1.3)`.
           `v19` at `x=0`. `v20` around `(0.7, -0.8)`. `v21` around `(0.55, -1.2)`.
           My previous `#o5=(0.5, -1.5)` was in collision with `v21`. We need to avoid `x=0` (v19) and these two new small obstacles.
           Let's try `#o5` at `(1.0, -1.0)`.
           Distance from `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)`: `sqrt((1.0 - 1.0)^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.75)^2) = 0.75`. Very reachable.
           `(1.0, -1.0)` is clear of `v19`, `v20`, `v21`.
           This location is far from `v5` but relatively close to `v1`. This assumes a wide sampling range, or that `above` implies the robotic arm reaches.
           
           **`#o0` (communication to `v9`):**
           `v9` `((-2.4, -2.3), (-1.39, -1.65))`.
           The previous `(-1.0, -1.0)` was rejected as unreachable.
           Let's try `#o0` at `(-1.0, -1.7)`.
           Distance from `v14` at `(-1.0, -1.75)` is `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.7))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.05)^2) = 0.05`. Very reachable.
           Distance from `v12` at `(1.0, -1.75)` is `sqrt((1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.7))^2) = sqrt(2.0^2 + (-0.05)^2) = sqrt(4.0025) approx 2.0`. This should be reachable.
           From `(-1.0, -1.7)` to `v9`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.7 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.9^2 + 0.3^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.9) approx 0.95`. In range.
           This configuration `(-1.0, -1.7)` is outside `v9` (its y-max is -1.65). This looks like the most robust `#o0`.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continued "not reachable for robot base" errors for all proposed configurations strongly suggest that my interpretations of 'reachable' and the robot's motion capabilities are fundamentally misaligned with the problem's internal model. Given that the PDDL initial state explicitly contains predicates like `motion(v14, v15, #o2, #o3)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`, these facts *must* be true and satisfiable by *some* real-world coordinates for `#o3`. The challenge is providing the exact numerical coordinates for these continuous parameters.
           
           I am in a loop where any coordinate I provide, even if geometrically plausible and collision-free according to AABB, is rejected by the system's "reachable" check. This implies a very restrictive motion model or complex unstated obstacles. Since I am required to provide a solution, and the problem assumes one exists, I will make a final attempt by choosing values that are *as close as possible to the rover's initial positions* while still attempting to satisfy the other conditions (range, collision avoidance). This means the rover will be barely moving. This is a desperate attempt to satisfy the "reachable" condition, even if it compromises on range for `imagevisible` (hoping for very generous interpretation of `imagerange` if the path is short).
           
           **Final Strategy Attempt - Minimal Movement:**
           
           **`#o3` (imaging `v17`, `v18`):**
           Let's assign imaging to `v14` (at `v15` `(-1.0, -1.75)`).
           Targets `v17` `(-0.7, 2.0)`, `v18` `(-1.9, 2.0)`.
           The key is "reachable for robot base". The shortest move is no move.
           Let `#o3` be `(-1.0, -1.75)` (the same as `v15`).
           From `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (-1.75 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.268^2 + (-3.771)^2) = sqrt(0.0718 + 14.22) = sqrt(14.29) approx 3.78`. This is far outside the 2-unit image range.
           This confirms that not moving is not a solution for imaging.
           
           Since the system *insists* that `#o3` is reachable and allows `imagevisible` for it, the issue must be with my coordinates. I have no more information to deduce these coordinates. I will try to use a coordinate that is a very small step from the rover's initial position along one axis.
           
           Let `#o3` for `v14` be `(-1.0, -1.0)`.
           `Distance v14_v15_to_o3 = sqrt((-1.0 - (-1.0))^2 + (-1.75 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0^2 + (-0.75)^2) = 0.75`. This is a short, simple move. This should be reachable.
           From `(-1.0, -1.0)` to `v17`: `sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.732))^2 + (-1.0 - 2.021)^2) = sqrt(0.268^2 + (-3.021)^2) = sqrt(0.0718 + 9.126) = sqrt(9.1978) approx 3.03`. Still out of range.
           
           This suggests that for `imagevisible`, the `imagerange` is the most restrictive. The `y` coordinate for objectives is too high.
           At this point, I am unable to determine coordinates that satisfy *all* conditions (reachable, collision-free, in range) given the feedback. This is a core problem of having insufficient information about the robot's motion model and possibly the full environment. I cannot deduce correct coordinates under these circumstances.
           
           Given the instructions "If the goal is not achievable from the initial state, in which case you should not return any plan and simply explain why the goal is not achievable," I must conclude that with the available information and repeated failures, I cannot find coordinates that the system deems valid for the continuous parameters while satisfying all the hard constraints. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, which require being within range, are particularly difficult to satisfy concurrently with the "reachable" and "collision-free" constraints, especially for `#o3` due to the high `y` values of the objectives `v17` and `v18` from the low `y` starting positions of the rovers.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. These require `take_image` actions, which in turn require `imagevisible` at a configuration `#o3`. All attempts to find a reachable `#o3` for either rover within `imagerange` for `v17` and `v18` have failed. This suggests that the preconditions for `take_image` cannot be met under the system's hidden motion and collision model. Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the information provided.
           
           The goal is not achievable from the initial state because all attempts to identify valid coordinates for the continuous parameters #o0, #o3, and #o5 have failed. Specifically, for the image capture tasks, no configuration #o3 could be found that was simultaneously reachable by a rover and within the specified image range of 2 units for both objectives v17 and v18, which are located at a significantly higher y-coordinate than the rovers' starting positions. The system consistently reports configurations as "not reachable for robot base," even for moves that appear short and obstacle-free based on the provided AABB information. This indicates an underlying, unstated, and highly restrictive motion model for which I lack sufficient information to infer valid configurations. Without being able to satisfy the preconditions for 'take_image' or 'send_analysis' due to these continuous parameter issues, the overall goal cannot be reached.
