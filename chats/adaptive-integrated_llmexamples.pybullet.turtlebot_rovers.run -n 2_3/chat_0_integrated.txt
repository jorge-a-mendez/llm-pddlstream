           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem describes a scenario where two rovers, v12 and v14, need to achieve a goal that involves collecting images and analyzing rocks, then sending the information back to the lander v9. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is a complex axiom that requires several conditions to be met:
           1. Both rovers v12 and v14 must be at their respective configurations v13 and v15, which is already true.
           2. Both rovers must have a free storage unit v16. This is also true initially.
           3. Two images of v17 and v18 (objectives) must be received with mode v11.
           4. Two rocks, one of type v2 (stone) and one of type v6 (soil), must be analyzed.
           
           Let's break down the required steps to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:
           
           **Receiving images of v17 and v18:**
           - Rover v12 can take an image of v17 or v18 using camera v10 with mode v11 at configuration #o3.
           - Rover v14 can also take an image of v17 or v18 using camera v10 with mode v11 at configuration #o3.
           - To take an image, the camera needs to be calibrated.
           - After taking the image, the image needs to be sent to the lander v9 from a configuration where communication is visible (#o0) and the ray is not blocked.
           
           **Analyzing rocks:**
           - There are rocks of type v2 (v1, v3, v4) and type v6 (v5, v7, v8).
           - Each rover can sample a rock if it's above it at a specific configuration (#o5) and has a free storage unit.
           - After sampling, the analysis needs to be sent to the lander v9 from a configuration where communication is visible (#o0) and the ray is not blocked.
           
           Given the allowed action instances, there are no `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions available. Only `move` and `drop_rock` actions are allowed. Since the goal requires receiving images and analyzing rocks, and the necessary actions to perform these tasks are not allowed, the goal is not achievable.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move v12 v13 #o2 v13)
           (move v14 v15 #o2 v15)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous attempt failed because the plan did not achieve the final goal `new-axiom@0()`, which requires more than just moving the rovers. The critical issue is the severely limited set of allowed action instances. The problem statement explicitly lists only `move` and `drop_rock` actions, and only specific instances of these.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()`. It is a conjunction of several conditions:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: True initially.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: True initially.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: True initially.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: True initially.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This requires `send_image` which requires `haveimage` which requires `take_image` which requires `calibrated`. None of these actions are available.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Similar to above, requires unavailable actions.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type predicate, it just states that there is an object of type 'stone' which is 'v2'. This is true, e.g., `type(v1, v2)`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This requires `send_analysis` which requires `analyzed` which requires `sample_rock`. None of these actions are available.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: Similar to type predicate, true, e.g., `type(v5, v6)`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: Similar to above, requires unavailable actions.
           
           Since the actions `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` are *not* provided in the list of valid action instances, it is impossible to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the goal. The problem states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Therefore, the goal is unachievable with the given set of allowed actions.
