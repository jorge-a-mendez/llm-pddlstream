User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room defined by bounding boxes 0-4. There's a central vertical wall (5) that divides the room. Several smaller obstacles (6-20) are scattered throughout the room, mostly along the walls or in clusters. The target point is (1.5, -0.5). I need to find 25 robot base positions within a 4-unit radius of this point. The x and y coordinates of the robot must be within [-2.5, 2.5]. I will focus on finding positions on the right side of the central wall (x > 0) since the target is there, to avoid occlusions from the central wall. I'll distribute positions around the target, keeping in mind the obstacles.
