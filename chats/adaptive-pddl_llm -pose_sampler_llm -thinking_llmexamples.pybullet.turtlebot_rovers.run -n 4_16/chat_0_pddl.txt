           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal with several subgoals. The initial state provides the starting conditions. Most of the preconditions are trivially satisfied initially, but there are crucial goals I must achieve: I need to have received images for objects `v17, v18, v19, v20` and have received analysis for rocks of type `v2` and type `v6`.
           
           To tackle these, I've got to use my available actions: `move`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `calibrate`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. The preconditions for these actions dictate a specific sequence of steps.  
           
           My main problem is that the given `move` actions are too restrictive. I need to get rovers `v12` and `v14` to specific configurations for image acquisition and analysis. However, neither rover can change its configuration from its initial one (`v13` or `v15`, respectively) with the given `move` instances. The actions are: `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15` and it isn't possible to change `atconf`.
           
           This has serious consequences:
           
           *   **Image acquisition:** To take images, I need the rovers at specific image locations which are distinct from their current configuration. This is impossible given the restriction on the `move` actions.
           *   **Analysis:** Similar logic applies to analysis.  To get samples and send the analysis, the rovers have to move to new configurations.  This, too, is blocked.
           
           The PDDL instance requires the robots to be in certain configurations to achieve goals, but provides no actions to modify the configuration, so the goal is unachievable given the constraints.  The `new-axiom@0()` goal is impossible to reach.
