           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which I've unpacked as wanting an object of a certain type (`v17`) to be placed on a specific receptacle (`v18`).  Looking at the initial state, I see I have two candidates, `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`.  Currently, though, they're both *on* other objects, `v11` and `v14` respectively.  The trick, it seems, is getting *either* `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           The standard way to do this would be a classic pick-and-place operation. However, the action instances are extremely limited - I'm *only* allowed to perform `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This basically moves the robot's base (the first v3), without interacting with any object state directly. It can't pick up or place anything. It just changes the `atbconf` (at robot base configuration), and `canmove()` conditions. Given that, I know I'm stuck. No way to get `v8` or `v12` to that crucial pose, #o2, where they would have the right support.
           
           I keep reviewing the facts. The available poses `(#o2)` for both `v8` and `v12` support the goal, but they're not where these things actually *are*.  No dice. I can't change the `atpose` of objects, only the base, so `on(?green, v18)` is unachievable given this ridiculous constraint. It's frustratingly clear that with *this* set of allowed actions, the goal is simply out of reach. There are facts like `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` but `atpose(v8, #o2)` will never be true, because I lack the action to change poses and pick up objects. Therefore the goal can never be achieved. It's an interesting problem, but a dead end.
