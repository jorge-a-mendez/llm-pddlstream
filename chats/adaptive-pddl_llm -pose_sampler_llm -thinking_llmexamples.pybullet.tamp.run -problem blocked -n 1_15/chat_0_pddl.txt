(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I've got to place this object, which is roughly square (0.07 x 0.07), a cool 50 times, stable, on surface 0. Stability means it's totally inside the bounds of surface 0.
           
           Let's break it down. Surface 0 is basically a rectangle: it goes from (4.2, -0.6) to (4.8, 0.0). That gives me a width of 0.6 and a height of 0.6. This object's a bit small, just 0.07 x 0.07, so I have some wiggle room.
           
           I'm thinking, since it's practically a square, I don't need to rotate it (theta = 0 makes the math easy). This keeps the bounding box the same size (0.07 x 0.07), no matter what the rotation. So I can just shift it around on the surface. To be stable, I need the center (cx, cy) of the object to be far enough from the edges of the surface.
           
           To make this simple: Half of size is 0.035. That means, to stay stable, I need:
           cx inside [4.2 + 0.035, 4.8 - 0.035] or [4.235, 4.765]
           cy inside [-0.6 + 0.035, 0.0 - 0.035] or [-0.565, -0.035]
           
           The width of these cx values is 0.53 and the height of the cy values is also 0.53.
           
           I'm thinking a regular grid will work nicely. The object is pretty much square (0.07*0.07), so I don't need to consider rotation for stability, at least for this scenario. I can just keep it all straight.
           
           Let's start from the bottom-left corner of my valid zone (cx = 4.235, cy = -0.565). I can move up in cx and cy values with a step of 0.05. This means:
           
           I start with:
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565) - surface, theta, cx, cy
           
           I increment to each:
           
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.285, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.335, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.385, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.435, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.485, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.535, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.585, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.635, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.685, -0.565)
           *   (0, 0.0, 4.735, -0.565)
           
           And I go on the next cy values: -0.515, -0.465, ... -0.365. I'll need just enough of these rows to be sure that I have 50. I have exactly 50 after row of cy = -0.365
           
           It is 11 of the same. But with a bit of increment (0.05) and I need enough of them to be the final 50 stable placements. I will generate these and keep theta as 0.
           
           So, I will generate all (cx, cy) pairs using increment steps, with my cx values between [4.235, 4.765] and my cy values between [-0.565, -0.035]
           
           As I've mentioned before, it will be 50 pairs of them.
