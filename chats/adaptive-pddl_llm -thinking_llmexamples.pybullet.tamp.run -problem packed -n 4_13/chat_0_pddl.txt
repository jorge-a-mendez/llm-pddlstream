           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: An Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, here's what I've got. The goal is to get several objects – `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` – all *on* `v18`. Initially, they're all supported by `v11`.  My brain immediately jumps to using `pick` and `place` actions because that's what's needed to change the `on` relationships.
           
           I have these actions: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Clearly, `clean` and `cook` are irrelevant. To move an object from one location to another, I'll need `pick` and `place` actions, using the predicates to describe their preconditions.
           
           I can see how I'd do this: for each object, `pick` it up, move it to `v18`, and then `place` it. I can identify suitable poses for placement on `v18` by looking at the available kinematic data.  Specifically, I see that `#o2` is a candidate pose for placement.
           
           The problem, as I see it, is the very limited allowed action instances. The only action given to me is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. The task explicitly states that I can ONLY use action instances that are in the given list. If I can't build any `pick` or `place` instances, then I'm stuck. It's a non-starter.
           
           My understanding is that I cannot construct any `pick` or `place` actions because the problem statement explicitly excludes them by restricting me to a single `move_base` instance, and no specific `pick` or `place` instances are provided. No matter how clever I get, there's no way to manipulate those objects into place without the `pick` and `place` actions to modify the predicates.  I'm declaring the goal unreachable.
