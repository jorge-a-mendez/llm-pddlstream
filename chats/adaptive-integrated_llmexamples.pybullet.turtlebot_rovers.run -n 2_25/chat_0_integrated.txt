           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom defined as:
           
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom atconf(v12, v13)
               Atom atconf(v14, v15)

               Atom receivedanalysis(?stone)
               Atom type(?soil, v6)
               Atom receivedanalysis(?soil)
           ```
           
           Let's break down the goal conditions and see what needs to be achieved:
           
           1.  `atconf(v12, v13)`: The rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is already true in the initial state.
           2.  `atconf(v14, v15)`: The rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is already true in the initial state.
           3.  `free(v12, v16)`: The store `v16` on rover `v12` is free. This is already true in the initial state.
           4.  `free(v14, v16)`: The store `v16` on rover `v14` is free. This is already true in the initial state.
           5.  `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective `v17` (which is an objective of type `v2`) in mode `v11` has been received.
           6.  `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective `v18` (which is an objective of type `v2`) in mode `v11` has been received.
           7.  `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: A rock of type `v2` (stone) has been analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v2` are `v1`, `v3`, `v4`. We need to analyze and send analysis for at least one of them.
           8.  `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: A rock of type `v6` (soil) has been analyzed and the analysis received. The rocks of type `v6` are `v5`, `v7`, `v8`. We need to analyze and send analysis for at least one of them.
           
           Now let's examine the initial state again and the available actions to figure out how to achieve the pending goals.
           
           **Initial State Summary:**
           *   Rovers: `v12` (at `v13`), `v14` (at `v15`).
           *   Store: `v16` is free on both `v12` and `v14`.
           *   Camera: `v10` is on both rovers `v12` and `v14`, and supports mode `v11`.
           *   Lander: `v9`.
           *   Objectives: `v17` and `v18`.
           *   Rocks:
               *   Type `v2` (stone): `v1`, `v3`, `v4`.
               *   Type `v6` (soil): `v5`, `v7`, `v8`.
           *   Relevant predicates for achieving goals:
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`
               *   `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`
               *   `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`
               *   `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
               *   `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`
               *   `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`
               *   `above(v14, #o5, v8)`, `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`
           
           **Available Action Instances (given):**
           *   `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: This is a no-op movement for `v12`.
           *   `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: This is a no-op movement for `v14`.
           *   `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Drops a rock if `v12`'s store is full.
           *   `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Drops a rock if `v14`'s store is full.
           
           Notice that the provided action instances only include `move` and `drop_rock`. This means we cannot directly use `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` if there are no specific action instances provided for them. This is a critical constraint. If only the provided action instances are allowed, and none of them are `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, then the parts of the goal requiring `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` cannot be achieved.
           
           Let's re-read the problem statement carefully: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since the plan requires achieving `receivedimage` for two objectives and `receivedanalysis` for two types of rocks, and the provided list of allowed action instances does not contain `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given constraints.
           
           Therefore, the goal is not achievable.
           
           No plan will be returned because the goal is not achievable with the given set of allowed action instances. The required actions for `receivedimage` (take_image, calibrate, send_image) and `receivedanalysis` (sample_rock, send_analysis) are not present in the list of valid action instances.
