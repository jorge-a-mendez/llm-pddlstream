           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **The Robot's Path to Rearrangement**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I need to move four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`, which are currently all stacked on `v11`, onto `v18`. Each object starts at a different pose on `v11` (i.e., `v8` at `v9`, `v12` at `v13`, etc.) and must end up *on* `v18` at distinct poses that I have to specify.
           
           My approach is simple: pick up each object and place it on `v18`. This requires a `pick` and a `place` action for each object. Since my trusty robot arm, `v4`, can only hold one thing at a time, I'll have to repeat this sequence: pick one object, put it down, pick the next, repeat.
           
           The steps will be:
           
           1.  **Move the Base:** To prepare, I'll first execute `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`. This might not be necessary if the starting base configuration, `v3`, is suitable, but it's the safest way to ensure I'm in the correct position for the subsequent pick and place actions.
           2.  **Pick and Place for Each Object:**
               *   Pick `v8` from `v9` and place it on `v18` at a pose denoted by `#o2`.
               *   Pick `v12` from `v13` and place it on `v18` at a different pose (still using `#o2`).
               *   Pick `v14` from `v15` and place it on `v18` at another pose (still using `#o2`).
               *   Pick `v16` from `v17` and place it on `v18` at the final pose (still using `#o2`).
           
           This gives me the sequence: `pick`, `place`, `pick`, `place`, `pick`, `place`, `pick`, `place`.
           
           **The Continuous Poses**
           
           Now, here's where my expertise comes into play. I need to specify *continuous poses* on `v18` for each object. The problem statement says the following: *“Any object that starts with a ‘#’ represents a continuous parameter … If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with ‘#’) such that pose(obj, #<name>) is in the initial state for some obj, then you must provide a continuous value for the pose.”*  
           
           This applies to `#o2`. Each of the four objects must have a distinct pose value for `pose(obj, #o2)`. Furthermore, the poses should be collision-free and fully contain the objects.
           
           The surface `v18` is a square, centered at (0,0) and measuring 0.27m x 0.27m. To manage the placement, I'll divide it into four equal quadrants and place each object in a different quadrant. This strategy provides collision-free poses.
           
           **Positioning Strategy for Stability**
           
           To minimize the chances of an unstable placement, it’s important to center the objects on the table's surface. With each object assigned to a quadrant of `v18`, here are the detailed coordinates:
           
           *   Object `v8` will go to (0.0675, 0.0675, 0.781, 0.0).
           *   Object `v12` will go to (-0.0675, 0.0675, 0.781, 0.0).
           *   Object `v14` will go to (-0.0675, -0.0675, 0.781, 0.0).
           *   Object `v16` will go to (0.0675, -0.0675, 0.781, 0.0).
           
           In this placement, the `z` coordinate is at 0.781, indicating the height to place the objects on the surface relative to its origin. The angle theta = 0 represents no rotation from its current orientation in these placements.
           
           **Summary**
           
           In conclusion, the robot will start with `move_base`, pick and place each object on the designated pose locations on `v18`, and finish the task.

           This applies to `#o2`. Each of the four objects must have a distinct pose value for `pose(obj, #o2)`. Furthermore, the poses should be collision-free and fully contain the objects.
