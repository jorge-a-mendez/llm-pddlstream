           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis and Conclusion on the Unreachability of `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with planning a solution to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain. This looks like a complex problem involving taking and sending images, analyzing samples, and then reporting those analyses. But after diving into the problem, I'm finding this to be impossible.
           
           Here's the situation: The initial state has two rovers, v12 and v14, each at fixed configurations (v13 and v15, respectively). Their possible movements are restricted to no-op moves (staying put). To meet the goal, I need to receive images of two objects and receive analyses of a stone and a soil sample. However, key actions like `take_image` and `sample_rock` require the rovers to be at configurations (represented by variables with a `#` prefix) where image visibility or objects are above the rover. In addition, images need to be communicated using actions that also need the rover to be at a specific configuration, while being able to communicate with the lander.
           
           The problem? These "special" configurations (like #o3 for images and #o5 for sample gathering) are not the starting positions (v13/v15). Since the rovers can't move, it's impossible to satisfy the preconditions for the necessary actions. The current facts in the initial state like `imagevisible(v12, #o3,...)` and `above(v12, #o5,...)` mean "If v12 is at the *continuous* configuration `#o3`, then these things are possible." They do *not* mean the rovers are already there, and importantly, there is no valid way for the rovers to *get* to these positions because they're stuck in their starting locations. And since there's no way to reach such poses, receiving images or analyses is therefore not possible.
           
           Thus, based on the rigid constraints of the `move` actions and the lack of other movement options, and the specific initial state conditions, the goal `new-axiom@0()` is *unachievable*.
