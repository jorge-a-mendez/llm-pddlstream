           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

(Thoughts: **A Strategic Plan to Achieve the Axiom: new-axiom@0()**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to make `new-axiom@0()` true. It boils down to getting two images and two analyses. I'll break it down step by step:
           
           1.  **Setting up the Rovers:**  We've got two rovers, `v12` and `v14`. I see that `v12` and `v14` are at specific configurations, so let's keep them in those configurations for now. Also, I'll need to make sure the cameras and the communication system are up to par.
           
           2.  **Capturing the Images:** The goal here is `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. I'll use rover `v14` for both because it has the right camera and communication link to the lander `v9`.
           
               *   **Image v17:**
                   *   First, I move `v14` to a new configuration close to the objective (`#q2`). I'll position it near the object to get a clear shot.
                   *   Then, calibrate the camera `v10` on `v14` and take the image of `v17`.
                   *   After capturing the image, I send the image of `v17` to the lander.
               *   **Image v18:**
                   *   I'll repeat the process of calibrating `v10` and taking the image of `v18`.
                   *   Since rover is at  `#q3` it has a view of `v18`.
                   *   Move back to `#q4`, and send the image.
           
           3.  **Analyzing the Rocks:** Next, I'll analyze some rocks to satisfy `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`.
           
               *   I see a stone and a soil nearby.  I'll position `v12` and move it next to `v3` and sample it. `full(v12, v16)` becomes true after it has sampled the stone. Then move it next to `#q0` where I can send this sampled analysis to the lander. Then I'll drop the stone.
           
               *   For the soil sample, I'll move `v12` next to `v8` (a sample of soil) and then I'll sample it. `full(v12, v16)` will be set again.
                   Then I'll move it back to `#q0` where it can analyze and send it back to the lander.
                   I will then drop the sample and return back to initial configuration.
           
           4.  **Final Touches:** Make sure the rovers and the communication system are in their configurations from the start.
           
           **Important Details:**
           Since I'm an expert, I'm going to determine a precise plan where the rovers are to be located.
           *   Let's set `#q2` to `(0.306, 0.499)`
           *   Let's set `#q3` to `(-0.455, 0.5885)`
           *   Let's set `#q0` and `#q4` to `(1.0, -1.75)` and `(-1.0, -1.75)`
           
           This detailed and specific plan will ensure that the given axioms are fulfilled.

User:      Configuration #q2 = (0.306 0.499) for rover v14 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #q3 = (-0.455 0.5885) for rover v14 at target v18 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #q4 = (-1.0 -1.75) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #q5 = (-0.68 -0.22) for rover v12 at target v8 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Okay, so I'm revisiting this plan because some configurations the user pointed out were deemed unreachable. The core of the issue seems to be finding valid *continuous* values (coordinates) for the configurations represented by the symbols `#q2`, `#q3`, `#q4`, and `#q5`.  I need to re-evaluate the reachability for those, specifically considering rover v14's initial position (`v15: (-1.0, -1.75)`) and rover v12's initial position (`v13: (1.0, -1.75)`) . The user mentioned the maximum visibility distances:  `imagevisible` is 2, and `comvisible` is 4.
           
           **Rover v14 (Image-Focused)**
           
           1.  **Imaging v17 (center: (0.306, 1.999))**
               *   Previously problematic, the main concern here is distance.
               *   I need to be within 2 units of v17 to image it.  My initial thought was to use (-0.5, 0.5) for the coordinate for  rover v14. The problem statement says `motion` facts exists, implying there is path,  but still there was an error. Now I will assign  `#q2` to `(0.306, 0.0)`. The logic is to keep it *very* close to the target of imaging, just a bit offset on X axis,  which is the *minimum* move to the image target.
               *   Distance from `v15`  `(-1.0, -1.75)` to the new `#q2 (0.306, 0.0)` is `2.18`.  
               *   Distance from `#q2` to `v17 (0.306, 1.999)` is `1.99`. This is fine. The key is now for me is distance, and to be close to where the target is in the vision range.
           
           2.  **Imaging v18 (center: (-0.455, 2.0885))**
               *   The strategy remains: keep the new pose close to the image target.  
               *   I'll assign  `#q3` to `(-0.455, 0.1)`.   Distance to the image target is 1.988, distance from `#q3`  to  v15 is about 1.92. This is again close to the target, again minimizing distance.
           
           3.  **Communication with v9 (center: (-1.9, -2.0))**
               *   The previous approach seemed okay. Since the `comvisible` range is 4, I'm going to assign the current value `(-1.0, -1.75)` for #q4, which is the starting position of rover v14. That way I minimize extra movement.
           
           **Rover v12 (Sampling-Focused)**
           
           1.  **Above v3 (center: (1.3165, -2.1245))**
               *   Distance is very small, so this should not be a problem. To be *directly above* the location of `v3`, the robot must be at that location. 
               *   Distance from `v13 (1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.3165, -2.1245)`: is a very short movement. I keep `#o5` at `(1.3165, -2.1245)`.
           
           2.  **Communication with v9 (center: (-1.9, -2.0))**
               *   Distance is okay. The communication is from the current position `(1.0, -1.75)` which is  a valid starting location.   
               *   I will reuse the initial position which is ok within the communication range.   I'll assign this position to the parameter `#q0`.
           
           3.  **Above v8 (center: (-0.6855, -0.2235))**
               *   This might have been a source of the previous error. Now I need to choose an above position, as close to the top of the range.
               *   I still can use the same location `(-0.6855, -0.2235)` for the parameter `#q5`.  Distance of the motion between `#q5` and `v13` seems reasonable.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachability and Configuration Assignments**
           
           I'm seeing a pattern with these "not reachable" errors, and I need to figure out what's going wrong. It seems the system isn't happy with the continuous values I'm assigning to the configurations, specifically, those related to reaching the imaging and communication targets. The plan specifies target positions, and it gives me a set of *motion* primitives to allow moving between configurations, so I've calculated the Euclidean distances and line-of-sight checks, ensuring that they respect the problem's visibility and communication constraints (e.g., within 2 units for image, within 4 for comms).
           
           At first, I assumed that "reachable" had a strict distance limit (maybe around 2 units), which created a conflict, because given the distance from the initial position of v14 to the image targets v17 and v18, a direct line was not working. This is where I start thinking about the implications.
           
           However, the problem statement says "you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that... reachable from the rover's current configuration". If I had provided a location where the rover was to be at the destination, but it's not reachable. Well, the system *must* have a value defined, or else this would have been a contradictory set of predicates. Also, I'm interpreting "reachable" as the straight-line distance, but it could mean something more.
           
           The available `motion` predicates seem to suggest "reachable" is *implicitly* defined by them. If *motion* exists between any two configurations, then that means the robot *can* reach that configuration. This means I'm supposed to find any collision-free coordinates that can ensure that image/communication conditions are met and that it's reachable according to *that definition.*. I need to trust the system’s initial state as the solution’s foundation.
           
           I re-examined the initial `atconf` positions for v14 and v12 and target locations like v17, v18, v9, v3, and v8, and re-estimated potential destinations based on the available `motion` actions: It appears that all target assignments will be in a location close enough to satisfy the conditions.
           
           For v14, for instance, starting from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, I had to consider, for instance, what `#q2` means, and how to define a location close enough that image `v17` can be taken. The distance is a problem. The instructions and available actions lead me to set `#q2` to be `(0.3, 0.5)`. After that, `#q3` had to be at `(-0.45, 0.6)`. The final location, for #q4, was set for communication at `(-0.9, -1.7)`. For v12, similar steps were taken. These configurations should be reachable within the given system definition.
           
           I'm now confident that I can specify `(x, y)` coordinate values for the unknown `#q` destinations, and the key is to ensure they are consistent with the "reachable" relationship encoded within the defined *motion* actions. By assuming that "reachable" means *reachable by a motion defined in the state*.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking Reachability and Collision Avoidance**
           
           Okay, so we're hitting "not reachable" errors and a collision error for this new plan. It's time to re-evaluate what's going wrong. My primary concern is those reachability issues. The core plan requires Rover v14 to image two locations and then communicate, while Rover v12 needs to analyze two samples and communicate. The "not reachable" errors are likely due to either straight-line distances or some internal constraints on the rovers' movements that I'm not privy to.
           
           I'm interpreting the "continuous parameter" aspect as just requiring me to provide a valid coordinate, not necessarily that the solver will *use* a continuous path. The collision error with `#q5` (Rover v12) along the Y-axis indicates that specific configurations along the path may be invalid.
           
           **Previous Failed Attempts and New Strategies**
           
           Before, I was positioning Rovers v14 and v12 far from their origin points to satisfy the goals. I'm going to adopt a different approach: minimizing the required moves, to stay as close as possible to the Rovers' initial starting positions while satisfying the key predicates.
           *   For **Rover v14**, starting from `(-1.0, -1.75)`, I'll try these for the continuous parameters:
               *   `#q2`: `(0.3, 0.1)` (imaging objective at (0.306, 1.999), 1.899 distance within range.)
               *   `#q3`: `(-0.45, 0.2)` (imaging objective at (-0.455, 2.0885), 1.8885 distance)
               *   `#q4`: `(-1.001, -1.751)` (Communication with v9. Distance 0.93)
           *   For **Rover v12**, also starting from initial positions:
               *   `#o5`: `(1.3, -2.1)` (Sample location. Distance from origin to sample 0.46)
               *   `#q0`: `(1.001, -1.751)` (Communication, close.)
               *   `#q5`: `(-0.7, -0.2)` (Sample. Close to initial pose and within -0.05, 0.05)
            
           I'm betting the solver has some kinematic restrictions in the motion planner that are making those "long" moves difficult. The coordinate selection should be collision-free. I am keeping in mind that the y-axis constraint indicates that any intermediate x values should be outside of a range to avoid collision with v19.
           
           **Collision Checking and Goal Verification**
           
           I've carefully checked all new configurations to ensure they don't collide with the static barrier.  
           
           The plan remains valid, and with the changes I've made, and am hoping they pass the reachability tests. I've re-assured myself that the final state achieves the goal predicates: configuration, communication, and analysis.
