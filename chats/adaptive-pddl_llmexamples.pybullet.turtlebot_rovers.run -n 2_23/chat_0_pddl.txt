           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and a lander `v9`. Both rovers are equipped with a camera `v10` and can store samples in `v16`. There are several rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`). The rovers are currently at `v13` and `v15` respectively, and both have access to the store `v16`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be broken down into:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. (Initially true)
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. (Initially true)
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`. (Initially true)
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`. (Initially true)
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: An image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: An image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists a stone object of type `v2`.
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a stone object has been received.
           9. `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists a soil object of type `v6`.
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of a soil object has been received.
           
           Let's break down how to achieve the remaining parts of the goal.
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - A rover needs to take an image of `v17` and `v18` using camera `v10` in mode `v11`.
           - The camera needs to be calibrated.
           - The image needs to be sent to the lander `v9`.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`:
           - A rover needs to sample a rock of type `v2` (stone) and a rock of type `v6` (soil).
           - The samples need to be analyzed.
           - The analysis needs to be sent to the lander `v9`.
           
           Looking at the available actions:
           - `move` actions are possible for both rovers, but their current configurations are already satisfying the `atconf` parts of the goal. These actions do not seem necessary to fulfill the goal.
           - `drop_rock` actions are available, but not useful as both rovers already have a free store `v16`.
           
           There are no available `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis` actions in the provided list. This means the rovers cannot take images, calibrate, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses.
           
           Therefore, the goals `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(?stone)`, and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` cannot be achieved with the given available actions. The goal is unreachable.
