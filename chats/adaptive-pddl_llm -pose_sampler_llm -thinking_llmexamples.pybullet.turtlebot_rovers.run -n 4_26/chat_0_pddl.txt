           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My analysis indicates that the plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` is currently infeasible. The goal requires several conditions to be met, including the acquisition of images (`receivedimage`) and the transmission of analysis (`receivedanalysis`). However, the available actions and initial state severely restrict the rovers' mobility.
           
           Specifically, the rovers are limited to "moving" within their current configurations (effectively no-ops) and dropping rocks into the store, none of which achieve the necessary `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` conditions. The actions required to achieve these, such as `take_image`, `send_image`, and `send_analysis`, necessitate the rovers to be at specific configurations (e.g., `#o3` for imaging, `#o0` for communication). Unfortunately, the available `move` actions do not allow the rovers to reach these configurations.
           
           Therefore, given the current constraints, it's impossible to satisfy the goal. The actions needed to complete image capture, image transmission, and soil analysis transmission are unreachable due to the rigid movement capabilities of the rovers. Moreover, even to sample rock, requires movement. Because there is no way to perform those actions, the goal is unachievable, unless the initial state changes or the available move actions are changed to allow a greater degree of movement.
