           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.309, 0.517, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.008, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.344, 0.481), (-4.273, 0.552)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my thought process:**
           
           I need to create a plan to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which means I need to make `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` true. I know from the initial state that `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true. Since I don't have constraints on which object to use, I'll pick `v12` as `?green`. My sub-goal is therefore to place `v12` on `v18` (`on(v12, v18)`).
           
           The axiom `on(?o, ?r)` tells me that to achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I need `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`. I see that `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is already in the initial state, so my immediate sub-goal is `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at `v13` (`atpose(v12, v13)`). Thus, I need to pick `v12` up from `v13` and place it at `#o2` on `v18`. This gives me the following plan:
           
           1.  **Move the base:** `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)` to a base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick:** `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (pick up `v12` with arm `v4` from pose `v13`).
           3.  **Place:** `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` (place `v12` at pose `#o2` on surface `v18`).
           
           I need to verify the preconditions for each action. The key precondition for the `pick` and `place` actions is `atbconf(#o3)`. Since `atbconf(v3)` is true initially, I *must* move the base to `#o3` first. All available `kin` predicates (which describe the robot's arm reachability) depend on the base being at `#o3`. This means that to pick and place, I *must* use the *same* base configuration `#o3`.
           
           After `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`, `atbconf(#o3)` becomes true. Then, `pick` is feasible because its other preconditions are also met. After the `pick` action, the object is grasped and `atpose(v12, v13)` becomes false. Then, the `place` action can be performed since its preconditions are now met, and the object is now at `#o2`.
           
           Once `v12` is placed at `#o2`, I will have achieved `on(v12, v18)`, and since `type(v12, v17)` is true, I have achieved the goal `new-axiom@0()`.
           
           The continuous values I need to consider are:
           *   `#o2`: The pose of `v12` on `v18`. I'll place it at the center: x = 4.5, y = -0.3, z = 0.801 (from initial pose), theta = 0.0.
           *   `#o3`: The base configuration used for both `pick` and `place` actions. However, I am not required to provide this value since it is defined in the `kin` predicates, not as a `pose`.
           *   `#o0`: The base trajectory for moving the base.
           *   `#o4`: The arm trajectory for the pick and place actions.
           *   `#o1`: The grasp configuration.
           
           The total cost will be `distance(v3, #o3) + pickcost() + placecost()`.
           
           **Important Note**: The `kin` predicates force the use of the *same* base configuration `#o3` for both pick and place, which is geometrically unlikely in a real-world scenario where the pickup point (v13) and placement point (#o2) are quite far. However, I am constrained by the given facts and must assume that a solution exists given the `kin` facts.
