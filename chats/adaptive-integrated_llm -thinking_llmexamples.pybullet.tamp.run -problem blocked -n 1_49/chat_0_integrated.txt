User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object

           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.309, 0.517, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.008, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.344, 0.481), (-4.273, 0.552)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom atbconf(v3)

           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Unreachable Goal**
           
           I'm faced with a problem that requires me to manipulate objects in a scene. My objective is to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0`, which boils down to placing an object of type `v17` onto `v18`. I see two potential candidates, `v12` and `v8`, both of which are of the correct type.  To achieve this, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           However, the key constraint here is that the robot's base can't move. The only allowed `move_base` action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`, which essentially does nothing as it keeps the robot at its initial base configuration, `v3`.
           
           The objects I need to move (`v12`, `v8`, and the target surface `v18`) are all too far away from the robot's fixed base.  Given the limited reach of a typical robot arm, I cannot feasibly pick up either object and place it on `v18` without moving the base to a nearby configuration.  The continuous parameter `q` in the `kin` predicate for any pick or place action must be `v3`, which is out of reach.
           
           Because the robot base cannot move, I'm unable to satisfy the geometric constraints for the `pick` and `place` actions and therefore cannot achieve the goal. Thus, the goal is unreachable given the current setup and the restricted set of actions.
