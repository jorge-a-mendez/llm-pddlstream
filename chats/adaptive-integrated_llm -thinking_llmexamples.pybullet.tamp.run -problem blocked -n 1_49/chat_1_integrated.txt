User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.309, 0.517, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.008, 1.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.344, 0.481), (-4.273, 0.552)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Infeasibility of the Plan**
           
           My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0`, which boils down to getting an object of type `v17` onto surface `v18`.  Initially, I see three objects (`v12`, `v8`, `v15`) that fit the type requirement.  To get an object `?green` *on* `v18`, it needs to be both *supported* by `v18` and in the correct pose (*atpose*).
           
           Looking at the initial state and available facts, I find that both `v8` and `v12` *can* be supported by `v18`. So, it looks like I could place either one on `v18`. I choose to go with `v8` for now. `v8` is currently *atpose* `v9`.
           
           To move `v8` onto `v18`, I would need to *pick* it up from `v9` and then *place* it on `v18` at a new pose, let's call it `#o2`. I analyze the preconditions for *pick* and *place*: I need robot `v4` and I can ignore the kinematics constraints for the moment. There is no `handempty` issue. The object `v8` is `atpose`.  Then, there's `unsafeapproach` that needs to be *false*, meaning no collision.  I check for other *atpose* objects, and it looks like it is safe. `unsafeatraj` has to be false as well.
           
           Similar checks apply to *place*. I look at `unsafepose` and `unsafeapproach`. It turns out that I can place `v8` on a reasonable pose on `v18`. This pose must be away from other objects. And I see that it is not dangerous to approach this new pose.
           
           So, *pick* and *place* look feasible. However, this is where the problem hits me like a brick: I re-read the crucial constraint. I am only allowed to use action instances from the provided list, and this list only contains `move_base`. **There are no `pick` or `place` instances!**
           
           This means I can't move anything; I'm stuck with the initial state! The only valid action, `move_base`, doesn't change object positions. The `on` predicate needs *both* `supported` and *`atpose`*.
           
           I go back and check the `supported` relationships:  `v18` supports `v8` and `v12`, but `v8` and `v12` are *atpose* elsewhere in the initial state. Since I can't move them, the *`atpose`* portion of the `on` predicate is permanently unmet.  Therefore, I cannot satisfy the goal of having an object *on* `v18`, given the limited actions.  I conclude the goal is unreachable.
