           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Task at Hand: A Plan for Object Manipulation**
           
           My goal is to devise a plan to move four objects, specifically v8, v12, v14, and v16, from their current location on surface v11 to a new surface, v18. The robot I'm working with has two arms, with arm v4 being the controllable one. My plan needs to leverage this arm and the robot's current base configuration, v3.
           
           To achieve this, I'll break down the problem into a series of steps: picking each object from v11, and placing them on v18, each at a specified pose. The initial state provides crucial information, including the objects' current positions and the robot's capabilities. Each object currently resides on v11, with the necessary preconditions for successful pick and place actions already established (e.g., graspability, supported poses).
           
           The "move_base" action, which moves the base of the robot to a new configuration, is also central to this plan. The actions require the robot to move from its initial base configuration, v3, to base configuration #o3. I will make sure the base configuration is set up properly for object manipulation. Then each of the pick/place actions can be done.
           
           I need to be very careful to coordinate the placement of each object to avoid any collisions. Since I'm expected to provide distinct poses for the objects when placed on v18, I will carefully calculate the coordinates for each objects' position. I'll make sure to place each object within the boundaries of v18, ensuring a collision-free configuration by dividing the surface into four quadrants.
           
           The plan will include:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** Moving the robot's base from v3 to the needed base configuration for picking/placing actions (#o3).
           2.  **Pick v8:**
               *   Grabbing v8 from v11 and setting up for placement.
           3.  **Place v8:** Placing v8 onto v18 at the specific pose (#o2).
           4.  **Pick v12:**
               *   Grabbing v12 from v11 and setting up for placement.
           5.  **Place v12:** Placing v12 onto v18 at the specific pose (#o2).
           6.  **Pick v14:**
               *   Grabbing v14 from v11 and setting up for placement.
           7.  **Place v14:** Placing v14 onto v18 at the specific pose (#o2).
           8.  **Pick v16:**
               *   Grabbing v16 from v11 and setting up for placement.
           9.  **Place v16:** Placing v16 onto v18 at the specific pose (#o2).
           
           The core assumption is that actions (picking and placing) will be successful.
