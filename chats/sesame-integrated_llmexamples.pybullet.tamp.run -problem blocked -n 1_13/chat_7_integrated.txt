           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains two graspable objects, `v12` and `v15`, located at `v13` and `v16` respectively. The robot has two arms, `v4` and `v6`, both currently empty. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which, according to the axioms, is true if `on(green, v18)` and `type(green, v17)` are true. However, there are no objects named `green` in the scene. Looking at the alternative definition of `new-axiom@0(?o)`, it refers to an object `o` that is not the culprit and is graspable. This definition seems more relevant given the problem statement. The task is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which implies satisfying `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Since `green` is not in the object list, and no other object has the type `v17` and is on `v18` in the initial state, the immediate goal from the PDDL definition `new-axiom@1()` is not achievable. However, the problem statement provides `Axiom new-axiom@0()` as `Conjunction Atom on(?green, v18) Atom type(?green, v17)`. It's possible the `new-axiom@0` is meant to be the one without arguments. Given that no object named `green` is defined, and there are no other axioms that involve `new-axiom@0()` (without arguments), I'll consider the task as trying to place a graspable object `v12` or `v15` on `v18`. Object `v12` has type `v17`, so if `v12` is placed on `v18`, the goal `on(v12, v18)` and `type(v12, v17)` will satisfy the axiom.
           
           Object `v12` is currently at `v13`, supported by `v14`. Object `v15` is at `v16`, supported by `v11`. We want to place `v12` on `v18`. `v18` is a surface. We need to find a `pose` for `v12` on `v18`. The initial state includes `pose(v12, #o2)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. So, the plan would involve picking `v12` from `v13` and placing it at `#o2` on `v18`.
           
           The `kin` predicates indicate that `v4` (the arm) can be used to pick `v12` from `v13` with `grasp #o1` at base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4`. It can also place `v12` at `#o2` with the same grasp, base configuration, and arm trajectory.
           
           The plan will be:
           1. `move_base` to `#o3` (the base configuration needed for pick/place).
           2. `pick` `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           3. `place` `v12` at `#o2` on `v18` using arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, base config `#o3`, and arm trajectory `#o4`.
           
           Since `v3` is the current base configuration, and the `pick` and `place` actions require the robot to be at `#o3`, we need to move the base from `v3` to `#o3`. Then, we perform the pick and place actions. Finally, if needed for the cost, we could move back to `v3`, but the goal is achieved after placing. The given `basemotion` for `move_base v3 #o3 #o0` is allowed. The cost function for `move_base` is `distance(q1, q2)`. If `q1` and `q2` are the same, distance is 0. If they are different, it's non-zero. Since `v3` and `#o3` could be different, we should use `move_base v3 #o3 #o0`. Then after the pick and place, the base is at `#o3`.
