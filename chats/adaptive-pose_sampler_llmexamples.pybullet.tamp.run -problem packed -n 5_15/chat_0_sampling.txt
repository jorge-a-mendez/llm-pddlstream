           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single square surface centered at the origin, with extents from -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y directions. The object is also square, with side length 0.09847194372735413.
           
           To find stable placements, I will consider placing the object on surface 0. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) will not affect its bounding box, so I can try different angles, but it will effectively cover the same area regardless of rotation when considering an AABB placement. However, it's good practice to try different angles.
           
           The object's half-extents are approximately 0.0492.
           The surface's half-extents are 0.135.
           
           For the object to be fully contained within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0492 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0492
           -0.0858 <= x <= 0.0858
           
           -0.135 + 0.0492 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0492
           -0.0858 <= y <= 0.0858
           
           I will generate placements that vary both the position (x, y) and the orientation (theta) within these bounds. Since the object is square, rotating it by 90 degrees (pi/2) or 180 degrees (pi) will result in the same effective bounding box. I will try a few different angles like 0, pi/4, pi/2.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) on surface 0. This placement is stable and did not collide with any fixed obstacles.
           
           Now I need to place object 5. The new object is also square, with side length 0.09705215260176919. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0485.
           
           The surface's half-extents are 0.135.
           
           For object 5 to be fully contained within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0485 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0485
           -0.0865 <= x <= 0.0865
           
           -0.135 + 0.0485 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0485
           -0.0865 <= y <= 0.0865
           
           Additionally, object 5 must not collide with object 7. Object 7 is located at (0, 0, 0, 0) and has a side length of 0.09847194372735413 (half-extent 0.0492). This means object 7 occupies the region from approximately (-0.0492, -0.0492) to (0.0492, 0.0492).
           
           Therefore, I need to find placements for object 5 such that its bounding box does not overlap with the bounding box of object 7.
           The x-range of object 7 is [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           The y-range of object 7 is [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           
           So, for object 5 (half-extent 0.0485):
           If x-center for object 5 is positive, x > 0.0492 + 0.0485 = 0.0977
           If x-center for object 5 is negative, x < -(0.0492 + 0.0485) = -0.0977
           This is outside the valid range of -0.0865 to 0.0865.
           
           This means that object 5 cannot be placed purely to the left or right of object 7 without violating the surface boundaries. The same applies to placing it purely above or below.
           It implies that the only possible placements for object 5 are on the edges or corners of the surface, as close to the boundaries as possible, avoiding the central area occupied by object 7.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the maximum possible x/y for object 5: 0.0865.
           The minimum possible x/y for object 5: -0.0865.
           
           If object 5 is placed at (0.0865, 0), its x-range will be [0.0865 - 0.0485, 0.0865 + 0.0485] = [0.038, 0.135].
           This would still overlap with the x-range of object 7 if object 7 is at (0,0).
           Let's check the collision properly.
           Object 7: x-range [-0.0492, 0.0492], y-range [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           Object 5 (at (x,y), half-extent 0.0485): x-range [x-0.0485, x+0.0485], y-range [y-0.0485, y+0.0485].
           
           For no collision:
           (x + 0.0485 < -0.0492) OR (x - 0.0485 > 0.0492) OR
           (y + 0.0485 < -0.0492) OR (y - 0.0485 > 0.0492)
           
           So:
           x < -0.0492 - 0.0485 = -0.0977
           OR x > 0.0492 + 0.0485 = 0.0977
           OR y < -0.0977
           OR y > 0.0977
           
           However, the allowed range for x and y for object 5 is [-0.0865, 0.0865].
           This means it is impossible to place object 5 such that its x-range *does not overlap* or its y-range *does not overlap* with object 7.
           This implies that given the size of the objects and the surface, there might be no placement for object 5 without collision with object 7 if object 7 is at the center.
           
           Let me re-check the problem statement: "If you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." This is a new object (ID 5), not a repeated request for object 7.
           
           The instruction "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j" implies that I must consider object 7 as a *fixed obstacle* for object 5, even if it was not explicitly provided as such.
           
           Given the constraints:
           Max x/y for object 5: 0.0865
           Min x/y for object 5: -0.0865
           Object 7 (centered at 0,0) occupies x in [-0.0492, 0.0492] and y in [-0.0492, 0.0492].
           To avoid collision, the bounding boxes must not overlap.
           This means:
           (x_5_max < x_7_min) OR (x_5_min > x_7_max) OR (y_5_max < y_7_min) OR (y_5_min > y_7_max)
           
           Let's plug in the numbers:
           x_5_max = x + 0.0485
           x_5_min = x - 0.0485
           x_7_min = -0.0492
           x_7_max = 0.0492
           
           Condition for no x-overlap:
           (x + 0.0485 < -0.0492) => x < -0.0977
           OR
           (x - 0.0485 > 0.0492) => x > 0.0977
           
           Condition for no y-overlap:
           (y + 0.0485 < -0.0492) => y < -0.0977
           OR
           (y - 0.0485 > 0.0492) => y > 0.0977
           
           However, the allowed range for the center of object 5 is [-0.0865, 0.0865] for both x and y.
           Since -0.0865 > -0.0977 and 0.0865 < 0.0977, there are no valid x or y center positions that satisfy the non-overlap conditions for a single axis. This means any placement for object 5 will have its x-projection overlap AND its y-projection overlap with object 7's projections if placed on surface 0. This constitutes a collision if the objects are axis-aligned.
           
           If object 5 is rotated, its effective AABB can be larger. For a square rotated by 45 degrees, the side length of its AABB becomes side_length * sqrt(2).
           New_side_x = 0.09705215260176919 * sqrt(2) = 0.13725
           Half_extent_rotated = 0.068625
           This would make it even harder to fit on the surface (max half extent 0.135). So, rotations won't help if anything.
           
           It seems I cannot place object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with object 7, given object 7's central position and the relative sizes. This means there are no possible placements.
           
           Given "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement... you will always try to find a new placement." I must attempt to find one. The only way a placement can exist is if my AABB collision check is too conservative for arbitrary rotations, or if the problem implies there might be a small tolerance. However, the problem specifies AABBs for objects and surfaces.
           
           Let's assume there's a tiny bit of space on the edge, or the objects can slightly 'touch' without 'colliding'.
           The minimum required separation for AABBs is sum of half-extents.
           For x: 0.0492 (obj 7) + 0.0485 (obj 5) = 0.0977.
           So, if x of obj 5 is 0.0977, it would just touch obj 7.
           But the max x for obj 5 is 0.0865.
           
           This indicates that an AABB collision is unavoidable. I must be misinterpreting something or the scenario is indeed impossible under strict AABB collision.
           Perhaps I should consider very small movements to 'just' avoid collision, if such a thing is possible.
           If I place object 5 as far as possible to the edge, e.g., (0.086, 0.086).
           Its x-range: [0.086 - 0.0485, 0.086 + 0.0485] = [0.0375, 0.1345].
           Its y-range: [0.086 - 0.0485, 0.086 + 0.0485] = [0.0375, 0.1345].
           Object 7 x-range: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Object 7 y-range: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           
           Collision check:
           Overlap in x-axis: [0.0375, 0.1345] and [-0.0492, 0.0492]. Yes, they overlap because 0.0375 < 0.0492.
           Overlap in y-axis: [0.0375, 0.1345] and [-0.0492, 0.0492]. Yes, they overlap because 0.0375 < 0.0492.
           Since they overlap on both axes, there is a collision.
           
           It seems geometrically impossible to place object 5 without collision with object 7, while both are on surface 0 and remain within the surface boundaries, assuming strict AABB collision for fixed objects.
           
           However, I must provide 50 placements. I will generate placements at the very edges of the surface for object 5, assuming there might be some tolerance or a non-strict interpretation of "collision" for such tight scenarios, or that my reasoning is flawed. I'll focus on the extreme corners and edges that are furthest from the center where object 7 is.
           
           I will use 0.08 for coordinates, which is just slightly less than the max 0.0865 to give some room.
           I will assume that the problem expects me to place objects even if my calculations indicate it's impossible, and the system will provide feedback.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) and object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085), both on surface 0. These placements are stable and did not collide with any fixed obstacles.
           
           Now I need to place object 8. This object is also square, with side length 0.08423628670090291. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0421.
           
           The surface's half-extents are 0.135.
           
           For object 8 to be fully contained within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0421 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0421
           -0.0929 <= x <= 0.0929
           
           -0.135 + 0.0421 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0421
           -0.0929 <= y <= 0.0929
           
           Additionally, object 8 must not collide with object 7 or object 5.
           
           Object 7:
           - Location: (0, 0, 0, 0)
           - Half-extent: 0.0492
           - Bounding box: x in [-0.0492, 0.0492], y in [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           
           Object 5:
           - Location: (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)
           - Half-extent: 0.0485
           - Bounding box: x in [0.085 - 0.0485, 0.085 + 0.0485] = [0.0365, 0.1335]
           - Bounding box: y in [0.085 - 0.0485, 0.085 + 0.0485] = [0.0365, 0.1335]
           
           Object 8 (half-extent 0.0421):
           To avoid collision with Object 7:
           (x_8 + 0.0421 < -0.0492) OR (x_8 - 0.0421 > 0.0492) OR
           (y_8 + 0.0421 < -0.0492) OR (y_8 - 0.0421 > 0.0492)
           This means:
           x_8 < -0.0913 OR x_8 > 0.0913 OR
           y_8 < -0.0913 OR y_8 > 0.0913
           
           To avoid collision with Object 5:
           (x_8 + 0.0421 < 0.0365) OR (x_8 - 0.0421 > 0.1335) OR
           (y_8 + 0.0421 < 0.0365) OR (y_8 - 0.0421 > 0.1335)
           This means:
           x_8 < -0.0056 OR x_8 > 0.1756 (this latter is outside surface bounds of 0.0929)
           y_8 < -0.0056 OR y_8 > 0.1756 (this latter is outside surface bounds of 0.0929)
           
           So, combining the surface bounds [-0.0929, 0.0929] with the non-collision conditions:
           
           For x_8:
           Must satisfy (x_8 < -0.0913 OR x_8 > 0.0913) for Obj 7.
           Must satisfy (x_8 < -0.0056) for Obj 5 (the other condition >0.1756 is impossible).
           
           So for x_8 to be valid, it must be in [-0.0929, 0.0929] AND (x_8 < -0.0913 OR x_8 > 0.0913) AND (x_8 < -0.0056).
           The conditions for avoiding object 7 give a very narrow band. If x_8 is in [-0.0929, -0.0913), it avoids object 7. If x_8 is in (0.0913, 0.0929], it avoids object 7.
           The condition x_8 < -0.0056 means x_8 must be negative.
           
           Let's try to place it in the negative x, negative y quadrant, away from both existing objects.
           Object 7 is centered at (0,0). Object 5 is in the positive x, positive y corner.
           So, a good candidate would be the negative x, negative y corner of the surface.
           
           Let's try a placement around (-0.08, -0.08).
           Check for surface bounds: -0.0929 <= -0.08 <= 0.0929. Valid.
           
           Check for collision with object 7 for (-0.08, -0.08):
           x_8 = -0.08. x_8 + 0.0421 = -0.0379. x_8 - 0.0421 = -0.1221.
           Since -0.0379 > -0.0492 and -0.1221 < 0.0492, there is x-overlap with Obj 7.
           Since -0.0379 > -0.0492 and -0.1221 < 0.0492, there is y-overlap with Obj 7.
           So, (-0.08, -0.08) would collide with object 7.
           
           This means that object 8 also faces severe constraints from object 7's central placement.
           The non-collision conditions for object 7:
           x_8 < -0.0913 OR x_8 > 0.0913 OR
           y_8 < -0.0913 OR y_8 > 0.0913
           
           The surface bounds for object 8:
           x_8 in [-0.0929, 0.0929]
           y_8 in [-0.0929, 0.0929]
           
           Combining these, the valid ranges for x_8 (and y_8) to avoid object 7 are:
           x_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913) OR x_8 in (0.0913, 0.0929]
           y_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913) OR y_8 in (0.0913, 0.0929]
           
           Now let's check for collision with object 5 (at (0.085, 0.085), half-extent 0.0485).
           Its x-range is [0.0365, 0.1335]. Its y-range is [0.0365, 0.1335].
           
           If we try x_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913):
           This range is entirely to the left of 0.0365, so no x-overlap with object 5.
           If we try y_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913):
           This range is entirely below 0.0365, so no y-overlap with object 5.
           
           So, if x_8 is in [-0.0929, -0.0913) AND y_8 is in [-0.0929, -0.0913), then object 8 will avoid both object 7 (by being in its "corners") and object 5 (by being in the opposite corner of the surface).
           Let's choose x = -0.092 and y = -0.092.
           This is within the allowed range of [-0.0929, -0.0913).
           
           Let's verify this placement: (0, 0.0, -0.092, -0.092)
           Object 8 half-extent: 0.0421
           Object 8 bounding box: x in [-0.092 - 0.0421, -0.092 + 0.0421] = [-0.1341, -0.0499]
           y in [-0.092 - 0.0421, -0.092 + 0.0421] = [-0.1341, -0.0499]
           
           Surface bounds check:
           [-0.1341, -0.0499] is within [-0.135, 0.135]. Valid.
           
           Collision with Object 7:
           Obj 7 x-range: [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           Obj 8 x-range: [-0.1341, -0.0499]
           Are these overlapping? No, because -0.0499 < -0.0492. (x_8_max < x_7_min) is satisfied.
           So no x-overlap. Therefore no collision with object 7. (Same for y).
           
           Collision with Object 5:
           Obj 5 x-range: [0.0365, 0.1335]
           Obj 8 x-range: [-0.1341, -0.0499]
           Are these overlapping? No, because -0.0499 < 0.0365. (x_8_max < x_5_min) is satisfied.
           So no x-overlap. Therefore no collision with object 5. (Same for y).
           
           This placement (0, 0.0, -0.092, -0.092) should be valid.
           I will generate other placements within the valid corner regions.
           
           Valid areas for object 8's center to avoid object 7:
           1. x in [-0.0929, -0.0913), y in [-0.0929, 0.0929]
           2. x in (0.0913, 0.0929], y in [-0.0929, 0.0929]
           3. x in [-0.0929, 0.0929], y in [-0.0929, -0.0913)
           4. x in [-0.0929, 0.0929], y in (0.0913, 0.0929]
           
           Now check these against object 5's occupied region (x in [0.0365, 0.1335], y in [0.0365, 0.1335]).
           
           Case 1: x_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913). This avoids obj 5's x-range (x_8_max < 0.0365).
              For y_8: [-0.0929, 0.0929].
              To avoid obj 5, y_8 must satisfy (y_8 < 0.0365 - 0.0421 = -0.0056) OR (y_8 > 0.1335 + 0.0421 = 0.1756 (impossible)).
              So, valid y_8 are in [-0.0929, -0.0056).
              Combined: x_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913) AND y_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0056). This is the "lower-left" corner region.
           
           Case 2: x_8 in (0.0913, 0.0929].
              This x-range overlaps with object 5's x-range [0.0365, 0.1335].
              So, to avoid collision, y_8 must avoid obj 5's y-range.
              y_8 < -0.0056 OR y_8 > 0.1756 (impossible).
              So, valid y_8 are in [-0.0929, -0.0056).
              Combined: x_8 in (0.0913, 0.0929] AND y_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0056). This is the "lower-right" corner region.
           
           Case 3: y_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913). This avoids obj 5's y-range.
              For x_8: [-0.0929, 0.0929].
              To avoid obj 5, x_8 must satisfy (x_8 < -0.0056) OR (x_8 > 0.1756 (impossible)).
              So, valid x_8 are in [-0.0929, -0.0056).
              Combined: x_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0056) AND y_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0913). This is the "lower-left" corner region (same as part of Case 1).
           
           Case 4: y_8 in (0.0913, 0.0929].
              This y-range overlaps with object 5's y-range [0.0365, 0.1335].
              So, to avoid collision, x_8 must avoid obj 5's x-range.
              x_8 < -0.0056 OR x_8 > 0.1756 (impossible).
              So, valid x_8 are in [-0.0929, -0.0056).
              Combined: x_8 in [-0.0929, -0.0056) AND y_8 in (0.0913, 0.0929]. This is the "upper-left" corner region.
           
           Summary of valid placement regions for object 8's center (x_8, y_8):
           1. Lower-left corner: x in [-0.0929, -0.0913) AND y in [-0.0929, -0.0056)
           2. Lower-right edge: x in (0.0913, 0.0929] AND y in [-0.0929, -0.0056)
           3. Upper-left edge: x in [-0.0929, -0.0056) AND y in (0.0913, 0.0929]
           
           I will generate placements within these regions. I'll use 0.092, -0.092, -0.006, 0.092 for the coordinates, trying to stay within the valid bounds.
           I'll also try different rotations, though for a square it mainly affects the AABB when rotated by 45 degrees, which would make it larger and potentially harder to fit. However, for a diverse set, I will include rotations.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085), and object 8 at (0, 0.0, -0.092, -0.092), all on surface 0. These placements are stable and did not collide with any fixed obstacles.
           
           Now I need to place object 4. This object is also square, with side length 0.09077972597225964. Its half-extents are approximately 0.0454.
           
           The surface's half-extents are 0.135.
           
           For object 4 to be fully contained within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0454 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0454
           -0.0896 <= x <= 0.0896
           
           -0.135 + 0.0454 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0454
           -0.0896 <= y <= 0.0896
           
           Additionally, object 4 must not collide with object 7, object 5, or object 8.
           
           Object 7:
           - Location: (0, 0, 0, 0)
           - Half-extent: 0.0492
           - Bounding box: x in [-0.0492, 0.0492], y in [-0.0492, 0.0492]
           
           Object 5:
           - Location: (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)
           - Half-extent: 0.0485
           - Bounding box: x in [0.085 - 0.0485, 0.085 + 0.0485] = [0.0365, 0.1335]
           - Bounding box: y in [0.085 - 0.0485, 0.085 + 0.0485] = [0.0365, 0.1335]
           
           Object 8:
           - Location: (0, 0.0, -0.092, -0.092)
           - Half-extent: 0.0421
           - Bounding box: x in [-0.092 - 0.0421, -0.092 + 0.0421] = [-0.1341, -0.0499]
           - Bounding box: y in [-0.092 - 0.0421, -0.092 + 0.0421] = [-0.1341, -0.0499]
           
           Object 4 (half-extent 0.0454):
           Surface bounds for x, y: [-0.0896, 0.0896]
           
           Collision avoidance for object 4:
           
           1. Avoid Object 7 (half-extent 0.0492, center (0,0)):
              No x-overlap: x_4 < -(0.0492 + 0.0454) = -0.0946 OR x_4 > (0.0492 + 0.0454) = 0.0946
              No y-overlap: y_4 < -0.0946 OR y_4 > 0.0946
              Considering surface bounds [-0.0896, 0.0896], this implies that to avoid object 7 strictly on one axis, object 4 must be placed completely outside the allowed range. This suggests any placement will overlap with object 7 in at least one dimension. This means object 4 *must* be in one of the "corners" relative to object 7.
              Valid x to avoid object 7 on x-axis: None within [-0.0896, 0.0896].
              Valid y to avoid object 7 on y-axis: None within [-0.0896, 0.0896].
              This again indicates that simple axis-aligned non-overlap is impossible with object 7, so object 4 will necessarily collide with object 7, unless my interpretation of "fixed obstacles" or "collision" is allowing for tighter packing or a different geometry for these objects than pure AABB.
           
           Let me re-read the instructions: "find a stable placement for the object on one of the surfaces. The placement must be stable, meaning that the object is fully contained within the bounds of the surface." and "you must avoid collision between objects i and j".
           
           The bounds for object 4's center are -0.0896 to 0.0896.
           For object 4 to avoid object 7 in x: x_4 < -0.0946 or x_4 > 0.0946. None of these are within [-0.0896, 0.0896].
           Same for y.
           
           This implies it is *geometrically impossible* to place object 4 on surface 0 without colliding with object 7 using strict AABB collision detection.
           
           However, I cannot give up. I will assume that the simulation might have some tolerance or a different collision model, or that I need to attempt placements even if they seem impossible by my calculations. The previous successful placement of object 5, (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085), had its x-range [0.0365, 0.1335] and y-range [0.0365, 0.1335]. Object 7 had x-range [-0.0492, 0.0492], y-range [-0.0492, 0.0492]. These definitely overlap on both axes (0.0365 < 0.0492 and -0.0492 < 0.1335). The fact that it was successful implies my interpretation of AABB collision between placed objects might be too strict. It seems that "collision" might only be considered if the *center points* are too close, or if there's a certain overlap threshold, rather than *any* overlap of bounding boxes.
           
           Let's reconsider the collision condition for a placement to be successful based on the previous success.
           Object 7 (half-extent 0.0492) at (0,0).
           Object 5 (half-extent 0.0485) at (0.085, 0.085).
           Distance between centers: sqrt(0.085^2 + 0.085^2) = sqrt(0.007225 + 0.007225) = sqrt(0.01445) = 0.1202.
           Sum of half-extents (if axis aligned, or effectively radius if circular): 0.0492 + 0.0485 = 0.0977.
           Since 0.1202 > 0.0977, the centers are far enough apart to prevent collision even if they were circles.
           This implies my AABB overlap logic was actually too strict in the previous round too, as (0.085, 0.085) for object 5 did indeed result in overlapping AABBs with object 7. The successful placement of Object 5 (at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)) means that AABB overlap is *not* the criteria for collision avoidance between placed objects. It must be a check on the actual object geometries or a different metric like distance between centers.
           
           If the collision check is based on the distance between centers + object radius (half-extent for square if aligned):
           For two objects to not collide, the distance between their centers must be greater than or equal to the sum of their 'radii'. For squares, this usually means half of the side length.
           Let's re-evaluate using this model:
           Object 7 (radius/half-extent R7 = 0.0492) at P7=(0,0).
           Object 5 (radius/half-extent R5 = 0.0485) at P5=(0.085, 0.085).
           Distance(P7, P5) = sqrt((0.085-0)^2 + (0.085-0)^2) = 0.1202.
           R7 + R5 = 0.0492 + 0.0485 = 0.0977.
           Since 0.1202 > 0.0977, they do not collide. This matches the successful placement.
           
           Now I will apply this collision model for object 4 (radius R4 = 0.0454).
           
           Constraint for Object 4 at P4=(x,y):
           1. Surface Bounds: x,y in [-0.0896, 0.0896]
           
           2. Avoid Object 7 (R7 = 0.0492, P7=(0,0)):
              Distance(P4, P7) >= R4 + R7
              sqrt(x^2 + y^2) >= 0.0454 + 0.0492 = 0.0946
              x^2 + y^2 >= (0.0946)^2 = 0.00894916
           
           3. Avoid Object 5 (R5 = 0.0485, P5=(0.085, 0.085)):
              Distance(P4, P5) >= R4 + R5
              sqrt((x-0.085)^2 + (y-0.085)^2) >= 0.0454 + 0.0485 = 0.0939
              (x-0.085)^2 + (y-0.085)^2 >= (0.0939)^2 = 0.00881721
           
           4. Avoid Object 8 (R8 = 0.0421, P8=(-0.092, -0.092)):
              Distance(P4, P8) >= R4 + R8
              sqrt((x-(-0.092))^2 + (y-(-0.092))^2) >= 0.0454 + 0.0421 = 0.0875
              (x+0.092)^2 + (y+0.092)^2 >= (0.0875)^2 = 0.00765625
           
           Let's look for possible regions.
           Object 7 is at (0,0). Object 5 is at (0.085, 0.085). Object 8 is at (-0.092, -0.092).
           The available space is somewhat diamond-shaped, but now with a hole in the middle, a corner taken up, and the opposite corner taken up.
           This leaves the other two corners: (-x, +y) and (+x, -y).
           Let's try the (-x, +y) quadrant. E.g., at (-0.08, 0.08).
           
           Check (-0.08, 0.08) for Object 4 (R4=0.0454):
           Surface Bounds: -0.0896 <= -0.08 <= 0.0896 and -0.0896 <= 0.08 <= 0.0896. Valid.
           
           Vs Object 7 (P7=(0,0), R7=0.0492, min_dist=0.0946):
           sqrt((-0.08)^2 + (0.08)^2) = sqrt(0.0064 + 0.0064) = sqrt(0.0128) = 0.1131.
           0.1131 >= 0.0946. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 5 (P5=(0.085, 0.085), R5=0.0485, min_dist=0.0939):
           sqrt((-0.08-0.085)^2 + (0.08-0.085)^2) = sqrt((-0.165)^2 + (-0.005)^2) = sqrt(0.027225 + 0.000025) = sqrt(0.02725) = 0.16507.
           0.16507 >= 0.0939. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 8 (P8=(-0.092, -0.092), R8=0.0421, min_dist=0.0875):
           sqrt((-0.08-(-0.092))^2 + (0.08-(-0.092))^2) = sqrt((0.012)^2 + (0.172)^2) = sqrt(0.000144 + 0.029584) = sqrt(0.029728) = 0.1724.
           0.1724 >= 0.0875. Valid. No collision.
           
           So, (-0.08, 0.08) is a valid placement for object 4.
           I will generate placements around this region and the (+x, -y) region.
           Let's try the other corner: (0.08, -0.08).
           
           Check (0.08, -0.08) for Object 4 (R4=0.0454):
           Surface Bounds: Valid.
           
           Vs Object 7 (P7=(0,0), R7=0.0492, min_dist=0.0946):
           sqrt((0.08)^2 + (-0.08)^2) = 0.1131.
           0.1131 >= 0.0946. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 5 (P5=(0.085, 0.085), R5=0.0485, min_dist=0.0939):
           sqrt((0.08-0.085)^2 + (-0.08-0.085)^2) = sqrt((-0.005)^2 + (-0.165)^2) = sqrt(0.000025 + 0.027225) = sqrt(0.02725) = 0.16507.
           0.16507 >= 0.0939. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 8 (P8=(-0.092, -0.092), R8=0.0421, min_dist=0.0875):
           sqrt((0.08-(-0.092))^2 + (-0.08-(-0.092))^2) = sqrt((0.172)^2 + (0.012)^2) = sqrt(0.029584 + 0.000144) = sqrt(0.029728) = 0.1724.
           0.1724 >= 0.0875. Valid. No collision.
           
           So, (0.08, -0.08) is also a valid placement for object 4.
           I will fill the list with variations around these two corner positions, including slight changes in coordinates and rotations. The maximum allowed coordinate is 0.0896. I'll use 0.085 as a safe bet within the bounds.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have successfully placed object 7 at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), object 5 at (0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085), object 8 at (0, 0.0, -0.092, -0.092), and object 4 at (0, 0.0, -0.08, 0.08), all on surface 0. These placements are stable and did not collide with any fixed obstacles.
           
           Now I need to place object 6. This object is also square, with side length 0.09626256959126286. Its half-extents (radius in circular approximation) are approximately R6 = 0.0481.
           
           The surface's half-extents are 0.135.
           
           For object 6 to be fully contained within the surface, its center (x, y) must satisfy:
           -0.135 + 0.0481 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0481
           -0.0869 <= x <= 0.0869
           
           -0.135 + 0.0481 <= y <= 0.135 - 0.0481
           -0.0869 <= y <= 0.0869
           
           Additionally, object 6 must not collide with objects 7, 5, 8, or 4. I will use the "distance between centers >= sum of half-extents" model for collision detection, as validated by previous successful placements.
           
           Existing objects and their properties:
           - Object 7: R7 = 0.0492, P7=(0,0)
           - Object 5: R5 = 0.0485, P5=(0.085, 0.085)
           - Object 8: R8 = 0.0421, P8=(-0.092, -0.092)
           - Object 4: R4 = 0.0454, P4=(-0.08, 0.08)
           
           Object 6 (R6 = 0.0481) at P6=(x,y):
           Surface Bounds: x,y in [-0.0869, 0.0869]
           
           Collision avoidance for object 6:
           
           1. Vs Object 7 (P7=(0,0), R7=0.0492):
              sqrt(x^2 + y^2) >= R6 + R7 = 0.0481 + 0.0492 = 0.0973
              x^2 + y^2 >= (0.0973)^2 = 0.00946729
           
           2. Vs Object 5 (P5=(0.085, 0.085), R5=0.0485):
              sqrt((x-0.085)^2 + (y-0.085)^2) >= R6 + R5 = 0.0481 + 0.0485 = 0.0966
              (x-0.085)^2 + (y-0.085)^2 >= (0.0966)^2 = 0.00933156
           
           3. Vs Object 8 (P8=(-0.092, -0.092), R8=0.0421):
              sqrt((x+0.092)^2 + (y+0.092)^2) >= R6 + R8 = 0.0481 + 0.0421 = 0.0902
              (x+0.092)^2 + (y+0.092)^2 >= (0.0902)^2 = 0.00813604
           
           4. Vs Object 4 (P4=(-0.08, 0.08), R4=0.0454):
              sqrt((x+0.08)^2 + (y-0.08)^2) >= R6 + R4 = 0.0481 + 0.0454 = 0.0935
              (x+0.08)^2 + (y-0.08)^2 >= (0.0935)^2 = 0.00874225
           
           Let's look for an open spot.
           Object 7 is central.
           Object 5 is in the (+x, +y) corner.
           Object 8 is in the (-x, -y) corner.
           Object 4 is in the (-x, +y) corner.
           
           This leaves the (+x, -y) corner as the most likely candidate region for object 6.
           Let's try a placement at (0.08, -0.08) for Object 6.
           Surface Bounds: -0.0869 <= 0.08 <= 0.0869 and -0.0869 <= -0.08 <= 0.0869. Valid.
           
           Check (0.08, -0.08) for Object 6 (R6=0.0481):
           
           Vs Object 7 (P7=(0,0), min_dist=0.0973):
           sqrt((0.08)^2 + (-0.08)^2) = sqrt(0.0064 + 0.0064) = sqrt(0.0128) = 0.1131.
           0.1131 >= 0.0973. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 5 (P5=(0.085, 0.085), min_dist=0.0966):
           sqrt((0.08-0.085)^2 + (-0.08-0.085)^2) = sqrt((-0.005)^2 + (-0.165)^2) = sqrt(0.000025 + 0.027225) = sqrt(0.02725) = 0.16507.
           0.16507 >= 0.0966. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 8 (P8=(-0.092, -0.092), min_dist=0.0902):
           sqrt((0.08-(-0.092))^2 + (-0.08-(-0.092))^2) = sqrt((0.172)^2 + (0.012)^2) = sqrt(0.029584 + 0.000144) = sqrt(0.029728) = 0.1724.
           0.1724 >= 0.0902. Valid. No collision.
           
           Vs Object 4 (P4=(-0.08, 0.08), min_dist=0.0935):
           sqrt((0.08-(-0.08))^2 + (-0.08-0.08)^2) = sqrt((0.16)^2 + (-0.16)^2) = sqrt(0.0256 + 0.0256) = sqrt(0.0512) = 0.2262.
           0.2262 >= 0.0935. Valid. No collision.
           
           So, (0.08, -0.08) is a valid placement for object 6. I will fill the list with variations around this position, along with edge placements.
           The maximum allowed coordinate for object 6 is 0.0869. I will use 0.085 as a common candidate, or 0.08 for safer distance.
