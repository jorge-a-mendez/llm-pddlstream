User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Robot Base Position Generation Strategy**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 25 diverse (x, y) coordinates for the robot's base, all within 4 units of a given target point.  The robot's base can only be within a 5x5 area, specifically between -2.5 and 2.5 for both x and y. I have some fixed rectangular obstacles to avoid, which I've analyzed to understand the environment's layout. The key thing is to avoid collisions and, crucially, to maintain a line of sight to the target. I'll also be getting feedback on my choices, so I can learn from any failures.
           
           Since this is the first request for this target, I'm starting from scratch. My strategy is to generate positions in a spiral-like fashion around the target point. I'll sample positions at different distances (from around 1 unit up to nearly the maximum range of 4) and angles. I'll ensure I check that all the robot's coordinates stay within the environment limits of [-2.5, 2.5]. Crucially, I have to ensure that the robot doesn't collide with any of the fixed obstacles.
           
           The biggest challenge is dealing with the 'line of sight' aspect.  There's a vertical wall at x=0 that effectively splits the environment in two, and based on the target point, I'll need to favor positions on the same side of this wall. The current target is at approximately (-1.01, -1.05), so I'll prioritize positions where the x-coordinate is less than zero (on the same side as the target). I'm carefully avoiding obstacles and ensuring that my coordinates are within limits, and by doing so, I will hopefully have the robot maintain line-of-sight. For simplicity, I will use a reasonable distance and angle sampling. I'm choosing more points than needed (300 points) and then filtering to guarantee that I end up with the right amount of valid and unique positions to send to the user.
