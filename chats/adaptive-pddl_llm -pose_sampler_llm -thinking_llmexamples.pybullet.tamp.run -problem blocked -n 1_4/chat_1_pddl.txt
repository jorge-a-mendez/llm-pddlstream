           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Achieving `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan that fulfills the `new-axiom@0` goal.  `new-axiom@0` expands to  `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)`. I observe that I have two objects of type `v17`: `v8` and `v12`. Either one can be the `?green`.  The key challenge is making `(on ?green v18)` true, which in turn means positioning the object `?green` such that it is both supported by `v18` and in a valid pose at `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I note that `(supported v8 #o2 v18)` and `(supported v12 #o2 v18)` are true. This provides a clue, as  `#o2` seems like a potential target.  Further investigation shows I need to achieve either `(atpose v8 #o2)` or `(atpose v12 #o2)`.
           
           I can accomplish this by using a `pick` and `place` sequence. Specifically, since `atpose(v8, v9)` is initially true,  I'll need to move `v8` from `v9` to `#o2`.
           
           The available actions are `pick`, `place`, and `move_base`. Given the constraints, I will have to place v8 or v12 on #o2. To facilitate this, the initial state facts include kinematic information (`kin`) for both objects and the available arm (`v4`). However, I note that the only provided `move_base` action doesn't actually change the base configuration, it simply cycles the `atbconf(v3)` state.  This implies that for `pick` and `place` to be feasible, the base configuration parameter in my kinematic facts must correspond to the currently held robot position `v3`.
           
           Therefore, the plan consists of two steps:
           
           1.  **(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)**: This action will pick up the object `v8` from its initial pose `v9`, using the arm `v4`, assuming that the arm configuration `?g`, base configuration `v3`, and arm trajectory `#o4` are feasible. It utilizes the grasp parameter `#o1`, base configuration `v3` and the trajectory `#o4`. Crucially, this action is only valid if we assume  `#o3 = v3`, to satisfy preconditions, and I confirmed that it can.  I will assume all  `NegatedAtom` predicates are initially false.
           2.  **(place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)**: This action places `v8` at the target pose `#o2`, using the same arm `v4`. It's possible because I already hold `v8` (`atgrasp`) and the base configuration is correctly aligned. The same parameters apply.
           
           After performing these steps, `atpose(v8, #o2)` will be true. Since `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true, this satisfies the `on(v8, v18)` goal and  `new-axiom@0()` is met. The plan relies on the critical interpretation that `#o3` must be interpreted as  `v3`, as there's no way to reach another base configuration.
           
           **In summary, the necessary actions are (pick and place)**. The `move_base` action instance is unnecessary in this scenario and can be ignored. Since the robot is initially at `atbconf(v3)`, and the only defined move action is (move_base v3 v3 #o0), there is no need for it.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Current Assessment: The Goal is Unreachable**
           
           Okay, the user correctly pointed out the flaw in the previous attempt. The `pick` and `place` actions aren't valid, which completely changes the game.  Let's reassess.
           
           The ultimate goal is `(on ?green v18)`. That means either `v8` or `v12` has to be *on* `v18`. From the initial state, I know that both `v8` and `v12` are the right *type* for this.
           
           To achieve this, let's break it down:  For either `v8` or `v12` to be `on v18`, I need two things: they need to be *supported* by `v18` and be at the correct *pose* relative to it. I see that `v8` is *supported* by `#o2` *relative* to `v18`. Same with `v12`. Great!
           
           Currently, `v8` is at `v9`, and `v12` is at `v13`. To get either of them *on* `v18`, I need to change their pose. Specifically, I need to get either `v8` *to* `#o2` or `v12` *to* `#o2`.
           
           The *only* available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This just moves the base *to itself*.  It doesn't actually change the state of the objects in any way!  It makes `atbconf(v3)` true, but that's not helping me here. It also *disables* any future moves.
           
           The crucial issue is that `move_base` doesn't affect the `atpose` of `v8` or `v12`.  It also doesn't unlock any helpful actions. So, since the only action I *can* use doesn't modify the state of those objects, I'm stuck. I can't change their poses to be `on v18`, so I can't reach the goal!
           
           Therefore, with only this single, unhelpful `move_base` action, the goal is *unreachable*. It's impossible.
