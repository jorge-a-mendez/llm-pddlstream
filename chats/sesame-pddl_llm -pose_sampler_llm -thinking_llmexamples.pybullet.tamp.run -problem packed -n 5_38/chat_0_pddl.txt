           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My primary goal is to determine 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, square dimensions 0.08798707551289908 x 0.08798707551289908) on a surface defined by the rectangle `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))` (Surface 0).**
           
           For a placement to be stable, the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) must be fully contained within the surface's AABB.  Since the object is square, its dimensions don't change, only its rotated bounding box does.  I calculated the rotated dimensions based on the object dimension, using `rotated_dim = obj_w * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`.  The maximum rotation size occurs when `theta` is π/4.
           
           I calculated the allowed x and y coordinate range for placement in a way to make any placement stable.  The maximum AABB rotation extent is `0.0622171272217229`.  The stable range for each coordinate is [-0.0727828727782771, 0.0727828727782771]. To guarantee stability across all angles, I restricted the object's center coordinates within this conservative range.  I chose a 5x5 grid in the x, y coordinates with values centered at 0 and spanning this range:  `[-0.07, -0.035, 0.0, 0.035, 0.07]`. The idea is to make the placement safe for any object rotation.
           
           Finally, I combined the coordinate combinations with two rotations, 0 and pi/4, to generate 50 unique stable placements.
           
           Here are the 50 stable placements on surface 0, the first 25 placements are at 0 degrees, the second 25 placements are at pi/4:

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object 4**
           
           Alright, here's the plan. I've been given some successful object placement feedback, specifically for object 5. Now, my task is to place a new, very similar square object, object 4, on the same surface without any collisions.
           
           I've got the dimensions and know the extents of the surface. First, I determined the boundaries object 5 occupies and considered its position, which currently lies at (-0.07, -0.07). Next, I need to find 50 valid placements for object 4. I'll use a grid strategy to make this process systematic.
           
           For object 4, I'll calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) using the object's dimensions. Since the object can be rotated, I've got to consider two angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. The dimensions of object 4 are very close to object 5, so I need to be extra cautious to avoid collisions.
           
           Here's my logic:
           
           1.  **Define a Grid:** I will use the x and y coordinates. I'm choosing the spacing based on the space of the surface and the size of the new object. I'll define these grid points and then iterate over them.
           2.  **Generate Candidate Placements:** I generate candidate placements by combining all the x-y combinations with the possible angles. In this case, 8 angles.
           3.  **Collision Detection:** I calculate object 4's AABB for each placement. Now, I need to check for collision with object 5's AABB. I already determined the AABB for object 5 from the feedback. A simple AABB intersection check will confirm whether each placement has any overlap and should be skipped.
           4.  **Selection:** I'll keep the first 50 valid placements (no collisions).
           5.  **Refinement:** If it turns out that there are not 50 combinations possible, I'll need to relax my conditions or make my grid more dense.
           
           I know I can't place object 4 at the same location as object 5. So, I need to filter out the combinations near that region. This approach will find safe combinations and guarantee object 4 is not overlapping.

(Thoughts: **My Goal: Find 50 stable, collision-free placements for Object 6 on Surface 0.**
           
           I've been tasked with placing a new object (ID 6) onto a surface. I've been given the dimensions of the object, its potential orientations (including rotation), and I have to ensure it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 5 and ID 4).  I need to find a way to generate a sufficient number of valid placements.
           
           **Understanding the Scene and the Challenges:**
           
           *   **Surface 0:** It's a square defined by its extent. I know I have to keep the object's entire bounding box within these confines, regardless of its rotation.
           *   **Existing Objects (ID 5 and ID 4):** I have the dimensions and placement of the existing objects, which I'll be using to avoid collisions. I'll represent each object with its Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) because it's a quick way to check if two objects overlap.
           *   **Object 6:**  It's another square with specific dimensions.
           *   **Rotation:** Object 6 can be rotated, which means the AABB will change. The worst-case scenario for its AABB size happens at a 45-degree angle.
           
           **The Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Placement Constraints:** I need to make sure the object remains entirely inside the surface's boundary. I'll need to calculate a "safe zone" for the center point of the object, taking into account the maximum extent of the object in its rotated state.
           2.  **Collision Detection:**  I will iterate over a grid of possible center points within the surface's "safe zone" for various orientations, checking for collisions with objects ID 4 and 5 at each potential placement.
           3.  **AABB Overlap Check:** I'll use a fast AABB overlap function to check if any two objects are colliding.
           
           **Implementing the Plan:**
           
           1.  I have two key calculations:
               *   `half_eff_dim_6`: Half of the effective side length of the object for any rotation angle.
               *   `check_collision(aabb1, aabb2)` : I'll use it to compare AABBs and quickly see if there are any collisions.
           2.  I generate a grid of `(x, y)` center coordinates, spanning the `safe_placement_region`, and consider rotations of 0 and pi/4 radians.
           3.  For each candidate, I check:
               *   **Surface Containment:** Does the AABB for a specific `(x, y, theta)` fall within the surface boundaries?
               *   **Collision with Existing Objects:** Does the candidate's AABB overlap with the AABBs of ID 4 and ID 5?
           4.  If a candidate is *both* surface-contained and collision-free, I add it to the final set of placements. I'll need to keep looking for placements until I have 50.
           
           **The Details of Implementation (and Debugging):**
           
           I need to make sure my placement strategy is robust, especially for those regions near existing objects. I have to avoid collisions when the new object "snuggles up" against an existing one (which can happen).
           I'll create a code that will iterate, check AABBs for collisions. and build a list of 50 non-colliding points.
           
           **In summary,** I will find the proper placements by building a list of non-colliding coordinates by iterating through a 2D grid, checking and filtering for collisions with objects 4 and 5 until I find the proper placements. I might change the grid or the number of angles, to meet the goal of 50 valid placements.
