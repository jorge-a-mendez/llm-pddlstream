           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's what I've figured out. My goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, but it looks like that's impossible given the constraints. Let's break it down:
           
           First, I need to achieve a bunch of conditions. Some are already true in the initial state, like being at a specific configuration and having free storage. Great! But the tough parts are: getting images of two objectives, and receiving analyses of a stone and soil.
           
           To get the images, I'd need to use the `send_image` action. To do *that*, I need to *take* an image first with `take_image`, which has some specific conditions. Here's where the problem arises: the rovers need to be at certain configurations (`#o3`) to take images and they can't actually *move* to them. I have rovers `v12` and `v14` in the initial configurations `v13` and `v15` respectively, and their moves are limited to self-loops. This means they cannot be placed at the required configurations for image visibility. So, I can't take the image, and therefore can't send it.
           
           Similarly, I need to receive analyses of a stone and soil. That means I need to sample, analyze, and then send the analysis. However, neither the `sample_rock` nor the `send_analysis` actions are in the allowed actions list.
           
           The problem here is that I have a very limited set of actions to use. I only have move actions that keep the rovers in place, and a `drop_rock` action. Since the allowed actions don't allow to collect or send image and analysis data. It's simply impossible to fulfill those *key* goal conditions.
           
           Therefore, since I can't achieve some crucial parts of the goal, the entire goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given allowed actions.
