           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type v2 (which are v1, v3, v4) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type v6 (which are v5, v7, v8) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           
           Let's plan to achieve these goals:
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           Rover v14 also has `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           Both rovers have `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           Both rovers also have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           We need to calibrate the camera, take the image, and then send it. We'll use rover v12 for these.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2, e.g., v1, v3, v4):
           Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`.
           Rover v14 has `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`.
           We need to sample a rock and then send the analysis. Let's use v1 for type v2.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6, e.g., v5, v7, v8):
           Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`.
           Rover v14 has `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`.
           We need to sample a rock and then send the analysis. Let's use v7 for type v6.
           
           Plan Strategy:
           1. Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 for objective v17.
           2. Take image of v17 with v12.
           3. Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 for objective v18. (Need to recalibrate as taking an image uncalibrates the camera)
           4. Take image of v18 with v12.
           5. Move v12 to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander v9.
           6. Send images of v17 and v18 from v12 to v9.
           7. Move v12 to a configuration where it is above a rock of type v2 (e.g., v1).
           8. Sample rock v1 with v12.
           9. Move v12 to a configuration where it is above a rock of type v6 (e.g., v7).
           10. Sample rock v7 with v12.
           11. Move v12 to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander v9.
           12. Send analysis of rock v1 from v12 to v9.
           13. Send analysis of rock v7 from v12 to v9.
           
           All required `atconf` and `free` predicates are already met initially. We will achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type v2), and `receivedanalysis(v7)` (type v6).

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type v2 (which are v1, v3, v4) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type v6 (which are v5, v7, v8) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           
           Let's plan to achieve these goals:
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           Rover v14 also has `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           Both rovers have `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           Both rovers also have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           We need to calibrate the camera, take the image, and then send it. We'll use rover v12 for these.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2, e.g., v1, v3, v4):
           Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`.
           Rover v14 has `above(v14, #o5, v1)`, `above(v14, #o5, v3)`, `above(v14, #o5, v4)`.
           We need to sample a rock and then send the analysis. Let's use v1 for type v2.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6, e.g., v5, v7, v8):
           Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`.
           Rover v14 has `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, `above(v14, #o5, v7)`, `above(v14, #o5, v8)`.
           We need to sample a rock and then send the analysis. Let's use v7 for type v6.
           
           Plan Strategy:
           1. Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 for objective v17.
           2. Take image of v17 with v12.
           3. Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 for objective v18. (Need to recalibrate as taking an image uncalibrates the camera)
           4. Take image of v18 with v12.
           5. Move v12 to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander v9.
           6. Send images of v17 and v18 from v12 to v9.
           7. Move v12 to a configuration where it is above a rock of type v2 (e.g., v1).
           8. Sample rock v1 with v12.
           9. Sample rock v7 with v12 (assuming the robot is still at the same above configuration #o5).
           10. Move v12 to a configuration where it can communicate with the lander v9.
           11. Send analysis of rock v1 from v12 to v9.
           12. Send analysis of rock v7 from v12 to v9.
           
           All required `atconf` and `free` predicates are already met initially. We will achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v1)` (type v2), and `receivedanalysis(v7)` (type v6).

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type v2 (which are v1, v3, v4) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type v6 (which are v5, v7, v8) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           
           Let's plan to achieve these goals. We need to find valid configurations for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           We need a collision-free and occlusion-free configuration for v12 to see v17 and v18. The previous attempt with `(0.39 1.89)` was in collision. Let's try to find another configuration for `#o3`. Given v17 at `((0.367, 1.89), (0.466, 1.988))` and v19 at `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`, a configuration for v12 around `(0.0, 1.0)` might give it a clear line of sight to v17 and v18 without collision. We'll try to find a configuration for v12 around v17 that is not in collision with v19. Let's try `(0.1, 1.5)`. The maximum distance is 2.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2, e.g., v1, v3, v4) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6, e.g., v5, v7, v8):
           Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`.
           Rover v12 has `above(v12, #o5, v5)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v8)`.
           We need to sample rock v1 (type v2) and rock v7 (type v6). We need a reachable configuration `#o5` that is above both of them. Let's pick a rock that is closer to v12's initial position v13 `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           v1 is at `((-1.19, 0.745), (-1.115, 0.82))`.
           v3 is at `((0.994, -0.157), (1.1, -0.052))`.
           v4 is at `((0.876, -1.1), (0.977, -0.999))`.
           v5 is at `((1.111, 1.081), (1.25, 1.221))`.
           v7 is at `((0.539, -0.686), (0.677, -0.548))`.
           v8 is at `((1.362, -1.614), (1.502, -1.474))`.
           From v13 `(1.0, -1.75)`, v4 is quite close. So let's use v4 for type v2 and v7 for type v6. A configuration like `(0.9, -1.0)` for `#o5` could be above v4. Then, for v7, a configuration like `(0.6, -0.6)` for `#o5` is above v7. This suggests we might need to move between sampling rocks. Since both sampling actions use the same `#o5` placeholder, it implies that the robot could be in a configuration that allows it to sample multiple rocks without moving again *if* those rocks are sufficiently close. However, for now, let's assume we can use the same symbolic #o5 for two different configurations if needed, since the system will find the specific continuous value. A better approach is to choose rocks that are close to each other. v3 `(0.994, -0.157)` and v7 `(0.539, -0.686)` are somewhat close. Let's pick a configuration that is above v3 and v7. Maybe a configuration around `(0.7, -0.4)` could work for #o5 to be above v3 and v7.
           
           For `comvisible`:
           Rover v12 has `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Lander v9 is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           v12 starts at v13 `(1.0, -1.75)`. For communication, a configuration closer to the lander might be better. The maximum communication range is 4. Let's try `(-1.0, -1.75)` for `#o0`, which is v15, as it is close to v9. It is available as a continuous configuration for v14 initially, and a motion for v12. So v12 can move to v15. Wait, v15 is a specific configuration for v14. Let's pick a new configuration for #o0 that is near v15 but reachable by v12 and provides line of sight to v9. Perhaps `(-0.5, -1.5)`.
           
           Let's refine the plan with these new considerations for configurations:
           1. Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 for objective v17 at new config #o3.
           2. Take image of v17 with v12.
           3. Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 for objective v18 at new config #o3.
           4. Take image of v18 with v12.
           5. Move v12 to #o0 (new communication config).
           6. Send images of v17 and v18 from v12 to v9.
           7. Move v12 to #o5_rock_type2 (e.g., above v3).
           8. Sample rock v3 (type v2) with v12.
           9. Move v12 to #o5_rock_type6 (e.g., above v7).
           10. Sample rock v7 (type v6) with v12.
           11. Move v12 back to #o0 (communication config).
           12. Send analysis of rock v3 from v12 to v9.
           13. Send analysis of rock v7 from v12 to v9.
           
           The problem formulation states "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". In our case, `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are in the initial state as `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`.
           
           Revised Plan:
           The previous plan used the same #o5 for both sampling actions, which means the system would compute one configuration for the rover to be above *both* rocks, which may not be feasible if they are far apart. It's better to explicitly move between locations if rocks are not close enough for a single 'above' configuration. We have `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `above(v12, #o5, v7)`. Since these are provided with the same #o5, let's try to find a single #o5 that works for both. v3 at `((0.994, -0.157), (1.1, -0.052))` and v7 at `((0.539, -0.686), (0.677, -0.548))`. They are somewhat separated. It is possible a configuration like `(0.8, -0.4)` could be above both.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type v2 (which are v1, v3, v4) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type v6 (which are v5, v7, v8) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           
           We need to find valid configurations for `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           v17 is at `((0.367, 1.89), (0.466, 1.988))`. Obstacles: v19 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`, v20 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, v21 `((-0.266, 1.396), (-0.125, 1.537))`.
           The previous `#o3` configuration `(0.1, 1.5)` was in collision with v20 and v21. We need a configuration for v12 that is collision-free and provides an occlusion-free line of sight to v17 and v18. Let's try to get further away from the obstacles and still within imaging range (2 units).
           A configuration like `(0.7, 1.0)` might be better for #o3. It avoids v20 and v21 and has a clear view of v17/v18.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6):
           We need to sample rock v3 (type v2, at `((0.994, -0.157), (1.1, -0.052))`) and rock v7 (type v6, at `((0.539, -0.686), (0.677, -0.548))`).
           The previous `#o5` configuration `(0.8, -0.4)` was not reachable from v12's initial position v13 `(1.0, -1.75)`. Let's assume the rover needs to move to a position closer to the rocks, and then be 'above' them.
           Since v12 starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, a configuration like `(0.95, -0.2)` would be above v3. And for v7, a config like `(0.6, -0.6)` would be above it. It's likely that a single configuration `#o5` might not work for both if they are too far apart. Given they are listed with the same `#o5` in the initial state for the `above` predicate, it implies the system *might* find a single configuration that is above both, or it expects separate moves. For now, we will assume we can use two different `sample_rock` actions at the same symbolic `#o5`, and the continuous value for `#o5` will be chosen such that it's above both (or a compromise that lets it be above both without moving). But since the previous #o5 was unreachable, let's try a configuration for #o5 that is closer to v12's current position and between v3 and v7. For instance, `(0.8, -1.0)` is closer to v13 and might be reachable. From `(0.8, -1.0)`, it needs to move to be above v3 and v7. We will treat #o5 as a specific configuration for a single 'above' location for now. Let's reconsider sampling. Maybe rover v14 can sample rock v7 since it's closer to v14's starting config v15 `(-1.0, -1.75)`. But then we'd need to send the analysis from v14. Let's stick with v12 for now for all tasks.
           Let's choose `v3` for type `v2` and `v7` for type `v6`. We need a reachable position for v12 to be above `v3` and `v7`.
           `v3` (0.994, -0.157) and `v7` (0.539, -0.686). A position like `(0.8, -0.4)` for #o5 is between them. The problem stated it was unreachable. So perhaps we need to get closer to the objects. Let's try `(0.9, -0.1)` for sampling v3, and `(0.6, -0.6)` for sampling v7. Since the action definitions show `above(?v: object, ?q: object, ?r: object)`, it implies that the configuration `?q` (here #o5) must be specifically above `?r`. It is better to use distinct configurations if they are not near each other. But given the PDDL, it's ambiguous. Let's assume we can move to a point near both rocks.
           Let's try to set #o5 at `(0.8, -0.4)` again but ensure reachability. Since v12 is at `(1.0, -1.75)`, a direct move to `(0.8, -0.4)` might be tough. Let's try using a sequence of moves. For now, let's assume the planner finds a path to `(0.8, -0.4)`.
           
           For `comvisible`:
           Rover v12 has `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Lander v9 is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           v12 starts at v13 `(1.0, -1.75)`. The previous `#o0` configuration `(-0.5, -1.5)` was not reachable.
           To communicate with v9, we need to be within 4 units. Let's try to move v12 closer to v9. `(-0.8, -1.8)` would be closer to v9, and closer to v14's starting configuration `(-1.0, -1.75)`, which means it should be reachable. This position is also free from obstacles (v20 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`).
           
           Let's refine the plan with these new configurations:
           
           --Plan--:
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11)
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10)
           (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11)
           (move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11)
           (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11)
           (move v12 #o0 #o2 #o5)
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v3 v16)
           (sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16)
           (move v12 #o5 #o2 #o0)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v3)
           (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)
           
           --Configurations--:
           (#o0 v12 #o1 v9): (-0.8 -1.8)
           (#o3 v12 #o4 v17): (0.7 1.0)
           (#o5 v12 #o5 v3): (0.8 -0.4)

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.8 -1.8) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.7 1.0) for rover v12 at target v17 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (0.8 -0.4) for rover v12 at target v3 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0()` which is a conjunction of several conditions. Let's break down the conditions to understand what needs to be achieved:
           
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is already true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v17 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means rover v12 or v14 needs to take an image of v18 with camera v10 in mode v11 and send it to lander v9.
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` and `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type v2 (which are v1, v3, v4) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           8. `type(?soil, v6)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type v6 (which are v5, v7, v8) needs to be analyzed by a rover and the analysis sent to the lander.
           
           It seems the main issue is finding *reachable* configurations for rover v12. Rover v12 starts at `v13 (1.0, -1.75)`.
           
           Let's carefully consider reachability from v13 for each required configuration.
           
           For `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           Rover v12 has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           v17 is at `((0.367, 1.89), (0.466, 1.988))`.
           Obstacles: v19 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`, v20 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`, v21 `((-0.266, 1.396), (-0.125, 1.537))`.
           The target v17 is in the upper right quadrant. v12 starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. Moving to `(0.7, 1.0)` was not reachable. This indicates that moving across the entire scene might be difficult or impossible. Let's try to find a configuration for `v14` instead.
           Rover v14 starts at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`.
           v14 also has `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`.
           From `(-1.0, -1.75)`, reaching `(0.7, 1.0)` is also a big move. Let's try to approach v17 from a different direction for v14. To see v17/v18 from `v14`, let's try a configuration like `(0.0, 1.0)`. This might avoid v20 and v21 and be closer to v14's starting point. But `v20` is `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` which is a wall at x=0. So we cannot pass x=0 for v14. This means v14 cannot see v17 and v18.
           
           Therefore, v12 must be used for imaging. If v12 cannot reach positions to image v17 and v18, the goal is unreachable. Let's reconsider reachable configurations for v12.
           v12 at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           v17 at `(0.367, 1.89)`.
           Obstacles: v19 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))`, v20 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))`. The v20 obstacle means v12 cannot cross the x=0 line. So v12 is confined to x > 0.
           To see v17 `(0.367, 1.89)`, v12 needs to be in its vicinity. Since v19 `((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25))` is around v17, we need to find a clear spot.
           Let's try for #o3 a configuration like `(1.0, 1.0)`. This is closer to v12's initial x-coordinate and avoids v19 and v20. It should be reachable from `(1.0, -1.75)`. Max image range is 2. The distance from `(1.0, 1.0)` to `(0.4, 1.9)` (approximate center of v17) is sqrt((1.0-0.4)^2 + (1.0-1.9)^2) = sqrt(0.36 + 0.81) = sqrt(1.17) approx 1.08, which is within range.
           
           For `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (type v2) and `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (type v6):
           We need to sample rock v3 (type v2, at `((0.994, -0.157), (1.1, -0.052))`) and rock v7 (type v6, at `((0.539, -0.686), (0.677, -0.548))`).
           v12 starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
           For `#o5` (above rocks):
           To be above v3, `(1.0, -0.1)` could work.
           To be above v7, `(0.6, -0.6)` could work.
           These are relatively close to v12's starting position. A configuration like `(0.8, -0.4)` was tried but said to be unreachable. This is confusing given v12's starting position and the rock positions. Perhaps there's an unseen obstacle.
           Let's re-examine the given `above` predicates. `above(v12, #o5, v3)` and `above(v12, #o5, v7)`. This implies a single configuration #o5 must be above both. Given v3 is at x=1.0 and v7 at x=0.6, and v12 confined to x > 0, it is reasonable to expect a single reachable configuration for #o5 between `(0.6, -0.6)` and `(1.0, -0.1)`. Let's try `(0.8, -0.4)` again, assuming the previous unreachability was an error or a different interpretation. Or, perhaps the robot can't directly reach this point from v13 without a specific path. We will assume the motion planner can find a path for now and assign `(0.8, -0.4)` as the desired configuration for #o5. It's the only one that can potentially be "above" both given the pre-defined predicates.
           
           For `comvisible`:
           Rover v12 has `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. Lander v9 is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           v12 starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`. v20 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` acts as a wall. So v12 cannot cross x=0. Therefore, v12 cannot directly see v9, which is in the x < 0 region. This means rover v12 cannot send images or analysis to lander v9.
           
           This is a critical problem: If v12 cannot reach `v9` for `comvisible`, then `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions from v12 are impossible.
           Let's check if v14 can do the communication.
           v14 starts at `v15 (-1.0, -1.75)`. v20 `((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5))` means v14 is confined to x < 0.
           Lander v9 is at `((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`.
           v14 has `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           A configuration for `#o0` for v14 could be `(-1.5, -1.8)`. This is reachable for v14 and can see v9. Distance from `(-1.5, -1.8)` to `(-1.9, -2.0)` (approximate center of v9) is sqrt((-1.5 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.8 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(0.4^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.2) approx 0.45, well within range 4.
           
           So, the strategy must change:
           Rover v12 handles imaging and sampling, but cannot communicate.
           Rover v14 handles communication. But v14 cannot image v17 or v18 due to the x=0 wall.
           
           This means the task of sending images `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)` cannot be achieved, as v12 cannot send, and v14 cannot take the image.
           The goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` includes `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`. If these cannot be achieved, the entire goal is unreachable.
           
           Based on the obstacles and rover positions, Rover v12 (x > 0) cannot communicate with Lander v9 (x < 0) due to the v20 obstacle at x=0. Similarly, Rover v14 (x < 0) cannot image v17 or v18 (x > 0). This makes the goal unreachable.
           
           The `blocked(?y)` axiom implies that if `cfreerayconf(?y, ?v, ?q)` is false, then the ray is blocked. Since there is a wall at x=0, no rover can send/receive across this wall.
           Thus, v12 cannot send to v9, and v14 cannot image v17/v18.
           
           Conclusion: The goal is unreachable.
