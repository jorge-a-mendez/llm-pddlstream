           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:

           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom representing a complex state. Let's break down `new-axiom@0()`:
           
           `new-axiom@0()` is true if:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` is true. (Rover v12 is at configuration v13)
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)` is true. (Rover v14 is at configuration v15)
           3. `free(v12, v16)` is true. (Storage v16 on rover v12 is free)
           4. `free(v14, v16)` is true. (Storage v16 on rover v14 is free)
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is true. (Image of objective v17 received, taken with mode v11)
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is true. (Image of objective v18 received, taken with mode v11)
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` is true. (Some object is of type v2 (stone))
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` is true. (Analysis of that stone received)
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` is true. (Some object is of type v6 (soil))
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` is true. (Analysis of that soil received)
           
           Let's examine the initial state:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)` are already true.
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are already true.
           - `objective(v17)` and `objective(v18)` are true.
           - `mode(v11)` is true.
           - `type(v3, v2)`, `type(v1, v2)`, `type(v4, v2)` are true (v1, v3, v4 are stones).
           - `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v5, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)` are true (v5, v7, v8 are soils).
           
           So, the parts of the goal that are *not* initially satisfied are:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for any stone)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for any soil)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(objective, mode)`, we need to:
           1. `calibrate(rover, config, ray, objective, camera)`
           2. `take_image(rover, config, ray, objective, camera, mode)`
           3. `send_image(rover, config, ray, lander, objective, mode)`
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(rock)`, we need to:
           1. `sample_rock(rover, config, rock, store)`
           2. `send_analysis(rover, config, ray, lander, rock)`
           
           Let's plan for each unsatisfied part:
           
           **Images:**
           We need to get images of v17 and v18 in mode v11 and send them. Rover v12 has camera v10 which supports mode v11.
           Initial state:
           `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` (v9 is the lander)
           Also, `onboard(v10, v12)` and `supports(v10, v11)`.
           
           Plan for `receivedimage(v17, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10)`
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v17, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v17, v11)`
           
           Plan for `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           1. `calibrate(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10)` (This might require recalibration if the camera loses calibration, but the problem doesn't specify if calibration is lost when taking an image. Assuming it's lost and re-calibrated. If not, only one calibrate is needed for both objectives at the same config.)
           2. `take_image(v12, #o3, #o4, v18, v10, v11)`
           3. `send_image(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v18, v11)`
           
           **Analysis:**
           We need to analyze one stone (type v2) and one soil (type v6) and send the analysis.
           Let's pick v1 as a stone (rock(v1), type(v1, v2)) and v7 as a soil (rock(v7), type(v7, v6)).
           Both `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v7)` are true.
           `store(v16)` and `free(v12, v16)` are true.
           `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` is true.
           
           Plan for `receivedanalysis(v1)` (stone):
           1. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v1, v16)`
           2. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v1)`
           Since v16 is now full, we would need to drop the rock if we want to sample another, but we only need one of each type.
           
           Plan for `receivedanalysis(v7)` (soil):
           1. `drop_rock(v12, v16)` (Assuming the problem requires the storage to be free for new samples)
           2. `sample_rock(v12, #o5, v7, v16)`
           3. `send_analysis(v12, #o0, #o1, v9, v7)`
           
           Considering the sequence:
           We can do all image-related tasks first, then all analysis-related tasks, or interleave them. The current configuration v13 is `atconf(v12, v13)`. The continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are configurations for v12. We need to ensure that the chosen configurations are accessible. Since `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)` are in the initial state, we just need to ensure that moving to these configurations is possible. However, there are no `motion` actions available to move to these configurations, *only* `move v12 v13 #o2 v13` which is effectively a no-op, and `move v14 v15 #o2 v15`. This indicates that the actions `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` must all be executable from the current configuration `v13` or a configuration accessible from `v13`.
           
           Let's re-examine the continuous configurations:
           - `conf(v12, #o0)`: used in `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`
           - `conf(v12, #o3)`: used in `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`
           - `conf(v12, #o5)`: used in `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, `above(v12, #o5, v7)`, `above(v12, #o5, v4)`, `above(v12, #o5, v3)`, `above(v12, #o5, v1)`, `above(v12, #o5, v5)`
           
           Since the current configuration of v12 is `v13`, for `take_image`, `calibrate`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions to be executable, their configuration arguments (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) must be `v13`. If they are not `v13`, we would need `move` actions to reach them, but no such `move` actions are provided. This means that if we use these actions, the continuous parameters `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` must refer to the same configuration as `v13`.
           
           Therefore, the plan should assume that the rover v12 is at the same configuration (`v13`) for all these operations. The `#oX` values represent valid rays/configurations from `v13` for the respective operations.
           
           Let's construct the plan. We need to provide values for `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5` (rays and configurations for v12).
           
           A possible order to achieve the goal:
           1. Calibrate for v17.
           2. Take image of v17.
           3. Send image of v17.
           4. Calibrate for v18.
           5. Take image of v18.
           6. Send image of v18.
           7. Sample rock (v1).
           8. Send analysis of rock (v1).
           9. Drop rock from storage.
           10. Sample soil (v7).
           11. Send analysis of soil (v7).
           
           Since the goal requires `type(?stone, v2)` and `type(?soil, v6)`, and we have `v1` (stone) and `v7` (soil), we can use these.
           
           It's important that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are distinct configurations if used for different types of actions, or if the same action type requires different poses (e.g., imaging two different objects from different vantage points). However, given the constraint on available move actions, it implies that the rover does not change its base configuration. Thus, `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` must all refer to the same base configuration as `v13`. The values will be for the *ray* and *configuration* to satisfy the predicates.
           
           Let's assume `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are different continuous parameters that represent suitable configurations/rays from `v12`'s perspective at `v13`.
           
           For the configurations:
           - `#o0`: for `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` (rover v12, target lander v9)
           - `#o3`: for `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` (rover v12, target objectives v17 and v18)
           - `#o5`: for `above(v12, #o5, v1)` and `above(v12, #o5, v7)` (rover v12, target rocks v1 and v7)
           
           The `conf` predicates in the initial state for these continuous parameters indicate their availability.
           `conf(v12, #o0)`
           `conf(v12, #o3)`
           `conf(v12, #o5)`
           
           Let's select configurations that are reasonable from v13 (1.0, -1.75).
           v17 (objective): ((0.367, 1.89), (0.466, 1.988))
           v18 (objective): ((-1.986, 2.142), (-1.913, 2.215))
           v9 (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           v1 (rock/stone): ((-1.19, 0.745), (-1.115, 0.82))
           v7 (rock/soil): ((0.539, -0.686), (0.677, -0.548))
           
           For `imagevisible` (max dist 2), `comvisible` (max dist 4).
           Rover v12 is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `#o3` (imaging v17): v17 is at (0.416, 1.939). From (1.0, -1.75) to (0.416, 1.939), distance is sqrt((1.0-0.416)^2 + (-1.75-1.939)^2) = sqrt(0.584^2 + (-3.689)^2) = sqrt(0.341 + 13.608) = sqrt(13.949) approx 3.73. This is too far for imagevisible (max dist 2).
           
           This implies that some of the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates with continuous parameters starting with '#' might be impossible to satisfy from the given fixed configuration `v13` for rover `v12`, or `v15` for rover `v14`.
           Let's recheck the problem statement: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration such that, given the geometry of the scene, the configuration is collision-free for the rover, reachable from the rover's current configuration, and has occlusion-free line-of-sight to the target object in the fourth argument in the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate."
           
           The crucial part is "reachable from the rover's current configuration". Since there are no `move` actions for `v12` to a different configuration, `v13` is its "current configuration". This means `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` must be equal to `v13`.
           
           Let's re-calculate distances:
           - Rover `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - Objective `v17` at approx (0.416, 1.939). Distance ~3.73 (too far for image).
           - Objective `v18` at approx (-1.949, 2.178). Distance ~4.77 (too far for image).
           - Lander `v9` at approx (-1.9, -2.0). Distance from v13 (1.0, -1.75) is sqrt((1.0 - (-1.9))^2 + (-1.75 - (-2.0))^2) = sqrt(2.9^2 + 0.25^2) = sqrt(8.41 + 0.0625) = sqrt(8.4725) ~ 2.91. This is within comvisible range (max dist 4). So `comvisible(v12, v13, #o1, v9)` could be true.
           
           - Rover `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - Objective `v17` at approx (0.416, 1.939). Distance from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) is sqrt((0.416 - (-1.0))^2 + (1.939 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(1.416^2 + 3.689^2) = sqrt(2.00 + 13.608) = sqrt(15.608) ~ 3.95. This is too far for image.
           - Objective `v18` at approx (-1.949, 2.178). Distance from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) is sqrt((-1.949 - (-1.0))^2 + (2.178 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(-0.949^2 + 3.928^2) = sqrt(0.90 + 15.429) = sqrt(16.329) ~ 4.04. This is too far for image.
           - Lander `v9` at approx (-1.9, -2.0). Distance from v15 (-1.0, -1.75) is sqrt((-1.9 - (-1.0))^2 + (-2.0 - (-1.75))^2) = sqrt(-0.9^2 + -0.25^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0625) = sqrt(0.8725) ~ 0.93. This is within comvisible range (max dist 4). So `comvisible(v14, v15, #o1, v9)` could be true.
           
           It appears the `imagevisible` predicates might not be satisfiable from the existing `v13` or `v15` configurations if `#o3` must be `v13` or `v15`. However, the PDDL initial state *explicitly states* `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v18)`, `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v17)`. This implies that there *exists* a continuous configuration for `#o3` (which is reachable from the rover's current configuration, given the rules, must be `v13` or `v15` respectively for `v12` and `v14`) from which these objectives are image visible. This contradicts my distance calculation, but since it is given in the initial state, we *must* assume it is true and that the parameters can be found. The prompt says "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." and "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate in the initial state OR is the second argument to a `comvisible` predicate in the initial state, then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". This means that such configurations (e.g. #o3) are valid configurations for the rover (v12 or v14) to be at to satisfy `imagevisible`. It does not explicitly state that `#o3` must be `v13`. The prompt just says "reachable from the rover's current configuration". Since there are no moves available, the "current configuration" is `v13` for `v12`. So, we must assume `#o3` (and `#o0`, `#o5`) are indeed `v13` for rover `v12` and `v15` for rover `v14`.
           
           Given the explicit presence of `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates in the initial state, despite the distances I calculated, I will proceed assuming the provided action instances are valid if their preconditions (including `imagevisible` and `comvisible` as stated) are met. The continuous parameters like `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are specified as configurations for the rover, for which `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)` are true in the initial state. Since there are no `move` actions that change the rover's configuration to one of these `#oX` values, these `#oX` values *must* be identical to `v13` (for rover `v12`) or `v15` (for rover `v14`).
           
           Therefore, for `v12`, the configurations for imaging/communicating/sampling are all `v13`.
           For `v14`, the configurations for imaging/communicating/sampling are all `v15`.
           
           Let's re-confirm that for rover `v12` at `v13`:
           - `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v17)`
           - `imagevisible(v12, v13, #o4, v18)`
           - `comvisible(v12, v13, #o1, v9)`
           - `above(v12, v13, v1)`
           - `above(v12, v13, v7)`
           
           This interpretation is consistent with the lack of move actions for `#oX` configurations.
           The problem requires me to give values for `#o0`, `#o1`, `#o3`, `#o4`, `#o5`.
           Since `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` must be `v13` for rover `v12` (as there are no moves), I will provide the coordinates of `v13` for these.
           `v13` is (1.0, -1.75).
           `v15` is (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           For `#o0`: associated with `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`. So #o0=v13. Target `v9`
           For `#o3`: associated with `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)`. So #o3=v13. Targets `v17`, `v18`.
           For `#o5`: associated with `above(v12, #o5, v8)`, etc. So #o5=v13. Targets `v1`, `v7`.
           
           The rays `rays` `#o1` and `#o4` need to be provided as well. These are from the rover's configuration to the target.
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Target `v9` (lander) is at (-1.9, -2.0).
           Ray `#o1` from (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           Target `v17` (objective) is at (0.416, 1.939).
           Target `v18` (objective) is at (-1.949, 2.178).
           Ray `#o4` from (1.0, -1.75) to (0.416, 1.939) for v17.
           Ray `#o4` from (1.0, -1.75) to (-1.949, 2.178) for v18.
           Since `#o4` is a single ray, it cannot point to both v17 and v18. This is an issue with the provided PDDL, as `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v18)` both use the same ray `#o4`. This implies that `v17` and `v18` must be in the same line of sight from `v12` at `#o3`. However, their coordinates are quite different. This is a common simplification in PDDL domains, where the ray only implies existence of line of sight. I will choose one of them for the ray value, or acknowledge this ambiguity. For now, I will assume the provided PDDL state and action definitions are consistent. I will provide values for the rays assuming they exist.
           
           Let's assume the ray is pointing towards the average center of v17 and v18 for `#o4` if both are visible. Or, more simply, it is a ray that works for one and then we assume it works for the other because the PDDL says it does. Given the prompt's instruction: "If your plan requires multiple different (rover, target object) pairs to satisfy the `imagevisible` or `comvisible` predicate, then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair (not one that works for all), specifying the configuration name, rover name, and target object name." This implies if `#o4` must be different for v17 and v18, I would need to provide a new value (e.g., `#o4-v17`, `#o4-v18`). But the initial state uses `#o4` for both. This means that `#o4` *must* be suitable for both `v17` and `v18` at configuration `#o3`.
           
           Let's just compute rays as (target_x - rover_x, target_y - rover_y).
           For `#o1` (v12, v9): (-1.9 - 1.0, -2.0 - (-1.75)) = (-2.9, -0.25)
           For `#o4` (v12, v17): (0.416 - 1.0, 1.939 - (-1.75)) = (-0.584, 3.689)
           For `#o4` (v12, v18): (-1.949 - 1.0, 2.178 - (-1.75)) = (-2.949, 3.928)
           Since both v17 and v18 are visible via `#o4`, I'll use the one for v17 as the ray value as it's the first in the initial state predicates.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10) , (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v17 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v17 v11) , (calibrate v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10) , (take_image v12 v13 #o4 v18 v10 v11) , (send_image v12 v13 #o1 v9 v18 v11) , (sample_rock v12 v13 v1 v16) , (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v1) , (sample_rock v12 v13 v7 v16) , (send_analysis v12 v13 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous response incorrectly assumed that actions other than `move` and `drop_rock` were allowed. The valid action instances list provided in the problem statement is extremely limited, only containing `move` (self-loop, effectively no-op) and `drop_rock` actions. None of the actions necessary to take images, send images, sample rocks, or send analyses are available in the provided `valid action instances` list.
           
           Let's re-examine the goal `new-axiom@0()` and the initial state, considering only the truly valid actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` (True in initial state)
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)` (True in initial state)
           3. `free(v12, v16)` (True in initial state)
           4. `free(v14, v16)` (True in initial state)
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` (False in initial state)
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)` (False in initial state)
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` (True for v1, v3, v4 in initial state)
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (False in initial state)
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` (True for v5, v7, v8 in initial state)
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (False in initial state)
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(...)`, actions like `calibrate`, `take_image`, and `send_image` are required.
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(...)`, actions like `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` are required.
           
           None of these required actions (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are present in the list of `valid action instances`. The only actions available are `move` (which does not change the state apart from satisfying a motion predicate for cost, but here it's a self-loop so it doesn't change `atconf`) and `drop_rock`. `drop_rock` requires `full(v, s)`, which is not true in the initial state (`free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` are true), so `drop_rock` cannot be executed initially. Even if it could, it only modifies `free/full` predicates, not `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Since the initial state does not satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` parts of the goal, and there are no valid actions to achieve these predicates, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The prompt states: "If the goal is not achievable from the initial state, in which case you should not return any plan and simply explain why the goal is not achievable."
           
           The goal is not achievable because the necessary actions to produce images and analyses (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are not available in the provided list of valid action instances.
