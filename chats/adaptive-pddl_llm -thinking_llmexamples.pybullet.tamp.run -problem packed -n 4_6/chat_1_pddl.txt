           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning:**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to get `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all "on" `v18`. The key is that "on" means supported and at a specific pose.  Initially, the objects are on `v11`.  I need to get them to the right "on" state on `v18`.  Since I'm an expert, I'm already visualizing the moves.
           
           First, I looked at the basic *actions* I have:  `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Clean and cook aren't relevant (no sinks or stoves).  `Move_base` *seems* useless – the one instance I have moves the base from `v3` to `v3`! So, I'm cautiously assuming it is a no-op, but the base configuration can still be important. Pick and place are the tools for the job.
           
           The *goal* is to have those four objects at specific *poses* supported by `v18`. The *axioms* tell me 'on' means the right support and *pose*. So, for each object (let's say `o`), I need to get it at some pose `#o2` where `supported(o, #o2, v18)` is true.
           
           I have *kinematic* information -  `kin(arm, object, current_pose, grasp, base_conf, trajectory)`. Importantly, all the `kin` instances use the same grasp and base configuration (`#o1`, `#o3`). This is where it gets tricky. I have `atbconf(v3)` in the initial state. The  `kin` predicates use `#o3`, however, the available `basemotion` action (`(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`)  indicates `#o3` is `v3` since I don't see any other way to change base configurations. Without any motion provided to set `#o3` to some other value, the plan is unsolvable. I am now proceeding with the understanding that `#o3` represents the existing robot configuration `v3`.
           
           I also have *safety* to think about – the `unsafe` conditions.  I see `NegatedAtom unsafe...` in the preconditions for pick and place. Since there are no `unsafe` facts in the initial state, I'm *assuming* the specified trajectory and the poses are safe. This is typical, that the continuous planner needs to take care of the safety aspects.
           
           My plan structure will be simple. For each object `o`, I'll:
           
           1.  **Pick** it from its current pose.
           2.  **Place** it at the new pose `#o2` "on" `v18`.
           
           So, it's essentially a series of pick-and-place actions for each object using arm `v4`. I will assume that it's possible for all 4 objects to occupy the pose on `v18`. If this wasn't true, or if there was an unsafe placement action, this would be unsolvable without further information! This, I believe, is a safe assumption given the overall problem and standard TAMP practices, for the same pose.
           
           Let's trace:
           
           **1.  Move `v8`** (I'm skipping the detailed pre/post conditions, but that's what I'm running through)
               *   Pick `v8` from pose `v9`
               *   Place `v8` at pose `#o2` "on" `v18`
           
           **2.  Move `v12`**
               *   Pick `v12` from pose `v13`
               *   Place `v12` at pose `#o2` "on" `v18`
           
           **3.  Move `v14`**
               *   Pick `v14` from pose `v15`
               *   Place `v14` at pose `#o2` "on" `v18`
           
           **4.  Move `v16`**
               *   Pick `v16` from pose `v17`
               *   Place `v16` at pose `#o2` "on" `v18`
           
           Once I've done those steps, all four objects will be in the right `on(o, v18)` state, and the goal is achieved!   I'm confident this plan works, given the interpretations I have made.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a flawed plan, and I've identified the root of the problem. The user's right; the only valid action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. That's not helpful at all, just a movement from a base to the *same* base. It consumes `canmove()`, which is important to note.
           
           The goal is to get several objects `on` a target object (`v18`). I know `on` is defined in terms of `supported` and `atpose`, and thankfully, the `supported` preconditions are already satisfied in the initial state. Great! That means I need to make the objects be `atpose(#o2)`.
           
           But here's the kicker: The only available action, the pointless base movement, *does absolutely nothing* to change the `atpose` of any object. It doesn't pick, place, or manipulate anything except the base, which doesn't affect the object positions. My initial state has `atpose` predicates, but they don't help me reach my end goal.
           
           Given these constraints – the useless action and the necessary changes to `atpose` – I'm forced to conclude that this goal is utterly unreachable within the current action set. The plan is fundamentally flawed, and I need a different approach.
