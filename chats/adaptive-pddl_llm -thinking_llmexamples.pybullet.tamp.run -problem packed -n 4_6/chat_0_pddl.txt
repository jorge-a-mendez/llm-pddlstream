               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is straightforward: to place objects `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` all onto object `v18`. From the initial state, I can see that all these objects are currently supported by `v11`.  This is a classic object manipulation task, and my expertise immediately tells me I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions to accomplish this.
           
           Looking at the problem description, I recognize the standard components: robot arms, base configurations, object poses, grasps, and support relationships. The initial state provides all the necessary details for each object, specifically that they are currently "on" object `v11`.
           
           Now, the crucial part: action availability. I'm provided with a severely limited set of actions: a single `move_base` action that essentially does nothing useful. The constraint explicitly states that any action *not* in this list is forbidden. The *essential* `pick` and `place` actions, the actions needed to achieve my goal, are simply *not* present.
           
           Therefore, given this extremely restrictive set of allowed actions, the problem is immediately unsolvable. I cannot manipulate any of these objects. I'm stuck, or, rather, the robot is. The goal is provably unreachable.
