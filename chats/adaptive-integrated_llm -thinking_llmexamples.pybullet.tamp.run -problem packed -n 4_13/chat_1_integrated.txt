User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.19, 0.322), (-0.095, 0.417)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.128, -0.334), (0.22, -0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.075, -0.483, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.32, 0.947).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.241, 0.029, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.325, 0.946).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.142, 0.37, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.971, -0.239).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.174, -0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.548, 0.836).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.026, -0.532), (0.124, -0.434)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.191, -0.021), (0.29, 0.078)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Planning for Object Relocation**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to move four objects (v8, v12, v14, v16) from their initial positions to the surface v18 using a single robot arm (v4) and base (v3). The robot is initially handempty and at a specific base and arm configuration. The starting conditions describe the location of each object supported by the initial surface (v11), with all objects being graspable. The objective is to place each object onto v18.
           
           To achieve this, I will adopt a simple, direct strategy:
           
           1.  **Object Selection**: I will individually pick each object, one at a time, to be placed on v18.
           2.  **Pick and Place**: The "pick" action, using known kinematic solutions based on object and robot configurations, will remove each object from its initial location. The subsequent "place" action will position each object on v18. The available `kin` predicates provide the necessary information for both picking and placing the objects.
           3.  **Pose Determination**: The crucial aspect is finding safe, non-colliding positions on v18. Given the initial state, the objects are situated on a supporting surface v11. The dimensions of v18 are relatively compact (0.27m x 0.27m). I will organize the objects in a 2x2 grid on v18 to prevent collisions.
           
           For object poses on v18:
           
           *   I must carefully assign precise, continuous values for the pose of each object (`#o2`) on surface v18.
           *   The placement locations are determined by a 2x2 grid pattern on v18 to make sure that each object is collision-free with respect to the other objects. I will use the initial z-value (0.781) and assume an object half-height of 0.05 (for typical object) for the final z-value (0.831).
           
           Given that the current base configuration is `atbconf(v3)`, which corresponds to the base configuration for picking and placing with `kin`, no intermediate base movements are necessary. The available `move_base` action does not alter the robot's base configuration.
           
           With these steps, I can ensure a successful relocation of each object to the target surface.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **The Problem's Core**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a planning problem, and it's pretty clear where it's going wrong. The user flagged that my plan, as it stands, relies on actions – 'pick' and 'place' – that simply aren't in the toolkit I've been handed. The only thing I *can* do, according to this list of "valid action instances," is a single movement: `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  That's just a pointless little shimmy, a tiny shift in the base configuration that doesn't affect the world state at all. 
           
           Now, the objective is to get these four objects, `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`,  onto `v18`.  That requires picking them up and putting them down, which relies heavily on those forbidden primitives, `pick` and `place`. So, unless I can bend reality, the goal is unreachable with the current rules. It's a fundamental mismatch between what I *need* to do and what I'm *allowed* to do. I need to inform the user that this isn't possible given the current constraints.
