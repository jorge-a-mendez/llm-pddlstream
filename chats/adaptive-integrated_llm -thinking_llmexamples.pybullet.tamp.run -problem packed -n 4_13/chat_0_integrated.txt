User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.19, 0.322), (-0.095, 0.417)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.128, -0.334), (0.22, -0.242)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.075, -0.483, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.32, 0.947).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.241, 0.029, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.325, 0.946).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.142, 0.37, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.971, -0.239).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.174, -0.288, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.548, 0.836).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.026, -0.532), (0.124, -0.434)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.191, -0.021), (0.29, 0.078)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v18)
               Atom on(v12, v18)
               Atom on(v14, v18)
               Atom on(v16, v18)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Infeasibility Analysis: A Clear Limitation**
           
           Okay, I've got a handle on the situation. The core of this problem hinges on a stark constraint: the only available action is `move_base v3 v3 #o0`. This means the robot's base configuration can only move from `v3` to itself.  I'm dealing with a scenario where the robot *cannot* manipulate the objects.
           
           Let's break down the implications.  I've got four objects: `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`. The goal is to have all of them supported *on* `v18`. Initially, all four objects are supported *on* `v11`.  My understanding is that "on" entails both support *and* the object being at the corresponding pose.
           
           To achieve this, I'd *need* pick-and-place actions, right?  The robot would have to:
           
           1.  Pick up `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16`.
           2.  Move those objects (or the arms) from their current locations, `v11`, to `v18`.
           3.  Place `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, and `v16` *on* `v18`.
           
           However, the action list provided explicitly *excludes* pick and place actions. It only allows the base movement, which is completely irrelevant to the goal's requirements.
           
           The objects can be stacked on `v10` or `v18`. But, since the robot can't pick the objects, it can't place them on either surface. There is no possibility of achieving the desired outcome with the given action set.
           
           Therefore, given the constraints, the goal of `on(v8, v18)`, `on(v12, v18)`, `on(v14, v18)`, and `on(v16, v18)` is *unreachable*. I need to articulate this clearly and concisely. There is no valid plan.
