           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve the Goal**
           
           Okay, let me lay out my thinking here. My primary objective is to develop a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()` from the provided initial state, utilizing only the permitted actions.
           
           First, I break down the goal `new-axiom@0()`. Examining its definition, I see it's a conjunction of several conditions: `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates, along with type assertions for stones and soils.
           
           I verify that the initial state satisfies the conditions for `atconf` and `free`. However, the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` conditions are not met initially.
           
           To satisfy `receivedimage(objective, mode)`, I'd need the `send_image` action, which requires `haveimage`.  Similarly, for `receivedanalysis(?r)`, I'd need `send_analysis`, which relies on `analyzed`.
           
           Now, I look at the available actions: `move` and `drop_rock`.  Crucially, neither `send_image`, `take_image`, `sample_rock`, nor `send_analysis` are in the allowed action instances.
           
           Considering the preconditions of the required actions (send_image and send_analysis), it's evident that I cannot fulfill the goal `new-axiom@0()` with the permitted actions. The necessary actions to generate `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` are simply not available.  Therefore, I conclude that achieving the goal from the given initial state is impossible.
           
           I have thoroughly examined the initial state and confirmed that no inherent conditions within it satisfy any of the unsatisfied goal components.
           
           My analysis confirms the impossibility: with the given action set, I cannot generate the needed `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates and therefore, `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable.
