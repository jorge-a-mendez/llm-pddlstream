           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, let's break down this plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My initial goal is to make an object of type `v17` be `on` object `v18`.  The current state tells me `v12` is of type `v17` and needs to be placed `on` `v18`. I also see that `v12` is initially located at pose `v13` and supported at pose `#p1` on `v18`.  Since I need to satisfy `on(v12,v18)`, I must achieve `atpose(v12, ?p)` with respect to `v18`.  The initial state provides that the robot arm can move to pose `p1`.
           
           Therefore, my plan needs the following key steps:
           1.  Move the base to a suitable location near object `v12` to allow picking and then near object `v18` for placement.
           2.  Pick `v12` from its current location `v13` using the arm `v4`.
           3.  Place `v12` at pose `#p1` on `v18` with the arm `v4`.
           
           Let me examine the available actions: `pick` and `place`. I'll also likely need to move the base because the initial state has the base at `v3`, but the `pick` action requires being at base conf `q2` and the `place` action requires being at base conf `q3`.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           *   **Step 1:  Move Base**
               *   Current Base Location: `v3`
               *   Desired Base Location: `#q2` (for picking)
               *   Action: `move_base(v3, #q2, #t5)`
               *   This is possible because `basemotion(v3, #t5, #q2)` is in the initial state.
           *   **Step 2: Pick Object**
               *   Action:  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t4)`
               *   All preconditions are met by initial state and previous step's action: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty` and the previous move_base step's effects and implicit negations.
           *   **Step 3: Move Base**
               *   Current Base Location: `#q2`
               *   Desired Base Location: `#q3` (for placing)
               *   Action:  `move_base(#q2, #q3, #o0)`
               *   This is possible because `basemotion(#q2, #o0, #q3)` is present.
           *   **Step 4: Place Object**
               *   Action:  `place(v4, v12, #p1, #g1, #q3, #t6)`
               *   The robot must be at a base conf `q3` and that has been satisfied in the previous move base step and the actions are applicable.
           
           After step 4, `atpose(v12, #p1)` is true,  and since `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is also true (from the initial state), I'll have `on(v12, v18)` satisfied. The initial state had `type(v12, v17)`. So the goal `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination:**
           The continuous pose `#p1` for `v12` on `v18` will be the centroid of `v18`. I'm calculating the pose from the given AABB of `v18`.
           
           `v18` AABB: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           
           *   X: (4.2 + 4.8) / 2 = 4.5
           *   Y: (-0.6 + 0.0) / 2 = -0.3
           *   Z: 0.8 (assumed table height for placement)
           *   theta: 0.0 radians
           *  Therefore `#p1` is  `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Cost Considerations:**
           There's a cost associated with the `pick` and `place` actions (1 each) and with each base motion. Since I will need to move the base twice, that impacts the overall trajectory cost. I am assuming

Model:     **Okay, let's break down this plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`:**
           
           My initial goal is to make an object of type `v17` be `on` object `v18`.  The current state tells me `v12` is of type `v17` and needs to be placed `on` `v18`. I also see that `v12` is initially located at pose `v13` and supported at pose `#p1` on `v18`.  Since I need to satisfy `on(v12,v18)`, I must achieve `atpose(v12, ?p)` with respect to `v18`.  The initial state provides that the robot arm can move to pose `p1`.
           
           Therefore, my plan needs the following key steps:
           1.  Move the base to a suitable location near object `v12` to allow picking and then near object `v18` for placement.
           2.  Pick `v12` from its current location `v13` using the arm `v4`.
           3.  Place `v12` at pose `#p1` on `v18` with the arm `v4`.
           
           Let me examine the available actions: `pick` and `place`. I'll also likely need to move the base because the initial state has the base at `v3`, but the `pick` action requires being at base conf `q2` and the `place` action requires being at base conf `q3`.
           
           Here's the detailed plan I've come up with:
           
           *   **Step 1:  Move Base**
               *   Current Base Location: `v3`
               *   Desired Base Location: `#q2` (for picking)
               *   Action: `move_base(v3, #q2, #t5)`
               *   This is possible because `basemotion(v3, #t5, #q2)` is in the initial state.
           *   **Step 2: Pick Object**
               *   Action:  `pick(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t4)`
               *   All preconditions are met by initial state and previous step's action: `kin`, `atpose`, `handempty` and the previous move_base step's effects and implicit negations.
           *   **Step 3: Move Base**
               *   Current Base Location: `#q2`
               *   Desired Base Location: `#q3` (for placing)
               *   Action:  `move_base(#q2, #q3, #o0)`
               *   This is possible because `basemotion(#q2, #o0, #q3)` is present.
           *   **Step 4: Place Object**
               *   Action:  `place(v4, v12, #p1, #g1, #q3, #t6)`
               *   The robot must be at a base conf `q3` and that has been satisfied in the previous move base step and the actions are applicable.
           
           After step 4, `atpose(v12, #p1)` is true,  and since `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` is also true (from the initial state), I'll have `on(v12, v18)` satisfied. The initial state had `type(v12, v17)`. So the goal `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied.
           
           **Continuous Parameter Determination:**
           The continuous pose `#p1` for `v12` on `v18` will be the centroid of `v18`. I'm calculating the pose from the given AABB of `v18`.
           
           `v18` AABB: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           
           *   X: (4.2 + 4.8) / 2 = 4.5
           *   Y: (-0.6 + 0.0) / 2 = -0.3
           *   Z: 0.8 (assumed table height for placement)
           *   theta: 0.0 radians
           *  Therefore `#p1` is  `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           **Cost Considerations:**
           There's a cost associated with the `pick` and `place` actions (1 each) and with each base motion. Since I will need to move the base twice, that impacts the overall trajectory cost. I am assuming
