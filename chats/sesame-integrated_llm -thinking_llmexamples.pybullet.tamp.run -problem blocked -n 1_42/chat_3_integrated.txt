           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Summary of Planning Process**
           
           Okay, here's my thought process on this planning problem, given that I'm aiming for the goal `new-axiom@0()` and I'm very familiar with robotics and planning. First, I broke down the goal, which simplifies to `on(v12, v18)`. Knowing this means I need to get object `v12` onto surface `v18`, I expanded this further to `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Since the initial state provides `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`, I understand that `#o2` represents the target pose of `v12` on `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was: I need to pick up `v12` from its current pose `v13` and place it at the target pose `#o2` on `v18`. From the available actions, it seems that the correct sequence of action steps would be to first move the robot's base using `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`, then pick with `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and finally place with `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`.
           
           Now, the tricky part. The problem demands a continuous pose for `#o2`. I need to choose an actual position for `v12` on `v18`. Looking at the provided AABBs, I determined `v18` is a table-like surface. After evaluating the table location to be at a height of z=0.8, I'm thinking of placing `v12` near the center of `v18` with coordinates `x = 4.5`, `y = -0.3` and the inferred table height  `z = 0.8`. Thus, `#o2 = 4.5 -0.3 0.8 0.0`.
           
           The biggest sticking point is the assumption that the same base configuration `#o3` must be used for both the pick and place. Due to the very large distance between v13 and #o2. The base movement between `pick` and `place` is not allowed. In this situation, the base configuration `#o3` must allow the robot arm to reach *both* v13 and #o2.
           
           Since the base cannot move between the pick and place, `#o3` is a specific and somewhat abstract base configuration that needs to enable both operations. Given the provided `kin` predicates, I had to assume that `#o3` can reach both `v13` and `#o2` within the kinematics of the PR2 robot. I checked the preconditions for each action, and the plan seems correct.
           
           Final Plan: 
           1. `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`
           2. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3. `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           and, finally I assigned `#o2` as a pose for the object `v12` on `v18 = (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           That should do it.
