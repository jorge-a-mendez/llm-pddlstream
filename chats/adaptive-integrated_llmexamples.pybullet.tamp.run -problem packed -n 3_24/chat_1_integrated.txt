User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.216, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.453, 0.891).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.065, 0.451, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.195).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.184, -0.35), (-0.093, -0.259)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.265, 0.174), (-0.168, 0.272)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.139, -0.305, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.554, 0.833).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.019, 0.406), (0.111, 0.497)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on v16. We are given the initial positions of v8, v12, and v14.
           From the initial state, we know the following:
           - `arm(v4)` and `arm(v6)`: The robot has two arms, v4 and v6.
           - `aconf(v4, v5)` and `aconf(v6, v7)`: The arms are in configurations v5 and v7 respectively.
           - `bconf(v3)`: The robot's base is in configuration v3.
           - `handempty(v4)` and `handempty(v6)`: Both hands are empty.
           - `atbconf(v3)`, `ataconf(v4, v5)`, `ataconf(v6, v7)`: The robot is currently in these configurations.
           - `canmove()`: The robot can move.
           - `graspable(v14)`, `graspable(v8)`, `graspable(v12)`: Objects v14, v8, and v12 can be grasped.
           - `stackable(v14, v16)`, `stackable(v12, v16)`, `stackable(v8, v16)`: All three objects can be stacked on v16.
           - `atpose(v14, v15)`: v14 is at pose v15.
           - `atpose(v12, v13)`: v12 is at pose v13.
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`: v8 is at pose v9.
           - `supported(v14, v15, v11)`, `supported(v12, v13, v11)`, `supported(v8, v9, v11)`: All three objects are supported by v11 at their current poses.
           - `pose(v14, #o2)`, `pose(v12, #o2)`, `pose(v8, #o2)`: There is a common symbolic pose `#o2` for all three objects.
           - `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`: This indicates that `#o2` is a valid pose on v16 for all three objects. This is the pose we need to compute.
           - `grasp(v14, #o1)`, `grasp(v12, #o1)`, `grasp(v8, #o1)`: There is a common symbolic grasp `#o1` for all three objects.
           - `kin(...)` facts for `v4` and the objects with their current poses and the target pose `#o2`, along with symbolic grasp `#o1`, base conf `#o3`, and arm traj `#o4`.
           
           The goal is `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. This means we need to pick up each object and place it on v16. Since there is only one `move_base` action instance, and it leads to no change in configuration and has no cost, it's likely that we can solve this problem without moving the base. The base configuration `#o3` and arm trajectory `#o4` must be resolved by the `kin` predicates. Since the `atbconf` is `v3` and the only `basemotion` is `(v3, #o0, v3)`, it's safe to assume `#o3` should be `v3`.
           
           We can pick and place objects using arm `v4`. We need to define `o2` as a collision-free placement on `v16` for each object. Since we are placing all three objects on the same surface `v16`, we need to ensure that the placed objects do not collide with each other. We will compute a pose for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. Since `v16` has AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`, we can place the objects within this region. The order of placement matters, as previously placed objects become obstacles. We will place them in sequence from left to right on the surface `v16`.
           
           Here's the plan:
           1. Pick `v14` from `v15` using arm `v4`.
           2. Place `v14` at `#o2_v14` on `v16`.
           3. Pick `v12` from `v13` using arm `v4`.
           4. Place `v12` at `#o2_v12` on `v16`.
           5. Pick `v8` from `v9` using arm `v4`.
           6. Place `v8` at `#o2_v8` on `v16`.
           
           For the continuous values, we need to provide collision-free poses for `#o2` on `v16`. We will assign distinct poses for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`. `v16` is a square, so we can place them along one edge or simply space them out.
           
           `v14` AABB: `((-0.265, 0.174), (-0.168, 0.272))`
           `v12` AABB: `((0.019, 0.406), (0.111, 0.497))`
           `v8` AABB: `((-0.184, -0.35), (-0.093, -0.259))`
           `v16` AABB: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`
           
           The `z` coordinate for placement should be `0.781` (same as current objects), plus the height of the object. Since we don't have object heights directly, and the initial poses are all at `z=0.781`, we assume that `0.781` is the z-coordinate for placing objects on `v16`.
           
           Let's find the centers and widths of the objects.
           `v14`: Center x = (-0.265 - 0.168)/2 = -0.2165. Width x = 0.265 - 0.168 = 0.097. Center y = (0.174 + 0.272)/2 = 0.223. Width y = 0.272 - 0.174 = 0.098.
           `v12`: Center x = (0.019 + 0.111)/2 = 0.065. Width x = 0.111 - 0.019 = 0.092. Center y = (0.406 + 0.497)/2 = 0.4515. Width y = 0.497 - 0.406 = 0.091.
           `v8`: Center x = (-0.184 - 0.093)/2 = -0.1385. Width x = 0.184 - 0.093 = 0.091. Center y = (-0.35 - 0.259)/2 = -0.3045. Width y = 0.35 - 0.259 = 0.091.
           
           Since the goal only requires `on(o, v16)`, and `v16` is a dummy surface (no AABB), we will interpret `v16` as having the default surface bounds or use another provided surface as a placeholder. However, the initial state gives `v16` an AABB. So we should place them within the bounds of `v16`.
           
           Let's compute poses for `v8`, `v12`, `v14` on `v16`. We'll place them next to each other along the x-axis, centered on the y-axis of v16.
           v16 x-range: [-0.135, 0.135], y-range: [-0.135, 0.135]
           
           We can place them side by side on v16, assuming the `z` coordinate is `0.781`.
           Let's make some simple poses in the middle of v16.
           Object `v14` (width approx 0.1) can be placed at x=-0.08, y=0.0.
           Object `v12` (width approx 0.09) can be placed at x=0.0, y=0.0.
           Object `v8` (width approx 0.09) can be placed at x=0.08, y=0.0.
           We need to ensure these don't collide and are within `v16`.
           
           Let's use a systematic placement:
           1. `v14` at `(-0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           2. `v12` at `(0.0, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)` (This would overlap with v14 as v14 is 0.1 wide. Let's adjust).
           Let's space them along the x-axis within v16.
           `v16` range: `x: [-0.135, 0.135]`, `y: [-0.135, 0.135]`. Total x-width of `v16` is 0.27.
           Objects have widths of about 0.1. So, three objects will take 0.3, which is larger than 0.27. This means we cannot place them all side-by-side perfectly centered along the x-axis if they were to face the same direction. However, we have some leeway given the AABBs.
           Let's try:
           `v14`: (x: -0.09, y: 0.0, z: 0.781, theta: 0.0)
           `v12`: (x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.781, theta: 0.0)
           `v8`: (x: 0.09, y: 0.0, z: 0.781, theta: 0.0)
           This will cause collisions if their bounding boxes are exactly at these centers.
           Since we only need to provide a single continuous value for each instance of `#o2`, we must ensure that all objects can be placed at this pose without collision. This is problematic, so we must differentiate the `#o2` for each object. We will introduce `#o2_v14`, `#o2_v12`, and `#o2_v8`.
           
           Let's use a more spread out approach within `v16`.
           For `v14`: We can place it at `x = -0.08`, `y = 0.0`, `z = 0.781`.
           For `v12`: We can place it at `x = 0.0`, `y = 0.08`, `z = 0.781`.
           For `v8`: We can place it at `x = 0.08`, `y = -0.08`, `z = 0.781`.
           
           The original `kin` definitions in the initial state like `kin(v4, v14, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` implies that `#o2` refers to a single symbolic pose for all objects. If so, then placing multiple objects at the same symbolic pose would mean they would all be in the same physical location. This is a contradiction. The problem states "if the plan requires multiple different objects to be placed simultaneously at the same pose starting with '#', then you must provide a different continuous value for *each* object at that pose (not one that works for all), specifying the pose name, object name, and surface name." This allows us to provide distinct continuous values for `#o2` for each object.
           
           So, let's define three distinct locations for `#o2` on `v16` for each object.
           
           `#o2_v14` for `v14` on `v16`: `(-0.08, 0.0, 0.781, 0.0)`
           `#o2_v12` for `v12` on `v16`: `(0.0, 0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           `#o2_v8` for `v8` on `v16`: `(0.08, -0.08, 0.781, 0.0)`
           
           All of these are within the `v16` AABB `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           The total cost will be `3 * pickcost() + 3 * placecost()`.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 v16 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 v16 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 v16 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The only available action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the base from `v3` to `v3`, effectively doing nothing in terms of changing the robot's base configuration, but it does satisfy `canmove()` and sets `atbconf(v3)`. However, it doesn't allow for any manipulation of objects (pick or place). The goal is to place three objects (v8, v12, v14) on `v16`. Without `pick` and `place` actions, it is impossible to achieve the goal of moving objects. Therefore, the goal is unreachable given the limited set of available actions.
