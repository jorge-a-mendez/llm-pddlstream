User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.216, 0.223, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.453, 0.891).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.265, 0.174), (-0.168, 0.272)).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.065, 0.451, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.195).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (-0.139, -0.305, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.554, 0.833).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.019, 0.406), (0.111, 0.497)).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.184, -0.35), (-0.093, -0.259)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks us to place objects v8, v12, and v14 on object v16. Currently, all three objects are on v11. We have two arms, v4 and v6, both are empty. We are at base configuration v3.
           
           The available action instances only include a `move_base` action from `v3` to `v3`, which means the robot doesn't need to move its base to reach any of the objects or target locations. This is a very restrictive set of actions.
           
           Let's examine the initial state and goal:
           - `atpose(v12, v13)`: v12 is at pose v13, supported by v11.
           - `atpose(v14, v15)`: v14 is at pose v15, supported by v11.
           - `atpose(v8, v9)`: v8 is at pose v9, supported by v11.
           - The goal is `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. This means we need to pick up each object and place it on v16.
           
           For each object (v8, v12, v14), there are potential actions of the form:
           - `pick(?a, ?o, ?p, #o1, ?q, ?t)`
           - `place(?a, ?o, #o2, #o1, ?q, ?t)`
           
           However, the provided list of allowed action instances only contains `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This means we cannot execute any `pick` or `place` actions, nor `clean` or `cook` actions. Without `pick` and `place` actions, we cannot move the objects from `v11` to `v16`. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The `pick` and `place` actions are not in the allowed action instances, which implies they are not executable under the current conditions, or their continuous parameters have not been computed.
           
           Even though there are symbolic objects like `#o1` (grasp) and `#o2` (pose on v16), and `kin` predicates in the initial state that would allow for picking and placing, the crucial limitation is that only `move_base v3 v3 #o0` is allowed.
           
           The problem statement says: "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           Since the goal requires changing the `on` predicate for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` from `v11` to `v16`, and the only way to do this is through `pick` and `place` actions, which are not in the allowed list, the goal is unreachable.
