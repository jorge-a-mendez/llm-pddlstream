           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem requires satisfying the `new-axiom@0` goal, which means:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover `v12` is at configuration `v13`. This is true in the initial state.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover `v14` is at configuration `v15`. This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Rover `v12` has a free store `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Rover `v14` has a free store `v16`. This is true in the initial state.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective `v17` is received in mode `v11`.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective `v18` is received in mode `v11`.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective `v19` is received in mode `v11`.
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Image of objective `v20` is received in mode `v11`.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: There exists a rock of type `v2` (stone).
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: The analysis of the stone is received.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: There exists a rock of type `v6` (soil).
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: The analysis of the soil is received.
           
           From the initial state, we have `rock(v7)`, `rock(v4)`, `rock(v5)`, `rock(v1)`, `rock(v3)`, `rock(v8)`.
           We also have `type(v5, v6)` (soil), `type(v7, v6)` (soil), `type(v8, v6)` (soil), `type(v3, v2)` (stone), `type(v4, v2)` (stone), `type(v1, v2)` (stone).
           
           So, to achieve `receivedanalysis(?stone)` and `receivedanalysis(?soil)`, we need to sample and send analysis for at least one rock of type `v2` (stone) and one rock of type `v6` (soil).
           For example, we can sample `v4` (stone) and `v5` (soil).
           
           To achieve `receivedimage` for all objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`), we need to take images of these objectives with a rover and then send those images.
           Both rovers `v12` and `v14` have camera `v10` onboard, which supports mode `v11`.
           Both rovers are at their respective initial configurations (`v12` at `v13`, `v14` at `v15`).
           There are `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates for both rovers and various configurations.
           
           Let's break down the plan:
           1.  **Analyze a stone and a soil**:
               *   Rover `v14` is at `v15`. It has `above(v14, #o5, v4)` (stone) and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` (soil).
               *   Move `v14` to `#o5`.
               *   Sample `v4` and `v5`. This will set `analyzed(v14, v4)` and `analyzed(v14, v5)`.
               *   Move `v14` to a configuration where it is `comvisible` with the lander `v9`. Let's use `#o0`.
               *   Send analysis for `v4` and `v5`.
           2.  **Take and send images of all objectives**:
               *   Rover `v12` is at `v13`. It has `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, vX)` for `v17, v18, v19, v20`.
               *   Calibrate camera `v10` using `v12` at `#o3`.
               *   Take images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20` using `v12` at `#o3`.
               *   Move `v12` to a configuration where it is `comvisible` with the lander `v9`. Let's use `#o0`.
               *   Send images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`.
           
           Let's trace the plan with rover `v14` handling analysis and `v12` handling images.
           
           **Rover v14 (analysis):**
           - Initial: `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v14, v16)`.
           - To sample rocks: need to be `above` the rock. We have `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`.
           - `move v14 v15 #o2 #o5`
           - `sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16` (full, analyzed v4)
           - `drop_rock v14 v16` (free again)
           - `sample_rock v14 #o5 v5 v16` (full, analyzed v5)
           - To send analysis: need to be `comvisible` with lander `v9`. We have `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           - `move v14 #o5 #o2 #o0`
           - `send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v4`
           - `send_analysis v14 #o0 #o1 v9 v5`
           
           **Rover v12 (images):**
           - Initial: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `free(v12, v16)`.
           - To take images: need to be `imagevisible` and `calibrated`. We have `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, vX)` for objectives.
           - `move v12 v13 #o2 #o3`
           - `calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10` (or any objective for calibration)
           - `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11`
           - `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11`
           - `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v19 v10 v11`
           - `take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v20 v10 v11`
           - To send images: need to be `comvisible` with lander `v9`. We have `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)`.
           - `move v12 #o3 #o2 #o0`
           - `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11`
           - `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11`
           - `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v19 v11`
           - `send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v20 v11`
           
           This plan covers all parts of the `new-axiom@0` goal.
           
           The provided AABBs are for the *target objects* and rover configurations.
           Rover v12 AABB is ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)). Its current config is v13 (1.0, -1.75, 3.142). This is within its AABB.
           Rover v14 AABB is ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)). Its current config is v15 (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0). This is within its AABB.
           
           The rays are for the line of sight. We need to specify collision-free configuration for `#o3` and `#o0` based on the targets.
           For `#o3` (image configuration):
           - `v12` needs to see `v17, v18, v19, v20`. `v17` is ((0.467, 2.105), (0.566, 2.204)). `v18` is ((1.916, 1.762), (2.006, 1.852)). `v19` is ((-1.854, 1.836), (-1.774, 1.916)). `v20` is ((-0.714, 2.123), (-0.62, 2.218)).
           - A configuration around (0, 0) or (0, 1) could potentially see all of them, but we need to pick specific ones for each rover. Since `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75), a config `#o3` at, for example, (0.0, 0.0) might work.
           - But the `imagevisible` predicates are given as `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)`, etc. This implies a single `#o3` for all objectives for `v12`.
           - Let's take `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `#o3`. A position around (0.0, 0.0) could potentially see many objects. Let's use (0.5, 0.5) as a placeholder.
           
           For `#o0` (communication configuration):
           - `v12` needs to see `v9`. `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           - From `v13` (1.0, -1.75), a config `#o0` at (-1.0, -1.0) might work.
           
           - `v14` needs to see `v9`. `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
           - From `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), a config `#o0` at (-1.0, -1.0) might work.
           
           For `#o5` (sampling configuration):
           - `v14` needs to be `above` `v4` ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321)) and `v5` ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772)).
           - This is tricky. `v4` and `v5` are far apart. Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           - There is `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`. This implies a single `#o5` for multiple rocks. This means that either the rock definitions are incorrect or the problem setup expects a configuration that allows the robot to move between rocks.
           - Let's re-examine `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`. This implies that *from a single configuration* `#o5`, rover `v14` is above both `v4` and `v5`. This is geometrically very unlikely given the AABB of `v4` and `v5`.
           - `v4` AABB: ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321))
           - `v5` AABB: ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772))
           - These rocks are far apart. It is impossible to be "above" both from a single configuration.
           - The `above` predicate likely refers to the rover's end effector being able to reach. If `#o5` is a base configuration, this is indeed problematic.
           
           Let's assume the `above` predicates imply reachability by the arm from configuration `#o5`, and `#o5` is a *single* configuration that the rover can attain, and from which it can reach both objects. Since the problem statement assumes that any action instance in the list is valid, we must assume that `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are achievable from `#o5`.
           
           Let's pick a configuration for `#o5` for rover `v14` that is a compromise between the two widely separated rocks, perhaps (0.0, 0.0), although this is a rough guess. Given the constraints, the problem implies that the given `#o5` allows reaching both `v4` and `v5` for `v14`. Let's choose a point for `#o5` that makes sense for `v14` to be able to reach `v4` and `v5`. Since `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), moving it to a general location. Let's try (0.0, 0.0) for #o5.
           
           Given the initial state provides `imagevisible(v14, #o3, #o4, v19)` and others, and `conf(v14, #o3)`, it seems `#o3` is a specific configuration for imaging tasks. Similarly for `#o5` and `#o0`. We just need to define their continuous values.
           
           The key is that the problem provides action instances that use `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` as if they are distinct valid configurations. We need to assign values to these.
           
           For `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v17)` and the other objectives, we need a point for `#o3` that is within 2 units of `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`, and has an unobstructed view. `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           - `v17`: (0.467, 2.105) to (0.566, 2.204)
           - `v18`: (1.916, 1.762) to (2.006, 1.852)
           - `v19`: (-1.854, 1.836) to (-1.774, 1.916)
           - `v20`: (-0.714, 2.123) to (-0.62, 2.218)
           
           This is impossible to satisfy with one configuration (`#o3`) within 2 units of all of them. The problem states `imagevisible` and `imagerange` are given for a specific `#o3`. This implies `#o3` is a valid viewing configuration. I will choose a configuration for `#o3` for `v12` that is closest to one of the objects, for example `v17`. (0.7, 0.2) is a point within 2 units of v17.
           
           For `comvisible(v12, #o0, #o1, v9)` and `comvisible(v14, #o0, #o1, v9)`, we need a point for `#o0` within 4 units of `v9`. `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)). `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Let's pick (-1.0, -0.5) for `#o0`, which is close to `v9` and between the rovers.
           
           For `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)`, as discussed, these objects are geometrically far apart. `v4` is ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321)) and `v5` is ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772)). Given that the action `sample_rock v14 #o5 v4 v16` is provided, we *must* assume that `#o5` is a valid configuration for `v14` to perform these actions. Since `#o5` is a single configuration for `v14` and for `v4` and `v5`, it's not possible that both are *above* it from a single point. This implies a very long arm reach or that the `above` predicate is satisfied if the robot can *reach* the rock from that configuration. I will choose a configuration for `#o5` that is achievable from `v14`'s initial position (`v15` at (-1.0, -1.75)) and from which it can hypothetically reach the rocks. Let's place `#o5` at (-0.5, 0.0) as a reasonable intermediate point for sampling.

Configuration #o5 = (-0.5 0.0) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -0.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous attempt failed because the chosen configurations were not reachable for the robot base. Let's re-evaluate the reachability for each rover and the specific target.
           
           Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).
           Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).
           
           **Rover `v14` (analysis):**
           *   **Target `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`**:
               *   `v4` AABB: ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321))
               *   `v5` AABB: ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772))
               *   Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). The problem statement implies `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` are achievable from the *same* configuration `#o5`. This is highly problematic given the far-apart locations of `v4` and `v5`. It seems that my interpretation of "above" might be incorrect, or the problem setup expects a very large working envelope for the rover's arm or that the rover *moves* between the rocks within the same high-level task. However, the action `sample_rock` takes a single configuration `#o5`. This strongly suggests `#o5` is a single configuration. If `#o5` can be a configuration from which *both* `v4` and `v5` are reachable by the arm, we need to choose a config that `v14` can reach. A point around (0, 0) is roughly equidistant but still far.
               *   Let's assume the problem implicitly means that there exists a path for the arm to reach these from a single base configuration, or that the configurations are for different parts of the arm. Given the `motion` predicates for the robot base, we need a reachable *base* configuration.
               *   Let's reconsider the range for `v14`. If `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), and `v4` is at (approx -1.3, 0.27), and `v5` is at (approx 2.0, 0.7).
               *   For `v4`, a configuration like (-1.2, -0.5) might be reachable from (-1.0, -1.75) and be "above" `v4`.
               *   For `v5`, a configuration like (1.5, 0.0) might be reachable from (-1.0, -1.75) and be "above" `v5`.
               *   Since `#o5` is a single continuous parameter used for both `v4` and `v5`, the problem definition might be flawed if a single base configuration is required to be "above" two widely separated objects. Let's assume the problem means that from configuration `#o5`, the *robot arm* can reach `v4` and `v5`. I need to pick a single point for `#o5` that `v14` can reach. Let's try to find a point that's not too far from `v15` and provides a general view/reach.
               *   Let's try a point closer to `v14`'s initial position, e.g., (-0.8, -0.5), which is closer to `v4` than `v5`. Given the geometric discrepancy, I will prioritize `v4` and trust the problem formulation implies an unstated arm reach.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending analysis to `v9`**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (-1.5, -1.8) would be very close to `v9` and reachable from `v15`. It's within the comms range (4 units).
           
           **Rover `v12` (images):**
           *   **Target `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`**:
               *   `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   `v17`: (0.467, 2.105) to (0.566, 2.204)
               *   `v18`: (1.916, 1.762) to (2.006, 1.852)
               *   `v19`: ((-1.854, 1.836), (-1.774, 1.916))
               *   `v20`: ((-0.714, 2.123), (-0.62, 2.218))
               *   Similar to `#o5`, a single configuration `#o3` for `v12` must allow `imagevisible` for all four objects. This is geometrically challenging. The problem states `imagevisible` *is a fact*, meaning it is possible. I will pick a configuration for `#o3` that is reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and tries to be central to some of these. Given `v17` and `v18` are on the positive x-side and `v19` and `v20` on the negative x-side, this implies a central location. Let's try (0.0, 0.0) again as a general point, but for reachability, maybe (0.5, 0.0). Distance from (0.5, 0.0) to `v17` (midpoint ~0.5, 2.15) is about 2.15 units. Distance to `v18` (midpoint ~1.95, 1.8) is about 2.2 units. Distance to `v19` (midpoint ~-1.8, 1.87) is about 3.7 units. Distance to `v20` (midpoint ~-0.66, 2.17) is about 2.2 units.
               *   Let's assume the problem ensures `imagevisible` and `imagerange` are valid for the given `#o3` despite the broad target spread. I will pick a configuration that is reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and central. A configuration (0.0, -0.5) is reachable from (1.0, -1.75). This is still likely outside the range for `v19`.
               *   This is problematic. The prompt says "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." and "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*." However, `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` is in the initial state. This means there *exists* such a configuration. I must find a *reachable* point.
               *   Let's try a point (0.0, 0.0) for `#o3`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (0.0, 0.0) is `sqrt(1^2 + 1.75^2)` = `sqrt(1 + 3.0625)` = `sqrt(4.0625)` = ~2.01 units. This should be reachable.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending images to `v9`**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). A configuration like (0.0, -1.0) is reachable from `v13` and within 4 units of `v9`.
           
           Let's refine the configuration values:
           
           For `v14`:
           - `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`. `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). Let's pick (-1.2, -0.5). This is reachable from `v15` and close to `v4`. It is far from `v5`, but I must assume the given `above` predicates imply reachability for sampling somehow.
           - `#o0` for communicating with `v9`. `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). Let's pick (-1.5, -1.8). This is reachable and close to `v9`.
           
           For `v12`:
           - `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`. `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). Given the widespread objectives, finding a single point that satisfies `imagerange` for all is hard, but the problem states `imagevisible` already. We just need to make sure the *base* config is reachable. Let's try (0.5, -0.5). This is reachable from `v13`.
           - `#o0` for communicating with `v9`. `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is around (-1.9, -2.0). Let's pick (-0.5, -1.5). This is reachable and within 4 units of `v9`.
           
           The problem also mentions `blocked(?y)` as an axiom. If `cfreerayconf(?y, ?v, ?q)` is false, then the ray `?y` is blocked. We assume that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates given in the initial state implicitly mean `cfreerayconf` is true (or rather, `blocked` is false) for the rays associated with the configurations `#o0` and `#o3` when those configurations are active.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous configurations failed due to reachability, occlusion, and collision. Let's re-evaluate the continuous parameters carefully, keeping in mind the robot's current position and target's location and any potential obstacles.
           
           **Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).**
           **Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           
           **Obstacles:**
           `v9` (lander, target for comms): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           
           **Rover `v14` (analysis):**
           *   **Target `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`**:
               *   `v4` AABB: ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321))
               *   `v5` AABB: ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772))
               *   Rover `v14` initial position: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   As established, `v4` and `v5` are very far apart. The problem implies one `#o5` configuration. This is the core difficulty here. I'll need to prioritize one rock or choose a very central point.
               *   Let's try to find a point that's reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) and not in collision.
               *   If `v14` is around (-1.0, -1.75), and `v4` is around (-1.3, 0.27), a configuration like (-1.0, 0.0) might be reachable from `v15` and potentially "above" `v4`.
               *   Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to (-1.0, 0.0) is 1.75, which is reachable.
               *   This choice is for `v4`. It is still geometrically unlikely to be above `v5`. Given the problem's structure, I must assume that the `above` predicates are satisfied, and my job is to find a reachable, collision-free base configuration.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending analysis to `v9`**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` at (-1.5, -1.8) collided with `v9`. This means the rover's AABB (v14 is ((-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571))) at (-1.5, -1.8) overlapped `v9`.
               *   Let's check `v14`'s AABB. `v14` is centered at (-1.0, -1.75) when at `v15`. So its x-range is [-1.187, -0.821] and y-range is [-1.929, -1.571].
               *   If `v14` were at (-1.5, -1.8), its AABB would be roughly `[-1.5 - 0.187, -1.5 + 0.187]` = `[-1.687, -1.313]` for x, and `[-1.8 - 0.179, -1.8 + 0.179]` = `[-1.979, -1.621]` for y.
               *   `v9`'s AABB is `[-2.405, -1.395]` for x, and `[-2.346, -1.654]` for y.
               *   The x-ranges `[-1.687, -1.313]` and `[-2.405, -1.395]` overlap. The y-ranges `[-1.979, -1.621]` and `[-2.346, -1.654]` overlap. So yes, a collision is expected.
               *   We need `v14` to be `comvisible` with `v9` without collision, and reachable from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Let's try a point further from `v9` but still within comms range (4 units). From `v15`, let's try (-0.5, -1.75). This is reachable (distance 0.5) and probably not colliding. Distance to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0) from (-0.5, -1.75) is `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.5)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.75)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.4)^2 + (-0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(1.96 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(2.0225)` = ~1.42 units, well within 4.
           
           **Rover `v12` (images):**
           *   **Target `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`**:
               *   `v12` initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   `v17` (0.5, 2.15), `v18` (1.95, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.87), `v20` (-0.66, 2.17).
               *   Previous `#o3` (0.5, -0.5) failed due to occlusion for `v17`. This means something was between (0.5, -0.5) and `v17`.
               *   We need a point for `#o3` that is reachable from `v13` (1.0, -1.75), has no occlusions to these targets, and is within 2 units of them. This is the most challenging part due to the wide spread of objectives and the occlusion check.
               *   Given the imagevisible is a fact in the initial state, such a configuration `#o3` must exist. I need to find a coordinate for it.
               *   Let's try a configuration that is very high up to avoid ground obstacles and closer to the general center of the objects. Perhaps (0.0, 1.0).
               *   Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (0.0, 1.0) is `sqrt(1^2 + (1.0 - -1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(1^2 + 2.75^2)` = `sqrt(1 + 7.5625)` = `sqrt(8.5625)` = ~2.93 units. This is reachable, but perhaps too far for `imagevisible` since the max distance is 2.
               *   Okay, the `imagerange` predicate is given in the initial state, so the range is already checked. I just need to find a reachable, collision-free, occlusion-free point for `#o3`.
               *   Given the `imagerange` for `v12, #o3` and `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`, the actual range to those targets should be fine. I need to find a base configuration that is reachable by `v12` and won't be blocked.
               *   Let's try (0.8, -0.8). Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (0.8, -0.8) is `sqrt((1.0-0.8)^2 + (-1.75 - -0.8)^2)` = `sqrt(0.2^2 + (-0.95)^2)` = `sqrt(0.04 + 0.9025)` = `sqrt(0.9425)` = ~0.97 units. This is very reachable.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending images to `v9`**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   `v12` initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Previous `#o0` (-0.5, -1.5) was not reachable.
               *   Let's try to keep it closer to `v13`. How about (0.0, -1.0)? Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to (0.0, -1.0) is `sqrt(1^2 + (-1.75 - -1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(1^2 + (-0.75)^2)` = `sqrt(1 + 0.5625)` = `sqrt(1.5625)` = ~1.25 units. This is reachable.
               *   Check for collision with `v9`. `v12` AABB: ((0.821, -1.929), (1.187, -1.571)).
               *   If `v12` is at (0.0, -1.0), its AABB is roughly `[-0.18, 0.18]` for x and `[-1.93, -1.57]` for y.
               *   `v9` is `[-2.4, -1.39]` for x and `[-2.34, -1.65]` for y. No collision.
               *   Check for comms visibility. From (0.0, -1.0) to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0). Distance `sqrt((-1.9-0.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.9)^2 + (-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(3.61 + 1)` = `sqrt(4.61)` = ~2.15 units. This is well within 4 units.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The challenge persists with collisions and occlusions. It's critical to consider the AABBs of the rovers, the targets, and now, the newly revealed obstacles:
           `v21`: AABB((-0.573, -1.940), (-0.450, -1.817))
           `v22`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) (This is a thin wall along x=0)
           
           Let's re-strategize, trying to keep the rovers away from known obstacles and ensuring line-of-sight for imaging and communication.
           
           **Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           **Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).**
           
           **Rover `v14` (analysis):**
           *   **Target `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`**:
               *   `v4` AABB: ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321))
               *   `v5` AABB: ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772))
               *   Previous `#o5` (-1.0, 0.0) for `v14` was not reachable. This point is a straight line upwards from `v15`'s x-coordinate, but the y-distance is 1.75. If the robot's kinematics prevent large y-movements without an x-component, it might be unreachable.
               *   Given `v14`'s starting `v15` (-1.0, -1.75), and `v4` at `(-1.3, 0.27)`, a configuration `(-1.0, -0.5)` would be reachable (distance 1.25) and closer to `v4`. It's also far from `v21` and `v22`. Let's use this for `#o5`.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending analysis to `v9`**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` (-0.5, -1.75) collided with `v21`. `v21` is at `(-0.5, -1.9)` to `(-0.45, -1.8)`. If `v14` (AABB `(-1.187, -1.929), (-0.821, -1.571)`) is at `(-0.5, -1.75)`, its center is `(-0.5, -1.75)`. Its AABB would be `[-0.5-0.187, -0.5+0.187]` for x (`[-0.687, -0.313]`) and `[-1.75-0.179, -1.75+0.179]` for y (`[-1.929, -1.571]`).
               *   `v21`'s AABB x `[-0.573, -0.450]` and y `[-1.940, -1.817]`.
               *   X overlap: `[-0.573, -0.450]` is fully contained within `[-0.687, -0.313]`. Y overlap: `[-1.940, -1.817]` is fully contained within `[-1.929, -1.571]`. Yes, there is a collision.
               *   We need to move `v14` to a new `#o0` that is reachable from `v15` or the subsequent `#o5` location, is collision-free with `v9` and `v21`, and has line-of-sight to `v9`.
               *   Let's try a point like `(-1.5, -1.0)`. Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.5, -1.0)` is `sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (0.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 0.5625)` = `sqrt(0.8125)` = ~0.9 units. This is reachable.
               *   Check collision for `v14` at `(-1.5, -1.0)`. Rover AABB for `v14` is approximately `[-1.687, -1.313]` for x and `[-1.179, -0.821]` for y.
               *   `v9`: `[-2.405, -1.395]` x, `[-2.346, -1.654]` y. No collision.
               *   `v21`: `[-0.573, -0.450]` x, `[-1.940, -1.817]` y. No collision.
               *   Comms visibility: From `(-1.5, -1.0)` to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0). Distance `sqrt((-1.9 - -1.5)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.0)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.4)^2 + (-1.0)^2)` = `sqrt(0.16 + 1)` = `sqrt(1.16)` = ~1.07 units. Well within 4.
           
           **Rover `v12` (images):**
           *   **Target `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`**:
               *   `v12` initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   `v17` (0.5, 2.15), `v18` (1.95, 1.8), `v19` (-1.8, 1.87), `v20` (-0.66, 2.17).
               *   Previous `#o3` (0.8, -0.8) failed due to occlusion for `v17`.
               *   `v22` is a wall along x=0. So we need to stay clear of it and ensure line of sight.
               *   To get a good line of sight to `v17` (around (0.5, 2.15)) and `v18` (around (1.95, 1.8)), `v12` could be at `(1.5, 0.0)`.
               *   Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(1.5, 0.0)` is `sqrt((0.5)^2 + (1.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 3.0625)` = `sqrt(3.3125)` = ~1.82 units. This is reachable.
               *   Check for collision with `v22` (x=0 wall). If `v12` is at `(1.5, 0.0)`, its AABB x is `[1.5-0.187, 1.5+0.187]` = `[1.313, 1.687]`, which is far from x=0. So no collision.
               *   This location favors `v17` and `v18`. It will be extremely difficult to get an occlusion-free view of `v19` and `v20` from the same point, as they are on the other side of the map. However, the initial state *explicitly states* `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v19)` and `imagevisible(v12, #o3, #o4, v20)`. This means that from a single `#o3`, it *is* possible to see all four. I must choose a reachable configuration. Let's try to find a configuration that is both reachable and not obstructed by the `v22` wall, while being somewhat central to the viewing targets.
               *   What about a config that is very close to `v13` but still aims towards the targets? Let's try `(1.0, -0.5)`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(1.0, -0.5)` is 1.25, reachable.
               *   Check for collision with `v22` (x=0 wall). If `v12` is at `(1.0, -0.5)`, its AABB x is `[0.813, 1.187]`, far from x=0. No collision.
               *   Occlusion is the main issue. A position at `(1.0, -0.5)` has `v17` at `(0.5, 2.15)`, `v18` at `(1.95, 1.8)`.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending images to `v9`**:
               *   `v9` AABB: ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` (0.0, -1.0) collided with `v22`. `v22` is a wall at x=0. If `v12` (AABB around (0.0, -1.0) would be roughly `[-0.18, 0.18]` for x) is at `(0.0, -1.0)`, its x-extent `[-0.18, 0.18]` clearly overlaps `v22`'s x-extent `[-0.05, 0.05]`.
               *   We need to move `v12` to a new `#o0` that is reachable from `v13` or subsequent `#o3` location, collision-free with `v9` and `v22`, and has line-of-sight to `v9`.
               *   Let's try a point like `(0.5, -1.5)`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.5, -1.5)` is `sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.3125)` = ~0.56 units. This is very reachable.
               *   Check collision for `v12` at `(0.5, -1.5)`. Rover AABB x is `[0.313, 0.687]`, far from x=0. No collision with `v22`.
               *   Check collision with `v9`. Rover AABB y is `[-1.929, -1.571]`. `v9` y is `[-2.346, -1.654]`. No y overlap. No collision.
               *   Comms visibility: From `(0.5, -1.5)` to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0). Distance `sqrt((-1.9 - 0.5)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-2.4)^2 + (-0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(5.76 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(6.01)` = ~2.45 units. Well within 4.
           
           The problem with a single `#o3` for all four objectives and a single `#o5` for the two analysis rocks (v4 and v5) remains a geometric challenge, as they are very far apart. The problem description suggests that these `imagevisible` and `above` predicates are true for some `#o3` and `#o5` and the `imagerange` is satisfied. So I'm trusting the predicate is valid and will focus on reachable and collision/occlusion-free base configurations.
           
           Let's pick for `#o3` for `v12`: `(1.0, 0.0)`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(1.0, 0.0)` is 1.75. Reachable. Collision with `v22` not an issue. Occlusion is still the biggest uncertainty here.
           
           Final attempt at configurations.

Configuration #o5 = (-1.0 -0.5) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (0.5 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The consistent issue is that the proposed configurations are not reachable for the robot base. This suggests that the robot's movement capabilities are more constrained than I'm assuming, or that the initial `motion` predicates limit what configurations are actually reachable via a `move` action.
           
           Let's list the known `motion` predicates involving `#o2` (a specific type of motion) to see what transitions are explicitly allowed from the initial configurations `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`).
           
           For `v12` (at `v13`):
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`: Stay in place.
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`: Move from `v13` to `#o5`.
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`: Move from `v13` to `#o3`.
           - `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`: Move from `v13` to `#o0`.
           This is crucial: `v12` can *only* move from `v13` to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5` directly. It cannot move to arbitrary points, only to these named continuous configurations. If it moves to `#o0`, it can then move from `#o0` to `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`, etc. This means the continuous values of `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` must be chosen such that they are reachable from `v13` (for `v12`) or `v15` (for `v14`), and also satisfy the visibility/above predicates.
           
           Let's re-examine reachable points from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) for `v12` and `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) for `v14`.
           
           **Reachable points for `v12` from `v13` (1.0, -1.75):**
           The `motion` predicates for `v12` seem to imply direct reachability from `v13` to `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. The "not reachable" error means my chosen coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` were not considered valid for these `motion` predicates. This usually implies the straight-line path is blocked or the distance is too large.
           
           Let's pick `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` to be very close to `v13` (for `v12`) and `v15` (for `v14`) respectively, to ensure reachability. This might make visibility/sampling difficult, but if the `imagevisible` and `above` predicates are given as true in the initial state for these general configurations, the underlying system should find the specific continuous values for the ray and confirm visibility. My task is to find the base configuration.
           
           **Rover `v12` (imaging):**
           *   **Target `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`**:
               *   `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   Previous attempts failed for occlusion or reachability.
               *   To ensure reachability, let's pick `#o3` to be very close to `v13`, e.g., `(1.0, -1.0)`. Distance from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(1.0, -1.0)` is 0.75. This should be reachable.
               *   Collision with `v22` (x=0 wall): `v12` AABB x is `[0.821, 1.187]` at this point, so no collision with `v22`.
               *   Occlusion is still the major unknown.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending images to `v9`**:
               *   `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` (0.5, -1.5) was not reachable.
               *   Let's pick `#o0` to be very close to `v13`, e.g., `(0.8, -1.7)`. Distance from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.8, -1.7)` is `sqrt((-0.2)^2 + (0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(0.04 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(0.0425)` = ~0.2 units. Highly reachable.
               *   Collision with `v22` (x=0 wall): `v12` AABB x is `[0.821, 1.187]`, so no collision.
               *   Comms visibility: From `(0.8, -1.7)` to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0). Distance `sqrt((-1.9 - 0.8)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.7)^2)` = `sqrt((-2.7)^2 + (-0.3)^2)` = `sqrt(7.29 + 0.09)` = `sqrt(7.38)` = ~2.72 units. Within 4.
           
           **Rover `v14` (analysis):**
           *   **Target `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`**:
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v4` at ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321)), `v5` at ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772)).
               *   Previous `#o5` (-1.0, -0.5) was not reachable.
               *   Let's pick `#o5` to be very close to `v15`, e.g., `(-1.0, -1.0)`. Distance from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, -1.0)` is 0.75. This should be reachable.
               *   Collision with `v21` ((-0.573, -1.940), (-0.450, -1.817)): `v14` AABB x is `[-1.187, -0.821]` at this point, so no collision with `v21`.
               *   Still, the geometric challenge of being "above" both `v4` and `v5` from `(-1.0, -1.0)` remains. However, I must assume the `above` predicates are true for some valid choice of `#o5` from the problem definition.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending analysis to `v9`**:
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` (-1.5, -1.0) was not reachable.
               *   Let's pick `#o0` to be very close to `v15`, e.g., `(-1.0, -1.5)`. Distance from `(-1.0, -1.75)` to `(-1.0, -1.5)` is 0.25. Highly reachable.
               *   Collision with `v21` (obstacle at x around -0.5): `v14` AABB x is `[-1.187, -0.821]`, no collision.
               *   Comms visibility: From `(-1.0, -1.5)` to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0). Distance `sqrt((-1.9 - -1.0)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(0.81 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(1.06)` = ~1.03 units. Within 4.
           
           This strategy of keeping the intermediate configurations extremely close to the starting points should satisfy the "reachable" constraint for the `move` actions. The `imagevisible` and `comvisible` and `above` predicates, as facts in the initial state (even with continuous parameters), implies that such configurations *exist* and are occlusion/collision-free for the specific rays. My task is to find the base configuration.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The constant "not reachable" errors, even with very small movements from the starting configurations, strongly suggest that the `motion` predicates in the initial state are extremely restrictive, or I'm misinterpreting what "reachable" means in this context. The available `motion` predicates for `v12` from `v13` are to `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`, or `v13`. Similarly for `v14` from `v15`. This implies that the only `(q1, q2)` pairs in a `move` action that are valid are those explicitly listed in `motion`. If the specified continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are not valid arguments for the existing `motion` predicates, then the `move` action cannot be executed with those values.
           
           Let's carefully examine the *exact* `motion` predicates given in the initial state.
           For `v12`:
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o5)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`
           `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)`
           And other permutations like `motion(v12, #o5, #o2, v13)`, `motion(v12, #o3, #o2, #o5)`, etc.
           
           This means that `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` are not just abstract continuous parameters, but they are *specific named configurations* that the robot can move to from specific other named configurations. The problem statement says: "If your plan uses some object #<name> (starting with '#') such that `conf(rover, #<name>)` is in the initial state for some `rover` AND #<name> is the second argument to a `imagevisible` predicate ... or `comvisible` predicate ... then you must provide a continuous value for the configuration". And "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan."
           
           The problem also states `conf(v12, #o0)`, `conf(v12, #o3)`, `conf(v12, #o5)`, `conf(v14, #o0)`, `conf(v14, #o3)`, `conf(v14, #o5)`. This implies that these are indeed specific, existing configurations that just need their values determined. The "not reachable" means that the given continuous value for `#oX` is not a valid coordinate for that named configuration.
           
           This is a very tricky interpretation. If `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *already specific named configurations* known to the system (as implied by `conf(rover, #name)` and their use in `motion` predicates), then the "continuous value" I provide must be *the specific coordinate value* for that pre-defined named configuration. If I provide a value that isn't compatible with the predefined (but unknown to me) path data or kinematics of `motion(#o2)`, it fails.
           
           Given the continuous "not reachable" errors, it's possible that the initial `motion` predicates are for *different* continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` than what I'm guessing. This means I need to try to infer or assume what values would make sense for reachability, while also considering visibility.
           
           Let's assume that the problem expects the named configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) to be geometrically "sensible" in relation to the initial configurations (`v13`, `v15`) and the targets, AND that the `motion` predicates define the *reachability itself*, so if I define a value for `#o0`, then `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o0)` should be valid using *that defined value*.
           
           Let's go back to basics, and assume the simplest possible configuration changes to guarantee reachability from `v13` and `v15` for the rovers. Perhaps these configurations *are* very close to the starting points.
           
           **Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).**
           **Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           
           **Obstacles:**
           `v9` (lander): ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           `v21`: AABB((-0.573, -1.940), (-0.450, -1.817))
           `v22`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) (thin wall at x=0)
           
           **Rover `v12` (imaging):**
           *   **Target `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`**:
               *   `v12` starts at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   The objectives are very spread out. This indicates that `#o3` must be a very specific vantage point.
               *   Let's try to put `#o3` very close to `v13`, but shifted slightly. e.g., `(1.0, -1.5)`. This should be reachable.
               *   Collisions: `v12` AABB is `[0.821, 1.187]` x and `[-1.929, -1.571]` y when at `v13`. If at `(1.0, -1.5)`, its AABB is also around this. No collision with `v22` (x=0).

               *   To ensure visibility and reachability, let's try a point in the positive x, negative y quadrant but far enough from `v22` and with line-of-sight to `v9`.
               *   Let's try `(0.7, -1.0)`. Distance from `v13` (1.0, -1.75) to `(0.7, -1.0)` is `sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (0.75)^2)` = `sqrt(0.09 + 0.5625)` = `sqrt(0.6525)` = ~0.8 units. Reachable.

               *   Try `(-1.5, -1.7)`. Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.5, -1.7)` is `sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(0.2525)` = ~0.5 units. Reachable.

               *   This is the same collision problem as before. We need `v14` to be *near* `v9` but not *in* `v9`.

               *   Let's try to find an `x` coordinate that avoids `v21` and `v9`. `v21` is at `x` around `-0.5`. `v9` is `x` around `-1.9`. `v14` is `x` around `-1.0`.
               *   If `v14` moves to `(-0.9, -1.5)`. Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) is `sqrt((0.1)^2 + (0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(0.01 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.0725)` = ~0.27 units. Highly reachable.
               *   Collision: `v14` AABB x `[-0.9-0.187, -0.9+0.187]` = `[-1.087, -0.713]`. No collision with `v9` or `v21` or `v22`.
               *   Visibility to `v9`: From `(-0.9, -1.5)` to `v9` center (~-1.9, -2.0). Distance `sqrt((-1.9 - -0.9)^2 + (-2.0 - -1.5)^2)` = `sqrt((-1.0)^2 + (-0.5)^2)` = `sqrt(1 + 0.25)` = `sqrt(1.25)` = ~1.12 units. Within 4.
           
           This is a very difficult problem because the definition of "reachable" and "valid" for the continuous parameters is not fully specified beyond the existence of `motion` predicates. I am forced to guess values.

User:      Configuration #o3 = (1.0 -1.5) for rover v12 at target v17 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.

Model:     The iterative failures reveal more obstacles and a very strict environment. The "not reachable" errors even for minor shifts (e.g., 0.25 units) suggest that my estimation of reachable space is fundamentally flawed or that the `motion` predicates are for very specific pre-computed values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` which I cannot infer. The problem is asking me to provide *the* continuous value, implying a single correct set of values exists.
           
           Let's list the known fixed obstacles again, including the new one:
           `v9` (lander): AABB((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))
           `v21`: AABB((-0.573, -1.940), (-0.450, -1.817))
           `v22`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) (thin wall at x=0)
           `v23`: AABB((-0.913, -1.322), (-0.774, -1.183))
           
           **Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).**
           **Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           
           It seems my strategy of guessing close-by points for `#oX` is failing, either due to implicit path planning constraints (which I don't see) or because the values are not "reachable" through the specified `motion` primitives. A `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` being listed implies that there *is* a valid trajectory from `v13` to `#o3`.
           
           Let's try to infer `reachable` configurations from the starting points `v13` and `v15` by looking at the geometry of the obstacles and other existing objects.
           
           **Rover `v14` (analysis):**
           *   **Target `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`**:
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v4` at ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321)), `v5` at ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772)).
               *   `v23` at `x` around `-0.8`, `y` around `-1.2`. `v14` at `v15` is near `v23`.
               *   Previous `#o5` (-1.0, -1.0) was not reachable. This is slightly in front of `v15` and shifted up.
               *   Let's try to put `#o5` at `(-1.5, -1.5)`. This is slightly to the left and forward of `v15`.
               *   Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-1.5, -1.5)` is `sqrt((-0.5)^2 + (0.25)^2)` = `sqrt(0.25 + 0.0625)` = `sqrt(0.3125)` = ~0.56 units. This should be reachable.
               *   Collision: `v14` AABB at `(-1.5, -1.5)`: x `[-1.687, -1.313]`, y `[-1.679, -1.321]`.
               *   `v9` x `[-2.405, -1.395]`, y `[-2.346, -1.654]`. No collision with `v9`.

               *   `v23` x `[-0.913, -0.774]`, y `[-1.322, -1.183]`. No collision with `v23`.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending analysis to `v9`**:
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` is ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   Previous `#o0` (-0.9, -1.5) collided with `v23`. `v23` x is `[-0.913, -0.774]` and `v14` at `(-0.9, -1.5)` would have x `[-1.087, -0.713]`, which clearly overlaps.
               *   Need a config far from `v23` and `v21`, but close enough to `v9` for communication and reachable from `v15` or `#o5`.
               *   Let's try `(-1.8, -1.7)`. This is reachable from `v15` (distance 0.8) and from `#o5` `(-1.5, -1.5)` (distance `sqrt((0.3)^2 + (-0.2)^2)` = ~0.36).
               *   Collision: `v14` AABB at `(-1.8, -1.7)`: x `[-1.987, -1.613]`, y `[-1.879, -1.521]`.
               *   `v9` x `[-2.405, -1.395]`, y `[-2.346, -1.654]`. x overlap: `[-1.987, -1.613]` and `[-2.405, -1.395]` overlap. y overlap: `[-1.879, -1.521]` and `[-2.346, -1.654]` overlap. This is likely a collision with `v9` itself.
               *   This is tricky. We need to be `comvisible` with `v9`, but *not collide* with it. Let's try `(-0.6, -1.7)`.
               *   Distance from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75) to `(-0.6, -1.7)` is `sqrt((0.4)^2 + (0.05)^2)` = `sqrt(0.16 + 0.0025)` = `sqrt(0.1625)` = ~0.4 units. Reachable.
               *   Collision: `v14` AABB at `(-0.6, -1.7)`: x `[-0.787, -0.413]`, y `[-1.879, -1.521]`.
               *   `v21` x `[-0.573, -0.450]`, y `[-1.940, -1.817]`. x overlap: `[-0.573, -0.450]` is within `[-0.787, -0.413]`. y overlap: `[-1.940, -1.817]` is within `[-1.879, -1.521]`. This is a collision with `v21`.
           
           This is becoming an exhaustive search. The error messages are critical. The configurations *must* be chosen to avoid explicit obstacles. Given the `motion` predicates, I *must* assume reachability when picking these named points. The persistent "not reachable" errors even for short distances are the most confusing. Could it be that `#o2` is a specific *path type* (e.g. only forward straight moves) and not just a generic motion parameter?
           
           Let's assume the continuous values given for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are *fixed* and *pre-defined*, and my task is to match the plan to those specific values, not define new ones. But the prompt says "you must provide a continuous value". This implies I *am* defining them.
           
           The only way to guarantee reachability given the errors is if the definition of "reachable" refers to the target point being one of the configurations specified in the motion primitives for that rover.
           
           Let's assume that the specific named configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` *already have pre-computed valid values*, and the continuous values I provide are just to instantiate them. The "not reachable" error implies that the value I provided for, say, `#o3` (e.g., (1.0, -1.5)) is not considered a valid coordinate for the *existing* configuration `#o3` which is referenced in `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)`.
           
           This is a deadlock. I'm asked to provide continuous values for `#oX` such that they are reachable, collision-free, and occlusion-free. But any value I pick gets rejected as "not reachable" or in collision. This strongly indicates that the allowed values for `#oX` are very specific and I cannot simply pick arbitrary coordinates.
           
           What if the initial configurations *are* the only valid "reachable" configurations for these generic `#oX` values, and the problem setup is actually expecting me to *not* specify new coordinates for them? But the prompt states: "you must provide a continuous value for the configuration".
           
           Could it be that the only "reachable" configurations are the ones whose coordinates already exist in the problem (e.g., `v13` and `v15`), and that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are actually aliases for these?
           If `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` were aliases for `v13` or `v15`, then the `motion` predicates like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` would mean moving from `v13` to `v13` (if `#o3` = `v13`), which makes little sense for a move.
           
           The most likely scenario is that the allowed `motion` trajectories (associated with `#o2`) are very specific, and the provided AABBs and object locations imply a very constrained environment.
           
           Given that I'm being asked to repeatedly try, let's try to place these continuous configurations in areas that are very sparsely populated by obstacles, or very close to their respective initial rover locations, to minimize collisions, but still allowing visibility.
           
           **Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).**
           **Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           
           **Rover `v14` (analysis):**
           *   **Target `#o5` for sampling `v4` and `v5`**:
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
               *   Obstacles `v21`, `v23` are in negative x / negative y space near `v14`.
               *   Let's try to place `#o5` at `(-1.0, -1.6)`. This is a minimal shift from `v15`. Distance 0.15. This MUST be reachable.
               *   Collision: `v14` AABB at `(-1.0, -1.6)`: x `[-1.187, -0.821]`, y `[-1.779, -1.421]`.
               *   `v21` x `[-0.573, -0.450]`, y `[-1.940, -1.817]`. No collision.
               *   `v23` x `[-0.913, -0.774]`, y `[-1.322, -1.183]`. No collision.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending analysis to `v9`**:
               *   `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). `v9` (lander) at ((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654)).
               *   We need `v14` to be `comvisible` to `v9` without collision with `v9` or other obstacles.
               *   Let's try `(-0.7, -1.7)`. This is a very small shift from `v15` (distance `sqrt(0.3^2 + 0.05^2)` = ~0.3). Should be reachable.
               *   Collision: `v14` AABB at `(-0.7, -1.7)`: x `[-0.887, -0.513]`, y `[-1.879, -1.521]`.
               *   `v21` x `[-0.573, -0.450]`, y `[-1.940, -1.817]`. This is still a collision with `v21` on x (overlap) and y (overlap). This area is very blocked.
           
           This approach of shifting minutely from `v15` to avoid one obstacle leads to another obstacle or still being "not reachable". The configuration values for `#oX` must be very specific.
           
           Given the constraints, I will try to use existing known good configurations if possible, otherwise, pick very safe, clear areas for communication/imaging and rely on the fact that `imagevisible`/`comvisible` implies the range and LOS are fine.
           
           Let's try putting the configurations in very empty spaces, even if they seem far. The "not reachable" might refer to collision-free path.
           
           **Rover `v12` (imaging):**
           *   **Target `#o3` for imaging `v17, v18, v19, v20`**:
               *   `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
               *   `v22` is a wall at x=0. Keep `v12` on the positive x side.
               *   Let's try `(1.5, 0.5)`. This is further from `v13` (distance `sqrt(0.5^2 + 2.25^2)` = ~2.3), but in a relatively open area.
               *   Collision: `v12` AABB x `[1.313, 1.687]`, far from `v22`. No known obstacles. Occlusion is the risk.
           *   **Target `#o0` for sending images to `v9`**:
               *   `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75). `v9` (lander) is in negative x, negative y.

               *   Collision: `v12` AABB x `[0.313, 0.687]`, far from `v22`. `v21` and `v23` are further negative. No known collision.

           This is the hardest set of constraints I've seen. I'm taking the prompt literally that the problem means "a coordinate value that works for the abstract configuration name, and the underlying system will validate if that specific (name, value) pair, when used in a `motion` primitive, results in a reachable state".

Configuration #o0 = (0.5 -0.5) for rover v12 at target v9 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continued "not reachable" errors, even with varying distances, is the most perplexing aspect. It's almost as if the only truly "reachable" configurations are the initial ones (`v13`, `v15`), which doesn't make sense for a `move` action. Given the constraints and the nature of the errors, the `motion` predicates must be extremely specific and the valid coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are tightly constrained around `v13` and `v15`.
           
           Let's rethink the reachability. If even minimal shifts are "not reachable," it might mean the robot's motion model allows only very specific, predefined paths to these `#oX` configurations, and my chosen coordinates simply don't match those pre-defined destination points.
           
           The only way to ensure "reachable" based on the problem statement is if `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are actually *identical* to `v13` and `v15`, and the `motion` predicates like `motion(v12, v13, #o2, #o3)` are in fact `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)`. This would mean the rover doesn't actually move. But then the `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis` actions would have to be executable from the initial positions.
           
           Let's assume that the specific coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are meant to be *very close* to the robot's initial position, and that the "reachable" check is extremely sensitive, possibly due to a complex internal path planner or very small valid movement envelopes.
           
           Given this, I will try to use coordinates that are minimally shifted from the rover's current location, almost "in-place," but try to pick ones that maximize line-of-sight/collision avoidance based on the errors.

               *   To get a clearer view of `v9` from `v12`'s side, `v12` might need to be further "back" or to the "side" to get around potential occluders (none explicitly listed for ray traces, so guessing).

           This is my most conservative attempt, relying on minimal shifts for "reachability" and trusting the problem statement implies these configurations *are* valid for visibility/sampling if chosen correctly. If even these don't work, there might be a fundamental misunderstanding of the task environment or the robot's kinematics.

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -1.65) for rover v14 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o5 = (-1.0 -1.6) for rover v14 at target v4 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The continued "not reachable" errors for even minute changes in configuration, combined with the fact that `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are used as endpoints in `motion` predicates, strongly implies that these `#oX` are *already pre-defined configurations within the problem's environment*, and I am merely meant to supply their *names* to the plan. However, the explicit instruction "you must provide a continuous value for the configuration" contradicts this interpretation.
           
           Given that I have failed to find "reachable" coordinates for any of these `#oX` configurations through iterative guessing, even with minimal shifts, the only remaining logical conclusion is that the initial state's `motion` predicates are *only* valid for specific (hidden) coordinate values of `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`. If I cannot determine these values, I cannot satisfy the "reachable" constraint.
           
           However, the problem requires me to never give up. The core issue is that I cannot infer the values of `#oX` that satisfy "reachable" and the `motion` predicates, while also being collision and occlusion-free for the given targets.
           
           Let's re-examine the core problem:
           The `motion` predicates define the allowed transitions:
           `motion(?v: object, ?q1: object, ?t: object, ?q2: object)`
           If `q1` is `v13` (for `v12`) or `v15` (for `v14`), then `q2` *must* be `v13`, `v15`, `#o0`, `#o3`, or `#o5`. My chosen continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` are being rejected by the `motion` predicate as "not reachable". This can only mean that the internal definition of `motion` for `#o2` requires very specific coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, and my guesses are incorrect.
           
           Since I cannot know the correct coordinates for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` that satisfy the implicit reachability constraints of the `motion` predicate, and my explicit instruction is to *provide* continuous values for these, I am in a paradox. I will try one last strategy that attempts to make the `motion` predicates effective by minimizing the *conceptual* "distance" for reachability, by making the configurations `v13` and `v15` themselves serve as the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` for their respective rovers. This means the rovers are not physically moving to new distinct locations for these tasks. If this interpretation is what makes them "reachable", then other constraints might fail, but it's the only way to satisfy "reachable" for arbitrary `#oX` values.
           
           If `#o0` = `v13`, `#o3` = `v13`, `#o5` = `v13` (for `v12`), and similarly for `v14` using `v15`, then the `move` actions become essentially no-ops or self-moves. But the prompt explicitly tells me to provide values for `#oX`.
           
           Let's use the actual fixed configuration values `v13` and `v15` as the continuous values for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5` for their respective rovers. This *must* satisfy reachability for `motion(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `motion(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`. The task is then whether the `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above` predicates hold from these fixed initial locations.
           
           **Rover `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).**
           **Rover `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75, 0.0).**
           
           Using the initial configurations for `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`:
           *   For `v12`: `#o3` = `v13` = (1.0, -1.75), `#o0` = `v13` = (1.0, -1.75).
           *   For `v14`: `#o5` = `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75), `#o0` = `v15` = (-1.0, -1.75).
           
           Let's check the predicates for these:
           **Rover `v14` (analysis) from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75):**
           *   `above(v14, v15, v4)` and `above(v14, v15, v5)`:
               *   `v4` ((-1.382, 0.222), (-1.283, 0.321))
               *   `v5` ((1.929, 0.635), (2.066, 0.772))
               *   It is geometrically impossible to be "above" both `v4` and `v5` from `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). This is a strong indication that this strategy won't work, because these `above` predicates *must* be satisfied for `sample_rock`. The problem explicitly lists `above(v14, #o5, v4)` and `above(v14, #o5, v5)` as facts. This means that a separate `#o5` *must* exist and be reachable and satisfy these.
           
           This implies there are valid points for `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5` distinct from `v13`/`v15`. The "not reachable" error is the fundamental problem. Without knowing the internal motion model for `#o2`, I cannot correctly guess values.
           
           Since the system gives me "not reachable" even for minimal shifts, and since I cannot move to other named configurations (`#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`) if they are not considered "reachable" by the internal planner, this plan is unachievable with my current ability to specify continuous values. I am at an impasse because I cannot find coordinates that the system accepts as "reachable" for *any* of the required continuous configurations.
           
           Therefore, I cannot provide a valid plan under these interpretation of the constraints. If the problem implies that I should use the *existing* `#oX` entities in the motion predicates without providing new coordinates, then the problem statement is contradictory. Since I am explicitly asked to provide a value, and every value is rejected as "not reachable", I must conclude that the goal is not achievable with the current information.
