           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about this problem:**
           
           I need to find 50 stable placements for a small, square-like object (0.07 x 0.07) on a rectangular surface defined by the points ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  A placement is defined by surface index, rotation angle (theta), and x,y coordinates of the object's center.  I need to ensure the object is *fully* inside the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I recognized that with rotations, the effective bounding box of the object will change. Because it is a square, W_eff = H_eff is calculated using `0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I'm calculating the ranges of `x` and `y` where the object can fit, for a given rotation. To generate diverse placements, I will use multiple angles to compute the bounding box. The angles chosen from 0 to 2*pi are: 0, 0.2pi, 0.4pi, ..., 1.8pi, or, 10 total.
           
           For each angle, I need to generate 5 points - the center and 4 quarter points.  Since the object is significantly smaller than the surface, the quarter points will be distinct and valid.

(Thoughts: **My Placement Strategy for Object ID: 10**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I'm tasked with placing 50 instances of a new object (ID 10) on Surface 0, ensuring they're stable and, crucially, don't collide with the previously placed object (ID 5). I've got a lot to consider, but I think I have a solid approach.
           
           First, I need to account for ID 5. I already have successful placements for ID 5 and will treat them as fixed obstacles. Since ID 5 is a square with side length 0.07, and I need to account for rotation, I'll calculate its effective bounding box for each angle. The biggest bounding box occurs when the square is rotated by 45 degrees, which has been applied at an approximate value of `0.628`.
           
           For object 10 I'll compute `eff_side_10` which is just `s_10 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))` to calculate for any given angle.
           
           The surface 0 has the shape of a rectangle bounded by `(4.2, -0.6)` and `(4.8, 0.0)`.
           
           Here's my approach:
           1.  **Angle Selection:** I'll use 10 different angles for object 10, evenly spaced between 0 and 2π radians.
           2.  **Effective Size:**  For each angle, I'll calculate the *effective* size of object 10 using `s_10 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. This considers the rotation and is essential for accurate collision checks.
           3.  **Valid Placement Region:** I'll determine the valid area for object 10 on Surface 0, considering its effective size. The object needs to fit entirely within the surface, leaving enough margin to prevent it from overlapping with the surface boundaries.
           4.  **Collision Detection:** This is where it gets interesting. I need a robust collision check. I'll use the AABBs from the object 5, and then iterate systematically through possible locations for object 10 and verify for collisions.
           5.  **Grid Search with Prioritization:** I'll use a systematic grid search within the valid region. But, to boost efficiency, I'll *prioritize* locations furthest from the known obstacle positions and the surface edges. I plan on placing first at the corners, edges, and then the interior of the grid.
           6. **Iterative and Resilient Placement:** If for a specific rotation, I find enough placements, I stop. If not, I'll add more points, using the grid density as needed.
           
           My objective is to have a robust method for generating these placements. I'm going to have this ready, and will use the code above to achieve it!
