           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of the `new-axiom@0()` Goal**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which is a conjunction of several atomic facts.  Crucially, I need to get four images (`receivedimage`) and two analyses (`receivedanalysis`). My initial state gives me a lot of information, which helps me understand how I can work on these subgoals.
           
           I see that I have two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, and both the objective targets and rocks are visible to them. However, my allowed actions are painfully limited: I can only move (uselessly, because the move is a no-op as the rovers are already at that location) or drop rocks (which I can't do because the initial state shows the rovers' storage units are free).  I am missing critical actions to accomplish my goal.
           
           To get the images, I need `send_image`, but that depends on `take_image`, and `take_image` requires `calibrate`.  I don't have a way to calibrate or take images. To get the analyses, I need `send_analysis`, which requires `sample_rock`.  Again, I don't have a way to sample rocks. It seems the problem has been intentionally set up to be unachievable from the initial state given the restricted action set. The `move` is redundant, and the `drop_rock` cannot be used since the stores are empty.
           
           In light of these limitations, I've concluded that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is currently *unachievable* with the actions I have at my disposal. There's no way to reach the required `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` states with these restricted actions. I will not return any plan.
