           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of several states. Upon examining the individual atoms, it becomes clear that the key challenges lie in achieving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates. These necessitate the use of `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, which in turn require the rover to be at specific configurations (where `imagevisible` and `comvisible` hold).
           
           I have identified that the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are initially located at `v13` and `v15`, respectively. The available actions consist of "no-op" `move` commands, `move(v12, v13, #o2, v13)` and `move(v14, v15, #o2, v15)`, alongside dropping rocks. However, the pre-conditions of the 'move' actions only allow the rovers to stay in the initial configurations, and the drop rock is not applicable.
           
           The critical issue is that the `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates, necessary for image-taking and transmission, are only true at configurations denoted by '#' (e.g., `#o3`, `#o0`).  These are distinct from the starting configurations (`v13`, `v15`). Due to the constraints imposed by the limited action set, I cannot execute the required actions to achieve the subgoals of `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis`. This lack of ability to interact with the environment, given the restricted actions and their pre-conditions, renders the initial goal unattainable.
