(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the User's Placement Request**
           
           Alright, I've got the task laid out. We need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 6, dimensions: `0.07506702536512896` x `0.07506702536512899`) on a square surface (`0: ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`). A placement is defined by surface index, rotation angle (radians), and the object's center coordinates (x, y).
           
           Stability means the object's rotated bounding box remains within the surface's bounds. Since the object is nearly square, the rotation's effect on its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is minimal. The bounding box's dimensions when rotated are `W = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|` and `H = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|`, where `w` and `h` are the object's dimensions. For a near-square object, the max `W` or `H` will be around 0.106.
           
           We know the surface 0 is a square, which simplifies the containment calculations. The center coordinates need to respect the surface boundaries, considering the rotated object's dimensions.
           
           My strategy? I'll utilize two rotations - 0 and π/2. Because the object is almost square, this provides a diverse set of placements. I'll define 5 evenly spaced x coordinates and 5 evenly spaced y coordinates that define the center of the object on the surface for each of those rotations. I'll get the minimum and maximum ranges of the object on the surface. Since `w` and `h` are very similar, I just need a grid, which provides for adequate diversity in x and y coordinates.
           
           After performing the calculations, I generated the following 5 x coordinates:  [-0.09746648731743552, -0.04873324365871776, 0.0, 0.04873324365871776, 0.09746648731743552]. And the following 5 y coordinates: [-0.097466487317435505, -0.04873324365871775, 0.0, 0.04873324365871775, 0.097466487317435505].
           
           Now, with those values I'll create a 5x5 grid for placement when theta = 0, and a 5x5 grid of rotated values when theta = pi/2. This will provide my 50 distinct placements, ensuring they are stable and contained within the surface, ready to be presented to the user.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 5 (Square Object)**
           
           Alright, here's my plan for placing object ID 5, keeping in mind the successful placement of object ID 6:
           
           First, I've got the dimensions of object 5: `w5 = h5 = 0.07549716129994499`.  It's a square, so rotation doesn't change its bounding box.  The available surface area (surface 0) is defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Since I know object 6 is already placed, I *must* avoid collision with it.  The previous placement of object 6 is at `(0, 0.0, -0.09746648731743552, -0.097466487317435505)`.  I calculated its AABB, which occupies the region `[-0.135, -0.05993297463487104] x [-0.135, -0.05993297463487101]`.
           
           To avoid collision, I need to constrain the placement of object 5. The basic valid placement range for a square is easy to calculate because you just center it inside the surface with the side being the `W`. This would be the full surface range with the object width on each side subtracted.
           
           I calculated `W = w5 = h5` for all angles. So I use the width of 0.075 to obtain a min and max of each dimension.  Then, by subtracting the object side from the surface range, the valid range becomes -0.097 to 0.097.
           
           To prevent collision with object 6, I calculated which x and y regions are occupied by Object 6, and I can't put any part of Object 5 there. This led me to constrain object 5's x placement above or y placement to the right of the collision region.
           
           To handle these constraints, I'll generate the placement region and filter it. I will generate a 7x7 grid centered on (0, 0) and filter the ones in the collision region. The range for the grid will span `-0.097 to 0.097`.  This ensures all points are within the surface bounds. After computing the points, I will select points to avoid the collision region.  I will avoid collisions by selecting locations above `y >= -0.022184393984898515` or to the right, `x >= -0.022184393984898545`.
           
           I need 50 placements. To do this, I will have 40 points in a grid pattern. This leaves a small bit, so I will select 10 more with a different, and non-conflicting placement.  
           
           For the final step,  I will use a 4x4 grid. After applying some calculations, I came up with another region of valid placement points.
           
           I will use two angles `0` and `pi/4` to produce these.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           I need to strategically place a new, almost square object (ID 4) onto a defined surface (Surface 0), ensuring that it doesn't collide with two existing objects (ID 6 and ID 5). My primary goal is to find at least 50 stable, collision-free positions.
           
           First, I need to understand the valid area available on the surface. Surface 0 is a square, and I know the object's dimensions (approximately 0.091 meters on each side). I start by defining the valid placement area's boundaries based on these dimensions, assuming the object is oriented at 0 degrees. I then calculate the center's bounds: -0.089 to 0.089 in both x and y.
           
           Next, the critical step: identifying and mapping the collision zones caused by the existing objects. I need to figure out where the new object's center cannot be to avoid overlap. Using the established dimensions and placements of Object 6 and Object 5, I calculate their Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs). From these, I determine the center coordinates that would result in a collision for the new object. These collision zones define the "no-go" areas.
           
           After this I determine the region where the new object's center cannot be and overlap Object 6 and Object 5. I define the area that should be avoided. Then I create a grid of possible placement locations across the surface, applying a fine 10x10 resolution to obtain the maximum points possible.
           
           Lastly, I carefully iterate through each position on the grid. For each candidate point, I check if it falls within a collision zone (by comparing its coordinates against the "no-go" ranges calculated earlier). Positions that *aren't* blocked are added to my set of valid placements. I know to have at least 50 valid placements. Therefore, to simplify this, the strategy will be only to use the points generated using `theta=0`.

           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for Object ID 7 (a nearly square object with dimensions approximately 0.086 x 0.086) on Surface 0, taking into account the existing fixed obstacles: Objects ID 6, 5, and 4.  The surface has bounds of [(-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)].
           
           To simplify the collision checks, I'm assuming a rotation of `theta = 0` for Object 7, meaning its dimensions are `w7 = h7 = 0.086`.  I calculate `half_w7` which is half of w7, which is `0.0430`. I'll place the objects at the calculated positions at (x, y) coordinates with `theta = 0`.  This assumption maximizes the placement area and simplifies the AABB calculation.
           
           My approach involves these critical steps:
           
           1.  **Understand the Geometry:** I'm aware of the size and AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of Object 7 and the surface area, and I will be using the AABB.
           2.  **Define Placement Constraints:** I have determined the general placement range of object 7 within the surface without overlap from surface bounds using `x_center_min_surf` and `x_center_max_surf`.
           3.  **Define and Block the Overlaps:** I will need to consider the existing objects (6, 5, 4) as fixed obstacles to be avoided. I'll get their AABBs. My strategy is to check if the AABB of any proposed placement of Object 7 overlaps with the AABB of any of these existing objects. I have calculated the AABB of the three existing objects to efficiently perform collision checks.
           4.  **Create a Grid and Filter:** I will create a grid of potential placement centers for Object 7, ensuring it is within the valid placement area `[-0.09197959719590946, 0.09197959719590946]` for x and y. From the previous step where the area was blocked, the resulting valid placement is `x_free_min` to `x_free_max`. I have x,y coordinates and I'll loop and check.
           5.  **Collision Check:** I will implement a function to check for collisions. This function calculates the AABB of Object 7 for any given placement (x, y) and checks for any overlap with the AABBs of the existing obstacles (6, 5, 4).
           6.  **Create a 7x8 grid.** The formula for the grids is `x_span_free = 0.09277415233990762` and `y_span_free = 0.18395919439181892`. The x step `0.013253450334272517` and the y step `0.03065986573196982`.

           4.  **Create a Grid and Filter:** I will create a grid of potential placement centers for Object 7, ensuring it is within the valid placement area `[-0.09197959719590946, 0.09197959719590946]` for x and y. From the previous step where the area was blocked, the resulting valid placement is `x_free_min` to `x_free_max`. I have x,y coordinates and I'll loop and check.
           5.  **Collision Check:** I will implement a function to check for collisions. This function calculates the AABB of Object 7 for any given placement (x, y) and checks for any overlap with the AABBs of the existing obstacles (6, 5, 4).
           6.  **Create a 7x8 grid.** The formula for the grids is `x_span_free = 0.09277415233990762` and `y_span_free = 0.18395919439181892`. The x step `0.013253450334272517` and the y step `0.03065986573196982`.
           7.  **Generate Placement Positions:** I will generate x, y coordinate pairs and then evaluate each of them.
           8.  **I will get 50 stable placements.**
