User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with walls at x = +/-2.5 and y = +/-2.5. There's a vertical obstacle in the middle at x=0. There are also several smaller, scattered obstacles within the room. I will try to find positions for the robot base that are within 2 units of the target point. I will prioritize positions that are not too close to the known obstacles, and if a previous position has failed, I will avoid it and try a new one.
