(Thoughts: **Summary of My Reasoning for Object Placement**
           
           My goal is to provide 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a given surface (surface 0).  The surface is a 0.27m x 0.27m square centered at the origin. The object has dimensions (approximately) 0.0937m x 0.0937m, so it’s almost square.  A placement is defined by the surface index (which is always 0 in this case), rotation angle (theta), and the object's center coordinates (x, y). Stability means the rotated object's bounding box is fully contained within the surface.
           
           First, I calculate the effective dimensions of the object's bounding box after rotation by theta. I then determine the valid (x, y) ranges for the object's center based on these rotated dimensions and the surface size. To achieve diverse placements, I vary theta, focusing on rotations from 0 to pi (as the bounding box is symmetric).
           
           Since the object is nearly square, the rotations don't significantly change the bounding box dimensions.  I've decided to sample a few theta values evenly spaced from 0 to pi (0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, pi/2, ...). For each theta, I determine valid x and y ranges.
           
           To create diversity, I'm taking three representative x values and three representative y values from within the valid ranges, giving a reasonable distribution and variety. I use 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 as multipliers to generate the points, such as x_min + (x_max-x_min)*0.1 or similar, so that it gives valid placements within the surface boundary for each rotation. Because the given valid ranges are reasonably large, and the area of the surface is large compared to the object, there will be enough room to make 50 diverse selections.  I calculate the effective dimensions of the rotated object and then restrict the (x,y) coordinates to the valid (x, y) coordinates for each angle. The process will yield 81 placements, easily satisfying the requirement of 50. Since I do not know of any additional constrains for the placement other than that the bounding box needs to be entirely within the boundary, the placements should be stable. The result will include the placements and parameters for each placement.

(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. I've been asked again to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0. Same object, so I need to generate a completely new set of placements. Since I didn't get any collision feedback last time, I'm assuming my previous approach was valid, and the problem was likely due to a non-fixed obstacle. Therefore, I will stick to my proven strategy, but with a few tweaks to ensure diversity.
           
           First, let's solidify the object's dimensions: `w = 0.09371451710671079` and `h = 0.09371451710671075`. Surface 0's bounds are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           I'll use 9 different rotation angles, incrementing by `pi/8` this time, to get a wider variety: `k * pi / 8` for `k = 0, ..., 8`. My primary goal is to vary the `x,y` coordinates.
           
           For each angle (`theta`), I'll calculate the valid placement area. I'll need `effective_w` and `effective_h` using the standard formulas: `effective_w = w * |cos(theta)| + h * |sin(theta)|` and `effective_h = w * |sin(theta)| + h * |cos(theta)|`. Then, I'll determine the valid range for `x` and `y` based on those effective dimensions:
           
           `x_min_valid = -0.135 + effective_w / 2`
           `x_max_valid = 0.135 - effective_w / 2`
           `y_min_valid = -0.135 + effective_h / 2`
           `y_max_valid = 0.135 - effective_h / 2`
           
           This is where I'll introduce the diversity.  I'll pick 3 `x` values and 3 `y` values by scaling the ranges. Instead of the previous values `0.1, 0.5, 0.9` I will use `0.2, 0.5, 0.8`. Using these values will create 9 unique placement combinations per rotation for my 9 rotations; that's 81 possible configurations. I will select the first 50 stable placements from those.
           
           Now, let's do the math.
           For `theta = 0`, the effective dimensions are the same as the original dimensions.
           
           Using the new ranges the `x` and `y` coordinates will be:
           `x = [-0.05288564486798676, 0.0, 0.05288564486798676]`
           `y = [-0.05288564486798677, 0.0, 0.05288564486798677]`
           
           For `theta = pi/8`, the effective width and height increase and the coordinates become:
           `x = [-0.04426959681161268, 0.0, 0.04426959681161268]`
           `y = [-0.04426959681161268, 0.0, 0.04426959681161268]`
           
           For `theta = pi/4`,
           The `effective_w` and `effective_h` are identical because sin(theta) = cos(theta). The coordinates become:
           `x = [-0.0412387347021249, 0.0, 0.0412387347021249]`
           `y = [-0.0412387347021249, 0.0, 0.0412387347021249]`
           
           And so on for each theta. I've double-checked my calculations, and I'm confident in the logic. I'll proceed to generate the 50 placements based on this strategy. The slight variations

(Thoughts: **Fulfilling the Request for Stable Object Placements**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for an object (ID 4) on a surface (0). The object is nearly square (`w ≈ h ≈ 0.0937`). This is the third attempt for this specific combination, and since I haven't received any feedback, I'll assume previous attempts were valid in terms of object-surface collision and no obstacles are present, and continue generating a diverse set of placements.
           
           The strategy involves:
           
           1.  Calculating the *effective* width and height of the object for various rotation angles (`theta`).
           2.  Determining the valid (x, y) center coordinates for the object within the surface for each `theta`.
           3.  Generating a grid of (x, y) coordinates within these valid ranges.
           
           Specifically:
           
           *   **Surface 0:**  Defined by the rectangle  `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           *   **Angles:** I'll use 9 evenly spaced angles between 0 and π radians (0, π/8, π/4, ... π).
           *   **Placement Strategy:** For each angle, I'll sample x and y positions at 15%, 50%, and 85% of the valid ranges. This will give me `9 * 3 * 3 = 81` candidate placements. I'll take the first 50.
           
           Let me break down the calculations:
           
           For example, when `theta = 0`, the effective width is `w = 0.0937`, and the center has a valid range of `[-0.0881, 0.0881]` on x and y axes.
           For `theta = pi/4`, the calculation is more interesting because I need to project the sides of object to calculate the effective width, which will be  `0.1325`, with the valid center range to `[-0.0687, 0.0687]` on x and y axes.
           
           I'll use the formulas that I outlined above. For each (theta, px, py), I compute valid coordinates for stable object placements.

(Thoughts: **Finding Stable Placements for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got this new object, ID 6, that's almost square, and I need to figure out 50 stable, non-colliding placements for it on surface 0. The catch? I need to avoid clashing with object ID 4, which is already successfully placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.06169991901265122, -0.06169991901265123)`.  I've got object 4's AABB: roughly `((-0.10856, -0.10856), (-0.01484, -0.01484))`, and I know the surface bounds are `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           My strategy? Generate a grid of potential placements, rotating object 6 through a range of angles and then checking each placement's AABB for collisions with object 4. I'll consider angles from 0 to pi in increments of pi/8 and calculate effective dimensions (width and height) of object 6 at each angle. I'll define valid x and y ranges for object 6's center given the surface bounds. Then, for a given angle, I'll systematically explore x and y positions within the surface area to place object 6.
           
           To avoid collisions, I'll calculate the AABB of object 6 for each position.  For a given rotation and position, there will be no collision if the edge of object 6 lies fully outside object 4. I will define safe regions to generate candidate placements with the edge of object 6 being out of collision range. I will apply a filter to reject positions that intersect object 4's AABB.
           
           This looks like a good plan. The surface area is 0.27m * 0.27m. Object 4 occupies the bottom-left quadrant. To efficiently find a diverse set of 50 non-colliding placements, I plan to sample points at each theta within the surface-valid range and filter the results by object 4's AABB. I'll use a step size that will ensure I find enough solutions without an exhaustive search.
           
           For each `theta`, I will determine the effective_w6 and effective_h6 for object 6. I'll calculate `x` and `y` range, calculate the AABB's for object 6 and check against object 4. I'll consider a 5x5 grid in x and y locations for each `theta` to get a good distribution, and generate enough candidate placements to ensure I find 50. Since I am sampling from a grid of candidate placements, I will be more likely to find a diverse set of valid placements. I will generate up to 225 candidate placements with that setup, which is more than enough to satisfy the requirements, and filter those that do not overlap with Object 4.

I will apply a filter to reject positions that intersect object 4's AABB.
           
           This looks like a good plan. The surface area is 0.27m * 0.27m. Object 4 occupies the bottom-left quadrant. To efficiently find a diverse set of 50 non-colliding placements, I plan to sample points at each theta within the surface-valid range and filter the results by object 4's AABB. I'll use a step size that will ensure I find enough solutions without an exhaustive search.
           
           For each `theta`, I will determine the effective_w6 and effective_h6 for object 6. I'll calculate `x` and `y` range, calculate the AABB's for object 6 and check against object 4. I'll consider a 5x5 grid in x and y locations for each `theta` to get a good distribution, and generate enough candidate placements to ensure I find 50. Since I am sampling from a grid of candidate placements, I will be more likely to find a diverse set of valid placements. I will generate up to 225 candidate placements with that setup, which is more than enough to satisfy the requirements, and filter those that do not overlap with Object 4.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Placing Object 5**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with placing 50 stable locations for a new object (Object ID 5) on a surface (Surface 0). I need to be careful to avoid collisions with two other objects that are already placed on the surface. These objects are at fixed locations and orientations.
           
           Here's my approach:
           
           1.  **Define the Problem:** I have the dimensions and positions of the existing objects (Object 4 and Object 6). I also know the dimensions of the new object (Object 5). I've got the surface bounds.
           2.  **Calculate AABBs:** I started by calculating the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for the existing objects. This makes collision detection much simpler because it allows me to quickly determine if a proposed location for Object 5 has the potential to collide. Since the existing objects are not rotated, the AABB calculations are straight-forward (center + or - half width/height).
           3.  **Rotation and AABB:** Object 5 is almost square, so for efficiency I decided to sample a few different rotation angles (theta) and consider them, but really rotation shouldn't make a huge impact on potential positions.
               *   For each rotation, I'll calculate the *effective* width and height.
               *   Then, for each rotation, I'll look at the placement space available.
           
           4.  **Define Placement Grid:** I'll determine the valid placement area for Object 5 based on the surface boundaries and the AABBs of the existing objects. I'll create a grid of candidate placement locations within this area.
           5.  **Collision Checks:** I'll then iterate through the grid, placing Object 5 at each candidate location (with the current rotation) and checking for collisions with the AABBs of the other objects. If no collision is detected, I'll record that placement as valid.
           6.  **Find 50 Placements:** I'll continue generating candidate placements and collision checks until I have found 50 valid, collision-free locations.
           
           In practice, I'll iterate quickly through thetas, starting with 0.  Since the object is almost square, I'll only need to sample the range 0 to pi/2 in theta.
