           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object

           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v16)
           Atom pose(v14, #o2)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v16)
           Atom supported(v14, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes several objects (v8, v12, v14) that are stackable and currently located on a surface (v11). The goal is to move all three objects (v8, v12, v14) to be on object v16.
           
           The initial state indicates the robot's current configuration (atbconf v3, ataconf v4 v5, ataconf v6 v7) and that both arms are empty (handempty v4, handempty v6). We also know that all three objects (v8, v12, v14) are graspable and have various possible poses and grasps defined, as well as supported on v11 in their current poses.
           
           However, the only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action only moves the robot's base from its current configuration v3 to v3, using trajectory #o0. It does not allow for any manipulation of objects (picking or placing) or any cleaning or cooking actions.
           
           Since the goal requires changing the location of objects (moving them from v11 to v16), and the only available action does not allow for any object manipulation, the goal is unachievable with the given set of allowed actions. The robot cannot pick up or place any objects.
