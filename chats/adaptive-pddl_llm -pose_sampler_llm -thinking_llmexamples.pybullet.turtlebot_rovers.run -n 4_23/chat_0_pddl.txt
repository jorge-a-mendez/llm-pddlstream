           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal expands into a conjunction of conditions: I need to ensure that four `receivedimage` predicates and two `receivedanalysis` predicates become true.  The `receivedimage` predicates depend on `send_image` actions, and the `receivedanalysis` predicates depend on `send_analysis` actions.  I've analyzed the initial state and the provided axiom definition and confirmed that none of these predicates are initially true.
           
           The key constraint here is the *allowed actions*. I'm only permitted to use actions that are explicitly listed.  After carefully reviewing those, I've confirmed that the only allowed action instances are two *move* actions (which basically keep the rovers at their initial configurations) and two *drop_rock* actions.  Neither *send_image* nor *send_analysis* is in this list.
           
           The standard PDDL formulation requires an objective rover to send image data to a lander. This requires a complex plan with calibration steps, image capture, and transmission. However, all these core actions are missing from the list.
           
           Since I am restricted to the provided action instances and these do not include the actions necessary to achieve the goal's `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` components, I conclude that this goal is *unreachable* from the initial state given the constraints.  I am confident in this conclusion. There is no valid plan, and I will not include a plan in the output.
