           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **Here's how I'm thinking about generating those 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0:**
           
           I've got the dimensions of the object (0.07 x 0.07) and the surface definition. I need to make sure the object is *fully* contained within the surface for it to be stable.  Since the object is a square, its rotation doesn't change much, but I'll account for it by calculating the new width and height based on the rotation angle (theta).
           
           I can define the surface as a rectangle with minimum and maximum x and y values, and then make sure the object's AABB is also entirely within those bounds. The object's AABB dimensions will vary slightly depending on the rotation.  Because it's a square, the widest AABB occurs at a 45-degree rotation.
           
           My strategy is to first generate placements at two different rotation angles: 0 degrees and 45 degrees. I will ensure that each of these placements is stable, meaning the object is within the surface bounds.  Since the surface is much bigger than the square object, I'll create a grid of evenly spaced placements in both directions for each rotation.
           
           For theta = 0, I calculated the valid x and y ranges. I will create a 5x5 grid of placements to get 25 placements.
           
           For theta = pi/4 (45 degrees), I'll do the same.  I calculated the new x and y ranges. Again, I will create a 5x5 grid for another 25 placements.
           
           This will give me the 50 placements needed and diverse enough variations in terms of position and orientation to cover the surface. I also confirmed that each one will be stable and within the given boundaries.  Now, I just need to output the list of placements in the correct format as a list of tuples.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 10**
           
           Okay, I've got a new placement request. Object 10 needs to be put somewhere on surface 0, and I need to generate 50 stable, non-colliding placements. The key thing here is to efficiently utilize the surface area while avoiding overlap with the existing object 5.
           
           First, I need to understand the object's dimensions and how rotation affects its bounding box. Object 10's dimensions are almost a perfect square, suggesting the AABB dimensions given represent `theta=0` in the object's local coordinate system. A rotation would *increase* its effective AABB. Since I need to maximize fitting, I should start with `theta = 0` to minimize the bounding box.
           
           I've already calculated the AABB for object 5 and the dimensions of object 10. Now, I need to determine where object 10 *can* be placed. The surface is defined by `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`, with width 0.6 and height 0.6. Object 5 occupies `((4.2, -0.6), (4.27, -0.53))`. Object 10 is large at 0.099 x 0.099. That limits options for x and y center.
           
           The strategy is to find 50 stable x, y pairs on the surface, ensuring they don't collide with object 5, and then to translate each to a 3-tuple (surf_idx, theta, x, y) for placement. I will prioritize `theta = 0` due to size minimization. If all fails, I'll switch.
           
           To avoid collision, I calculated that the center of object 10 must be *at least* half a bounding box width (approx 0.04949) to the right or above object 5. This places a minimum x and y to stay away from a collision.
           
           I will create a grid of potential placements within the surface bounds, ensuring at least half a bounding box's distance from object 5. From the valid points (x, y), I'll make the translation to the appropriate 4-tuple.
           
           The process I will follow is:
           1.  Calculate surface bounds and object dimensions.
           2.  Determine a non-collision region (from the x, y values from step 1).
           3.  Generate grid points in the non-collision region.
           4.  Generate at most 50 stable configurations for placement using a systematic method for choice.
           
           50 placements are now ready, ensuring that there is no collision with object 5 or that they are within the bounds of surface 0.
           
           Based on the above calculations, here is the list of 50 stable placements, all with `theta=0`:
           
           ```
