           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.19, 0.521)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.751, 0.18), (-4.666, 0.265)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.708, 0.223, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.616, 0.787).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Planning to Satisfy a Conjunctive Goal**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to a conjunction of two atoms: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`.  I've already identified that `v8` is of type `v17`, and therefore a potential candidate for `?green`. Since I already have `type(v8, v17)` in the initial state, I just need to satisfy `on(v8, v18)`. This means placing `v8` *on* `v18`.
           
           To satisfy `on(v8, v18)`, I need the atoms `supported(v8, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v8, ?p)` to be true. Examining the initial state, I see that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is already true, meaning `v8` is *currently* supported by `#o2` which is on `v18`.  However, `v8` is currently at a different pose.  
           
           This leads me to a plan:  I need to pick up `v8` from its current pose `v9`, move the robot's base, and then place `v8` at a new pose that *also* satisfies supported.
           
           The problem, therefore, boils down to finding a viable location for `v8` on the surface `v18` by picking it and placing it. The necessary actions available are pick and place. These have constraints regarding grasp, trajectory, and base configuration. So:
           
           1.  **Move Base:** I will need to use `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)` to move from the base's starting position `v3` to a base configuration `#o3` that is within reach of `v8` at the initial pose and close to target surface. The `kin` fact demonstrates that a certain gripper, base conf, and pose trajectory is possible.
           2.  **Pick:** The `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)` action involves `v4` for the arm, `v8`, `v9` for the pose and other # variables. Preconditions must be met, like handempty, gripper, correct pose, no unsafe approach or trajectories.
           3.  **Place:** The `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)` uses gripper, `#o3` which has the robot base conf, and another trajectory. The plan's objective is achieved: place `v8` on `v18`.
           
           By default, any condition not explicitly stated in the initial state is false, so I can safely assume that any negative preconditions like `~unsafeapproach` or `~unsafepose` (meaning no unsafe approach or pose) are true since the positive conditions are not in the initial state.
           
           **Generating a Continuous Pose for v8**
           
           The key remaining step is to define the exact pose for `#o2`, which determines where `v8` will be placed on `v18`.  I need to ensure `v8` remains within the bounds of `v18`, so I need to translate the initial (4.5, 0.3) pose. After calculating the width, I chose a new pose for `v8` within v18 such that its center is at (4.5, -0.3) and maintain a z-coordinate of 0.8 (from v9, v8, supported). So, the full pose for `#o2` will be (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), where 0.0 is the quaternion angle.
           
           Therefore, the final plan is:
           1. `move_base(v3, #o3, #o0)`
           2. `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
           3. `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`
              with the continuous pose `#o2` at (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)
           
           This plan satisfies the initial goal.
