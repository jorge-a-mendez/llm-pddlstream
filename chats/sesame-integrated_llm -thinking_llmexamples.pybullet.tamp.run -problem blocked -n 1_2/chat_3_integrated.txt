           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((2.158, -0.481), (3.196, 0.513)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.751, 0.18), (-4.666, 0.265)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.708, 0.223, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.616, 0.787).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Geometric Constraints**
           
           My task is to devise a plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to placing the object `v12` at a specific pose on surface `v18` and ensuring it's of a certain type. The initial state tells me that `v12` is of the required type and is initially at pose `v13`, supported by `v14`.  I need to pick it up and place it on `v18`.
           
           The standard approach would involve: 1) Moving the robot base, 2) Picking `v12`, and 3) Placing it.  I have facts indicating that base and arm motions (using the `kin` predicate) *exist* for these steps.  However, the `kin` facts are crucial here, as they *strongly tie* the reachability of the arm for *both* pick and place *to the same base configuration*, denoted as `#o3`.
           
           Examining the scene geometry, `v13` (where `v12` *starts*) is located at approximately `(-4.7, 0.2)` while the target location on `v18` (where `v12` *must end*) is around `(4.5, -0.3)`. This translates to a distance of approximately 9.2 meters between the two required arm poses. The PR2-like robot I'm dealing with can't reach that far with its arm from a single base configuration.
           
           The preconditions for `pick` and `place` include the *reachability facts* from `kin`. These facts, however, are *fixed* to `#o3`, meaning the robot must use the *same base position* for picking and placing.  Given the wide separation between source and target, a single base configuration will simply not allow the required arm motions.
           
           Because the available facts and actions constrain pick and place operations to the same impossible-to-reach base position, the goal is unreachable.  There's no way to physically move `v12` the required distance with the specified kinematic constraints. The problem is unsolvable given the geometric arrangement.
