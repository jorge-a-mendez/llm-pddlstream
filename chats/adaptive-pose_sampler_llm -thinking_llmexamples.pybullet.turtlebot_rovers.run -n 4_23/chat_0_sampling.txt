User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Expert Summary: Robot Base Position Generation for a Given Target**
           
           My primary objective is to generate 25 feasible base positions (x, y) for a robot, given a target point (2.19, -2.28) and a constraint that the base must be within a maximum range of 4 units from the target. The robot's orientation will automatically face the target. Crucially, I need to account for fixed obstacles within the scene and ensure a clear line of sight to the target from each base position. The base positions are also limited to a region of x: [-2.5, 2.5] and y: [-2.5, 2.5].
           
           The scene geometry presents a significant challenge. A central vertical wall at x=0 effectively divides the area, and there are numerous other AABB obstacles of varying sizes. This central wall presents an immediate challenge as I must ensure any chosen (x, y) point has line of sight to the target on the other side. The target itself is in the bottom-right quadrant (x > 0, y < 0), very close to the boundaries of the scene.
           
           I have meticulously analyzed the target coordinates and scene characteristics to formulate a strategic approach. Considering the obstacles and the target's location, my initial thinking is that the robot's base should also be on the right side of x = 0 to avoid the central wall. Given the target's coordinates and boundary constraints, I can determine the reachable region around the target.
           
           I will focus on generating positions in the right side of the scene. I have chosen a sampling of points around the target, varying both distance and angle. I will carefully consider the x bounds and make sure all candidates satisfy `x > 0.05`.
           My initial generation process revealed that obstacle 17, which is very close to the target, is crucial. If the y coordinate is in a certain range, then an x coordinate to the left of the target would run into that obstacle. The `x` and `y` constraints are as follows:
           
           *   **x > 0.05:** Avoid the central partition at x = 0.
           *   **Target point** (2.19, -2.28)
           
           I sampled a grid of points, generating a diverse pool of candidate (x, y) coordinates with appropriate x bounds based on obstacle 17 and the central wall. Then, I filtered the list for points within the range, which resulted in the 25 points I present now. I am confident that these positions provide a good range of options for placing the robot while avoiding collisions and providing clear lines of sight to the target. I've also checked each candidate to ensure they meet the constraints, which were distance from target, scene limits, and central obstacle consideration. These selected positions will be robust for ensuring line of sight.
