           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is a square room with dimensions 5x5, from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5). There's a central vertical wall at x=0. There are also several smaller obstacles scattered throughout the room, mostly in the corners and along the walls. I need to find 3 robot base positions within a 2 unit radius from the target point {target_point}, avoiding fixed obstacles and considering the room boundaries. I will prioritize positions that offer a clear line of sight to the target and are not too close to the obstacles. I will try to space the positions out to increase the chances of finding a valid one. I will also make sure the positions are within the x and y limits of [-2.5, 2.5].

Model:     The target point is (-1.836, 1.810). The previous attempts failed due to no line of sight or collision with obstacle 12. Obstacle 12 is at ((1.096, 2.254), (1.221, 2.378)). The previous positions were far from the target. I need to be careful to select positions within the max range of 2. I'll focus on the area around the target, being mindful of the central wall at x=0. Since the target is in the negative x half, I will prioritize positions in that half of the room. I also need to be careful with the obstacles in the top left quadrant such as 8, 10, 18, 20, 21.

Model:     The target point is (-1.836, 1.810). Previous attempts included positions far from the target (first request) and positions on the same x-coordinate as the target or the wall (second request). The central wall at x=0 is a major obstacle for positions in the positive x region. The previous proposed positions were (-1.8361, 0.0), (-0.8361, 1.810), and (-2.4, 1.810). None of them passed. I need to be careful with the obstacles in the top left quadrant such as 8: ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)), 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)), 18: ((-1.48, 2.266), (-1.355, 2.391)), 20: ((-1.885, 1.76), (-1.786, 1.858)), and 21: ((-0.389, 1.993), (-0.293, 2.088)). Given these obstacles, I will try to place the robot in a clear zone slightly to the left and below the target, or possibly directly below it but still within the max range.

All of these failed with either no line of sight or not reachable. I need to get much closer to the target, as all of the previous points were quite far. The maximum distance is 2. The target is in the upper left quadrant, near the wall and several small obstacles: 10: ((-0.75, 1.75), (-0.25, 2.25)) and 21: ((-0.389, 1.993), (-0.293, 2.088)). My previous attempts were too far away, and likely occluded by obstacles or the central wall. I'll focus on positions within a 2-unit radius from the target, especially to the right (positive x) or below (negative y) to try and avoid obstacles to the left and directly above the target.

           (0.0, 1.5) collided with obstacle 5 (the central wall at x=0).
           This shows that placing the robot near the central wall (x=0) is problematic. The target is in the upper right quadrant.

           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The target point is now (1.894, 1.907). The previous attempts for this target were (1.0, 1.0), (0.5, 0.5), and (2.0, 1.5). All failed with "not reachable" or "no line of sight." The target is in the upper right quadrant, close to the wall and several small obstacles: 7: ((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)) and 19: ((1.847, 1.860), (1.940, 1.953)). Obstacle 19 is very close to the target, suggesting that placing the robot in that immediate vicinity might be difficult. Obstacle 7 encloses the target. This indicates that I need to place the robot *outside* obstacle 7, but still within a 2-unit radius. I'll try to find positions just outside the box defined by obstacle 7, and in areas that generally seem clear from previous feedback.

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

This means I need to find a position that is outside of these obstacles and still provides line of sight, and is within the 2-unit range. I'll focus on positions further away from the corner, perhaps to the bottom-right or bottom-left of the cluster of obstacles in the top-right corner. I will also consider positions along the right wall.
