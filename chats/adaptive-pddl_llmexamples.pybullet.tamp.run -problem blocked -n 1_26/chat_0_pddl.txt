           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene contains several objects: `v3` (a base configuration), `v4` and `v6` (arms), `v8`, `v12`, `v15` (graspable and stackable objects), and `v10`, `v11`, `v14`, `v18` (regions/surfaces).
           
           The initial state indicates:
           - The robot is at base configuration `v3` (`atbconf(v3)`).
           - Both arms `v4` and `v6` are handempty (`handempty(v4)`, `handempty(v6)`) and at their respective arm configurations (`ataconf(v4, v5)`, `ataconf(v6, v7)`).
           - Objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are at specific poses on various surfaces.
               - `v8` is at `v9` on `v11`, and also at `#o2` on `v18` and `v10`.
               - `v12` is at `v13` on `v14`, and also at `#o2` on `v18` and `v10`.
               - `v15` is at `v16` on `v11`, and also at `#o2` on `v10`.
           - `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`.
           - `v8`, `v12`, and `v15` are graspable and stackable on `v10` and `v18`.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be satisfied by `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. This means we need to get an object of type `v17` onto `v18`. From the initial state, `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`. Also, `v8` is already at pose `#o2` on `v18`, satisfying `on(v8, v18)`. Similarly, `v12` is already at pose `#o2` on `v18`, satisfying `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           Therefore, the goal is already met by the initial state, as both `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17` and are already on `v18`. Since the goal is already satisfied, no actions are needed.
           
           --Plan--:

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The previous response incorrectly indicated an empty plan by outputting `)`. The goal `new-axiom@0()` is satisfied if there is an object of type `v17` on `v18`.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `type(v8, v17)` is true.
           - `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` is true.
           - `atpose(v8, #o2)` is true (due to the problem setup implying that if a pose is listed with supported, and atpose for a different pose, the continuous parameter pose is also "at").
           
           Therefore, based on the axiom `on(?o: object, ?r: object)` (which is `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` and `atpose(?o, ?p)`), `on(v8, v18)` is true.
           Since `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` are true, the conditions for `new-axiom@0()` are already met in the initial state. No actions are required to achieve the goal. However, the problem formulation requires a plan, even if it's minimal. The only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action moves the base from `v3` to `v3` using trajectory `#o0`. This action doesn't change the state of `v8` or `v12` or their positions, nor does it affect their type. Since the goal is already met and the problem demands a plan, we can include this no-op action.
           
           --Plan--:
           (move_base v3 v3 #o0)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

Model:     I apologize for the previous incorrect responses. It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding how the `new-axiom@0()` is evaluated or if my previous assessment of its satisfaction was correct.
           
           Let's re-evaluate the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This axiom is defined as:
           ```
           Axiom new-axiom@0()
             Conjunction
               Atom on(?green, v18)
               Atom type(?green, v17)
           ```
           To satisfy this goal, we need to find an object, let's call it `?green`, such that it is of `type v17` AND `on v18`.
           
           From the initial state:
           - `type(v8, v17)` is true.
           - `type(v12, v17)` is true.
           
           Now let's check the `on` predicate using its axiom:
           ```
           Axiom on(?o: object, ?r: object)
             Conjunction
               Atom supported(?o, ?p, ?r)
               Atom atpose(?o, ?p)
           ```
           So, for an object `?o` to be `on ?r`, it must be `supported` at some `?p` on `?r`, and it must actually be `atpose(?o, ?p)`.
           
           Let's check for `v8` and `v12`:
           
           For `v8`:
           - `type(v8, v17)` is true.
           - We have `supported(v8, v9, v11)`. But `v11` is not `v18`.
           - We have `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`. For `on(v8, v18)` to be true, we also need `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           - We *also* have `atpose(v8, v9)`. So, `on(v8, v11)` is true.
           
           For `v12`:
           - `type(v12, v17)` is true.
           - We have `supported(v12, v13, v14)`. But `v14` is not `v18`.
           - We have `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. For `on(v12, v18)` to be true, we also need `atpose(v12, #o2)`.
           - We *also* have `atpose(v12, v13)`. So, `on(v12, v14)` is true.
           
           Crucially, the initial state provides `atpose(v8, v9)` and `atpose(v12, v13)`. It does *not* explicitly state `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)`. Even though `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` are given, if `v8` is `atpose(v8, v9)` and `v9` is different from `#o2`, then `on(v8, v18)` is not true. Similarly for `v12`.
           
           Since the problem states "Any fact that is not explicitly stated in the initial state is *false*", we cannot assume `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)` are true. Therefore, `on(v8, v18)` and `on(v12, v18)` are NOT true in the initial state.
           
           This means we need to move `v8` or `v12` to a pose where it is supported by `v18`. However, the only action available is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action does not allow us to pick up or place objects. The `pick` and `place` actions are not available in the list of valid action instances.
           
           Given that the goal requires an object to be placed on `v18`, and there are no `pick` or `place` actions available, the goal is *unreachable* with the given set of allowed actions. The `move_base` action only moves the robot's base and does not affect the state of objects on surfaces or the `on` predicate.
