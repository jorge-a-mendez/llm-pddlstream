User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 4 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is primarily defined by a large square outer boundary from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), reinforced by thin rectangles along its edges. There's a central vertical wall at x=0, and several smaller, scattered obstacles within the space. I need to find positions that avoid these fixed obstacles. The max_range of 4 from the target point means I can generally explore a wide area around the target, but I must also stay within the [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] overall robot placement limits.
           
           Given the constraints, I will prioritize positions that are clearly away from known obstacles and provide a good view of the target. I will try to sample around the target point. I also need to ensure that the robot base is within the overall [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5] bounds. I will try to generate a diverse set of positions around the target, considering different directions (north, south, east, west, and diagonals). Since the target is {target_point}, I'll consider points in its vicinity, checking for collisions with known obstacles.
           
           Positions:
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 0.5})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] - 0.5})
           ({target_point[0] + 0.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] - 0.5} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] + 0.5} {target_point[1] + 0.5})
           ({target_point[0] - 0.5} {target_point[1] + 0.5})
           ({target_point[0] + 0.5} {target_point[1] - 0.5})
           ({target_point[0] - 0.5} {target_point[1] - 0.5})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 1.0})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] - 1.0})
           ({target_point[0] + 1.0} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.0} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] + 1.0} {target_point[1] + 1.0})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.0} {target_point[1] + 1.0})
           ({target_point[0] + 1.0} {target_point[1] - 1.0})
           ({target_point[0] - 1.0} {target_point[1] - 1.0})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] + 2.0})
           ({target_point[0]} {target_point[1] - 2.0})
           ({target_point[0] + 2.0} {target_point[1]})
           ({target_point[0] - 2.0} {target_point[1]})

           ({target_point[0] + 2.0} {target_point[1] - 2.0})
           ({target_point[0] - 2.0} {target_point[1] - 2.0})
