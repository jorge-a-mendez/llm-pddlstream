User:      The robot can only be placed within the following limits for (x, y, theta):
           x: [-2.5, 2.5], y: [-2.5, 2.5], theta: [-inf, inf]
           
           New request:
           
           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

(Thoughts: **Finding Optimal Robot Base Positions**
           
           My objective is to determine three valid (x, y) robot base positions for a given target point, considering a maximum range of 2 and a list of fixed obstacles within a defined workspace. My initial understanding of the scene reveals a rectangular environment bounded by walls and a prominent central vertical wall. The target lies in the bottom-right quadrant, prompting me to favor base positions on the right side of the central wall to maintain potential line of sight.
           
           My process involved defining several functions: `is_point_in_aabb` and `is_colliding` to check for obstacle collisions, `is_in_global_bounds` to enforce the workspace limits of `[-2.5, 2.5]` for both x and y, and `calculate_distance` to compute the distance to the target, and `is_valid_candidate` to combine all conditions.
           
           After a review of a series of potential candidate points, I selected three final positions:
           1.  `(0.63, -1.91)`: To the left of the target, mid-range.
           2.  `(2.13, -0.41)`: Above the target, mid-range.
           3.  `(1.63, -1.41)`: Upper-left diagonal from the target, closer.
           
           These positions ensure diversity in placement around the target while being within the required range, global boundaries, and free from collision with any fixed obstacles. I have addressed the central wall by positioning my candidate positions to the right of it (x > 0.05).
