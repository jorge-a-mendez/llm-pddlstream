           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Refinement and Plan Generation**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to satisfy `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, specifically `v12` which is also `?green`, both "on" a surface (`v18`) and of a particular "type" (`v17`). The initial state gives us `type(v12, v17)`, so we need to get `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see `v12` is supported by `v14` at pose `v13`. It's also supported by `v18` at pose `#o2` according to  `supported(v12, #o2, v18)`. This leads me to believe I need to move `v12` from `v13` to `#o2`.
           
           The plan emerges:
           
           1.  If necessary, move the robot's base to a suitable configuration, base configuration `#o3`.
           2.  Pick `v12` up from its current pose, `v13`.
           3.  Place `v12` onto the target surface `v18` at pose `#o2`.
           
           I have the actions I need. `pick(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)` and `place(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`. I need to check the preconditions, and this includes `kin` predicates, which require that I have the suitable configurations (bconf) and base conf (aconf) that will permit these movements. It seems from the setup that there is at least one suitable pose (`#o3`) which will enable a correct movement. I must move the base to the right position, and then pick and place.
           The preconditions also include information on whether a grasp is defined, and whether trajectories might be dangerous. These are important, but not available in the initial state, so I'll assume they are safe.
           
           **Plan Steps and Preconditions**
           
           1.  **Move Base:** If base configuration `v3` is not suitable, I will execute `(move_base v3 #o3 #o0)`. This requires the initial state includes `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `atbconf(v3)`.
           2.  **Pick Object:** I will execute `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. The preconditions are :`kin(v4, v12, v13, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `handempty(v4)` and `atbconf(#o3)`. I will also need to address any unsafe predicates.
           3.  **Place Object:** I will execute `(place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. The preconditions are `kin(v4, v12, #o2, #o1, #o3, #o4)`, `atgrasp(v4, v12, #o1)`, and `atbconf(#o3)`. I need to ensure there are no unsafe pose or approach conditions here either.
           
           After these actions, I will have `atpose(v12, #o2)` and thus `on(v12, v18)`, which, combined with the initial state fact of `type(v12, v17)`, will achieve my goal.
           
           **Continuous Variable Assignment**
           
           The key to executing this plan is the assignment of continuous values to the poses and trajectories involved.
           
           *   `#o0` (base trajectory) needs an assignment.
           *   `#o1` (the grasp) requires a defined instance.
           *   `#o2` is a target pose (for the object on the surface). This one is key.
           *   `#o3` is base configuration.
           *   `#o4` is an arm trajectory.
           
           `#o2` is crucial. The initial state gives us the AABB for `v12` and `v18` and other pose information.
           I will place the object `v12` (with AABB  `((-4.488, 0.289), (-4.396, 0.38))`) onto surface `v18` (AABB `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`).
           I'll position `v12` at the center of `v1
)
