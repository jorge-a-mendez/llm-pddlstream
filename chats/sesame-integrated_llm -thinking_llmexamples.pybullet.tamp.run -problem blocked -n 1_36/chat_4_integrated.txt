           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.488, 0.289), (-4.396, 0.38)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.442, 0.335, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.981, 0.196).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v19 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((3.256, -1.417), (4.353, -0.416)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning for Achieving the Goal: `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process: The objective is to satisfy the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially means I need to make sure an object (`v12`) is *on* another object (`v18`) and that the correct *type* applies to the first object. Since the object type is already fulfilled in the initial conditions (`type(v12, v17)` is true), the primary hurdle is achieving `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           My initial analysis reveals a key detail: `on(v12, v18)` actually expands to `supported(v12, #p1, v18)` and `atpose(v12, #p1)`.  The 'supported' part is already true, meaning `v12` being *at* a certain position `#p1` is the missing ingredient. Since `v12` *isn't* currently at `#p1` (it's at pose `v13`), I need to devise a sequence of actions that will *move* `v12` to the correct location.
           
           To make this happen, I identified two fundamental actions: *pick* and *place*. I must first *pick* `v12` from its current pose `v13` and then *place* it at the target pose `#p1`. I need to ensure the preconditions of these actions are met.
           
           For the `pick` action: I needed to first move the base to the location to pick `v12` from `v13`. Then the move the base.
           
           For the `place` action: Likewise, I need to move the base again.
           
           Regarding placement coordinates, the most important part is to place the object in the correct z-axis, to be exactly supported. I will have the object place on the surface `v18`. Therefore, the best position for `v12` to land on `v18` will be with `(4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0)`.
           
           Putting this all together, the plan to achieve `new-axiom@0()` is as follows:
           
           1.  **`move_base(v3, #q2, #t5)`:** Move to the object.
           2.  **`pick(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t4)`:** Pick up the object `v12`.
           3.  **`move_base(#q2, #q3, #o0)`:** Move to the place location.
           4.  **`place(v4, v12, #p1, #g1, #q3, #t6)`:** Place the object `v12` at pose `(4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0)`.
           
           I've carefully assessed each action's preconditions and confirmed they are satisfied in the correct order. I've also verified the final placement will not produce any collisions. This should lead to a successful outcome.
