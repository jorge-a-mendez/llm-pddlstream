           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Planning to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to devise a plan that fulfills the goal `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunction of two atomic facts: `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)`. Analyzing the initial state, I determine that `?green` must be `v12` because the only available `type` fact is `type(v12, v17)`. Therefore, the simplified goal becomes `on(v12, v18)`.
           
           To achieve `on(v12, v18)`, I must find a pose `?p` where both `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)` are true. The initial state provides `supported(v12, #p1, v18)`, thus `#p1` is the correct pose. My goal is now to establish `atpose(v12, #p1)`.
           
           Currently, `v12` is at pose `v13`, so I recognize the need for a pick-and-place sequence: `pick` `v12` from `v13` and `place` it at `#p1`. This prompts the following plan:
           
           1.  **Move Base:**  Navigate the base to a suitable configuration `#q2` using motion trajectory `#t5`.
           2.  **Pick Object:** Use the arm `v4` to pick `v12` from `v13`, applying grasp `#g1` and using base configuration `#q2` and trajectory `#t4`.
           3.  **Move Base:** Reposition the base to `#q3` using motion trajectory `#t7`.
           4.  **Place Object:** Place `v12` at `#p1` using arm `v4`, grasp `#g1`, base configuration `#q3`, and trajectory `#t6`.
           
           I then verify the preconditions for each step, ensuring a valid order.
           
           *   Step 1 requires `basemotion(v3, #t5, #q2)` and `atbconf(v3)`, both given initially, and `canmove()`.
           *   Step 2 requires `kin(v4, v12, v13, #g1, #q2, #t4)`, which is given, `atpose(v12, v13)`, `handempty(v4)`, and `atbconf(#q2)` (achieved by step 1).  I also assume negated unsafe conditions regarding approach, which are implicitly true if not explicitly false.
           *   Step 3 requires `basemotion(#q2, #t7, #q3)`, and `canmove()` (achieved by the prior steps), and `atbconf(#q2)`.
           *   Step 4 requires `kin(v4, v12, #p1, #g1, #q3, #t6)`, and `atgrasp(v4, v12, #g1)` (achieved by the prior steps), and `atbconf(#q3)`. I again must assume negated unsafe conditions.
           
           The total cost is the sum of the distances travelled by the robot during the moves plus the `pick` and `place` costs.
           
           Considering the continuous parameters, especially the target pose `#p1`, the problem statement highlights the need to find a collision-free and stable placement. Based on the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of object `v12` and surface `v18`, I calculate an appropriate pose for `#p1` at `(4.5, -0.3, 0.801, 0.0)`. This places the object on the center of the surface at a Z coordinate consistent with the object's initial position, assuming that the object has a base surface at Z coordinate.
           
           Finally, I address the repeated `new-axiom@0()` description, assuming it to be a copy-paste error and that the initial interpretation still holds. I confirm that all preconditions are met in a logical sequence. The `pick` and `place` actions have been checked to be applicable and their execution is reliant on preconditions being true.  This means that `on(v12, v18)` is fulfilled when the object is placed at `#p1`. I also acknowledge that the system is responsible for generating valid collision-free motions, and I am only required to provide the pose of `#p1`.
