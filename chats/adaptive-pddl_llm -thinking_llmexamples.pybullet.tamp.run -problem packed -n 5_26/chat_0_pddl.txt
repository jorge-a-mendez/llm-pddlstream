               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Missing Kinematic Information**
           
           My objective is to rearrange a set of objects, `v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18`, from their initial resting place on `v11` to be positioned on `v20`.  My analysis leads me to believe this is currently unattainable. The necessary actions to achieve this, `pick` and `place`, hinge on the satisfaction of their *kinematic* preconditions, specifically the `kin` predicate. This predicate essentially signifies that a feasible kinematic solution exists for moving an object using the robotic arm, defining the grasp, the required arm trajectory, and the robot's base configuration for each pick and place operation. However, the initial state of this problem explicitly states that any fact not explicitly mentioned is false. Crucially, the initial state *does not include* any `kin` facts.  Therefore, according to the provided problem domain, these `kin` predicates are false, making the preconditions for `pick` and `place` inherently unachievable. Without the ability to pick and place, it's impossible to execute the desired transformation and reach the intended goal state, leaving the objective unachievable.
