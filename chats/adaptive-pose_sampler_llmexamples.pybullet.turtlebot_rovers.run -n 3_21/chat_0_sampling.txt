           Target point: {target_point}. Please provide a valid placement for the robot base (x y) within the max distance 2 from the target point. 

Model:     The scene is primarily defined by a large square bounding box from (-2.5, -2.5) to (2.5, 2.5), with thinner bounding boxes forming the outer walls, suggesting an enclosed area. There's a central vertical wall (0, -2.5) to (0, 2.5). Several smaller obstacles are scattered throughout, some of which are very small. I will prioritize positions that are away from the known obstacles and that offer a clear line of sight to the target. Given the target point is (0.83 -1.02), I'll try to place the robot in open areas, such as to the right of the central wall, while staying within the max_range=2 from the target.
           
           Positions:
           (0.83 -0.02)
           (2.03 -1.02)
           (0.83 -2.02)

User:      The following failures were found from the previous request. These were positions that either collided with fixed obstacles or did not have line-of-sight to the target point. You may use these as negative examples for future requests:

Model:     The previous attempts failed because the proposed positions did not have a line of sight to the target point (0.51 2.16). This means there's an obstacle blocking the view, most likely the central wall or some of the smaller obstacles in the upper half. I need to get much closer to the target point and consider the obstacles more carefully. The target is in the upper right quadrant, near some small obstacles (9, 10, 20, 21). I will try positions that are above or to the side of these obstacles, within the max_range=2.

Model:     The target point is now (-2.09 2.16). My previous attempts were for a different target, but the new failures are very informative. Two positions collided with obstacles, (1.51 2.16) with obstacle 15 and (-0.51 2.16) with obstacles 10 and 21. These obstacles are in the upper left and upper right sections of the map. My general strategy is to keep a safe distance from all known obstacles and try to approach the target from different directions. Given the target is at (-2.09 2.16), which is in the upper left corner, I need to be careful about obstacles 8 and 19 which are also in this corner. I will try to place the robot further away from the obstacles and closer to the edges, but still within the max range of 2.

Model:     The target point is now (-0.46 -0.66). My previous attempts for the target (-2.09 2.16) resulted in failures. The position (-1.09 2.16) failed due to a collision with obstacle 8 ((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)). The positions (-2.09 0.16) and (-2.09 1.16) both failed due to no line of sight, likely due to the central wall (obstacle 5) or other obstacles in that area.
           
           For the new target point (-0.46 -0.66), which is in the lower left quadrant of the map, I need to place the robot within a radius of 2. I'll need to consider obstacles 5 (the central wall), 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 17, which are scattered around the lower half of the map. I'll aim for positions to the left of the central wall (x < 0) and in the vicinity of the target.
           
           Positions:
           (-0.46 -2.46)
           (-2.46 -0.66)
           (-1.46 -0.66)
