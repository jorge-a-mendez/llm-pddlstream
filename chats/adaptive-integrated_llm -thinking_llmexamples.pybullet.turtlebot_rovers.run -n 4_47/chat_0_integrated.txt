           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My analysis indicates that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable given the current state and the available actions. The core problem lies in the inability of the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to change their configurations. They are initially at `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the only permitted "move" actions keep them fixed in these positions.
           
           The `new-axiom@0()` goal requires achieving `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`, as well as `receivedanalysis` predicates for a stone and soil. To accomplish the former, `send_image` actions are necessary, which in turn require `comvisible` and `imagevisible` predicates, with rovers at specific configurations. The `receivedanalysis` predicates will require `send_analysis`. However, the initial state provides `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates using configurations `#o3` and `#o0`, respectively.
           
           The key issue is that all image/communication-related actions (`calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `send_analysis`) have the precondition `atconf(?v, ?q)`, meaning the rover must be at a specific configuration.  Since the initial state places the rovers at fixed configurations (`atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`) and there are *no* actions to move the rovers to configurations like `#o3` or `#o0`, it's impossible to satisfy the preconditions of the `send_image` or `send_analysis` actions using the given actions and initial state. The given plan can use the move action which is an identity move, but it cannot change the rover configuration. 
           
           Because the rovers are locked in their initial configurations, the required `imagevisible` and `comvisible` predicates cannot be used. The available move actions are all identity moves, and the goal cannot be achieved. The solution space is thus exhausted, leading to the conclusion that the goal is unreachable.
