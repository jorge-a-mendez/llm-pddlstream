           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers (v12 and v14), a camera (v10), a lander (v9), a storage unit (v16), and several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) and objectives (v17, v18, v19, v20). There are also different types of rocks (v2 for v1, v3, v4 and v6 for v5, v7, v8) and a mode (v11). Both rovers are at specific configurations (v12 at v13, v14 at v15) and have the storage free. The camera is onboard both rovers, and supports mode v11.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` represents a complex state that requires several conditions to be met, including:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)`: Rover v12 is at configuration v13. This is true initially.
           - `atconf(v14, v15)`: Rover v14 is at configuration v15. This is true initially.
           - `free(v12, v16)`: Storage v16 on rover v12 is free. This is true initially.
           - `free(v14, v16)`: Storage v16 on rover v14 is free. This is true initially.
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: Image of objective v17 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: Image of objective v18 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: Image of objective v19 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `receivedimage(v20, v11)`: Image of objective v20 in mode v11 has been received.
           - `type(?stone, v2)`: Some object of type v2 (stone) exists. This is implicitly true with rocks v1, v3, v4.
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: An analysis of a stone (type v2) has been received.
           - `type(?soil, v6)`: Some object of type v6 (soil) exists. This is implicitly true with rocks v5, v7, v8.
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: An analysis of soil (type v6) has been received.
           
           The available actions are `move` and `drop_rock`.
           The `move` actions simply keep the rovers at their current configurations, which doesn't change anything relevant to achieving the goal beyond maintaining the `atconf` predicates.
           The `drop_rock` actions are not useful either as both storage units are already free.
           
           To achieve the goal, we need to:
           1. Receive images for objectives v17, v18, v19, v20 in mode v11. This requires `take_image` and `send_image` actions. Neither of these actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances.
           2. Receive analysis for a rock of type v2 and a rock of type v6. This requires `sample_rock` and `send_analysis` actions. Neither of these actions are available in the provided list of valid action instances.
           
           Since none of the actions required to achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates are available in the given list of allowed actions, the goal is unreachable.
           
           The only allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`, and none of these actions can change the state to satisfy the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals. Therefore, the goal is not achievable with the given set of valid action instances.
