           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.021, -0.296), (0.1, -0.218)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Unfeasible: Objects Too Large for Surface**
           
           After careful consideration of the problem and the constraints provided, I've concluded that the given goal state, where five specific objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) must all be placed on surface v20, is **unachievable**. The challenge lies in finding collision-free and stable placement locations for these objects within the limited space of v20.
           
           My analysis started with understanding the core objective: moving the five objects from their initial positions on surface v11 to v20.  I recognized that the actions of "pick" and "place" would be central to this plan.  Each "pick" would require a valid trajectory and hand configuration. Each "place" action would require the robot's base to be in a valid position and the robot's arm to be in a certain state and object pose and orientation.
           
           I then considered the AABB values provided for the objects (their geometries). Since the prompt stated that I must generate unique poses for each object, even if the symbolic pose is the same (e.g., #o2), I needed to generate unique pose values. The values had to be collision free and stable. Because of the nature of the problem, I have to ensure stability for all of the objects. This means, the objects must be contained within the v20's boundaries.
           
           I discovered that the objects are all too large to place 5 of them on `v20`.  Even if the objects were to be reconfigured by rotating the objects and placing them at angles relative to v20, the AABB values would still be larger than the allowable area. I considered 2x2 grid patterns to optimize object placements. I would also have to separate the objects enough so that there are no collisions.
           
           Given the object dimensions, and v20's dimensions, I have concluded that the objective stated is not feasible with the given constraints.
           
           Therefore, no plan is presented.
