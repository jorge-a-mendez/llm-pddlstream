           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.071, 0.493, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.745, 0.667).

           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.021, -0.296), (0.1, -0.218)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Planning to Arrange Objects on a Surface**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a scenario where I need to move a set of objects: `v8`, `v12`, `v14`, `v16`, and `v18` from their current locations on surface `v11` onto `v20`.  My understanding is that I need to provide continuous values for pose `(#o2)` for each object as this symbol in the PDDL plan is a placeholder, and they all have to be on `v20` at the end.  Fortunately, I see the robot's base won't move, as indicated by `move_base v3 v3`.
           
           I have two arms, but the kin facts, and the instructions indicate that I should use the same `v4`. The actions I have are `pick` and `place` so I need a series of those operations. Specifically, I'll need to `pick` each object from its current location, and then `place` it onto `v20`. Since the goal state is "on(object, v20)", I know these objects need to be *supported* by v20.  I've got the `kin` facts, which indicate the exact poses for grasping and placing.
           
           The problem specifically asks me to provide *distinct* coordinate values for each object on surface `v20`, even though the plan uses `#o2` for all place actions.  I take this to mean I'll assign different coordinates to each object on `v20`, making `#o2` a "template" for distinct poses.
           
           I've considered the geometry and the size of `v20`. It's a small space, so I'll need to pack these objects tightly. I chose `0.781` for the z-coordinate since that's what the problem stated, and it is a surface to place these objects. Then I chose x and y coordinate that would fit the size of `v20` based on its AABB. These locations should work. I'm going to set their rotation to 0.0 (quaternion (0,0,0,1)).
           
           Here's the planned action sequence I've decided on. I'll pick each object with arm `v4`, and then place it at its specified continuous pose on `v20`:
           1.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           2.  `(place v4 v8 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           3.  `(pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           4.  `(place v4 v12 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           5.  `(pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           6.  `(place v4 v14 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           7.  `(pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           8.  `(place v4 v16 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           9.  `(pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           10. `(place v4 v18 #o2 v20 #o1 v3 #o4)`
           
           The poses for placing (`#o2`) will be calculated based on the objects' dimensions and the surface area of `v20`, along with the z = `0.781`. I have calculated the location on surface `v20`. So, for `v8` at (0.08, 0.08, 0.781), `v12` at (-0.08, 0.08, 0.781), `v14` at (0.08, -0.08, 0.781), `v16` at (-0.08, -0.08, 0.781), and `v18` at (0.0, 0.0, 0.781).
           
           I believe this approach will satisfy the goal state and fulfill all constraints.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 #o3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, so the user has flagged a significant issue: the plan I generated earlier contained actions outside the permitted set.  Specifically, I used `pick` and `place` actions, and the *only* action allowed is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. That's a huge constraint.
           
           My goal is to achieve these `on` predicates: `on(v8, v20)`, `on(v12, v20)`, `on(v14, v20)`, `on(v16, v20)`, and `on(v18, v20)`.  I know that `on(?o, ?r)` is defined by the axiom `supported(?o, ?p, ?r) AND atpose(?o, ?p)`.  
           
           Looking at the initial state, I see a clear issue.  Each of the objects is currently `on(x, v11)`. To get them onto `v20`, I need to change the `atpose` predicate for each object to a pose supported by `v20`. The only way to change the `atpose` predicate are `pick` and `place` actions, which are *not* allowed. 
           
           The allowed action, `(move_base)`, doesn't touch the `atpose` predicate. It changes the robot's configuration.  Since I'm restricted to that single action, there's absolutely no way to modify the positions of the objects to satisfy the goal.  The problem statement is crystal clear: I can only use actions from the given list, and if the goal is unreachable, I shouldn't even attempt to provide a plan. Since I can't build a plan, I will not do so.
