           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Limited Actions**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which expands to finding an object `?green` that is both "on v18" and has a certain "type".  I considered both `v8` and `v12` as potential candidates for `?green` because they have the required "type".
           
           To fulfill the "on v18" condition, I need to place either `v8` or `v12` on `v18`.  This would entail a `pick` action to move the object from its initial support (either `v11` or `v14`) and then a `place` action to position it on `v18`.
           
           However, the key constraint is the list of available action *instances*. I need an action *instance* to construct a plan using it.  The only available action instance is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This implies moving the base between the same configuration.  No `pick` or `place` instances are available.
           
           Since the problem requires modifying the state via `pick` and `place` actions that are not available, the goal is unreachable.
