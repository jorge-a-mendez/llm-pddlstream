           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning about Goal Achievability with Limited Actions**
           
           Okay, here's my breakdown of the problem: I'm given a PDDL planning problem and need to determine if a specific goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is achievable given the initial state and available actions. The goal simplifies to ensuring an object is "on" a specific target (`v18`) and has a particular type (`v17`).
           
           My initial thought is to analyze the goal's structure and available facts in the initial state. The axioms for `new-axiom@0()` all boil down to `on(?green, v18) and type(?green, v17)`.  I can see that both `v8` and `v12` satisfy the `type(?green, v17)` condition, so either could be my `?green` candidate.
           
           Looking at the initial state, `v8` is currently on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`. To satisfy the "on" condition, I need to move either `v8` or `v12` to `v18`.  `v18` looks like it can be a supporting location based on facts about `supported` and  `stackable`.
           
           Now, the crucial part: the available action. The only action instance I can use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This moves the base from its current configuration to the same configuration using trajectory `#o0`.  Effectively, it *doesn't* change the robot's pose or object locations.
           
           The core of the problem is the action limitations.  To change the "on" status of an object, I'd need `pick` and `place` actions. However, those actions are *not* provided. Therefore, since I only have a `move_base` action that does not alter any "on" facts, I conclude the goal *cannot* be achieved. The provided action is simply insufficient to move any object to `v18`.
