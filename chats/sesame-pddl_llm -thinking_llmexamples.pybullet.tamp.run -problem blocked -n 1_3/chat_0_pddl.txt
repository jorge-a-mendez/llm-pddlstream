           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my plan to achieve the goal `Atom new-axiom@0()` (i.e., making an object be on a specific region and have a specific type).**
           
           First, I need to understand what the goal means.  `new-axiom@0()`  is equivalent to having an object (`?green`) be `on v18` and have the type `v17`. To do this, I will need to use predicates that describe the state of the objects, their locations, and the actions I can perform. The two available objects that can satisfy the type requirement are `v8` and `v12`.
           
           Now, I analyze the predicates I've got to work with: `on`, `type`, `supported`, `atpose`, `pick`, `place`, `move_base`, `kin`, `atgrasp`, `handempty`, `atbconf`, and several `NegatedAtom unsafe...` predicates.  The `on` predicate requires an object to be *supported* by another.  The `type` predicate is easily satisfied by observing the initial state and finding objects of type `v17`.
           
           My plan uses the available facts from the initial state, to choose either `v8` or `v12`. I am choosing `v8`.
           
           The solution is to pick the object from the *current* location and *place* it at the *target* location `v18`.  Since I need `on(v8, v18)`, I need to make sure `v8` is both at the right pose and supported by the region. The supporting pose for `v8` is `#o2` according to existing information in the initial state.
           
           The plan looks like this:
           
           1.  **Move the robot base from position `v3` to configuration `#o3` (using `move_base`).**  This is because the `pick` and `place` actions that I plan to execute require the robot base to be at a specific configuration. The base will need to move to base configuration `#o3`, as specified. This movement needs the initial position `v3` to move to the new position `#o3`.
           2.  **Pick up `v8` using the arm controlled by `v4`.**  This involves using the trajectory `#o4` and grasp `#o1`.
           3.  **Place `v8` at pose `#o2` on region `v18`.**  This step also uses trajectory `#o4` and grasp `#o1`.
           
           The plan hinges on moving `v8` from its current pose `v9` to the desired pose `#o2`. The preconditions for `pick` and `place` must be satisfied.  That means the arm `v4` must be empty, there must be a valid path/trajectory, the objects must satisfy the `kin` relationship for movement, and the robot base must be at the proper configuration `#o3`.
           
           *   **Move Base** needs `basemotion(v3, #o0, #o3)` and `atbconf(v3)`. The base `move_base` action changes the base configuration from `v3` to `#o3`.
           *   **Pick:** The arm can pick `v8` when the base is configured for movement. The arm has the kin relationship described for the pick action.
           *   **Place:** Likewise, the kin for placement needs to be true, and other properties must be checked.
           
           The assumption is that all `unsafe...` conditions are false (i.e., the *negated* versions are true). With these actions, the `on(v8, v18)` predicate becomes true, and the `type(v8, v17)` is true in the initial state, thereby meeting my objective.
