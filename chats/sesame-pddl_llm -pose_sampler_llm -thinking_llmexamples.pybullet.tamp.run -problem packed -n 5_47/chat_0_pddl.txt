(Thoughts: **Placements for Object ID 5 on Surface 0**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for an object (ID 5, dimensions roughly 0.0832 x 0.0832) on surface 0, which is a square with corners at (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Since this is a new object and there are no known obstacles, I can focus purely on finding placements that fit within the surface. The object is essentially a square, so I'm thinking I can just use a few different orientations.  I'm going to set `surf_idx = 0` for all placements.
           
           The object's dimensions are almost the same in both directions, meaning that the rotated bounding box changes very little as the rotation angle changes, and the difference can be neglected. I've found that the rotated bounding box's dimensions depend on `theta`: when it's `0` or `pi`, the object lies in its initial orientation. When rotated by `pi/2` or `3*pi/2`, the rotation is at right angles. I can maximize stability and fit within the surface bounds, so for the object I can use `theta = 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4`.
           
           So I've decided to generate a few different rotations. I'll use those orientations with the maximum distribution of points, and I can calculate `x_min(theta)`,`x_max(theta)`, `y_min(theta)`, and `y_max(theta)` from those orientations.
           
           For theta = 0 and pi/2, the valid x and y range is [-0.0934, 0.0934], giving me a 3x3 grid for each.
           The valid x and y range for the rotated object is roughly [-0.0762, 0.0762] for the other 2 orientations. I created a grid for those rotations for a 4x4 array of placements.
           
           This means I'll be able to get 9 placements each from the horizontal and vertical. From the rotations at `pi/4` and `3*pi/4`, I'll be able to create 16 placements for each of those. That'll get me the required 50 stable points. All values will be within the constraints of the surface and object dimensions. These are all the placements I need for now.

(Thoughts: **Alright, let's break this down.** The task at hand is to find 50 stable placements for object ID 4 on surface 0, while ensuring it *doesn't* collide with the previously placed object ID 5. I've got the dimensions of both objects, the surface dimensions, and the successful placement location of object 5. My strategy is to first calculate the valid placement region on the surface, accounting for object 5's presence, then to select 50 diverse placements within that region, making sure they're stable.
           
           First, I've got to consider all the rotations (0, pi/2, pi/4, 3pi/4) and calculate the rotated bounding box dimensions of object 4 for each. Then, I need to figure out the "forbidden" region on surface 0 — the area object 4's bounding box can't overlap with object 5's. This means I've got to calculate the safe bounds for object 4's center point, taking into account how its bounding box will grow for each of the rotations.
           
           To handle the collision avoidance, I'll calculate the inflated AABB of object 5 by adding half of object 4's dimensions. Then, I can create a grid and filter out any points that overlap this "inflated" area. This will give me a set of safe (x, y) coordinates for the center of object 4 for each rotation.
           
           So, for each rotation, I'll have a valid region on the surface. Within that region, I need to generate 50 placement points. For diversity, I'll divide the valid region into sub-regions, taking points that make sense based on the grid structure, being mindful that I have a total of 12 for theta=0, 12 for theta=pi/2, and 13 each for theta=pi/4, 3pi/4. This will give me the 50 distinct placements, where I also filter out to be away from the edge of the forbidden box. This final list of 50 (x, y, theta) coordinates will provide the stable, collision-free placements that I need.

(Thoughts: **Summary of My Strategy for Object Placement**
           
           Okay, so I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for this new, nearly square object (ID 6) on surface 0.  I need to do this while avoiding collisions with two existing objects: object 5 and object 4.  Here's my thought process, broken down:
           
           First, I need to define the problem. I have a known surface size, and I know where object 5 and object 4 are placed (along with their sizes, and bounding box extents).  My goal is to place object 6 within the surface, at various rotations, without any overlap.
           
           Next, I look at potential object 6's dimensions. Since object 6 is almost square, I'll consider a limited set of rotations: 0, pi/2 (90 degrees), pi/4 (45 degrees), and 3pi/4 (135 degrees). I need to determine the dimensions of a bounding box (AABB) of object 6 *for each rotation*. I will also adjust it as object 6 is near square.
           
           Then, I have to figure out the "forbidden zones" around the existing objects. I have to create an "inflated" bounding box for each object 4 and 5; to calculate the forbidden zones. I'll need to calculate how much to inflate them, based on the *rotated* dimensions of object 6.  My next step is to create a grid of points on the surface, and check for collisions.
           
           Now, it's time to build a strategy. I am going to create a simple check. To evaluate placement locations, I'm going to set up grids across the surface at each rotation angle. The size of the grid will be dependent on how much free space I expect. With grid points for the center, and the rotated object 6's AABB half-width and half-height (and current objects' extents), I can calculate: if any of the vertices of the AABB would hit objects. The code checks for AABB intersection. If not overlapping the forbidden zones, it is a valid placement.
           
           Let's test it. I calculated 12 valid points for each of rotations theta=0 and theta=pi/2 (with a 6x6 grid), plus 14 for theta=pi/4, and 14 for theta=3pi/4 (with a 7x7 grid) – this means I have a total of 52 valid placement points. This meets my target of 50. I have the solution.
