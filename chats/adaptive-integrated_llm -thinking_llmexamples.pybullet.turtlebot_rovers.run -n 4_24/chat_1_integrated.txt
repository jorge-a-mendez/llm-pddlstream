           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Comprehensive Plan to Achieve New Axiom**
           
           My task is to formulate a plan to satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, a complex logical conjunction involving several conditions related to image acquisition, analysis, and communication within a robotic scenario. I began by meticulously breaking down the `new-axiom@0()` definition. The core challenge lies in achieving the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           The first part requires the rovers, `v12` and `v14`, to obtain and send images (`receivedimage`) of four target objects (v17, v18, v19, v20) to the lander `v9` with mode `v11`.  My analysis revealed that I can leverage the existing knowledge and actions defined. The approach involves these steps:  (1) moving a rover to a suitable imaging configuration (`#o3`), (2) calibrating its camera, (3) taking images, (4) moving to a communication configuration (`#o0`), and finally (5) sending the images. The problem is complicated by the need to handle different coordinates for each image capture for configurations, since the prompt demands a distinct configuration per image.
           
           The second part of the plan focuses on fulfilling the `receivedanalysis` predicates. This entails analyzing a stone (of type `v2`) and a soil sample (of type `v6`). I planned to use rover `v14` to move to a rock sampling configuration, `sample_rock`. The process then proceeds to gather each necessary sample and transmit it to the lander. The requirement of a "free" storage means the storage space must be cleared at each stage.
           
           To meet the requirements, the detailed sequence includes the precise actions that must be taken.
           1. `v12` must move to a location to capture an image and then send it to the lander.  This procedure must be completed for *each* object.
           2. `v14` must move to the location of the rocks, sample them, then drop the sample, and return to comms.
           3. Upon all transmissions, both rovers must return to their initial configurations to be free.
           
           The challenge in generating a plan lies in efficiently managing the rovers' movements and accounting for constraints. The key constraint that the plan requires, according to the geometric constraints, will satisfy it.

           3. Upon all transmissions, both rovers must return to their initial configurations to be free.
           
           The challenge in generating a plan lies in efficiently managing the rovers' movements and accounting for constraints. The key constraint that the plan requires, according to the geometric constraints, will satisfy it.
           

User:      Configuration #o3 = (-2.0 1.0) for rover v12 at target v19 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (-0.5 1.0) for rover v12 at target v20 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Configuration #o0 = (-1.0 -2.0) for rover v14 at target v9 is not valid because the target is not visible from the rover's camera due to occlusion.
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, based on the previous feedback, I need to refine the plan for our rovers, particularly focusing on unreachable and occluded configurations. The goal is to ensure successful image acquisition and soil/rock analysis.
           
           Let's begin by re-evaluating the problem configurations.
           
           **Addressing Reachability & Occlusion:**
           
           1.  **Rover `v12` at `v19`:** The initial configuration `(-2.0, 1.0)` was deemed unreachable. I'll test new try `(-1.5, 1.5)` for `v19`. I've checked and it is closer and within image visible range.
           
           2.  **Rover `v12` at `v20`:** Similar reachability issue with `(-0.5, 1.0)`. I'll try `(0.0, 1.0)` for the new configuration, which is also image-visible and reachable.
           
           3.  **Communication & Occlusion:** Previous attempt `(-1.0, -2.0)` for both `v12` and `v14` (for communication with the lander) faced occlusion issues. The new coordinate `(-0.5, -0.5)` is closer, within the 4m range, and should provide an unobstructed line of sight. I will ensure that the coordinate change for the new communication config is reasonable.
           
           **Revised Operation Strategy:**
           
           1.  **Rover `v12` (Imaging):**
               *   Moves to imaging config for each of the four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`).
               *   Calibrates the camera.
               *   Takes an image.
               *   Moves to the communication config `(-0.5, -0.5)` to transmit images to the lander (`v9`).
           
           2.  **Rover `v14` (Sampling & Analysis):**
               *   Samples stone and then soil targets.
               *   Moves to communication config `(-0.5, -0.5)` to send soil and rock analyses to the lander.
           
           **Key refinements:**
           
           *   Rover `v14` will *drop* any sampled rock to ensure the store is free, before communicating the analyses. This also ensures goal state condition of `free(v14, v16)` is satisfied at the end.
           *   The overall goal of the rovers will be to return to their initial configurations after operations are complete.
           
           **Coordinate Updates:**
           
           Based on the revised strategy, I've re-calculated the continuous values for x and y of the rover positions.
           
           *   `v17`: `(0.4, 1.0)`.
           *   `v18`: `(2.0, 1.0)`.
           *   `v19`: `(-1.5, 1.5)`.
           *   `v20`: `(0.0, 1.0)`.
           *   `Communication config`: `(-0.5, -0.5)`.
           
           These updates are designed to avoid obstacles and meet the constraints of the motion plan. I am confident these revised plans will meet the analysis conditions.

           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

Model:     The previous plan had issues with reachability and collision for several configurations, primarily for rover `v12` when taking images and for both rovers when communicating with the lander `v9`. Let's re-evaluate the configuration choices based on the new collision information and reachability constraints.
           
           The goal remains `new-axiom@0()`, which means:
           1.  Rovers `v12` and `v14` must end at `v13` and `v15` respectively.
           2.  Sample stores `v16` for both rovers must be free.
           3.  Images of `v17, v18, v19, v20` must be received.
           4.  Analysis of one stone (`v2`) and one soil (`v6`) rock must be received.
           
           **Initial State Review:**
           *   `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           *   `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           *   Both `v12` and `v14` have `free(v16)`.
           *   Rover `v12` has camera `v10` (`onboard`, `supports` `v11`).
           *   Rover `v14` also has camera `v10` (`onboard`). This is a bit unusual for two rovers to share one camera object, but given the PDDL, it implies `v10` can be used by either.
           *   Lander is `v9` (at `(-2.405, -2.346)` to `(-1.395, -1.654)`).
           *   Objectives: `v17` ((0.403, 2.155)), `v18` ((2.167, 1.892)), `v19` ((-2.175, 1.831)), `v20` ((-0.566, 2.088)).
           *   Rocks: `v1, v3, v4` (type `v2` - stone), `v5, v7, v8` (type `v6` - soil).
               *   `v3` ((1.198, 0.947)) is a stone.
               *   `v5` ((-0.55, -1.242)) is a soil.
           
           **Collision Obstacles:**
           *   `v21`: AABB((lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))). This is a thin wall or post along the y-axis at x=0.
           *   `v22`: AABB((lower=(-0.524, -0.484), upper=(-0.411, -0.371))). This is a small obstacle around `(-0.45, -0.42)`.
           
           **Revised Configuration Strategy:**
           
           Let's use `v12` for all imaging and image sending, and `v14` for all sampling and analysis sending.
           
           **Rover `v12` (Imaging and Image Sending):**
           Initial position: `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           Maximum imaging range: 2m.
           
           *   **Target `v17` ((0.403, 2.155))**:
               *   Previous `#o3` (0.4, 1.0) was not reachable. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`. To reach `(0.4, 1.0)` is a long move.
               *   New `#o3` for `v17`: `(0.6, 0.5)`. Distance to `v17` is sqrt((0.403-0.6)^2 + (2.155-0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.0388 + 2.739) = 1.66m (within range).
           *   **Target `v18` ((2.167, 1.892))**:
               *   Previous `#o3` (2.0, 1.0) was not reachable. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   New `#o3` for `v18`: `(1.8, 1.0)`. Distance to `v18` is sqrt((2.167-1.8)^2 + (1.892-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.1346 + 0.7957) = 0.96m (within range).
           *   **Target `v19` ((-2.175, 1.831))**:
               *   Previous `#o3` (-1.5, 1.5) was not reachable. Rover `v12` is at `(1.0, -1.75)`.
               *   This target is far from `v12`. Let's try to get closer. New `#o3` for `v19`: `(-0.5, 0.5)`. This is quite a distance, but `v12` could reach it. Distance to `v19` is sqrt((-2.175 - (-0.5))^2 + (1.831 - 0.5)^2) = sqrt(2.805 + 1.771) = 2.13m. This is just slightly out of range for image, so this is not a good choice for `v12`.
               *   Let's check if `v14` (initial at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) can image `v19`. `v19` is at `(-2.175, 1.831)`. `v14` could move to `(-2.0, 1.0)`. Distance from `(-2.0, 1.0)` to `v19` is sqrt((-2.175 - (-2.0))^2 + (1.831-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0306 + 0.6939) = 0.85m (within range). So, `v14` will image `v19`.
           *   **Target `v20` ((-0.566, 2.088))**:
               *   Previous `#o3` (0.0, 1.0) was in collision with `v21` (x=0).
               *   New `#o3` for `v20` (for `v12`): `(0.2, 1.0)`. Distance to `v20` is sqrt((-0.566-0.2)^2 + (2.088-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.5867 + 1.1837) = 1.33m (within range). This avoids `v21`.
           
           **Rover `v14` (Imaging, Sampling and Analysis Sending):**
           Initial position: `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           Maximum imaging range: 2m. Maximum communication range: 4m.
           
           *   **Target `v19` ((-2.175, 1.831))**:
               *   New `#o3` for `v19` (for `v14`): `(-2.0, 1.0)`. Distance to `v19` is 0.85m (within range). `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`. Move to `(-2.0, 1.0)` is reachable.
           *   **Sample Rock `v3` ((1.198, 0.947), stone)**:
               *   `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) needs to be `above` `v3`. A configuration like `(1.0, 1.0)` would work.
           *   **Sample Rock `v5` ((-0.55, -1.242), soil)**:
               *   `v14` (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) needs to be `above` `v5`. A configuration like `(-0.5, -1.0)` would work.
           
           **Communication with `v9` (Lander at `(-1.9, -2.0)`):**
           Maximum communication range: 4m.
           *   Previous `#o0` (-0.5, -0.5) for both rovers was in collision with `v22`.
           *   New `#o0` for `v12` to `v9`: `(-0.7, -0.7)`. This avoids `v22`. Distance to `v9` is sqrt((-1.9 - (-0.7))^2 + (-2.0 - (-0.7))^2) = sqrt(1.44 + 1.69) = sqrt(3.13) = 1.77m (within range).
           *   New `#o0` for `v14` to `v9`: `(-0.7, -0.7)`. This avoids `v22`. Distance to `v9` is 1.77m (within range).
           
           **Revised Plan Logic:**
           
           1.  **`v12` images `v17, v18, v20` and sends them.**
               *   Move `v12` to `#o3_v17_v12`. Calibrate. Take image `v17`. Move `v12` to `#o0_v9_v12`. Send image `v17`.
               *   Move `v12` to `#o3_v18_v12`. Calibrate. Take image `v18`. Move `v12` to `#o0_v9_v12`. Send image `v18`.
               *   Move `v12` to `#o3_v20_v12`. Calibrate. Take image `v20`. Move `v12` to `#o0_v9_v12`. Send image `v20`.
           2.  **`v14` images `v19` and sends it.**
               *   Move `v14` to `#o3_v19_v14`. Calibrate. Take image `v19`. Move `v14` to `#o0_v9_v14`. Send image `v19`.
           3.  **`v14` samples `v3` (stone) and `v5` (soil), sends analyses.**
               *   Move `v14` to `#o5_v3_v14`. Sample `v3`. Drop `v3`.
               *   Move `v14` to `#o5_v5_v14`. Sample `v5`.
               *   Move `v14` to `#o0_v9_v14`. Send analysis `v3`. Send analysis `v5`. Drop `v5`.
           4.  **Rovers return to initial configurations.**
               *   Move `v12` to `v13`.
               *   Move `v14` to `v15`.
           
           Let's use specific continuous parameter names for clarity, e.g., `#o3_v12_v17` for `v12`'s configuration to image `v17`. The provided action list uses generic `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5` which implies these are parameterized by the specific context. I will use the generic ones in the plan and provide specific values for each use case.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating the Plan: Obstacles and Reachability**
           
           Okay, I need to get this straight. My initial assessments regarding rover positions and obstacle avoidance were off. The system is telling me that my proposed configurations either aren't reachable for the robot base or are in collision. I need to be much more careful about where I send these rovers, and specifically, I need to take the obstacle *v21* very seriously.
           
           Here's the situation:
           
           *   **Obstacle `v21`**: This is a long, thin wall or post along the y-axis, right at *x = 0*. Anything close to this line is in trouble. Any attempted traverse across this line will be in collision with this obstacle.
           *   **Obstacle `v22`**: A small block near the origin (-0.45, -0.42).
           
           **The key is *v21*.**  It's a divider. Rover *v12* starts on the positive X side, and *v14* starts on the negative X side. Any objective on the 'wrong' side of *v21* is inaccessible without some clever maneuvers and potentially, assuming the line of sight is above v21, which I have not been explicitly given.
           
           **Rover `v12`'s (at `(1.0, -1.75)`) Objectives:**
           
           *   **Imaging:** `v17` (0.403, 2.155), `v18` (2.167, 1.892), `v20` (-0.566, 2.088).
           *   **Sampling:** `v3` (1.198, 0.947).
           *   **Communication:**  *Lander* `v9` (-1.9, -2.0).  **Problem:** Lander and most objectives are on the wrong side.
           
           **Rover `v14`'s (at `(-1.0, -1.75)`) Objectives:**
           
           *   **Imaging:** `v19` (-2.175, 1.831).
           *   **Sampling:** `v5` (-0.55, -1.242).
           *   **Communication:** *Lander* `v9` (-1.9, -2.0).
           
           **The Major Issue: `v21` is a Barrier**
           
           Here's what I've figured out: `v21` at *x = 0* is a major barrier for both movement and line-of-sight. If a rover is on one side, it cannot image, communicate, or sample on the other side. My previous plans assumed I could send images and analysis across the wall with no consideration.
           
           Based on testing, `v14` cannot image `v17, v18`, and `v12` cannot sample `v5`. 
           
           **Revised Plan with Strict Division:**
           
           *   **v12's Tasks**: Image `v17`, `v18`; Sample and analyze `v3`. It cannot communicate with v9 and thus cannot deliver.
           *   **v14's Tasks**: Image `v19`, `v20`; Sample `v5`, and Send ALL data to the lander. It cannot image objectives in the other space.
           
           **Problem: *This won't work***
           
           **The core problem is *communication*.** The lander `v9` is on the negative X side (the side *v14* is on). *v12* can't communicate with the lander because it cannot cross the barrier at *x = 0*  (*v21*).
           *   **Communication can be performed only by v14:** However, v14 *cannot get* the images from v12 as it will collide.
           
           The system predicates such as `haveimage` link the images to the rover that *took* them, and only that rover can transmit them: and given the block, that is not possible.
           
           **Conclusion: The goal is not achievable.** I cannot create a plan that successfully satisfies all the conditions due to the limitations imposed by the wall-like obstacle *v21*. I will need to provide that the goal is not achievable and provide the supporting reasoning.
