           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Detailed Plan to Achieve new-axiom@0()**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core of my current thinking is centered around crafting a plan to satisfy the requirements of `new-axiom@0()`. This means ensuring I can, in my role as the rover, receive and analyze the images of the four objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v20`) and the analyses from all six rock samples (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`). The initial state is straightforward, but the available actions are critically limited.
           
           My initial challenge lies in the nature of the *available* actions: a move to the same position for both rovers and a drop_rock that only works after a sample. Given this, I have interpreted "valid actions" to provide a filtering constraint after instantiating object references. I'm assuming that I will have the freedom to craft a plan using, potentially, a standard set of action types.
           
           **Step 1: Imaging (Rover `v12`)**
           
           I've decided to split the work between the two rovers. Rover `v12` is tasked with the image gathering and communication. Since my instructions say I must specify continuous values for certain object references, I am making the following assumptions: the continuous solver can find a way to place the rover into these "impossible" positions, and that the continuous solver is able to find a way to make multiple targets be in the range of the camera.
           
           So, for images, `v12` has to:
           
           1.  **Move to `#o3`:**. `v12` starts at `v13`. It has to go to `#o3`. I'm assigning unique, named locations for my continuous configurations, `#o3_v12_v17`, `#o3_v12_v18`, `#o3_v12_v19`, and `#o3_v12_v20` to satisfy the "different value per rover-target pair" rule.
           2.  **Calibrate and Take Images:** At each `#o3`, I'll need to calibrate (if needed) and then take an image of a target.
           3.  **Move to `#o0`:** Then I'll move to the communication configuration.
           4.  **Send Images:** Lastly, I'll send all images.
           5.  **Return**: And finally, the move back to `v13`
           
           **Step 2: Analysis (Rover `v14`)**
           
           Rover `v14` will handle the sampling and analysis. My working plan is:
           
           1.  **Move to `#o5`:** Rover `v14` will start at `v15` and needs to visit a configuration `(#o5)`. Again, each rock has its own named config, `#o5_v14_v1`, `#o5_v14_v3`, etc.
           2.  **Sample and Drop:** At each `#o5`, I'll sample, then drop the sample (if it is not the last one)
           3.  **Move to `#o0`:** Then move to the communications config.
           4.  **Send analysis:** Then send the analyses.
           5.  **Return**: And lastly, move the rover back to `v15`.
           
           **Addressing the Contradictions**
           
           The geometry is the crux of the problem. If I can't find appropriate continuous values for these configurations, the problem is not solvable. It seems highly improbable for v12 and v14, as currently positioned, to be in positions such that all listed goals can be satisfied. For `v12` and all 4 objectives, it is impossible for them to all be in view given the current location. So, for the geometry to work, the configurations must be carefully chosen.
           
           I'm interpreting the "different value per pair" phrasing to mean that *each* target, either rock or goal, requires its own unique position. The final plan relies upon this interpretation.
           
           The available continuous objects/configurations and the plan for each rover are clearly identified above.
           
           I remain mindful of the initial predicates. At the end, both rovers need to be back where they started. The plan incorporates these moves, which means `v12` is sent back to position `v13` and `v14` is sent back to position `v15`.

(Thoughts: **Plan Derivation for a Trivial Goal**
           
           My initial assessment indicates that the provided goal, `new-axiom@0()`, is already satisfied within the initial state, as defined by the problem axioms.  All atoms constituting the goal are explicitly or implicitly true, specifically in the initial state of the problem. This means no actions are strictly *required* to achieve the goal, as it is already achieved.
           
           The allowed actions are extremely limited, primarily consisting of no-op `move` actions for two rovers and `drop_rock` actions with a precondition I can't satisfy initially. These no-op moves would not change the state of the system away from the goal. The other actions require a rock store to be full, which cannot be accomplished with any of the valid actions.
           
           Given these constraints, an empty plan (doing nothing) would technically satisfy the goal. However, to demonstrate understanding of the problem and adherence to instructions, I will generate a plan comprising the no-op moves. These actions are valid because their preconditions are satisfied within the initial state, and they do not violate the goal. I must also consider the "continuous value for the configuration" prompt requirement. However, in this case, the `move` actions use state arguments, not named configurations starting with '#', so I am not obligated to provide continuous values, as the prompt rule is not triggered.
           
           The no-op move actions are appropriate because they do not change the existing state in any way, keeping all goals true.
           
           My final plan will consist of these actions:
           *   (move v12 v13 #o2 v13)
           *   (move v14 v15 #o2 v15)
           
)

User:      The plan you provided is not valid because: `Fact is not satisfied: Atom new-axiom@0()`. This is not a result of a geometric failure, but rather a failure to achieve some action's preconditions in your action sequence. Recall that the action preconditions and the goal *must* be satisfied.
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state ensuring that action preconditions are satisfied and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Rethinking the Goal and Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I messed up. My initial assumption that the axiom `new-axiom@0()` was *already* satisfied was dead wrong.  The system is interpreting that axiom as a *goal* that needs to be achieved.  Therefore, the problem isn't just about figuring out a plan; it's about making sure the plan *leads* to that conjunction becoming true.
           
           This means I need to make sure all the `atconf`, `free`, `receivedimage`, and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the axiom are true.  I checked the initial state, and it’s only the `atconf` and `free` predicates that are true initially. The rest are false. So I need to achieve those image and analysis predicates.
           
           Now, I re-examined the error message. It's not just a matter of parameterization. It’s saying *any* action *not* in the list of valid action instances is considered invalid.  That's a severe constraint I completely missed the first time around.
           
           The provided list is painfully restrictive. I’m limited to rovers doing a few useless moves, and dropping rocks (which I can't sample). There is no calibration, taking or sending images, or sampling and sending analysis. There's no way to reach the elements of the goal. The actions *needed* to get those images and analyses are simply *not* available. The actions needed to do what the goal requires.
           
           So, the conclusion is clear. With the provided set of valid action instances, the goal is *unachievable*. I'm absolutely certain of this now. The problem explicitly states that only actions in the provided list can be used, and those actions are insufficient to satisfy the conditions of the `new-axiom@0()` goal. I misinterpreted the meaning of the actions, and the goal expression. I'm sure I won't do it again.
