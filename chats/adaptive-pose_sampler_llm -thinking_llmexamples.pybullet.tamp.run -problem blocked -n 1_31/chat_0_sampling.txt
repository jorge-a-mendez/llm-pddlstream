           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

(Thoughts: **My plan for placing the object is comprehensive, considering various factors and constraints. The primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for the object on a specific surface, adhering to the given conditions.**
           
           First, I identified the object's dimensions (0.07 x 0.07) and the surface's boundaries. Since the object is square-like, I understood that its orientation (theta) will impact the effective area it occupies on the surface. While the AABB dimensions of a square don't change by rotations like 90 degrees or 180 degrees, the internal structure might have more information than the bounding box. The given dimensions are for an AABB. However, I consider different theta values to maximize the coverage.
           
           My approach involves determining the valid placement area based on the surface's dimensions and the object's effective dimensions at different orientations. I calculated the valid ranges for x and y coordinates, ensuring the object remains entirely within the surface. I also computed the bounding box of the rotated object and found its new bounding box given by `rotated_w = rotated_h = 0.07 * (abs(cos(theta)) + abs(sin(theta)))`. I will then ensure those dimensions fit on the surface and consider this during placement.
           
           To generate diverse placements, I planned to vary the object's orientation and position. I decided to consider 5 different angle values, focusing on rotations such as 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, and pi/2. I have calculated the effective dimension for all of them. Then, I have set up grids of points for these. Finally, I will systematically generate the placement by a simple rule, i.e., `(surf_idx, theta, x, y)`. I am using a mix of horizontal and vertical generation, which will keep them organized.
           
           The result is a set of 50 distinct placements, covering the available surface area with a variety of orientations. The plan looks to be complete, and all values will be in float format.

(Thoughts: **Collision-Free Object Placement Strategy**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new object (ID 10) that needs a home on surface 0, and it's got to play nice with Object 5, which is already in place. Object 5 is at a known location, and its AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) is defined by the coordinates `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.27, -0.53)`. The surface is defined as `(4.2, -0.6)` to `(4.8, 0.0)`. My task is to find 50 stable and collision-free placements for Object 10.
           
           First things first, I need to account for Object 5's presence. I know Object 10's dimensions (approximately 0.07485 x 0.07485), and I need to calculate its AABB based on different rotation angles (`theta`). I will choose rotation angles to be `0, pi/8, pi/4, 3*pi/8, pi/2`. With rotation, the object's effective dimension will vary and can be easily calculated. This effective dimension represents the largest extent in any direction when the object is rotated.
           
           I'm using a strategy to find safe positions. I will avoid placing the object too close to the surface's bottom left corner, where Object 5 is located. I'll split the valid area into two.
           
           For each angle, I calculate the `effective_dim`, then identify the valid ranges for the object's center coordinates within the surface bounds, whilst avoiding collision.
           
           *   **For the y-axis:** To guarantee no overlap with Object 5, I set a lower bound for y-coordinates. I can calculate the *y* value of the object's AABB which just touches the top side of the object 5 AABB. This will yield a range on which I safely generate y values.
           *   **For the x-axis:** I simply use `linspace` across a given range.
           
           So, for each angle I'll have a set of generated coordinates.
           Finally, I generate a grid, and try placing points that fit within. The coordinates would be set at `5 * 2 = 10` points for each of the five angles.
           By picking ranges and iterating, I should be able to ensure I have 50 good placements.
           I'm confident I can output an array of valid positions, each with its corresponding angle, and make the client happy!
