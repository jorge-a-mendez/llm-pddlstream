           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Strategic Placement on v20**
           
           My objective is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) onto the surface v20, a task that I can approach using a series of pick-and-place actions. The "on" predicate is fundamental here, requiring both the "atpose" and "supported" predicates to be true. All objects are currently supported on #o2. To achieve this, I must pick each object from its current location and place it on v20. The key lies in finding collision-free stable placement poses for the objects on the surface.
           
           Initially, I will establish the desired final poses for each object on v20:
           -  I'll position the objects using coordinates that place them within the bounds of v20 to meet the stability constraint. Given that each object has an approximate width of 0.1, the objects can be placed in a grid.
           I intend to use five distinct poses for the "#o2" parameter corresponding to the five objects. The `z` value will be 0.781 for all to maintain the objects at their current "top" surface height.
           
           The robot has two arms but will use the hand v4 in this case. The base remains fixed.
           
           The plan will include:
           1. `pick` (v4, object, current_pose, #o1, v3, #o4)
           2. `place` (v4, object, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)
           
           The process will involve the following sequence, repeated for each object:
           *   Pick the object (arm v4), ensuring the robot base is configured at its initial configuration.
           *   Place the object (arm v4) on v20 at the specific coordinate defined earlier.
           
           The preconditions and effects of these actions will be met given the initial state. Collision-free movements are assumed. All `unsafe` predicates are initially false.
           
           With this plan, I should be able to satisfy the `on` predicates and achieve the desired outcome. The total cost, which is 10, is from pick and place actions, and base actions which are assumed zero as the robot is not moving its base.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v16 v17 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v16 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4) , (pick v4 v18 v19 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v18 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Okay, so I've looked at the constraints. The user is right, all my `pick` and `place` actions are invalid. The only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. Now, the objective is to get these five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto v20. That screams "pick and place" to me. It's a fundamental manipulation task.
           
           But here's the kicker:  `move_base`?  All it does is shift the robot's base configuration. It doesn't affect anything relevant to the objects!  No changes to `atpose`, `atgrasp`, `holding`, or `on` – nothing! It only impacts where the base of the robot is located using `atbconf` and the robot's ability to move using `canmove()`.
           
           And that's the problem.  I need to *change* the state of the objects. I need to get them *onto* the surface. But without any *actual* object manipulation actions – pick, place, grasp, ungrasp – this is a non-starter.  The robot is simply incapable of achieving the goal given the provided action set. The goal is, quite simply, *unachievable* with this action set.
