           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.161, 0.272), (0.248, 0.359)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.13, -0.334), (-0.033, -0.237)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.077, -0.251, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.993, -0.115).

           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.237, 0.533, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.999, 0.05).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.204, 0.316, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.99, -0.143).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (-0.081, -0.286, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.957, 0.291).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.149, -0.431, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.982, 0.189).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.034, -0.293), (0.119, -0.209)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.198, 0.495), (0.275, 0.572)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning on Goal Unreachability**
           
           I'm faced with a challenge: move several objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18) from their current surface (v11) to a new surface (v20). My goal is to achieve 'on(object, v20)' for each of these objects. I know that the 'on' predicate depends on two other predicates: 'atpose' and 'supported'. The objects are currently in a state where they are 'on' v11, represented by 'atpose(object, initial_pose)' and 'supported(object, initial_pose, v11)'.
           
           The key here is that to change the surface an object is 'on', I must change its 'atpose' value. The obvious way to do this is with a 'pick' and 'place' action. However, there's a problem: the only allowed action instance I'm given is a 'move_base' action that does nothing (moves from v3 to v3). The problem description explicitly states that only actions in this allowed list can be used. There are no 'pick' or 'place' actions in this list.
           
           Since the 'pick' and 'place' actions aren't allowed, I can't change the 'atpose' of the objects.  Therefore, I cannot change the "on" relation of the objects to point to v20, making this goal impossible.
