           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom graspable(v15)

           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)

           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom graspable(v12)

           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Inability to Achieve Goal Due to Action Instance Limitations**
           
           My initial analysis focused on identifying a sequence of actions that would satisfy the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object, `?green`, that is of type `v17` and is on `v18`. I quickly determined that `v8` or `v12` would satisfy the type requirement. The difficulty lies in making either object `on v18`.
           
           I considered the necessary conditions based on the axioms: I need to satisfy `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.  Examining the initial state, I confirmed that `v8` is currently `on v11` and `v12` is currently `on v14`.  To place either object on `v18`, I would need to use `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           However, the crucial limitation arises from the available action instances.  The only allowed action instance is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action, while valid, only changes the robot's base configuration and its `canmove()` status.  It does *not* provide any means to manipulate objects or modify their position relative to `v18`.
           
           Because the goal requires changing the `on` predicate (which mandates object manipulation through `pick` and `place`), and the only provided action instance is incapable of doing so, I must conclude that the goal is currently unachievable with the given constraints.
