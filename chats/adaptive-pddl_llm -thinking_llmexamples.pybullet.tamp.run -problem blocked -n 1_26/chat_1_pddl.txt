           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning through the Problem**
           
           Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process in tackling this PDDL planning problem. My initial task is to find a plan, or at least determine if one exists, to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal boils down to having an object of a specific type (v17) "on" another object (v18).
           
           First, I examined the initial state and the goal. I noticed that the objects v8 and v12 both have the necessary type (v17), and they are also stackable on v18. Therefore, the plan hinges on getting either v8 or v12 "on" v18. The "on" predicate is defined in terms of "supported" and "atpose."
           
           I meticulously checked the current "on" facts in the initial state.  v8 is on v11 and v12 is on v14. The problem here is that they are not on v18. To satisfy the goal, either v8 or v12 needs to be at the pose where it would be supported by v18.
           
           Then I focused on the only available action, `move_base`. Analyzing its preconditions and effects, it only manipulates the `atbconf` and `canmove` predicates, and adds to total-cost.  Critically, it *doesn't* directly affect `atpose` or `on`. This is a red flag.
           
           The "pick" and "place" actions are the only actions that modify the `atpose` and therefore `on` predicates.  However, they are not allowed.  Since `move_base` cannot change the poses of any object, it's impossible to satisfy the goal using only the given `move_base` instance.
           
           Therefore, since the only action instance doesn't affect the predicates related to the goal, I conclude that the goal is *unachievable* given these constraints. I will not return a plan.
