           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Immovable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with the goal of satisfying the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to placing an object of a specific type (v17) "on" another object (v18).  My initial thought is to identify objects of the correct type in the initial state.  I see two possibilities: v12 and v8, both of type v17.
           
           To get an object "on" v18, I need to satisfy the preconditions for the `on` axiom: `supported(?green, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(?green, ?p)`.  I check the current state for v12 and v8.  I see that v12 is currently on v14, and v8 is on v11.  The path forward seems clear: I'll need to move either v12 or v8 onto v18.
           
           Here's where things get problematic. To move an object, I typically use `pick` and `place` actions. However, when I examine the available actions, I only see `move_base v3 v3 #o0`.  This is a serious constraint.  The absence of `pick` and `place` means I can't directly manipulate any object's `atpose` facts. Consequently, I can't move v12 or v8.
           
           Therefore, since the only available action is moving the base, and there are no actions to move any object, I'm stuck. My detailed analysis reveals that the goal `new-axiom@0()` is unreachable with the given actions.  I've exhausted all possibilities and confirmed that no combination of available actions can satisfy the goal's requirements given the initial state.  The current configuration is a dead-end as there are no available actions to pick or place objects.
