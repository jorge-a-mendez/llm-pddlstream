           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my analysis of the problem:**
           
           I'm tasked with devising a plan to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. This goal hinges on making sure both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true for some object,  `?green`. I've looked at the initial state and noticed two candidate objects that fit the `type` criteria:  `v12` and `v8`.
           
           The real sticking point is ensuring the `on(?green, v18)` part.  `on` is true if an object is *both* at a specific pose and is supported at the location specified in that pose. I've checked both `v12` and `v8`.
           
           *   `v12`: It's initially at pose `v13` and supported by `v14` (so, it's `on(v12, v14)`).  I've also seen it supported at pose `#o2` with `v18`.
           *   `v8`: Same situation, it's at pose `v9` supported by `v11` so, it's `on(v8, v11)`. I've seen it supported at pose `#o2` with `v18`.
           
           My thinking is, if I could move either `v12` or `v8` to `#o2`, I'd be golden because they're already supported there. That's how I could ensure they're on `v18`.
           
           However, here's the catch: the only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This move doesn't allow me to pick and place to change object's support and pose. Because it only allows for the robot's base movement.
           
           I'm starting to realize that the `new-axiom@0()` is a rule for deriving facts, not a goal for this problem. Given I have the axiom `new-axiom@0()`, all I need is to infer the truth of the expression.
           
           But `v12` and `v8` aren't *currently* `on v18`. I need to change the facts about the objects. Unfortunately, the only action won't allow me to make `on(?green, v18)` true. 
           
           So, I conclude that it's impossible. Because none of the object has the pose of `v18`, and no action can modify that. In other words,  the goal `new-axiom@0()` can't be reached with the available action.
