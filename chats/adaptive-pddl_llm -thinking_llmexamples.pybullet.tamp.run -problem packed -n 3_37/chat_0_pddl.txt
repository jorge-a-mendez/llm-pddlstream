           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Conjunction
               Atom on(v8, v16)
               Atom on(v12, v16)
               Atom on(v14, v16)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching the Unreachable: A Dead End**
           
           Okay, so I've got a problem. The goal is clear: I need to get `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` *on* `v16`.  Currently, they're all sitting pretty on `v11`.  My initial thought is to break this down.  For any object *o* on *r*, I need two things: the robot needs to *place* the object, meaning I need `atpose(?o, ?p)` and that the support relationship `supported(?o, ?p, ?r)` to be true.
           
           Now, my initial intuition is to use the `place` action.  However, let's step back and consider what actions are actually available. The only allowed action instance I have to work with is `move_base`. That's a huge problem. It does exactly what it sounds like – *moves the base*.  No object interaction whatsoever.
           
           The conditions for *placing* are pretty strict, but they're irrelevant here, because even to *place* something I'd need to *pick* it up first.  And both *pick* and *place* require that kinematic trajectory exist. Not available to me.
           
           I can confirm that I have supported poses for all three objects on v16: `supported(v8, #o2, v16)`, `supported(v12, #o2, v16)`, and `supported(v14, #o2, v16)`.  The key here is that `#o2` is a continuous parameter, which means poses exist! But I can't *get* them there.
           
           Given the constraints, `move_base` is my *only* tool, and it simply cannot manipulate objects. Therefore, achieving the desired *on* relationship for `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` with `v16` is impossible. This goal is unreachable given the current action instances.
