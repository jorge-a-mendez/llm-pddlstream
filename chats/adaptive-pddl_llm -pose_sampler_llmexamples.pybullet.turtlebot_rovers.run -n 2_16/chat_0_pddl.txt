           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The scene describes two rovers, v12 and v14, each with a camera v10 and a store v16. Both rovers are at known configurations (v13 for v12, v15 for v14). There are several rocks (v1, v3, v4, v5, v7, v8) of different types (v2, v6). There are also two objectives (v17, v18) and a lander v9. The camera v10 supports mode v11. Both rovers can see the lander v9 for communication and can see both objectives v17 and v18 for imaging. Both rovers are above multiple rocks, indicating they can sample them.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` can be achieved by satisfying its conditions. The axiom states that:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)` is true. (already true)
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)` is true. (already true)
           3. `free(v12, v16)` is true. (already true)
           4. `free(v14, v16)` is true. (already true)
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)` is true. (not true, needs to be achieved)
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)` is true. (not true, needs to be achieved)
           7. `type(?stone, v2)` is true. (implied by type(v4, v2), type(v3, v2), type(v1, v2))
           8. `receivedanalysis(?stone)` is true. (not true, needs to be achieved for a rock of type v2)
           9. `type(?soil, v6)` is true. (implied by type(v7, v6), type(v5, v6), type(v8, v6))
           10. `receivedanalysis(?soil)` is true. (not true, needs to be achieved for a rock of type v6)
           
           Since `move` actions don't change the conditions for imaging, analyzing or sending, they will not contribute to achieving the goal, and in this case, the provided `move` actions also lead to the same configuration, making them irrelevant. The `drop_rock` actions also do not contribute to the goal, as both stores are already free. The crucial part of the goal is to receive images for objectives v17 and v18 in mode v11, and to receive analysis for rocks of type v2 (stone) and type v6 (soil).
           
           To achieve `receivedimage(v17, v11)` and `receivedimage(v18, v11)`:
           - The rovers need to `calibrate` their camera for a given objective.
           - Then `take_image` of the objective in the specified mode.
           - Then `send_image` of the objective in the specified mode to the lander.
           
           To achieve `receivedanalysis(?r)` for a rock of type v2 and a rock of type v6:
           - A rover needs to be `above` the rock.
           - The rover needs to `sample_rock` to analyze it. This also fills a store.
           - Then `send_analysis` of the analyzed rock to the lander. Since we need to analyze rocks of different types, we will need to sample at least two different rocks (one of type v2 and one of type v6). Since the stores are free, we can sample. Since the rovers have two stores, they can hold two samples.
           
           Let's break down the required steps:
           
           1.  **Image v17 and send it:**
               *   Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 (or v14) for objective v17.
               *   Take image of v17 with v10 in mode v11.
               *   Send image of v17 in mode v11.
           2.  **Image v18 and send it:**
               *   Calibrate camera v10 on rover v12 (or v14) for objective v18. (if not already calibrated, but calibration for one objective doesn't necessarily mean it is calibrated for another unless blocked). Let's assume re-calibration might be needed or calibration for one objective works for another. From the PDDL, `calibrated(?c, ?v)` means the camera is calibrated for the rover, not for a specific objective. So, calibrating for v17 should suffice for v18.
               *   Take image of v18 with v10 in mode v11.
               *   Send image of v18 in mode v11.
           3.  **Analyze a type v2 rock (e.g., v1) and send analysis:**
               *   Sample rock v1 with rover v12 (or v14).
               *   Send analysis of v1.
           4.  **Analyze a type v6 rock (e.g., v7) and send analysis:**
               *   Sample rock v7 with rover v12 (or v14).
               *   Send analysis of v7.
           
           Both rovers (v12 and v14) are capable of performing all these actions as per the initial state and available action instances (the continuous parameters are implicitly handled). We will use rover v12 for all operations.
           
           --Plan--:
           (calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10)

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(calibrate v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v17 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v17 v11), (take_image v12 #o3 #o4 v18 v10 v11), (send_image v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v18 v11), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v1 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v1), (sample_rock v12 #o5 v7 v16), (send_analysis v12 #o0 #o1 v9 v7)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The provided list of valid actions only includes `move` actions that do not change the rover's configuration and `drop_rock` actions.
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires:
           - `receivedimage(v17, v11)`
           - `receivedimage(v18, v11)`
           - `receivedanalysis(?stone)` (for a rock of type v2)
           - `receivedanalysis(?soil)` (for a rock of type v6)
           
           None of the available actions (`move` or `drop_rock`) can achieve these conditions. The `move` actions simply move the rover from a configuration to the same configuration, effectively doing nothing. The `drop_rock` actions change `full(v, s)` to `free(v, s)`, but both rovers already have `free(v, s)` for their stores, so these actions also don't change the state in a way that helps achieve the goal.
           
           The actions needed to achieve the goal (e.g., `calibrate`, `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, `send_analysis`) are not present in the allowed list of actions. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given set of valid actions.
