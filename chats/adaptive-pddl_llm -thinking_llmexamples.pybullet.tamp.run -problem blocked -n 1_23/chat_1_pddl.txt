           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis: Goal Unreachable**
           
           Okay, here's how I'm thinking through this problem:  My primary objective is to satisfy the `new-axiom@0()` goal, which translates to having an object `?green` that is both "on" `v18` and of `type v17`.  I'm an expert, so I understand this immediately means I need to manipulate the state.
           
           First, I examined the available objects with the right type. I found two contenders: `v8` and `v12`, both with `type(v17)`. I then check the initial states of these objects.
           
           To be "on" something (like `v18`), the object must be supported by that thing and be at that pose. The facts show that `v8` is `on(v8,v11)` and `v12` is `on(v12,v14)` currently, but neither object is initially on `v18`.  They *could* be on `v18` because the state includes facts that describe support: both are `supported(v8 or v12, #o2, v18)`.
           
           My next step is to examine the provided actions.  However, here's where I run into a roadblock. The only allowed action is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`. This action *only* moves the robot's base. It has no effect on object poses; it simply moves the base from its current position to the same position, so there's really no change.
           
           To get `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`, I need to use `pick` and `place` actions which are *crucial* actions that change the object pose, and which aren't in this list.
           
           Thus, I conclude that with the *given* set of available actions, it's *impossible* to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`. There is no way to manipulate object poses, and because no other objects initially satisfy the `on` and `type` criteria, the goal state cannot be reached.
