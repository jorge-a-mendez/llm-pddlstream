           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Plan Infeasibility Analysis**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having object `v12` on object `v18`. Crucially, `v12`'s type is already `v17`, which simplifies the problem to just getting `v12` onto `v18`.
           
           Examining the initial state, I see that `v12` is currently supported by `v14` at pose `v13`. To get `v12` onto `v18`, I need to satisfy the `on(v12, v18)` predicate. This requires `supported(v12, ?p, v18)` and `atpose(v12, ?p)`.  Essentially, I need to pick up `v12` and then place it onto `v18`.
           
           The initial plan would be to: 1) Pick `v12` from its current pose (`v13`). 2) Move the robot base as needed to allow placing `v12` on `v18`. 3) Place `v12` onto `v18` at the appropriate pose (`#o2`).
           
           However, the critical constraint is the list of *allowed* action instances. The only action instance provided is `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`, which is essentially a no-op base move. No `pick` or `place` instances are available.
           
           Now, here's the problem. To achieve the goal, I *must* perform a `pick` and a `place` action (or some variation that achieves the same effect), but I am strictly limited to *only* using the `move_base` no-op action.
           
           The system's design *requires* that I pick and place object v12, but has made that operation impossible. This implies that the goal is *unachievable* within the provided action constraints. I must conclude the goal is infeasible to reach.
