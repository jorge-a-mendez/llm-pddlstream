(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for a Square Object on a Square Surface**
           
           I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a square object (ID 5) on a square surface (surface 0). The surface is defined by its corners, and I know the object's size and that it is a square.  Because the object is square, any rotation is just a change in the bounding box orientation. Since the problem asks for `theta`, and usually the axis aligned bounding box size is specified for `theta=0`, I need to use the full range of `theta` values.
           
           First, I define the safe area on the surface where the object's center can be located, accounting for the object's half-width. This safe area is also a square, but smaller than the surface, reflecting the minimum bounding rectangle dimensions at zero rotation.  I calculate the safe range of x and y coordinates for the object's center considering the largest rotated bounding box, which corresponds to `theta=pi/4` (45 degrees), for maximum size when rotated, which is `s * sqrt(2)`.
           
           I'm interpreting the AABB dimensions given to be the dimensions at theta = 0, so that I need to calculate the bounding rectangle dimensions for other rotations. This means that I must use the formula for calculating the AABB of a rotated rectangle.  I need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rotated AABB is largest (when the square is at a 45-degree angle). Then, I need to compute the `x` and `y` center coordinates. I understand that the rotated AABB size will change with the rotation, and I want to vary the rotation to generate different possible bounding box sizes.  I select 5 angles to create a grid of stable positions. I select the `theta` values: `0`, `pi/8`, `pi/4`, `3pi/8`, and `pi/2`.
           
           For each `theta`, I calculate the x and y coordinate range of valid centers, accounting for the rotation. I then generate a 3x3 grid of placements within this safe area, leading to 9 points for each `theta`. This will make 45 total placements.
           
           To reach the required 50 placements, I add 5 more unique `theta` values to ensure sufficient diversity.  These angles are centered at (0, 0).
           The additional rotations will be `pi/16`, `3pi/16`, `5pi/16`, `7pi/16`, and `pi/3`.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Object Placement Strategy for ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We have a new object, ID 4, and my task is to find 50 stable placements for it on a surface, avoiding collision with the previously placed object, ID 5. I already know that object 5 has a stable position at (0, 0.0, -0.08759381247945251, -0.08759381247945251). Now, the dimensions of object 4 are `size_x = 0.0725` and `size_y = 0.0725`, practically a square. It must be placed on surface 0: `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`.
           
           Since the previous placement of ID 5 was successful, my top priority is to ensure object 4 doesn't collide with it. I'll need to define the region occupied by ID 5. Object 5 has dimensions `0.0948` and is placed at `(-0.0875, -0.0875)`.  Given that the surface is flat and the object is square, this will be easy.  I calculate object 5's AABB which is effectively a bounding box: `[-0.135, -0.0401] x [-0.135, -0.0401]`.
           
           The key here is to find a set of 50 stable placements. I will start by using a grid search of placements, at 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2 radians.  However, this involves checking the AABB collision.  My approach is to place the object and check for overlap in a rigorous way.
           
           To generate the non-colliding placements for ID 4, I'm defining a set of candidate placements based on a grid search.  In the calculation, to ensure the new object doesn't intersect with the existing object, it must not exist in a rectangle.  This checks if the the candidate object intersects with the area that the other object is in.
           
           I will then use a loop to search those positions at the different rotations and store those positions that do not have an overlap.
           
           So, for all angles, this will produce 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) that's about 0.095 units on each side.  It's gotta go on surface 0, and obviously, I have to avoid collisions with the objects already there: object 5, which is at (-0.087593, -0.087593), and object 4, which is at (-0.09874, 0.0).  
           
           The surface itself is a square that goes from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135). I'm planning to use the same logic as before. First I check a number of different rotation angles to decide a set of rotations to attempt. Next for each selected rotation, I'll calculate the smallest AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) that encapsulates object 6 for that particular rotation. Then I'll generate a grid of potential center points for the object.
           
           I need to make sure the object's center point won't take it off the surface - it needs to be inside the boundary. To make sure the object is stable I need to check for collision with the existing objects 4 and 5.
           
           Object 5 is at (-0.087593, -0.087593), is about 0.0948 units on each side, so it has an AABB that goes from [-0.135, -0.04018] in X and Y.
           Object 4 is at (-0.09874, 0.0), with about 0.0725 units on each side, with an AABB from [-0.135, -0.0624] in x, and [-0.0362, 0.0362] in y.
           
           The new object's AABB is easy to compute for a specific center (x, y).
           
           I need to use my previous collision check logic: if the new object's AABB overlaps either Obj5's range or Obj4's range, then there's a collision and that's no good.
           
           I'm thinking I'll try several rotation angles, like 0, pi/8, pi/4, 3pi/8, and pi/2. I'll need to compute an AABB. For theta = 0, the maximum coordinate for the center will be 0.08753. Then I would generate a grid of points, where I check each one. If I get enough candidates, I will move on to the next theta value, and then so on.
           
           Let's test all these placements and determine if a placement is stable. I'll use a `num_steps = 5` for my initial grid. After that, if I have not found 50, then I'll use `num_steps_finer = 7` to generate a denser grid.
