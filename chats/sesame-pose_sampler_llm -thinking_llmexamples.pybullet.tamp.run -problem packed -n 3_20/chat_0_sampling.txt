(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object 6 on Surface 0**
           
           My objective is to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 6, a square with side length 0.0981077, on surface 0, a square bounded by (-0.135, -0.135) and (0.135, 0.135).  Stability and containment are the key constraints. Given the shape and surface geometry, I'll leverage a sampling approach to generate a diverse set of placements. The object's AABB half-width/height depends on its rotation, `theta`.
           
           First, I calculate the AABB's effective half-width/height, considering the rotation.  Since it's a square, the half-width and half-height will be the same and is given by 0.5 * `object_side_length` * ( |cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)| ). For theta=0, pi, we have AABB half-width/height equal to 0.5 * `object_side_length = 0.04905385`. For theta = pi/4, 3pi/4, etc we have AABB half-width/height equal to 0.069367. For theta = pi/8, 3pi/8 etc we have AABB half-width/height equal to 0.06408.
           
           Then I determine the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) on the surface, ensuring the AABB remains entirely within the surface bounds.  The usable surface area is restricted by the rotating bounding box, given by the effective half-width/height.
           
           I chose these different thetas, I will try to space out the samples to cover a diverse area of the space.
           
           For `theta = 0`, I sample `x` and `y` coordinates from the valid range, approximately `-0.0859` to `0.0859` with a spacing to have about `5 x 5 = 25` samples.
           
           For `theta = pi/4`, I sample `x` and `y` coordinates from the range `-0.0656` to `0.0656` to get  `4 x 4 = 16` samples.
           
           For `theta = pi/8`, I sample `x` and `y` coordinates from the range `-0.0709` to `0.0709` to get `3 x 3 = 9` samples.
           
           This approach provides a good distribution of placements, considering rotation. As no previous failures have been encountered for this object, I don't need to consider collision avoidance. I will proceed with creating the placements using this approach, with surf_idx = 0.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning and Plan for Placing Object 5**
           
           Alright, I've got a new task. I need to figure out 50 stable placements for object 5 on surface 0, making absolutely sure it doesn't collide with object 6, which is already in place. First, I need to remind myself where that first object lives. Object 6's AABB is  `((-0.12905385, -0.12905385), (-0.03094615, -0.03094615))`. I'm starting with dimensions for this object that are around 0.09100. Let's call its width and height simply *s*.  The surface is a square of `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`.
           
           To avoid overlap, the idea is to generate valid center positions for object 5, and then do some quick tests to avoid collision.  I'm familiar with the concept of effective half-dimensions to deal with rotation, based on the rotation angle theta.  I need to adjust the placement ranges, of course, for various rotations, and then perform simple AABB checks to quickly filter out the collisions.
           
           I've decided to test different values for theta.  Since I'm looking for 50 valid solutions, I'm going to start with four common rotations: 0, pi/4, pi/2, and 3*pi/4, and then find some other rotations, looking at one at pi/8, to give me a wider set of valid centers. I will make a table to show the centers.
           
           For each angle theta, I know the size of object 5, and the known center of object 6, I can calculate `effective_half_dim_5` and then build up those AABB coordinates. If the intervals *don't* overlap, there will be no collision.
           
           Let's begin, I can do this!

(Thoughts: **Object Placement on Surface 0: A Detailed Strategy**
           
           My objective is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID: 4) on Surface 0, taking into account two existing fixed objects (ID: 6 and ID: 5) as obstacles. Surface 0's dimensions are -0.135 to 0.135 meters in both the X and Y directions. Object 4 has a side length (s_4) of 0.0862 meters, and for any given rotation, its bounding box's effective half-dimension will depend on the cosine and sine of the rotation angle.
           
           I've determined the bounding boxes for the fixed objects. Object 6's placement AABB is (-0.129, -0.129) to (-0.031, -0.031), and object 5 is (-0.005, -0.125) to (0.085, -0.035).
           
           My strategy is to generate candidate placements (rotation angle, X-coordinate, Y-coordinate) and then test them for validity. The validity check involves two key steps: (1) Ensure the object's bounding box stays within Surface 0's bounds and (2) check for collisions with the AABBs of the two existing objects.  A collision occurs when there is overlap in both the X and Y dimensions.
           
           I'll iterate through several rotation angles (0, pi/8, pi/4, and so on) and generate a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for each angle. Then I will test each point against the collision conditions. For simplicity, I'll prioritize points in the upper portion of the surface, especially far from center (x=0, y=0), to reduce the need for complicated checks.
           
           I'll start by systematically generating points to check. My collision detection logic involves checking the bounding box of object 4 against the surface and then against the bounding boxes of the existing objects. A more exhaustive grid will ensure I capture a variety of valid positions.
           The code outputs a list of 50 valid placements.
