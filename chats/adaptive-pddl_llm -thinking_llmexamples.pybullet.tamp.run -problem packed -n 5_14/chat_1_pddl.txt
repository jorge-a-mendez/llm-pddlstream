           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment: Goal Unreachable**
           
           My task is to create a plan to arrange objects v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18 *on* object v20.  I've thoroughly examined the initial state and the goal state, and I understand the relationship between the *on* predicate and the *supported* and *atpose* facts. The robot has two arms and is initially at base configuration v3.
           
           I need to use the `place` action to get each object *on* v20.  To `place` an object, I first need to pick it up. The *kin* facts are provided, showing *how* the robot can interact with the objects (which arm, grasp, trajectories). However, there's a critical constraint: I'm only allowed to use action instances from a given list.
           
           The problem lies with this constraint. The *only* action I am allowed to use is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action doesn't change the `atpose` predicate of the objects.  The *kin* facts suggest `pick` and `place` actions are *possible*, but they are *not* explicitly allowed because they aren't in the list of valid action instances.
           
           Since *pick* and *place* are the only way to move objects and change the `atpose` predicate (which ultimately dictates *on*), and since these actions are explicitly disallowed, the goal cannot be achieved. I'm left with the frustrating conclusion that the provided tools are insufficient to reach the goal state.  The current task is impossible.
