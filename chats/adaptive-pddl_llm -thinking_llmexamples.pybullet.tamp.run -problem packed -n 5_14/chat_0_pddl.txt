           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a goal: getting five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) onto another object, v20.  More specifically, I need to make sure that the `on` predicate holds true for each of those objects with respect to v20.  The "on" axiom is fairly straightforward: an object is "on" another if it's supported at a specific pose.
           
           I start by checking the initial state.  All the objects I need to move are *currently* at their respective poses (v9, v13, v15, v17, v19) and supported by v11.  The problem is, to get them onto v20, I need them supported at a new pose, denoted by `#o2`.
           
           The available actions I have at my disposal are limited: `move_base`, `pick`, `place`, `clean`, and `cook`.  Of these, only `move_base` is immediately available as an action instance; it's a no-op given the start and end configs.  The important actions are `pick` and `place` because they are what I need to rearrange the objects.
           
           The crucial problem becomes apparent when I examine the preconditions for `pick` and `place`. They both require a `kin` fact: a kinematic configuration that tells me how the robot's arm can interact with the objects.  The initial state, however, *does not* include any `kin` facts. That's a show-stopper!
           
           Without the ability to `pick` and `place`, I have absolutely no way to alter the current `atpose` of the objects and get them into their desired "on" state.  The only action available, `move_base`, can't do anything to change the `atpose` of the objects, meaning it also can't satisfy the goal.  I conclude, therefore, that this goal state is currently unreachable given the initial state and available action set.
