User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task: 
           
           ```
           #o0: object
           #o1: object
           #o2: object
           v10: object
           v11: object
           v12: object
           v13: object
           v14: object
           v15: object
           v16: object
           v17: object
           v18: object
           v3: object
           v4: object
           v5: object
           v6: object
           v7: object
           v8: object
           v9: object
           ```
           
           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.525, -0.379), (-4.437, -0.291)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, -0.335, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.811, 0.584).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts: 
           
           ```
           Atom type(v12, v17)
           Atom graspable(v8)
           Atom supported(v8, v9, v11)
           Atom atpose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v12, v10)
           Atom stackable(v8, v10)
           Atom pose(v15, v16)
           Atom stackable(v8, v18)
           Atom arm(v6)
           Atom pose(v8, v9)
           Atom ataconf(v4, v5)
           Atom supported(v15, v16, v11)
           Atom arm(v4)
           Atom atbconf(v3)
           Atom atpose(v12, v13)
           Atom canmove()
           Atom pose(v12, v13)
           Atom type(v8, v17)
           Atom supported(v12, v13, v14)
           Atom controllable(v4)
           Atom aconf(v6, v7)
           Atom stackable(v15, v10)
           Atom aconf(v4, v5)
           Atom graspable(v12)
           Atom stackable(v12, v18)
           Atom ataconf(v6, v7)
           Atom atpose(v8, v9)
           Atom handempty(v4)
           Atom graspable(v15)
           Atom bconf(v3)
           Atom handempty(v6)
           Atom grasp(v8, #o1)
           Atom pose(v12, #o2)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)
           Atom btraj(#o0)
           Atom basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)
           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v18)
           Atom grasp(v12, #o1)
           Atom pose(v15, #o2)
           Atom supported(v15, #o2, v10)
           Atom pose(v8, #o2)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v18)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reaching an Unreachable Goal**
           
           My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which requires an object of type `v17` to be located on surface `v18`. Initially, I see two potential candidates: `v8` and `v12`, both of type `v17`. My analysis reveals that `v8` is currently supported by `v11`, a surface that partially overlaps with `v18`, while `v12` rests on `v14`, a completely separate surface.
           
           To satisfy the goal, I would need to maneuver either `v8` or `v12` onto `v18`. This would entail `pick` and `place` actions to change the physical configuration. However, the available actions are limited to a single `move_base` operation, effectively a 'no-op' in this context. The problem explicitly states I can only use actions from the provided list.
           
           Due to the absence of valid `pick` and `place` instances, I am fundamentally incapable of altering the position of the objects. Since the initial state does not satisfy the goal condition, and I lack the means to manipulate the scene, I must conclude that `new-axiom@0()` is currently unreachable.
