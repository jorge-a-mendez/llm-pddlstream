           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.525, -0.379), (-4.437, -0.291)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.481, -0.335, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.811, 0.584).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Reasoning Through the Plan**
           
           My primary objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've determined is equivalent to `on(?green, v18)` AND `type(?green, v17)`.  I need to find an object of `type(?green, v17)` and then place it `on(?, v18)`. After inspecting the initial state, I've identified two potential objects, `v12` and `v8`, both with the correct type. I've chosen `v8` because it seems to have more predefined actions, specifically placing it on a designated surface, `v18`.
           
           To satisfy `on(v8, v18)`, I need to find a way to place `v8` onto `v18`. I know from my knowledge of these types of problems, that this will involve finding an appropriate grasping location for the robot arm. The current setup is: `supported(v8, v9, v11)` and `atpose(v8, v9)` and `supported(v8, #p0, v18)`. This looks promising. The plan must therefore move `v8` from pose `v9` on `v11` to the desired location `#p0` on `v18`.
           
           To move `v8`, I'll break down the process into elementary steps. I'll need to use `pick` and `place` actions, which have various preconditions. These include moving the base of the robot arm to be nearby the object, and also that the trajectory between two poses must be safe to travel.
           
           I've determined that the first action required is to move the robot base. It is currently at `v3`, but the `pick` action requires the base at `#q0`. This will be done with `move_base v3 #q0 #t2`. I've checked that the preconditions, such as `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()`, are satisfied in the initial state and are likely to be satisfied throughout.
           
           After the move_base action, I can execute the `pick` action, picking up `v8` from `v9`. Its effects will be that `v8` is no longer `atpose(v8, v9)`.
           
           Next, I need to place `v8` at `#p0`. This requires another base movement using `move_base #q0 #q1 #t4`.
           
           Finally, after verifying these base movement actions, I'll execute the `place` action, putting the object at the target pose, `#p0`. After these actions, I can confirm that `on(v8, v18)` will hold true, meaning I will have successfully satisfied my objective.
           
           To ensure that I am providing the most relevant actions to the plan, I now need to consider collision predicates and trajectories. In order to select the correct object with its given pose, it is my job to make sure that the object can be placed there in a stable fashion.
           
           For the value of continuous parameter `#p0`, I analyzed the AABBs of both `v8` and `v18`. To be stable, `v8` must fully fit within the bounds of `v18`. By calculation, I've determined an appropriate pose is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8)`: x-range `[4.465, 4.535]` is within the x-range of `v18`. For y,  [-0.335, -0.265] is fully contained within [-0.6, 0.0] as required. As for z, given `v8` starts at z=0.8, and no table height has been specified, it is safest to keep the origin at `0.8`, which assumes `v18` has the same z-value as other objects being manipulated. This also ensures stability, meaning there should be no overlapping with other objects. Theta is 0.
           
           Thus, my complete plan is:
           
           1.  `(move_base v3 #q0 #t2)`
           2.  `(pick v4 v8 v9 #g0 #q0 #t0)`
           3.  `(move_base #q0 #q1 #t4)`
           4.  `(place v4 v8 (4.5, -0.3, 0.8) #g0 #q1 #t1)`
           
)
