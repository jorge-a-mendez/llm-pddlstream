           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.677, -0.343, 1.2, -1.467, 1.242, -1.954, 2.223).
           Object v20 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135)).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.3, -0.6), (0.3, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.033, 0.355), (0.065, 0.453)).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.119, 0.24), (0.194, 0.315)).
           Object v16 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((0.024, -0.288), (0.12, -0.191)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.017, 0.19), (0.054, 0.261)).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (0.016, 0.404, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.949, 0.316).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-0.002, -0.541), (0.081, -0.458)).
           Object v19 is a pose with position (0.157, 0.278, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.732, 0.681).
           Object v17 is a pose with position (0.072, -0.24, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.479, 0.878).
           Object v15 is a pose with position (0.018, 0.225, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, -0.714, 0.7).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (0.04, -0.499, 0.781) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.106, 0.994).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (-1.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Conjunction

               Atom on(v12, v20)
               Atom on(v14, v20)
               Atom on(v16, v20)
               Atom on(v18, v20)`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The task is to move five objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their initial locations on surface v11 to the surface v20. The robot has two arms, v4 and v6, both are initially empty. The robot's base is at v3.
           
           The problem statement only provides one action instance: `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. This action effectively means the robot moves from its current base configuration to the same base configuration using an empty trajectory. This action has no practical effect on the state of the objects or the robot's ability to manipulate them.
           
           There are no pick or place actions provided in the list of valid action instances. Without these actions, the robot cannot pick up any of the objects (v8, v12, v14, v16, v18) from their current locations, nor can it place them onto the target surface v20. Therefore, the goal of having all five objects on surface v20 is unachievable given the limited set of allowed actions.
