User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           Atom supported(v12, #o2, v10)
           Atom supported(v8, #o2, v10)
           Atom grasp(v15, #o1)

           ```
           
           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Reasoning on Achieving the Goal `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           My objective is to find a plan that satisfies `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to having an object `?green` such that both `on(?green, v18)` and `type(?green, v17)` are true. I've examined the initial state to identify potential candidates for `?green`.  Objects `v8` and `v12` are of type `v17`, so they could be `?green`.
           
           If I consider `v8`, I see that it is currently *on* `v11` and I can see it *could* be on `v18`.
           Similarly, `v12` is *on* `v14` and *could* be on `v18`.  
           
           The primary challenge is moving one of these objects to `v18`.  I reviewed the available actions, but the only allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  This action does not change the state of the *on* predicate. I confirmed it does not change `atpose` nor `supported`, which would be needed to satisfy the goal.  I have also checked for `pick` and `place` actions, and they are not included.
           
           Given the available actions, it's impossible to achieve the goal `on(?green, v18)`. No object initially satisfies that condition.  Since the only option is a move action that doesn't change objects position, the goal is unachievable with the available actions.
