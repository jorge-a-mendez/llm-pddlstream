           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal-Oriented Planning with Object Manipulation**
           
           My objective is to fulfill the requirement defined by `new-axiom@0`, which dictates that I must position an object of type `v17` onto object `v18`. I've analyzed the initial state, where I identify two objects of type `v17`: `v8` and `v12`. Neither object currently satisfies the `on` condition with `v18`. After inspecting their poses, I recognize I need to move one of them onto `v18`. Given the available actions, I've chosen to move `v8` to `v18`.
           
           To do this, I will execute a "pick" action to grasp `v8` and a "place" action to place `v8` on `v18`. The key here lies in ensuring that the base configuration `(#o3)` in `kin` constraints can be consistently interpreted to mean the current base configuration, `v3`. This is crucial for the feasibility of `pick` and `place`, which require the robot's base to be at a specific configuration.
           
           My plan entails the following steps:
           
           1.  **Pick `v8`:** I'll use arm `v4`, grasp `#o1`, from `v8`'s pose `v9` with the base at `v3` and using trajectory `#o4`.
           2.  **Place `v8`:** Following the pick, I'll place `v8` onto `v18` at pose `#o2` (which is supported by `v18`) with the same arm and base configuration.
           
           This sequence ensures the goal `on(v8, v18)` and `type(v8, v17)` is met. Any `move_base` actions that only remove the `canmove()` predicate would be unnecessary and introduce unneeded costs. This plan is, therefore, a concise method to solve the problem and get the needed grasp and type.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Assessing the Plan's Limitations**
           
           Okay, the user correctly pointed out an issue: the initial plan was flawed. The only permitted action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. Let's re-evaluate this. The goal is `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to needing something green `on v18`. I see two things are green in the initial state, `v8` and `v12`, but neither are on `v18`.  `v8` is on `v11` and `v12` is on `v14`.
           
           To achieve `on(?green, v18)`, I'd need to manipulate the object's pose and ensure the object is supported by `v18`.  The `move_base` action, with its `basemotion` and `atbconf` preconditions, doesn't actually affect the objects' positions. The action is allowed because of `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)` which is true in the initial state and also because `atbconf(v3)` and `canmove()` are true in the initial state. The effects of the action are also `atbconf(v3)`, `NegatedAtom atbconf(v3)`, and `NegatedAtom canmove()`. Since both `atbconf(v3)` and `NegatedAtom atbconf(v3)` are the same, `atbconf(v3)` will remain true. The last effect is the interesting point: executing the action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` will negate `canmove()`. This means that I *can* do something, but can't do anything else.
           
           The problem is, the core of the issue is that it's impossible to manipulate `on` relations. I need `pick` and `place` actions to move these green objects onto `v18`. Those are the only methods for manipulating the `on` relation. The robot's movement doesn't actually place the object. Since those actions aren't allowed, and since `v8` and `v12` aren't already on `v18`, there's no way to reach the goal. The goal is unachievable with the current constraints.
