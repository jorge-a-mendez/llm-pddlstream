           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Planning**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The core objective, `new-axiom@0()`, boils down to achieving a conjunction of conditions.  First, the "easy" ones:  being at certain configurations and having stores free (initial conditions).  Then, the meat of the problem: acquiring images of two objectives, `v17` and `v18`, and analyzing and getting analysis of two objects, one of type `v2` (rocks) and one of type `v6` (soil samples).  The rovers I have are `v12` and `v14`. I'll first explore using `v12` for all tasks, and then check to see if I need to introduce v14 at a later step.
           
           To get the images, I need to use the `take_image` and `send_image` actions.  This means setting up the `imagevisible`, `onboard`, `supports`, `atconf`, and `calibrated` preconditions. Since `v10` is the camera, it makes sense to have `v12` and `v14` use that camera. Both rovers are equipped with cameras. My approach will be to move the rover to a good viewing point, calibrate the camera, take pictures, and then send them.
           
           The analysis part requires `sample_rock` and `send_analysis`.  The prerequisites here are above, store, free, comvisible and atconf. So I need to move the rover to the correct sampling location and then the communication location. Since I have a choice, I will pick `v3` and `v5` because they are above `#o5`.
           
           **Detailed Action Plan for Rover v12**
           
           Let's begin. Rover `v12` starts at `v13`.
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:**
               *   Move `v12` from `v13` to configuration `#o3`.
               *   Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for objectives `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Take images of both `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Move `v12` from `#o3` to configuration `#o0` (near the lander `v9`).
               *   Send the images of `v17` and `v18` to the lander.
           
           2.  **Analysis and Communication:**
               *   Move `v12` to `#o5`.
               *   Sample rock `v3`.
               *   Drop the sampled rock because only one can be stored.
               *   Sample rock `v5`.
               *   Move `v12` back to configuration `#o0` (com).
               *   Send the analyses of rocks `v3` and `v5`.
           
           Since both rovers start at `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the configurations for image/com/sample are `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`, these will require `move` actions.
           
           **Geometric Configuration and Parameter Estimation**
           
           Now, the trickier part:  determining the continuous parameters for those configuration objects. For `v12`, for `imagevisible`, it's clear: `#o3` has to be a location where `v12` can see both `v17` and `v18` within the `imagerange`. The lander is at the point where `comvisible` is true. Let's look at the rocks' position to ensure the `above` property is present. My problem is how to calculate the position, but I have already written a series of steps to identify all the positions of each rover.
           
           *   **Configuration `#o3`:** A point from which the rover `v12` can image the objectives within the appropriate range. A valid choice that meets the geometric requirements and avoids collisions seems to be at coordinate (0.6, 0.5)
           
           *   **Configuration `#o0`:** The location to ensure the rover can communicate with the lander. An acceptable position that minimizes travel is `(-0.5, -2.0)`.
           
           *   **Configuration `#o5`:** A location from which to collect the rock samples. I'll pick `(-0.7, 1.0)`, as the location is right above the soil and rock sample points.
           
           **Final Plan with Coordinates**
           
           The final plan:
           
           1.  Move rover `v12` from configuration `v13` to `(#o3 0.6 0.5)`
           2.  Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.

           Let's begin. Rover `v12` starts at `v13`.
           
           1.  **Image Acquisition:**
               *   Move `v12` from `v13` to configuration `#o3`.
               *   Calibrate the camera `v10` on `v12` for objectives `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Take images of both `v17` and `v18`.
               *   Move `v12` from `#o3` to configuration `#o0` (near the lander `v9`).
               *   Send the images of `v17` and `v18` to the lander.
           
           2.  **Analysis and Communication:**
               *   Move `v12` to `#o5`.
               *   Sample rock `v3`.
               *   Drop the sampled rock because only one can be stored.
               *   Sample rock `v5`.
               *   Move `v12` back to configuration `#o0` (com).
               *   Send the analyses of rocks `v3` and `v5`.
           
           Since both rovers start at `v13` and `v15` respectively, and the configurations for image/com/sample are `#o3`, `#o0`, `#o5`, these will require `move` actions.
           
           **Geometric Configuration and Parameter Estimation**
           
           Now, the trickier part:  determining the continuous parameters for those configuration objects. For `v12`, for `imagevisible`, it's clear: `#o3` has to be a location where `v12` can see both `v17` and `v18` within the `imagerange`. The lander is at the point where `comvisible` is true. Let's look at the rocks' position to ensure the `above` property is present. My problem is how to calculate the position, but I have already written a series of steps to identify all the positions of each rover.
           
           *   **Configuration `#o3`:** A point from which the rover `v12` can image the objectives within the appropriate range. A valid choice that meets the geometric requirements and avoids collisions seems to be at coordinate (0.6, 0.5)
           
           *   **Configuration `#o0`:** The location to ensure the rover can communicate with the lander. An acceptable position that minimizes travel is `(-0.5, -2.0)`.
           
           *   **Configuration `#o5`:** A location from which to collect the rock samples. I'll pick `(-0.7, 1.0)`, as the location is right above the soil and rock sample points.
           
           **Final Plan with Coordinates**
           
           The final plan:
           
           1.  Move rover `v12` from configuration `v13` to `(#o3 0.6 0.5)`
           2.  Calibrate `v10` on `v12` for `v17`.

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Refined Strategy for Object Manipulation**
           
           My initial plan failed due to an unreachable communication configuration. I need to find new configurations for communication (`#o0`) and image-taking (`#o3`).  The current image configuration, `(0.6, 0.5)`, is problematic.
           
           First, I re-evaluated the object positions. I've re-computed distances to determine valid `#o3` configuration poses to ensure I am within range to view `v17` and `v18`. I confirmed that the current `#o3` poses can't work for both `v17` and `v18`. This requires two separate configurations or rovers, but I believe the intent is to use a single configuration. I have determined a mid-point pose, `(0.6, 2.1)` that I'll designate as `#o3`.
           
           Next, I need to find a new communication configuration, `#o0`, that is reachable and `comvisible` to the lander `v9`. `(-0.5, -2.0)` failed. I've determined that `(-1.5, -2.0)` is close enough, collision-free, and reachable.
           
           Now I am going to deal with the `above` predicate, `#o5`. This is a tricky predicate. I need `v12` to be *above* both `v3` and `v5` at a single `#o5` configuration, which is geometrically impossible with the given constraints. I must be able to satisfy the intent using a single configuration, so I will select the midpoint and determine `(-0.8, 1.1)`.
           
           **My new Plan:**
           
           1.  Move to image location: `v13 (1.0, -1.75)` -> `#o3 (0.6, 2.1)`
           2.  Calibrate for the first objective (`v17`), then, take its image
           3.  Re-calibrate and take the second image (`v18`)
           4.  Communicate: `#o3 (0.6, 2.1)` -> `#o0 (-1.5, -2.0)`
           5.  Send image data.
           6.  Move: `(#o0 -1.5, -2.0)` -> `(#o5 -0.8, 1.1)`.
           7.  Sample `v3`.
           8.  Drop the sample.
           9.  Sample `v5`.
           10. Return: `(-0.8, 1.1)` -> `(-1.5, -2.0)`.
           11. Send rock analysis data.
           
           I've carefully checked all configurations for potential collisions. All seem fine.
           
           The line of sight between my new points and the objectives and destination is also clear of obstructions. The new points make sure the `motion` predicates are valid as well.
           
           I believe I have a solid plan to achieve the goal of the task.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Collision-Free Execution**
           
           Alright, after reviewing the feedback, it's clear I need to adjust the rover's configurations to avoid collisions. The original plan had some issues, specifically with the positioning of `#o3` (imaging) and `#o0` (communication).
           
           First, let's address `#o3`. The goal here is to get a clear image of objects `v17` and `v18`. My initial attempt at `(0.6, 2.1)` hit an obstacle, `v19`.  I've recalculated and decided to try `#o3 = (0.8, 2.1)`. This seems to keep me within reach of the targets and outside the x-range of obstacle `v19`. I checked the distances to `v17` and `v18`, and it's within 2 units, as required.
           
           Next, I need to reposition `#o0` to allow communication with the lander, `v9`. My original choice, `(-1.5, -2.0)`, was too close and actually inside `v9`. After considering the AABBs of the rover and the lander, I'm proposing `#o0 = (-0.5, -2.0)`. This should keep the rover within communication range (4 units) and collision-free. I verified that  `-0.5` is outside the lander's bounding box.
           
           The configuration for `#o5` which is used for targeting `v3` and `v5` remains the same as it wasn't flagged for collision. This is the "above" configuration.
           
           I performed additional collision checks to ensure that the robot is not close to other rocks or the other stationary rover as it moves between configurations.
           
           Now, with these changes, I need to revisit the overall plan, as the main goal of the axiom needs to be achieved in the *final state*. This means I need to make sure the Rover is back in its initial configuration at the end of execution. Furthermore, `v3` and `v5` must be analyzed, and then the rover must return to initial state. The revised plan structure ensures this:
           1.  Rover moves to #o3 and images `v17` and `v18`.
           2. Rover sends those images.
           3. Rover moves to #o5 and analyses `v3` then `v5`.
           4. The rover moves back to #o0 and sends the analyses.
           5. The rover drops the rock to ensure it's free at the end.
           6. The rover returns to the initial starting point.
           By dropping the rock at the end, I can ensure that all conditions are met, and the Axiom is properly rendered.

(Thoughts: **Updated Configuration Analysis and Plan Refinement**
           
           Okay, so I've been tasked with revisiting those rover configurations, specifically `#o3` and `#o0`, to address the feedback. It seems my initial assessments were a bit off, particularly with `#o3`.  Let's break down the issues and my revised approach.
           
           **#o3 (Imaging):** The previous point `(0.8, 2.1)` was problematic because I miscalculated the rover's footprint. It was too close to obstacle `v19` (a region from `(0.25, 1.75)` to `(0.75, 2.25)`) and I need to avoid any collisions. Since I need to image objects `v17` and `v18`, I need a visible spot. Considering that I need to be *away* from `v19`, a good approach here would be to find a point with a smaller X-coordinate and Y-coordinate above `v19`'s `min Y`.
           
           After thinking it through, I'm going to propose **(0.0, 2.1)** for `#o3`. It ensures good visibility to both imaging targets, is more than `0.75` away from `v19` on the X-axis, and is significantly above `v19` on the Y-axis. Furthermore, this point seems within reach of my abstract motion predicates; the `motion` predicates seem to involve `#o0`, `#o3`, `#o5`, `v13`, and `v15`, and I know I have a motion link from `v13` to `#o3`, so I'm covered.
           
           **#o0 (Communication):** The previous `(-0.5, -2.0)` was marked as "not reachable", so I need to re-evaluate. It looks like the issue stems from the abstract `motion` predicates not being defined for the previous spot.
           
           Looking at the lander `v9` position, centered at approximately `(-1.9, -2.0)`, a better approach would be to choose a communication point with an X-coordinate greater than `v9`'s max-X `-2.405`.  I'll suggest **(-1.0, -2.0)** for `#o0`. This is far enough away from the lander to avoid collision, and it looks like the distance to the lander will be less than 4, and still within the rover's communication range. The abstract motion facts cover reaching this point, so this should work.
           
           **#o5 (Sampling):** The previous `(-0.8, 1.1)` configuration has been verified. I will stick with this, as it satisfies the requirements.
           
           **Plan Revisions:** The plan itself, in terms of the sequence of actions, seems sound. I just needed to adjust the coordinates.
           
           1.  Move from `v13` to `#o3` (0.0, 2.1)
           2.  Take image `v17`.
           3.  Take image `v18`.
           4.  Move from `#o3` (0.0, 2.1) to `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0).
           5.  Send image `v17`.
           6.  Send image `v18`.
           7.  Move from `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0) to `#o5` (-0.8, 1.1).
           8.  Sample `v3`.
           9.  Drop rock.
           10. Sample `v5`.
           11. Move from `#o5` (-0.8, 1.1) to `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0).
           12. Send analysis `v3`.
           13. Send analysis `v5`.
           14. Drop rock.
           15. Move from `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0) to `v13`.
           
           Double-checking all the necessary motion links, the sequence still holds up. I believe this will now provide a robust solution.

           4.  Move from `#o3` (0.0, 2.1) to `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0).
           5.  Send image `v17`.
           6.  Send image `v18`.
           7.  Move from `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0) to `#o5` (-0.8, 1.1).
           8.  Sample `v3`.
           9.  Drop rock.
           10. Sample `v5`.
           11. Move from `#o5` (-0.8, 1.1) to `#o0` (-1.0, -2.0).

           Double-checking all the necessary motion links, the sequence still holds up. I believe this will now provide a robust solution.

(Thoughts: **Re-evaluating Configurations for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that some previous configuration choices were problematic, specifically `#o3 = (0.0, 2.1)` (collision with `v20`) and `#o0 = (-1.0, -2.0)` (not reachable). This is crucial information, especially the reachability issue, as the `motion` predicates must connect these configurations. I need to re-assess the goals and initial state and then find new configurations.
           
           The goal is to analyze two rocks, image two objectives, and get to the initial position. Relevant initial facts include the rover positions, objective positions, and obstacle locations.  I'm dealing with two obstacles, `v19` and `v20`, which are defining the operational space.
           
           **Revising Configuration Strategies:**
           
           *   **Imaging Configuration `#o3`:** The previous problematic choice collided with `v20`.  The objectives are near (1.84, 2.06) and (-0.66, 2.11). I will try *x = 1.0, y = 2.0*.  This is clear of both `v19` and `v20` and still close to the objectives. The distance check shows that it's within range of the objectives, given the range of my imaging sensor.
           *   **Communication Configuration `#o0`:** The previous choice was deemed unreachable. I have to avoid the lander's AABB (`((-2.405, -2.346), (-1.395, -1.654))`) and still be reachable from all points. I will try *x = -0.3, y = -1.0*. This should avoid collisions and be within the expected travel range. Distance checks show this configuration is not within the lander bounds.
           *   **Sampling Configuration `#o5`:** The initial choice of *(-0.8, 1.1)* is valid, given that it's already above the rocks, there is no need to make changes here.
           
           **Updated Plan**
           
           Based on this, my updated plan is to:
           
           1.  Move from the initial configuration to `#o3 = (1.0, 2.0)` for imaging.
           2.  Take images.

           5.  Move from `#o0` to `#o5 = (-0.8, 1.1)` for sampling.
           6.  Sample the rocks.
           7.  Move from `#o5` to `#o0`.
           8.  Send analyses.
           9.  Finalize by dropping the rocks at their spots, then return to initial position.
           
           This new plan should address the previous issues and is feasible, given the existing `motion` predicates.

(Thoughts: **Refining Rover V12 Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that the previous configurations I proposed for `#o3` and `#o0` weren't reachable for rover `v12`. I need to figure out new, collision-free, and occlusion-free configurations that *are* reachable. Critically, these new configurations need to be reachable from existing states using the provided `motion` predicates.
           
           Here's the situation: I'm starting at `atconf(v12, v13)` where `v13 = (1.0, -1.75, 0.0)`. My goal is to get `v12` to `atconf(v12, v13)`, get `free(v12, v16)`, `receivedimage(v17, v11)`, `receivedimage(v18, v11)`, `receivedanalysis(v3)`, and `receivedanalysis(v5)`. I have obstacles like `v19` and `v20` to avoid.  I have these motion predicates to move between locations, including the continuous configuration positions `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`.
           
           It looks like the problem may be that the rover base collides with some obstacle in a prior path or at the target location. I don't have the exact robot geometry, so I need to make sure the start/end points are collision-free with respect to *all* obstacles to make sure the paths are clear for the rover.
           
           I'm focusing on finding the (x, y) coordinates for the new configurations while respecting the obstacle constraints.
           
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging Objective):**
               *   I need to find a position for `#o3` that lets `v12` image both `v17` and `v18`.  I have to avoid obstacles `v19` and `v20`.  After a few tries, I've chosen `(1.0, 1.9)`. This position keeps me within range to image both objectives and is collision-free.
           *   **`#o0` (Communication Objective):**
               *   This is for communicating with `v9`. I want a spot outside the x-range of `v19` and `v20` where the base will not collide with either.  I found `(-0.5, -1.0)`. This should allow clear transmission with the lander.
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling Objective):**
               *   I'll stick with `(-0.8, 1.1)`. This position is between the rocks `v3` and `v5` and seems collision-free.
           
           I'm confident that these new configuration positions are all reachable using the `motion` predicates from the initial state, and will fulfill all necessary goals. I'll maintain the current plan structure and hope for success!

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**
           
           Alright, let's dive into this Rovers domain puzzle. The goal is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, which I've taken to mean getting the rover to complete some tasks and end up at a specific configuration. The main stumbling block appears to be finding a valid spot, `#o3`, for the rover to image two targets (`v17`, `v18`) *and* communicate (`#o0` to `v9`), all while avoiding collisions and being reachable. Previous attempts to generate a plan have been rejected because the continuous values I provide for configurations like `#o0` and `#o3` are not valid, mainly due to "not reachable for robot base" issues. This indicates that I am either misinterpreting "reachable" based on the constraints of `motion` predicates, or my chosen locations are somehow problematic.
           
           **Re-examining Constraints and Parameters**
           
           Let's break down the problem further. The main difficulty is finding good, achievable coordinates for:
           
           *   **`#o3` (Imaging):** This is where the rover needs to image both targets, `v17` (far right) and `v18` (far left). The crucial thing is the line of sight for imaging, which must be occlusion-free and within 2 meters. The placement must satisfy the `imagevisible` predicates. There's a persistent issue in this domain regarding `v20`, a vertical obstacle at x=0. The presence of `v20` makes it difficult to have a line of sight to both targets simultaneously.
           *   **`#o0` (Communication):** This is where the rover needs to communicate. It must be accessible to the starting point `v13` and also within range (4 meters) of the lander (`v9`). Also, the base of the rover shouldn't be in collision with any obstacle.
           *   **`#o5` (Sampling):** I have been able to provide this coordinate previously, to sample `v3` and `v5` without issue.
           
           **Collision and Reachability Checks**
           
           One very important consideration is to perform careful collision checks, especially regarding the base, which occupies a rectangular area defined by the x,y coordinates of the rover at a particular location. I'm taking the approximate bounding box dimensions for these, and determining if there's any overlap with other AABBs for rocks, fixed obstacles, or rover/lander placements. Based on past runs, "not reachable for robot base" likely means that the point is invalid, which may due to the placement being outside the navigable area.
           
           **Geometric Reasoning for Target Visibility and Obstacle Avoidance**
           
           Based on prior runs, the locations for the targets are at the coordinates given, and the fixed objects (`v19`, `v20`) are obstacles that must be avoided. One challenge is the 2-meter visual range in PDDL. Given the arrangement, the only viable configurations are those to the right of v17, and the only configurations that could allow v18 to be seen must be on the side of v18 or beyond.
           
           **Current Problem**
           I cannot find a configuration for `#o3` that is valid. I've tried multiple configurations that meet the constraints, but none are accepted.
           
           **Reasoning**
           
           Given the geometric constraints, the best interpretation is that there is no solution that provides an occlusion-free path. The "blocked" function uses test-cfree-ray-conf-negative and so it's a matter of line of sight from the continuous configurations given. The requirements for the function are that there is a range to be met. I'm at the point where I will assume the goal is unreachable.
