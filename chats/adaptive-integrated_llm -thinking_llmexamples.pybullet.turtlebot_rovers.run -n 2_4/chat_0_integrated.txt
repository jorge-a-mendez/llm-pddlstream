           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Analysis of Achieving `Atom new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `Atom new-axiom@0()`, which I see is a conjunction of multiple `Atom`s.  I'm already starting with the initial state and can see that several conditions are *already* met: `atconf(v12, v13)`, `atconf(v14, v15)`, `free(v12, v16)`, and `free(v14, v16)`.  My focus is therefore on achieving the remaining conditions, particularly those involving `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis`.
           
           Looking at the problem space, I've got two rovers, one at configuration `v13` and the other at `v15`. My actions are limited to moving these rovers - but the only defined move actions are self-moves.  That feels... constricting.  To achieve the goal, I need to get images (`receivedimage`) and perform analyses (`receivedanalysis`).
           
           For `receivedimage`, I'll need to use `take_image` and then `send_image`.  To take an image, I need to be *calibrated*.  And that's where I hit my first snag. I need to be at a configuration where the thing I want to image is *visible* and the camera must be on a rover that is *calibrated*. I see `imagevisible` facts are present, but all those require configurations `#o3`, which neither rover starts at. So, *to take a picture, I need to be at configuration `#o3`*.
           
           For the analyses (`receivedanalysis`), I see that I'll need to first `sample_rock` and then `send_analysis`.  But again, to do *that* I need to be in a configuration where there are rocks above me. I know I see some rocks above a certain position, *but I need to be at configuration `#o5` to sample them*.
           
           Now, the problem is, *there's no way to move*!  My 'move' actions are essentially no-ops; I can't *get* to `#o3`, `#o0`, or `#o5` from where I start. Because of this, it is *impossible* to achieve the goal state. I am *configurationally* stuck. I can not receive the image or analyze any of the potential stones or soil. I can't take the actions needed. The plan is simply not achievable with the defined actions and initial state.
