(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           Alright, I need to figure out how to place an object (ID 4) 50 times stably on a surface. The object is a square with side length ~0.0756. Surface 0 is also a square, centered at (0,0) with side length 0.27.  A stable placement means the object must fit entirely within the surface. The object can rotate, but because it's a square, rotations by 90-degree increments are effectively the same in terms of the bounding box.
           
           The key is this: the half-width and half-height of the rotated object's bounding box change with the rotation angle (theta). Since the object is a square,  `hw = S/2 * ( |cos(theta)| + |sin(theta)| )`, where S is the side of the object.  This means I need to calculate a new `hw` for *each* angle, because the bounding box size changes.  Now, `hw` varies, and the most constrained orientation is at 45 degrees, where the rotated AABB will have the greatest width. So I first calculate the `hw` range, and the range for the `x` and `y` center values.
           
           To ensure diversity, I'll generate a list of 50 angles from 0 to 2*pi, and then, for each angle I'll calculate the valid `x` and `y` range, where the x and y values for the surface center can be.  To provide distribution, I'll use 10 x 5 grid of (x,y) locations within the range for each theta.
           
           In summary, I'll calculate for each theta the valid range, and the 50 x,y center values corresponding.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: Avoiding Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback indicating that object 4 has been successfully placed at a specific location on the surface. Now, my task is to place object 5 in the same scene without any overlap.
           
           I've determined that object 4 is a square with a known side length and a fixed position, specifically in the bottom-left of the surface.  This means its bounding box (AABB) is clearly defined, spanning from (-0.135, -0.135) to (-0.05939, -0.05939).
           
           Next, I need to figure out where to place object 5, another square with its own side length. My goal is to find 50 valid placements across surface 0 while ensuring they don't intersect with the AABB of object 4.
           
           I know the maximum extent of valid x and y coordinates for object 5 based on the surface size and dimensions for all angles of rotations. To determine this extent, I'll calculate the half width of object 5, taking into account any potential rotation.
           
           I've decided to employ a strategy involving generating a grid of potential (x, y) coordinates for object 5 at varying rotations, or theta, which I will test against an existing placement to ensure non-collision for the 50 placements I'm seeking. This will be an iterative process.
           
           I'll check these candidate (x, y) coordinates and, if I find non-colliding locations, store them. To ensure the diversity of the placements, I'll alternate the search directions across the grid. If no valid placement is found on the grid for one particular rotation, I'll then move the center, to make sure I find 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for a New Object**
           
           I need to generate 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 6) on surface 0, taking into account two existing square objects (ID 4 and ID 5) as obstacles. I'll represent the surface with its bounds and the objects using their positions, sizes (0.0756 and 0.0878) and bounding boxes (AABB). My approach involves a grid search for placement points combined with rotation for the new object.
           
           First, I pre-calculate the AABB for objects 4 and 5, setting the surface boundaries. Then, I generate 50 angles (theta) for the new object, and for each theta: calculate the minimum and maximum ranges for valid center coordinates based on the object's size and surface. I'll form a 5x5 grid of potential placements, calculate the AABB of the new object given its angle, and check collision with the other two AABBs. If no collision-free spot is found in the grid, I will fall back to a corner location. If that also fails, I'll attempt the center.  If no placements are found, dummy placements are appended. Finally, I will ensure that there are 50 placements output.

(Thoughts: **Refining Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           Okay, so I need to place 50 stable placements for this new square object (ID 7) on Surface 0, taking into account the existing obstacles (IDs 4, 5, and 6). Surface 0 is a square region centered at (0,0). I've got the dimensions and AABBs for everything figured out.  The critical aspect here is to avoid collisions.
           
           My initial approach is solid:  I'm going to iterate through 50 different angles (theta) and, for each angle, generate a grid of candidate (x, y) positions within the available space on the surface. For each candidate, I’ll check if the object’s AABB (for the given angle) collides with the AABBs of the existing obstacles. If no collision, I've got a valid placement.
           
           To start, for each angle, I calculate the `hw_7` based on the given object's side length, and determine the bounds of valid `x` and `y` coordinates.
           
           I recognized the occupied corners, and know the bottom-right and central regions are relatively clear, so I'm trying to distribute candidates throughout the whole region, and trying to put more weight on clear regions. I'll use 5 candidate positions for both x and y at each angle, for a grid of 25 candidates, as a base. To ensure diversity, I'll alternate the search direction (scanning top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top) for every other angle.
           
           I also added a fallback mechanism to try the center or bottom-right corner if the grid search fails, though that should be unlikely, given how the surface size relative to the object.  I've double-checked my collision detection logic, and my calculations look right. I'm expecting this to give me the desired results!
