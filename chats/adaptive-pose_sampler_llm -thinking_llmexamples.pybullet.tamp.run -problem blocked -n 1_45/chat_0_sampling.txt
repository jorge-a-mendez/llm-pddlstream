(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy: 50 Stable Configurations**
           
           Okay, so I've got this square object, 0.07 x 0.07, and I need to come up with 50 stable placements on a surface defined by the AABB ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).  Essentially, I'm defining where this object can be positioned, accounting for its rotation.  The goal is to ensure the object's bounding box stays entirely within the surface boundaries.
           
           First, I define the object's half-extents (0.035 in both x and y). The rotation angle `theta` is critical, as it changes the effective bounding box. I determine the maximum and minimum size of the AABB based on `theta`. I find the max effective side of the square is approximately 0.09898 when `theta` is pi/4. The minimum effective size of the side is 0.07 (or 0.035 * 2) at theta = 0.
           
           Since the surface is quite a bit larger (0.6 x 0.6) than the object, there's a lot of room for placements. I start with generating placements with the square set at a zero rotation, theta = 0, which makes my math easier. 
           
           I calculate the valid range for the object's center coordinates (x, y) given the surface dimensions and the effective bounding box at zero rotation.  Specifically, x must be between 4.235 and 4.765, and y must be between -0.565 and -0.035. I decide to create a grid of placements because it's systematic and I can easily generate the required number of placements: a 5x10 grid. Using a grid guarantees a set of 50 placements with `theta = 0`.  I calculate the grid steps for x and y to distribute the objects evenly within the valid range.  This will result in 50 distinct positions and orientations. This meets the brief as all calculated values should be valid.

User:      The following successes were found from the previous request. These were placements that did not collide with fixed obstacles. You may use these as positive examples for future requests:

(Thoughts: **Analyzing Placement Options for ID: 10 to Avoid Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback confirming a successful placement for `ID: 5` at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`.  This means `ID: 5`, with its `(0.07, 0.07)` dimensions, is situated safely. I've got to keep this in mind as I figure out where `ID: 10` can go.
           
           Now, `ID: 10` is a square object with dimensions `(0.08, 0.08)`, basically `(0.08, 0.08)`, and I'm still working with surface `0`, which is defined by the points `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`.
           
           First, let's break down the geometry of `ID: 10`. It's a perfect square, so its half-extents are `0.04` in each direction at `theta = 0`. The surface I'm placing it on is `0.6` wide and `0.6` high.
           
           For `theta = 0`, the valid x-range for the center is `[4.24, 4.76]`, and the valid y-range is `[-0.56, -0.04]`.
           
           The previously placed `ID: 5` is sitting at `(0, 0.0, 4.235, -0.565)`. It occupies a region in x of `[4.2, 4.27]` and a region in y of `[-0.6, -0.53]`.  `ID: 10` has to avoid this region.
           
           I'm aiming to generate 50 placements for `ID: 10`, assuming `theta = 0` to simplify the calculations, as it's square. The collision conditions dictate that the center point of `ID: 10` must satisfy one of the following:  either its x-coordinate must be greater than or equal to `4.31`, *or* its y-coordinate must be greater than or equal to `-0.49`.
           
           I've set up a grid-based approach to generate potential placements.  I've defined x-points from `4.24` to `4.76` and y-points from `-0.56` to `-0.04`, creating a network of potential centers. I've adjusted the number of points in each direction and calculated the valid placements according to the collision rule. The grid creates a slightly diverse set of potential locations on the surface, ensuring I cover the space appropriately, accounting for the constraint that at least one of these two conditions must be true:  `x >= 4.31` or `y >= -0.49`. This process resulted in a list of 52 valid (x,y) coordinates for the center of `ID: 10`, from which I will just take the first 50.
