           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The object is a square with dimensions approximately 0.093x0.093. This object is significantly smaller than the surface, so there should be many stable placements. Since the object is square, its orientation (theta) does not affect its AABB, so I can use 0 for theta. I will try to place the object in various locations on the surface, including the center and corners.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27. The new object (ID: 5) is also a square, with dimensions approximately 0.099x0.099. It's slightly larger than the previous object (ID: 4) but still considerably smaller than the surface.
           
           I know that (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) was a stable placement for object ID 4. I need to find placements for object ID 5 that are stable on the surface and do not collide with object ID 4, which is currently placed at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           Since object ID 4 is centered at (0,0) and has size 0.0929x0.0929, its AABB extends from approximately -0.0465 to 0.0465 in both x and y.
           
           Object ID 5 has size 0.0989x0.0989. To avoid collision, its center needs to be sufficiently far from (0,0). The minimum distance for the centers of two axis-aligned squares of sizes s1 and s2 to not overlap is (s1/2 + s2/2). In this case, (0.0929/2 + 0.0989/2) = 0.04645 + 0.04945 = 0.0959. So the center of object 5 must be at least 0.0959 units away from the origin in both x and y directions to avoid collision with object 4, if considering their bounding boxes as a whole. However, I can also consider placements where they touch but do not overlap, which would allow placements with centers closer than this. A more accurate non-collision criterion for axis-aligned squares is that `abs(center_x1 - center_x2) > (s1_x/2 + s2_x/2)` OR `abs(center_y1 - center_y2) > (s1_y/2 + s2_y/2)`. For two squares, this means that their bounding boxes must not overlap.
           
           Let's try placing object 5 at various positions on the surface, ensuring they are far enough from (0,0) to not collide with object 4. The available surface for object 5 ranges from -0.135 to 0.135 in x and y. If object 5 is centered at (x,y), its AABB spans `(x - 0.0989/2, y - 0.0989/2)` to `(x + 0.0989/2, y + 0.0989/2)`, which is roughly `(x - 0.0495, y - 0.0495)` to `(x + 0.0495, y + 0.0495)`.
           For object 5 to be fully on the surface, its center (x,y) must satisfy:
           `-0.135 + 0.0495 <= x <= 0.135 - 0.0495`
           `-0.0855 <= x <= 0.0855`
           And similarly for y.
           
           So the valid region for the center of object 5 is `[-0.0855, 0.0855]` in both x and y.
           Object 4 is at `(0, 0, 0)`. Its AABB is `(-0.046455, -0.046455)` to `(0.046455, 0.046455)`.
           To avoid collision, the AABB of object 5, `(x_c - 0.04949, y_c - 0.04949)` to `(x_c + 0.04949, y_c + 0.04949)`, must not overlap with object 4's AABB.
           This means either `x_c - 0.04949 > 0.046455` (i.e., `x_c > 0.095945`) or `x_c + 0.04949 < -0.046455` (i.e., `x_c < -0.095945`), OR
           `y_c - 0.04949 > 0.046455` (i.e., `y_c > 0.095945`) or `y_c + 0.04949 < -0.046455` (i.e., `y_c < -0.095945`).
           
           However, the valid range for the center of object 5 is `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`. This means that if object 4 is placed at the origin, there is no valid placement for object 5 on surface 0 that does not collide with object 4. This is an important geometric constraint to recognize.
           
           Let's re-evaluate. The problem states "if you receive a second request for the same object and set of surfaces, it may be because the previous placement collided with some non-fixed obstacle, which you must use to learn about the geometry of the scene." Here, the request is for a *new* object ID (ID 5), but object ID 4 has *already been successfully placed*. This means object ID 4 is now a fixed obstacle in the scene at (0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
           
           My calculation shows that the object 5 is too large to fit on surface 0 without colliding with object 4. The maximum x-coordinate for object 5's center to be on the surface is 0.0855. But to avoid collision with object 4, x_c must be greater than 0.095945 or less than -0.095945. These ranges do not overlap. This means that no placement for object 5 is possible on Surface 0 without colliding with object 4.
           
           I need to find a placement. This implies there must be a placement. Perhaps my interpretation of "fixed obstacle" is wrong, or I'm missing something. What if the previously placed objects are not fixed obstacles for *all* subsequent placements but only for *the same object ID*? The prompt says: "If you have already placed an object with ID i, then when given a request for an object with ID j you must avoid collision between objects i and j." This explicitly means object 4 is a fixed obstacle for object 5.
           
           Let me double-check the bounds.
           Surface 0: `(-0.135, -0.135)` to `(0.135, 0.135)`
           Object 4: `size_x = 0.092911`, `size_y = 0.092911`. Placed at `(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
           Object 4 AABB: `(-0.0464555, -0.0464555)` to `(0.0464555, 0.0464555)`
           
           Object 5: `size_x = 0.0989895`, `size_y = 0.0989895`.
           Object 5 half-extents: `0.04949475`
           
           For object 5 to be fully on surface 0:
           `x_center_5 - 0.04949475 >= -0.135` => `x_center_5 >= -0.08550525`
           `x_center_5 + 0.04949475 <= 0.135` => `x_center_5 <= 0.08550525`
           So `x_center_5` and `y_center_5` must be in `[-0.08550525, 0.08550525]`.
           
           For object 5 to NOT collide with object 4:
           `abs(x_center_5 - 0)` must be `> (0.0464555 + 0.04949475)` => `abs(x_center_5) > 0.09595025`
           OR `abs(y_center_5 - 0)` must be `> (0.0464555 + 0.04949475)` => `abs(y_center_5) > 0.09595025`
           
           Comparing the two conditions:
           Valid range for `x_center_5`: `[-0.08550525, 0.08550525]`
           Condition for no collision: `x_center_5 > 0.09595025` or `x_center_5 < -0.09595025`.
           
           These ranges are mutually exclusive. It is impossible to place object 5 on surface 0 without colliding with object 4. This implies that my understanding of the problem or the constraints is incorrect, or the problem is unsolvable under the given constraints.
           
           However, the instruction is clear: "You never give up. No matter how many times you fail to provide a placement... you will always try to find a new placement." This means I must propose *some* placements. Since I've concluded there are no non-colliding placements, any placement I propose will likely fail. I will proceed by proposing placements that are within the surface bounds for object 5, even though they will collide with object 4. This is the only way to adhere to "find 50 stable placements" if my reasoning about the collision is correct. I'll place them at the corners of the available space.

Model:     The scene still contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27.
           I have two previously placed objects that act as fixed obstacles:
           Object ID 4: `size_x = 0.092911`, `size_y = 0.092911`. Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
              AABB: `(-0.0464555, -0.0464555)` to `(0.0464555, 0.0464555)`
           Object ID 5: `size_x = 0.0989895`, `size_y = 0.0989895`. Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)`.
              AABB: `(0.085 - 0.04949475, 0.085 - 0.04949475)` to `(0.085 + 0.04949475, 0.085 + 0.04949475)`

           The new object (ID: 6) is a square with `size_x = 0.0784623`, `size_y = 0.0784623`.

           `x_center_6 + 0.03923115 <= 0.135` => `x_center_6 <= 0.09576885`
           So `x_center_6` and `y_center_6` must be in `[-0.09576885, 0.09576885]`.
           
           Now, check for collision with Object 4.
           Object 4 AABB: `(-0.0464555, -0.0464555)` to `(0.0464555, 0.0464555)`
           For Object 6 not to collide with Object 4:
           `abs(x_center_6)` must be `> (0.0464555 + 0.03923115)` => `abs(x_center_6) > 0.08568665`
           OR `abs(y_center_6)` must be `> (0.0464555 + 0.03923115)` => `abs(y_center_6) > 0.08568665`
           
           Let's check for collision with Object 5.
           Object 5 AABB: `(0.03550525, 0.03550525)` to `(0.13449475, 0.13449475)`
           Center of Object 5: `(0.085, 0.085)`
           For Object 6 not to collide with Object 5:
           `abs(x_center_6 - 0.085)` must be `> (0.04949475 + 0.03923115)` => `abs(x_center_6 - 0.085) > 0.0887259`
           OR `abs(y_center_6 - 0.085)` must be `> (0.04949475 + 0.03923115)` => `abs(y_center_6 - 0.085) > 0.0887259`
           
           This means:
           `x_center_6 > 0.085 + 0.0887259 = 0.1737259` OR `x_center_6 < 0.085 - 0.0887259 = -0.0037259`
           `y_center_6 > 0.085 + 0.0887259 = 0.1737259` OR `y_center_6 < 0.085 - 0.0887259 = -0.0037259`
           
           Combined valid range for center of Object 6: `[-0.09576885, 0.09576885]` for both x and y.
           
           Let's try to find a placement.
           Consider the top-left quadrant of the surface.
           A candidate point that satisfies the Object 4 no-collision condition (e.g., `x_center_6 < -0.08568665` or `y_center_6 < -0.08568665`).
           Let's try a point like `(-0.09, 0.0)`.
           Is `(-0.09, 0.0)` within `[-0.09576885, 0.09576885]`? Yes.
           Does `(-0.09, 0.0)` collide with Object 4?
           `abs(-0.09) > 0.08568665`. Yes, `0.09 > 0.08568665`. So no collision with Object 4.
           
           Does `(-0.09, 0.0)` collide with Object 5?
           `x_center_6 = -0.09`. `y_center_6 = 0.0`.
           Condition for no collision with Object 5:
           `x_center_6 < -0.0037259` (i.e. `-0.09 < -0.0037259`). Yes.
           So no collision with Object 5 either.
           
           This means `(-0.09, 0.0)` is a potentially stable placement! I will try to generate placements around this idea, as well as some in other corners that respect the existing objects.
           
           Other potential areas:
           - `(x < -0.08568665, y)`: (Far left side)
             - Example: `x = -0.09`. Valid `y` range for `x=-0.09` is `[-0.09576885, 0.09576885]`.
             - Check collision with Object 5: `x_center_6 = -0.09` satisfies `x_center_6 < -0.0037259`.
             - So, for `x = -0.09`, any `y` in `[-0.09576885, 0.09576885]` will not collide with Object 5 *on the X axis*.
             - For the Y axis, if `y_center_6` is in `[-0.0037259, 0.1737259]` (derived from `abs(y_center_6 - 0.085) > 0.0887259`), it might collide.
             - So, for `x = -0.09`, to avoid collision with Object 5, `y_center_6` must be `> 0.1737259` OR `y_center_6 < -0.0037259`.
             - Since the valid `y` range for object 6 is `[-0.09576885, 0.09576885]`, the only valid `y` range that satisfies collision avoidance with object 5 (for `x = -0.09`) is `[-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
           
           This is getting complex, let's list the safe regions.
           Overall available center box for Object 6: `C = [-0.09576885, 0.09576885] x [-0.09576885, 0.09576885]`
           
           Collision zone with Object 4 (a square around origin):
           `x in [-0.08568665, 0.08568665]` AND `y in [-0.08568665, 0.08568665]`
           
           Collision zone with Object 5 (a square around (0.085, 0.085)):
           `x in [-0.0037259, 0.1737259]` AND `y in [-0.0037259, 0.1737259]` (clamped to surface boundaries)
           Since `0.1737259` is outside the overall available center box C, the clamped collision zone for Object 5 becomes `x in [-0.0037259, 0.09576885]` AND `y in [-0.0037259, 0.09576885]`.
           
           So, for object 6:
           Its center (x,y) must be in `C`.
           It must NOT be in the Object 4 collision zone.
           It must NOT be in the Object 5 collision zone.
           
           Let's find regions in C that are NOT in these collision zones:
           1.  `x_center_6 < -0.08568665`: This avoids Object 4.
               The range is `[-0.09576885, -0.08568665)`.
               For any `x` in this range, we need to check collision with Object 5.
               If `x` is in this range, it's already less than `-0.0037259`, so no collision with Object 5 on x-axis.
               So, for `x` in `[-0.09576885, -0.08568665)`, any `y` in `C` that avoids Object 5's y-collision range `[-0.0037259, 0.09576885]` will work.
               So, `y` must be in `[-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
               This gives a safe region: `x in [-0.09576885, -0.08568665)` AND `y in [-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
               Example: `(-0.09, -0.01)`.
           
           2.  `y_center_6 < -0.08568665`: This avoids Object 4.
               The range is `[-0.09576885, -0.08568665)`.
               For any `y` in this range, we need to check collision with Object 5.
               If `y` is in this range, it's already less than `-0.0037259`, so no collision with Object 5 on y-axis.
               So, for `y` in `[-0.09576885, -0.08568665)`, any `x` in `C` that avoids Object 5's x-collision range `[-0.0037259, 0.09576885]` will work.
               So, `x` must be in `[-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
               This gives a safe region: `y in [-0.09576885, -0.08568665)` AND `x in [-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
               Example: `(-0.01, -0.09)`.
           
           3.  `x_center_6 > 0.08568665`: This avoids Object 4.
               The range is `(0.08568665, 0.09576885]`.
               For any `x` in this range, it falls within Object 5's collision x-range `[-0.0037259, 0.09576885]`.
               So, to avoid collision with Object 5, `y` must be outside `[-0.0037259, 0.09576885]`.
               This means `y` must be `y < -0.0037259` (no `y > 0.09576885` is possible within C).
               So, `x in (0.08568665, 0.09576885]` AND `y in [-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
               Example: `(0.09, -0.01)`.
           
           4.  `y_center_6 > 0.08568665`: This avoids Object 4.
               The range is `(0.08568665, 0.09576885]`.
               For any `y` in this range, it falls within Object 5's collision y-range `[-0.0037259, 0.09576885]`.
               So, to avoid collision with Object 5, `x` must be outside `[-0.0037259, 0.09576885]`.
               This means `x` must be `x < -0.0037259` (no `x > 0.09576885` is possible within C).
               So, `y in (0.08568665, 0.09576885]` AND `x in [-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
               Example: `(-0.01, 0.09)`.
           
           It seems there are several small regions where object 6 can be placed. I will use the corners of these regions and some points inside them.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene contains a single square surface centered at the origin, with dimensions 0.27x0.27.
           I have three previously placed objects that act as fixed obstacles:
           Object ID 4: `size_x = 0.092911`, `size_y = 0.092911`. Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`.
              AABB: `(-0.0464555, -0.0464555)` to `(0.0464555, 0.0464555)`
           Object ID 5: `size_x = 0.0989895`, `size_y = 0.0989895`. Placed at `(0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085)`.
              AABB: `(0.03550525, 0.03550525)` to `(0.13449475, 0.13449475)`
           Object ID 6: `size_x = 0.0784623`, `size_y = 0.0784623`. Placed at `(0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.01)`.
              AABB: `(-0.09 - 0.03923115, -0.01 - 0.03923115)` to `(-0.09 + 0.03923115, -0.01 + 0.03923115)`
              AABB: `(-0.12923115, -0.04923115)` to `(-0.05076885, 0.02923115)`
           
           The new object (ID: 7) is a square with `size_x = 0.09897545`, `size_y = 0.09897545`.
           Object 7 half-extents: `0.049487725`.
           
           For object 7 to be fully on surface 0:
           `x_center_7 - 0.049487725 >= -0.135` => `x_center_7 >= -0.085512275`
           `x_center_7 + 0.049487725 <= 0.135` => `x_center_7 <= 0.085512275`
           So `x_center_7` and `y_center_7` must be in `C = [-0.085512275, 0.085512275]`.
           
           Now, check for collision with Object 4 (center (0,0), half-extents 0.0464555).
           Collision if `abs(x_center_7) <= (0.0464555 + 0.049487725) = 0.095943225` AND `abs(y_center_7) <= 0.095943225`.
           So, to avoid collision with Object 4, `abs(x_center_7) > 0.095943225` OR `abs(y_center_7) > 0.095943225`.
           However, the available range for x and y center of Object 7 is `[-0.085512275, 0.085512275]`. This means `abs(x_center_7)` and `abs(y_center_7)` can never be `> 0.095943225`.
           This implies that *any* placement of Object 7 on the surface will collide with Object 4. This is similar to the situation with Object 5.
           
           This result from the calculations suggests it's impossible. However, the system provided a successful placement for Object 5 which also should have collided with Object 4 according to my previous calculations (center of 5 at (0.085, 0.085) and center of 4 at (0,0) - both were within their respective collision zones by my calculations).
           The previous Object 5 placement was: `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085`.
           Object 4's AABB: `(-0.0464555, -0.0464555)` to `(0.0464555, 0.0464555)`
           Object 5's AABB: `(0.03550525, 0.03550525)` to `(0.13449475, 0.13449475)`
           These two AABBs definitely overlap.
           The `(0.03550525, 0.03550525)` corner of Object 5 is inside Object 4's positive quadrant. And the `(0.0464555, 0.0464555)` corner of Object 4 is inside Object 5's negative quadrant.
           
           This discrepancy indicates that my interpretation of "collision" or "stable placement" might be slightly off from the underlying simulation or validation. Or it might be a subtle nuance of how AABBs are used for collision, perhaps a small margin, or if they are allowed to just touch. If they are allowed to just touch, then `abs(center_x1 - center_x2) >= (s1_x/2 + s2_x/2)` is the condition.
           Let's re-calculate using `>=` for non-collision:
           For Object 7 not to collide with Object 4:
           `abs(x_center_7) >= 0.095943225` OR `abs(y_center_7) >= 0.095943225`.
           Still, the maximum `abs(x_center_7)` possible is `0.085512275`. So even with 'just touching', it's impossible to avoid collision with Object 4 with my current understanding.
           
           The only way for the system to have found successful placements in the past that my calculations flagged as collisions is if my collision detection logic is stricter than the actual simulation.
           One possibility: the objects are cylinders and the AABB is just a rough representation, or the collision detection uses a different shape. But the problem states "geometry of the object will be described in terms of the x and y dimensions of its axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)".
           
           Let's assume there's a small epsilon, or the check allows for a tiny overlap. Or, maybe my calculation of the available center range is slightly off.
           `upper_x = 0.135`, `lower_x = -0.135`. `size_x = 0.09897545`. `half_size_x = 0.049487725`.
           Max center x: `0.135 - 0.049487725 = 0.085512275`.
           Min center x: `-0.135 + 0.049487725 = -0.085512275`.
           So the range `[-0.085512275, 0.085512275]` for the center is correct.
           
           Let's reconsider the successful placements provided by the system.
           (ID: 4) at (0,0). (ID: 5) at (0.085, 0.085).
           My collision calculation for ID 4 and ID 5:
           Dist needed for non-overlap: `(0.092911/2) + (0.0989895/2) = 0.0464555 + 0.04949475 = 0.09595025`.
           Center of ID 4 is `(0,0)`. Center of ID 5 is `(0.085, 0.085)`.
           `abs(0.085 - 0) = 0.085`. This is `< 0.09595025`.
           So there *is* an overlap in X and Y axes between ID 4 and ID 5 using strict AABB collision.
           The only way `(0.085, 0.085)` for ID 5 is stable and non-colliding with ID 4 is if the collision checking is not strict AABB intersection. It's possible that the validation only checks one axis at a time, or requires *both* axis overlaps for collision. Or, more likely, there's a tolerance.
           
           Given that the system has accepted placements that my AABB math says overlap, I will assume a relaxed collision check or some other mechanism. I will try to place Object 7 in locations that are geometrically "near" the boundary but might have some tolerance to make them valid. I will aim for positions outside the previous objects' centers but within the surface boundaries, trying to fill the remaining space.
           
           Let's try to place Object 7 in the corner where Object 5 is not, and Object 6 is not.
           The surface's available corners for its center are roughly `(+-0.085, +-0.085)`.
           Object 4 is at `(0,0)`.
           Object 5 is at `(0.085, 0.085)`.
           Object 6 is at `(-0.09, -0.01)`. Its AABB covers `(-0.129, -0.049)` to `(-0.05, 0.029)`.
           
           Let's look at the remaining "open" corner area.
           There's the top-right corner `(0.085, 0.085)` already occupied by Object 5.
           There's the bottom-left corner `(-0.085, -0.085)`. Object 6 is centered at `(-0.09, -0.01)`.
           Object 6 AABB: `x in [-0.129, -0.05]` and `y in [-0.049, 0.029]`.
           So `(-0.085, -0.085)` is potentially free from Object 6. Let's check:
           Collision with Object 4: `(0.085, 0.085)` for ID 5 was considered valid. The size of Object 7 is very similar to Object 5. So, if `(0.085, 0.085)` was valid for Object 5 relative to Object 4, then `(-0.085, -0.085)` should be valid for Object 7 relative to Object 4.
           Collision with Object 5: Object 5 is at `(0.085, 0.085)`. Object 7 at `(-0.085, -0.085)`. These are far apart, clearly no collision.
           Collision with Object 6: Object 6 is at `(-0.09, -0.01)`. Object 7 at `(-0.085, -0.085)`.
             Center distance: `dx = -0.085 - (-0.09) = 0.005`. `dy = -0.085 - (-0.01) = -0.075`.
             Half-extents: Object 6: `0.03923115`. Object 7: `0.049487725`.
             Sum of half-extents x: `0.03923115 + 0.049487725 = 0.088718875`.
             Sum of half-extents y: `0.03923115 + 0.049487725 = 0.088718875`.
             `abs(dx) = 0.005`. This is less than `0.088718875`.
             `abs(dy) = 0.075`. This is less than `0.088718875`.
             So, `(-0.085, -0.085)` for Object 7 *would* collide with Object 6 by strict AABB.
           
           This is very confusing. The past accepted placements contradict strict AABB collision.
           I will follow the lead of the accepted placements. The placement of ID 5 at (0.085, 0.085) and ID 4 at (0,0) was accepted, despite their AABBs clearly overlapping. This suggests that the collision detection has a margin, or there is a specific rule. The most probable explanation is that if objects' *centers* are sufficiently far apart, they are considered non-colliding. Or there's a minimum overlap threshold.
           
           Let's assume the problem's implicit rule is that if object A's center `(cx_A, cy_A)` and object B's center `(cx_B, cy_B)` satisfy `abs(cx_A - cx_B) >= min_dist_x` AND `abs(cy_A - cy_B) >= min_dist_y`, they are considered non-colliding. However, that's not how AABB collision works. For AABB collision, it's `abs(cx_A - cx_B) >= min_dist_x` OR `abs(cy_A - cy_B) >= min_dist_y` to *not* collide. If it was AND, then any placement that my previous calculations said collide would be valid!
           
           Let's re-examine `(ID: 4) -- 0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0` and `(ID: 5) -- 0, 0.0, 0.085, 0.085`.
           Object 4 `x_half = 0.0464555`. Object 5 `x_half = 0.04949475`.
           Sum of half-extents: `0.09595025`.
           `abs(0.085 - 0) = 0.085`. This is `LESS` than `0.09595025`. So they collide.
           The fact that this was accepted implies there is a tolerance or a different collision rule.
           
           I must keep trying. The object is roughly the same size as object 5, and object 5 was placed in a corner. I'll try the other "available" corners.
           Let's try `(-0.085, 0.085)`.
           Object 7 center: `(-0.085, 0.085)`.
           1.  Collision with Object 4 (center (0,0)):
               `x_dist = abs(-0.085 - 0) = 0.085`. `y_dist = abs(0.085 - 0) = 0.085`.
               Sum of half-extents for Object 7 and Object 4: `0.049487725 + 0.0464555 = 0.095943225`.
               Since `0.085 < 0.095943225`, this would normally indicate a collision. But `(0.085, 0.085)` for ID 5 passed, so maybe `(-0.085, 0.085)` for ID 7 will too.
           
           2.  Collision with Object 5 (center (0.085, 0.085)):
               `x_dist = abs(-0.085 - 0.085) = 0.17`. `y_dist = abs(0.085 - 0.085) = 0`.
               Sum of half-extents for Object 7 and Object 5: `0.049487725 + 0.04949475 = 0.098982475`.
               `0.17 > 0.098982475`. So they don't collide on the X axis. This should be a non-collision based on AABB.
           
           3.  Collision with Object 6 (center (-0.09, -0.01)):
               `x_dist = abs(-0.085 - (-0.09)) = 0.005`. `y_dist = abs(0.085 - (-0.01)) = 0.095`.
               Sum of half-extents for Object 7 and Object 6: `0.049487725 + 0.03923115 = 0.088718875`.
               `0.005 < 0.088718875` (x collision).
               `0.095 > 0.088718875` (y no collision).
               Since `0.005 < 0.088718875`, this would be an X-axis overlap, which means collision.
               This would imply `(-0.085, 0.085)` is a collision.
           
           Given the ambiguity, I'm going to follow the pattern of accepted placements. If (0.085, 0.085) worked for Object 5 (similar size to Object 7) despite my calculation of collision with Object 4, then symmetric placements (e.g. `(-0.085, -0.085)` or `(-0.085, 0.085)`) might also work for Object 7 *relative to Object 4*.
           The collision with Object 6 and Object 7 at `(-0.085, 0.085)` is also likely.
           
           I will try `(0.085, -0.085)`.
           1.  Collision with Object 4 (center (0,0)):
               `x_dist = abs(0.085 - 0) = 0.085`. `y_dist = abs(-0.085 - 0) = 0.085`.
               Sum of half-extents for Object 7 and Object 4: `0.095943225`.
               `0.085 < 0.095943225`, so likely to pass if previous placements did.
           
           2.  Collision with Object 5 (center (0.085, 0.085)):
               `x_dist = abs(0.085 - 0.085) = 0`. `y_dist = abs(-0.085 - 0.085) = 0.17`.
               Sum of half-extents for Object 7 and Object 5: `0.098982475`.
               `0 < 0.098982475` (x collision).
               `0.17 > 0.098982475` (y no collision).
               This implies an X-axis overlap, so collision.
           
           This is proving very difficult without knowing the exact collision rule. I will pick locations that are as far as possible from existing objects but still within the surface bounds.
           
           Let's try to place Object 7 in the "top-left" corner as far as possible. `x_center = -0.085`, `y_center = 0.085`.
           The previous success for ID 6 was `(0, 0.0, -0.09, -0.01)`. This meant placing an object whose center was at -0.09 could fit. For object 7, max x center is `0.0855`. Min x center is `-0.0855`.
           So, I will place object 7 in some positions in the free areas, hoping for success. Since the prior valid placements suggest there is some allowance for overlap or that the geometry is more complex than simple AABB, I will assume that near-boundary placements are preferred and that if one axis is clear, it might be enough.
           
           My previous reasoning for ID 6 found safe regions like `x in [-0.09576885, -0.08568665)` AND `y in [-0.09576885, -0.0037259)`.
           This was for ID 6, which is smaller.
           Object 7 is roughly same size as Object 5.
           Given that (0.085, 0.085) was valid for Object 5, I will try other "extreme" positions within the surface for Object 7, hoping the collision logic is consistent.
           Let's use `(-0.085, 0.085)` and `(0.085, -0.085)` (assuming these work like (0.085, 0.085)).
           Then I will try to place it along the edges, far from existing objects.
           For instance, the space around the middle of the left edge `x=-0.085`.
           Available `y` range for `x=-0.085` is `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`.
           Collision with Object 6 at `(-0.09, -0.01)`:
           If `x_center_7 = -0.085`, `x_dist = 0.005`. Collision if `0.005 < 0.0887`. This means x-axis overlaps.
           So the y-axis must separate them: `abs(y_center_7 - (-0.01)) >= 0.0887`.
           `y_center_7 + 0.01 >= 0.0887` => `y_center_7 >= 0.0787`
           OR `y_center_7 + 0.01 <= -0.0887` => `y_center_7 <= -0.0987` (this is outside surface bounds).
           So, if `x_center_7 = -0.085`, then `y_center_7` must be `[0.0787, 0.0855]`.
           This is a small strip on the top left. `(-0.085, 0.079)`
           
           Now, check this potential placement `(-0.085, 0.079)`:
           1.  On surface? Yes, `(-0.085, 0.079)` is in `[-0.0855, 0.0855]`.
           2.  Collision with Object 4: `(0,0)`. Dist `(0.085, 0.079)`. Sum half extents `0.0959`. `0.085 < 0.0959` and `0.079 < 0.0959`. This would collide by strict AABB. But given accepted precedents, it might pass.
           3.  Collision with Object 5: `(0.085, 0.085)`. Dist `(0.17, 0.006)`. Sum half extents `0.0989`. `0.17 > 0.0989` (x no-collision). `0.006 < 0.0989` (y collision). So it would collide.
           
           This is very tough. I will generate diverse placements in regions that seem relatively open, based on the *successful* placements rather than my AABB calculations for collision. The successes imply a more forgiving collision check or a different understanding of collision.
           
           Since the placements of ID 4 at (0,0) and ID 5 at (0.085, 0.085) are successful, it suggests that objects can be placed very close to each other. Object 6 is at (-0.09, -0.01).
           The areas least likely to be immediately "covered" by multiple objects are probably the corners that don't have object 5 and the other side of object 6.
           So let's try the other available edge/corner spots:
           `(-0.085, 0.085)` - top left
           `(-0.085, -0.085)` - bottom left (but object 6 is close)
           `(0.085, -0.085)` - bottom right
           
           I'm going to provide placements in these regions, trying to fill the remaining "voids". I'll use 0 for theta as it's a square.
