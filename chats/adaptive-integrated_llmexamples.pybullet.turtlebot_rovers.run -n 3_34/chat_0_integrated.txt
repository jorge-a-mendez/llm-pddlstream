           Object v13 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (1.0, -1.75, 3.142).

           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

Model:     The problem asks to achieve the goal `new-axiom@0()`, which is an axiom with a complex conjunction of predicates. Let's break down `new-axiom@0()` into its constituent parts:
           1. `atconf(v12, v13)`: This is true in the initial state.
           2. `atconf(v14, v15)`: This is true in the initial state.
           3. `free(v12, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           4. `free(v14, v16)`: This is true in the initial state.
           5. `receivedimage(v17, v11)`: This means an image of objective `v17` in mode `v11` has been received by the lander.
           6. `receivedimage(v18, v11)`: This means an image of objective `v18` in mode `v11` has been received by the lander.
           7. `receivedimage(v19, v11)`: This means an image of objective `v19` in mode `v11` has been received by the lander.
           8. `type(?stone, v2)`: This is a type predicate, but the goal only requires `receivedanalysis(?stone)`. The `type` predicates like `type(v1, v2)` and `type(v4, v2)` are already in the initial state.
           9. `receivedanalysis(?stone)`: This means a rock of type `v2` (stone) has been analyzed and the analysis received.
           10. `type(?soil, v6)`: Similar to `?stone`, `type(v7, v6)`, `type(v8, v6)`, and `type(v5, v6)` are in the initial state.
           11. `receivedanalysis(?soil)`: This means a rock of type `v6` (soil) has been analyzed and the analysis received.
           
           The available actions only include `move` and `drop_rock`.
           - `move` actions are `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)` and `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`. These actions essentially move the rover from a configuration to the same configuration using a trajectory. They do not change the `atconf` state if executed.
           - `drop_rock` actions are `(drop_rock v12 v16)` and `(drop_rock v14 v16)`. These actions require `full` storage and result in `free` storage. Both `v12` and `v14` have `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)` in the initial state, so these actions are not currently applicable unless storage becomes `full`.
           
           The crucial observation is that no actions are available to:
           - `take_image`: This action is needed to create `haveimage` facts, which are a precondition for `send_image`.
           - `send_image`: This action is needed to create `receivedimage` facts for objectives `v17`, `v18`, and `v19`.
           - `sample_rock`: This action is needed to create `analyzed` facts for rocks.
           - `send_analysis`: This action is needed to create `receivedanalysis` facts for rocks.
           - `calibrate`: This action is needed before `take_image`.
           
           Since none of the actions required to achieve `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` are available in the list of valid action instances, it is impossible to satisfy the goal. The goal specifically requires these predicates to be true, and the robot currently has no way to achieve them. The given allowed actions are `move` and `drop_rock`. Neither of these actions can produce `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           --Plan--:
           ; The goal is not achievable because there are no available actions to `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, which are necessary to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `; The goal is not achievable because there are no available actions to `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, which are necessary to satisfy the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates in the goal.)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

Model:     The problem requires achieving the `new-axiom@0()` goal. As established in the previous attempt, this axiom requires several `receivedimage` predicates for objectives `v17`, `v18`, `v19` and `receivedanalysis` predicates for rocks of type `v2` (stone) and `v6` (soil).
           
           The initial state provides:
           - `atconf(v12, v13)` and `atconf(v14, v15)`
           - `free(v12, v16)` and `free(v14, v16)`
           - Information about rocks (`v1`, `v3`, `v4`, `v5`, `v7`, `v8`) and objectives (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`).
           - `onboard(v10, v12)` and `onboard(v10, v14)` (camera `v10` on both rovers)
           - `supports(v10, v11)` (camera supports mode `v11`)
           - `lander(v9)`
           
           The available actions are:
           1. `(move v12 v13 #o2 v13)`: Rover `v12` moves from configuration `v13` to `v13`. This action is a no-op in terms of changing the configuration, but it's a valid action if executed.
           2. `(move v14 v15 #o2 v15)`: Rover `v14` moves from configuration `v15` to `v15`. Similar to the above, a no-op configuration change.
           3. `(drop_rock v12 v16)`: Rover `v12` drops a rock from store `v16`. Precondition: `full(v12, v16)`. Current state: `free(v12, v16)`. This action is not applicable.
           4. `(drop_rock v14 v16)`: Rover `v14` drops a rock from store `v16`. Precondition: `full(v14, v16)`. Current state: `free(v14, v16)`. This action is not applicable.
           
           None of the provided actions can achieve the `receivedimage` or `receivedanalysis` goals. These predicates require `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis` actions, none of which are in the list of valid actions. Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy the goal given the allowed actions.
           
           Since the problem explicitly states that "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" and "If the goal is not achievable from the initial state, in which case you should not return any plan and simply explain why the goal is not achievable", I must conclude that the goal is not achievable.
           
           The goal cannot be achieved with the provided limited set of actions.
           
           The goal `new-axiom@0()` requires `receivedimage` for multiple objectives and `receivedanalysis` for different rock types. The available actions are only `move` (which effectively does not change rover configurations in this case) and `drop_rock` (which is not applicable as both rovers have free storage). There are no actions available to `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, or `send_analysis`, which are necessary to produce the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts. Therefore, the goal is unreachable.
