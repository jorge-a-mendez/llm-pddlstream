User:      Here is a list of objects present in this scene for this task:

           Some of the objects represent continuous values that have already been computed. In particular:
           Object v5 is an arm configuration with joint values (0.393, 0.333, 0.0, -1.522, 2.722, -1.219, -2.989).
           Object v9 is a pose with position (4.5, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v12 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.454, -0.6), (-4.358, -0.504)).
           Object v15 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.315, 0.265), (4.385, 0.335)).
           Object v13 is a pose with position (-4.406, -0.552, 0.801) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.268, 0.963).
           Object v7 is an arm configuration with joint values (-2.135, 1.296, -3.75, -0.15, -10000.0, -0.1, -10000.0).
           Object v16 is a pose with position (4.35, 0.3, 0.8) and quaternion (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0).
           Object v18 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0)).
           Object v3 is a base configuration with (x, y, theta) = (2.5, 0.0, 0.0).
           Object v11 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.6)).
           Object v8 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((4.465, 0.265), (4.535, 0.335)).
           Object v14 is an object with axis aligned bounding box (AABB = ((minx, miny), (maxx, maxy))): ((-4.8, -0.6), (-4.2, 0.6)).
           
           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **The Path to New Axiom**
           
           My primary goal is to achieve the state described by `(new-axiom@0)`, specifically making `(on ?green v18)` and `(type ?green v17)` true. After analyzing the provided axioms, I understand that I need to find an object, which I'll call `?green`, that satisfies both these conditions. From the initial state and available objects, I can see that `v12` and `v8` are candidates because they both have `type(v12, v17)` and `type(v8, v17)`.
           
           The crucial part is to satisfy `(on ?green v18)`.  This requires ensuring that `?green` is both supported by a surface and at the correct position. I found that `v18` is a likely surface and the goal requires placement of `?green` *on* `v18`. From the initial state, the key information is that `supported(v8, #o2, v18)` holds and `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` holds. To make `(on v8 v18)` or `(on v12 v18)` true, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)` or `atpose(v12, #o2)` true.
           
           My strategy now is to move either `v8` or `v12` to `#o2`. Since `v8` is already at `atpose(v8, v9)` and my current plan is simplified without any base motion, I'll choose `v8` as my object. I will need to use available arm `v4` to perform a `pick` action to grasp `v8` from pose `v9`, and place to `v18` pose `#o2`.
           
           Examining the action predicates, I determined:
           1.  I have to `pick` object `v8` with arm `v4`,
               - The plan's execution requires using bconf `v3`. The only available `move_base` action instance in the initial state is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`. It is not feasible, nor necessary, to move the robot base.
               - I can `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           2. I `place` it onto the pose `#o2` supported by `v18` with `place(v4, v8, #o2, #o1, v3, #o4)`.
           
           Now, I'll specify a coordinate value for `#o2`. The relevant information includes the AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) of `v18` and `v8`. The ideal location will be at the center of `v18` and top of the `v18` which is at z = 0.8. Thus, I calculate the `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates for the new pose `#o2` and the `(x, y, z, theta)` format is `(4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0)`.
           
           To summarize the plan:
           1.  `pick(v4, v8, v9, #o1, v3, #o4)`
           2.  `place(v4, v8, (4.5, -0.3, 0.8, 0.0), #o1, v3, #o4)`
           
           Following this plan, I'll have successfully achieved the conditions for `(on v8 v18)` and `(type v8, v17)`, thus satisfying the overall goal.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 v3 #o4) , (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 v3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **Analysis of Unreachable Goal with Available Actions**
           
           Okay, so I've been given a new goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which translates to the more concrete goal of having an object of a certain `type` placed `on` a specific `r`.  This `type` constraint means I'm looking at objects `v8` and `v12`.  The target surface is `v18`.
           
           My initial thought was to consider `v8`. The initial state has `supported(v8, #o2, v18)`, which is great.  However, `v8` is currently *at* a different pose, `v9`. To achieve `on(v8, v18)`, I need `atpose(v8, #o2)`.
           
           The only action at my disposal is `move_base`.  After careful consideration, it's clear `move_base` doesn't do anything that modifies an object's pose or interacts with the robot's grasping capabilities. It only moves the robot's base. It's essentially useless for the task at hand. There's no way to manipulate `v8` with the available action.
           
           I then considered `v12`. The reasoning is similar. Although `supported(v12, #o2, v18)` is in the initial state,  `v12` isn't *at* that pose. I need `atpose(v12, #o2)` to succeed. The `move_base` action is still useless here.
           
           I also ruled out other objects that were initially supported by existing surfaces, because they weren't the correct `type`.
           
           The core issue is this:  I need to get *either* `v8` *or* `v12` `on` `v18`. This inevitably requires a robot action that can *pick* an object and *place* it somewhere else. Since these `pick` and `place` actions are not available, this goal is unreachable.  I can't manipulate objects with *just* the `move_base` action. There's no possible plan.
