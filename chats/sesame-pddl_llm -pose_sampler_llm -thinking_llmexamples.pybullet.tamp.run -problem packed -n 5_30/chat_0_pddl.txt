(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 5**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. The task is to find 50 stable placements for an almost-square object (ID 5) on a single square surface (surface 0). The core challenge is ensuring that the object stays within the surface boundaries, regardless of its rotation.
           
           First, I need to understand the constraints. The surface's boundaries are fixed, and I know the object's dimensions (size_x, size_y). To ensure stability, I'll leverage the simple flat surface nature – as long as the object is *fully* within the bounds, it's considered stable. Rotation matters, as it changes the object's effective footprint (AABB).
           
           Given that the object is almost square, varying `theta` (the rotation) is key for exploring different configurations, even though the AABB doesn't change wildly.
           
           Here's the plan:
           
           1. **Calculate the Valid Area**: I need to determine the area on the surface where the object's *center* can be placed. This area is smaller than the surface itself, as the object's AABB cannot extend beyond the edge. The critical angle is `pi/4` because that orientation gives the biggest AABB, making the *valid* area the smallest, so ensuring it will work for any angle.
              - I used `W_pi/4 = (w+h)/sqrt(2)` for the most restrictive boundary calculation.
              - This leads to the most stringent valid area bounds for the center point.
           
           2. **Generate Placements**: I can use a grid strategy for placing the object on the surface.
              - The key is using coordinates that ensure the object is contained at all angles.
              -  I will choose `x` and `y` coordinates to be in a set of five equally spaced points in the valid area.
              - I will apply two thetas, 0 and pi/4.
           
           3.  The final approach gives the needed 50 placements. It is systematic, yet robust for varying orientation on a constrained area. The coordinates are calculated with the most restrictive case.
           
           In essence, I'm defining a smaller safe zone for the center point and populating it with placements at two rotations, ensuring all 50 configurations stay within the surface's boundaries, regardless of the angle, therefore are stable.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request. Object 5 was placed successfully, and now I need to place Object 6, avoiding any collisions. I've been given Object 6's dimensions and the surface it needs to go on, and I'm treating the problem from a geometric and collision detection standpoint.
           
           First, I analyze the surface bounds and the object's dimensions to determine valid placement regions. Object 6 is nearly square, like Object 5. I calculate the bounding box (AABB) of Object 6 for various rotations (0 and pi/4), since object 6 is also square-ish, the bounding box at pi/4 will be largest. Using half the longest dimension of the AABB as the constraining half-extents. Then, I define valid ranges for the center point of the object `(x, y)` based on these calculations, to ensure they remain inside the specified surface.
           
           Now, it's about collision avoidance. I check the bounding box dimensions of Object 5 at its current location, so I know where the object 6 must be placed for collision to be avoided. Since this is an expert level scenario, I'm employing a quick method of checking for collisions with objects of similar shape which is to use the AABB's and check if the AABB's overlap. Given the simplicity of the problem where the two objects are relatively square, I'm choosing a few different rotations.
           
           I need to generate placements that won't collide with Object 5. Given the relatively small size of object 6, a bounding box check is simplest.
           
           I create a 5x5 grid of potential `x` and `y` coordinates for the object's center. I then check these placements for the two rotation options. Based on that, I realize the grid has problems. The most effective way is to pick 50 safe locations that avoid that corner where Object 5 is. Object 5 is located in the bottom-left of the 0 surface, and I'll generate points that are clearly far from object 5.
           I refine the generation of points, generating a 5x5 grid again, but now only on the right half, which will work, since no point will overlap the Object 5's placement. This ensures no collisions.
           
           I'll check all placements to make sure no collisions happen, and then all placement calculations will be verified and stored.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Object Placements**
           
           My primary goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on Surface 0, ensuring no collisions with two existing objects, ID 5 and ID 6. I've broken down the problem into a few critical steps.
           
           First, I established the surface's boundaries and the dimensions of all objects. Object 4 is a square with a known side length.  I carefully calculated the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) dimensions for both existing objects, accounting for their positions. I also calculated object 4's AABB dimensions with rotation.
           
           To ensure stability, I needed to define the valid placement area on Surface 0, factoring in Object 4's maximum AABB dimensions.  I derived that the object's center needs to be within the boundaries.
           
           Next, I defined the "exclusion zones," or the areas occupied by the existing objects. I need to avoid these. I looked at the arrangement of objects, and saw that picking points in the upper half of the surface or further left/right would be a safe choice.
           
           To efficiently find valid placements, I set up a grid for potential object centers (`x` and `y` coordinates) on the surface, ensuring that they fall within the valid placement range. For computational simplicity, I'll only need a small rotation set, such as `theta = 0`, `pi/6`, `pi/4`, `pi/3` and `pi/2`.
           
           By analyzing the placement regions for the existing objects, and setting constraints on the y axis, I determined that any object placement with a y-coordinate greater than 0.0072 would be safe from collisions. To give myself some room and to make sure I don't overlap, I'll use y = 0.03 and y = 0.06 as my y values.
           
           I then picked my x values such that I still have 50 good placements. I have 5 possible x values: `-0.06, -0.03, 0, 0.03, 0.06`, and I can apply two rotations. Then, there will be 10 center points. By combining 5 center points with 5 orientations, I arrive at my total of 50 stable and collision-free object placements on Surface 0, ready to be used.

(Thoughts: **Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**
           
           Alright, I'm tasked with finding 50 stable placements for a new object (ID 7) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with objects 5, 6, and 4. The surface is a simple rectangle defined by `((-0.135, -0.135), (0.135, 0.135))`. I've been provided with the dimensions and placement data (`surf_idx`, `theta`, `x`, `y`) of the existing objects. My initial thought is to calculate the Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABBs) for each object and use those to check for collisions. The new object is nearly square, and I'll need to consider its maximum dimensions when rotated.
           
           **AABB Calculation and Surface Constraints**
           
           I've calculated the AABBs for the existing objects.  Object 5: `[-0.1115, -0.0385] x [-0.1115, -0.0385]`; Object 6: `[-0.0027, 0.0795] x [-0.1179, -0.0357]`; Object 4: `[-0.1029, -0.0170] x [-0.0129, 0.0729]`.  I've also determined the maximum size of the new object, which occurs at a 45-degree rotation (`theta = pi/4`).  This gives me a maximum half-extent of ~0.056.  Therefore, valid center placements for the new object on the surface are: `[-0.0789, 0.0789] x [-0.0789, 0.0789]`.
           
           **Collision Avoidance and Strategy Refinement**
           
           Now, the real challenge is collision avoidance.  I've visualized the occupied space to identify clear areas. Based on that and by examining the object AABBs, I can see that the surface is quite congested, and finding collision-free placements will require a careful strategy.  Initially, I thought about finding a clear region and then trying different angles.
           
           **A More Systematic Approach**
           
           To be more systematic, I've decided to employ a grid-based approach. I'll create a grid of possible center points within the valid surface range. For each grid point, I'll calculate the new object's AABB at different rotation angles (0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2). Then, I'll check if the object's AABB collides with any of the existing objects' AABBs.
           
           **Collision Checking and Grid Adjustment**
           
           I will iterate through each grid point and angle and perform the collision checks.  If a placement is collision-free, I'll store it.  The initial grid and angle set might not yield 50 valid placements. Therefore, I will expand the grid and potentially add rotation steps.
           
           I will try `xc_grid = [-0.07, -0.04, -0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07]` and `yc_grid = [-0.07, -0.04, -0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07]` with angles `thetas = [0.0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2]`. If I don't get sufficient placements, I can expand the grid, fine-tune the filter conditions, and refine my choice of `y_c_vals`. After a failed attempt, I expanded the grid to `[-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` and also increased theta sampling steps.
           
           The final step will involve generating the placements. I'll take a strategic approach to try and find free areas without a lot of overlap.

           I will try `xc_grid = [-0.07, -0.04, -0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07]` and `yc_grid = [-0.07, -0.04, -0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07]` with angles `thetas = [0.0, pi/6, pi/4, pi/3, pi/2]`. If I don't get sufficient placements, I can expand the grid, fine-tune the filter conditions, and refine my choice of `y_c_vals`. After a failed attempt, I expanded the grid to `[-0.09, -0.06, -0.03, 0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09]` and also increased theta sampling steps.
           
           The final step will involve generating the placements. I'll take a strategic approach to try and find free areas without a lot of overlap.
