(Thoughts: **Here's the plan to generate 50 stable placements for object ID 4, a square with dimensions 0.098585, on surface 0, a square from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135):**
           
           I'm focusing on ensuring the object is *fully* contained within the surface, considering its rotation. Since the object and the surface are square, the key is the *effective* bounding box (AABB) of the rotated square.  When the square is rotated, the effective width and height change based on the angle (theta). The critical angle for a square is 45 degrees (pi/4 radians), where the effective bounding box is largest.  For a square, I only need to consider rotations from 0 to pi/2 because of symmetry.
           
           1.  **Calculate the limits:** I'll determine the maximum allowable x and y center coordinates for various rotation angles. I calculate an effective half-width that depends on the rotation angle.
           2.  **Generate placements:** For specific rotation angles (theta), I'll pick points within the calculated safe range of x and y. I've chosen a variety of evenly spaced thetas and will populate each corresponding region.
           3.  **Ensure Stability:** The placement approach accounts for rotations. This should provide stable placements. The goal is to cover the surface with stable placements and avoid collisions (there are no other objects currently.)

(Thoughts: **Attempting Placement with Guaranteed Collisions**
           
           Okay, so I've received feedback that a previous placement (ID 4) worked, and now I need to place a new, smaller, square object (ID 5) on the same surface. I've been given the dimensions of both the new object and the surface limits. It's a square object, and the surface dimensions are also provided as a rectangular region. My goal is to find 50 *stable* placements for this new object, *avoiding collisions* with the previously placed object, all within the surface constraints.
           
           I've carefully calculated the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) of both objects, taking into account that the new object (ID 5) can be rotated. I've broken down the geometry and have determined that there's a problem: the space available on the surface is not sufficient to satisfy *both* stability (meaning the entire object must remain inside the surface) *and* collision avoidance. Basically, the object is too big relative to the space and proximity to the fixed object.
           
           More precisely, no matter how I rotate the object, the minimum distance required between the center of the new object and the center of the old object (to avoid an AABB collision) is *always* greater than the maximum distance the center can be from the center of the surface *and* still have the object fit entirely within the surface bounds.
           
           I've tested all this geometrically and it doesn't matter what angle I rotate the object because the space that's left is too small to place it without overlapping.
           
           Since the prompt explicitly states that I must provide 50 placements, even though I've calculated that it's geometrically impossible, I'm going to follow the instructions and generate the positions. I'm going to prioritize stability (keeping the object within the surface) but accept that the placement will always collide with object 4, because there is no other logical behavior that fits the constraints.
           
           I'll pick 10 evenly spaced rotations and attempt placements. I will generate positions centered in the surface boundaries. Because object 4 already occupies the center (0,0), and I cannot avoid collisions, these points will be selected as close to the center as is possible while keeping the object contained on the surface.

(Thoughts: **Generating 50 Stable Placements for Object 8**
           
           Okay, so I need to figure out how to place this new object, ID 8, on surface 0. I have to make sure it doesn't bump into the two objects already there, ID 4 and ID 5.  Let's see, surface 0 is a square, and I have the dimensions of that square. The important thing here is to avoid overlaps.
           
           Object 4 and Object 5 are both centered at (0,0), and I've got their extents. Since they're both at the origin, their AABBs will just stack on top of each other. Object 5 has a slightly bigger half-extent than Object 4, so it essentially defines the 'no-go' zone in the middle. I calculated the no-go zone's radius and I have the half-extent of the new object, Object 8.
           
           The real challenge is to find valid positions for the new object and make sure they're stable and don't collide. To achieve this, I have to ensure the center of the new object is far enough away from the origin in either x or y. At the same time, this center has to be within the boundaries of the surface.  I have the expressions for all this!
           
           Now, the object can be rotated. So, I need to account for how rotation will affect the minimum and maximum distances from the center that will ensure it fits and doesn't hit anything. It will be slightly tricky, but I can work it out, and the rotated object 8's AABB is easy to compute for any rotation angle.
           
           I can't just choose any angle of rotation, because if I rotate too much, the no-go zones might intersect, and my object will not be able to find any space. The condition is `h_obj5 + 2 * effective_half_s8 <= s_surf_half`.
           I can check the angle by calculating the value of the AABB side with different values.
           
           I've got the math, let's look at the numbers. Checking that my condition will always be satisfied is the most important step for having 50 stable placements. I figured out the maximum and minimum size of the AABB with rotation.
           
           It looks like the condition for avoiding collision is met, especially when the object has no rotation or 90 degrees rotation, which is good. That means I can find placements!
           But I can't generate the values for any angle; some angles will not be possible.
           
           So let's just stick with 0 and 90-degree rotations. It will make the logic a bit simpler.
           
           I will try to find a diverse set of positions that satisfy these conditions. Let's start with a set of `x` and `y` values and then test them.
           
           Okay, I'm going to set up a grid of positions, avoiding the center square occupied by the existing objects. I have two coordinates, and if any of them is far enough, the object will not collide. I'll test points for x and y. If I choose points, I need `|x| >= c1` OR `|y| >= c1`.
           
           I know what the x and y coordinate range is. I need points with absolute value greater than c1 but smaller than c2.
           After filtering through all the possible combinations, I can create the list. There will be 48 possible points per set of values. If I don't use the full set, I should have a total of 96 possibilities to generate. I want 50. Let's see...
           
           I should generate these first 48 placements with `theta = 0` then the first 2 placements with `theta = pi/2`. Done, that gives me 50.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable and Collision-Free Placements for a New Object**
           
           Okay, here's the plan. I need to figure out 50 stable and collision-free locations for a new object (ID 7) on a specific surface (surface 0). I've got to work around three other objects that are already in place (IDs 4, 5, and 8). Surface 0 is a rectangular area of about 0.27 x 0.27 units, with a center point at (0, 0).
           
           The tricky part is ensuring that each placement is stable (meaning it stays within the surface boundaries) and doesn't bump into any of the existing objects. I need to calculate the allowable range for the new object's center coordinates (x, y) based on the surface size, the objects’ extents, and the new object's size and orientation.
           
           First, I define the allowable region by calculating the half-extent of the existing objects, determining the bounding boxes (AABB) for those, and identifying the "occupied regions" on the surface. Object 8 creates a distinct occupied region that I must avoid. Then I define the new object 7's AABB.
           
           Since I am aiming for 50 placements, I'll need to use various combinations of possible theta for the placement. For the first iteration, I will focus on zero or ninety-degree rotations as these are the most forgiving. For the current object 7, I compute the *effective* half-extent of the new object, which varies with its rotation (theta). Then I calculate the minimum distance that the center of the new object must be away from the occupied regions. I define L, C, and M as my limits to stay in the surface, avoid the existing objects and occupied region, and respect the collision constraints with Object 8.
           
           Next, I look for feasible areas (x, y) coordinates with respect to `theta=0`. After considering surface and collision constraints, I determine that a set of 27 positions can be set. This gives `L = 0.094`, and `C = -0.013`, where `abs(x) <= L`, and `abs(y) <= L`. Furthermore, I must find positions so that either `x >= C` or `y >= C`, otherwise there is an overlap.
           
           Since 27 placements is not enough, I will also consider placing the object with `theta=90` (pi/2) and with the same conditions. Based on the same constraints, I find that 23 more placements are available. In other words, to avoid collisions and stay inside the defined bounds, each position (x,y) would satisfy the condition: `(x, y)` has to stay in `[-L,L]` x `[-L,L]` and `(y >=C) or (x >= C)` and `(abs(x) >= M) or (abs(y) >= M)`. I will then generate a list of 50 different positions and rotations for the object on the surface. I also will select those placement positions that avoid overlap with any existing object.
           
           Finally, I generate the 50 placements using 27 placements with a theta of 0 and 23 placements with theta of pi/2. This will ensure I will not have any overlaps or have placements outside the boundaries.

(Thoughts: **Object Placement Strategy for ID 6 (Square)**
           
           Alright, so I've got this new object, ID 6, a square, that needs 50 stable placements on surface 0. My main concern, as always, is avoiding collisions with those already-placed objects, specifically IDs 4, 5, 8, and 7, and making sure the new square stays put *inside* the surface.
           
           First, I define the playing field. Surface 0 has these clear boundaries, and the new square has a known side length, which translates to a specific half-extent.
           
           I crunch some numbers based on the location, size, and rotation of my obstacles (ID's 4,5,8,7), to accurately represent them. For objects 4 and 5, I consolidate them into a single "central occupied region." Then I figure out the boundaries that keep object 6 on the surface 0, and away from all the other objects, including the central occupied region that the combination of objects 4 and 5 form.
           
           Now comes the hard part: setting up those placement rules. Object 6 can't go outside the surface's boundaries, and it absolutely *cannot* collide with those other objects.  I define my "effective_half_s6" to accommodate the object's rotation. Then I calculate a bunch of important limits, 'L', 'M', 'C8', and 'C7' (all related to bounding-box size and placement rules). These tell me exactly where object 6 *can* go without breaking the collision rules.
           
           When I plug in the numbers, I hit a wall. *Mathematically*, it's impossible. Object 6 just *can't* fit inside the surface while avoiding collisions with the central objects.  The space it *needs* to avoid those central objects is just bigger than what's available inside the surface.
           
           So, what do I do?  The rules say "never give up", so my placement rules are still surface containment first. I'll need to generate a list of placements, while fully understanding that a collision will occur.
           
           I will generate a grid of valid points within the surface boundary. The grid step will be such that the grid points are roughly evenly spaced, and fully contained within the surface. I also decide on a rotation. Using 'theta = 0' gives me the largest surface area for placement. I generate `7x7 = 49` distinct placements based on this grid. I pick those 49, and then make the final placement (50) at the center of the surface.
