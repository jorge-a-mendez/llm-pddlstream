(Thoughts: **Placement Strategy for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I need to find 50 stable placements for object ID 5 on surface 0.  I've been given the object's dimensions (`size_x`, `size_y`) and the surface's bounding box.  My first thought is that since I'm the expert here, I can use my knowledge of geometric principles to ensure stability.  I'll start by considering the surface dimensions, which are from (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).  This gives me a width and height of 0.27.
           
           The object's dimensions are almost the same in the x and y directions, making the object nearly square.  I'll simplify things a bit by approximating the size as a constant dimension (`obj_dim`) and using this to determine the required range for the object's center.  I'll call the dimensions `obj_w` and `obj_h`.
           
           Since the object is square, the effective dimensions of its rotated AABB won't change dramatically with different rotation angles (`theta`). To cover a range of orientations, I'll calculate the rotated bounding box's dimensions using the formulas for  `W_rot = obj_w * abs(cos(theta)) + obj_h * abs(sin(theta))` and `H_rot = obj_w * abs(sin(theta)) + obj_h * abs(cos(theta))`.
           
           To find the possible positions, I'll calculate the valid center ranges:  `x_min_center`, `x_max_center`, `y_min_center`, and `y_max_center`. I can place the center anywhere within this calculated range.
           
           My plan is to systematically vary both the orientation and position. I'll use 10 different angles, spaced evenly from 0 to 2π, and for each of these angles, I'll place the object at 5 different positions. The positions will be the center of the valid region, and the four corners of that region.  That will give me my 50 placements. I'll pick `surf_idx = 0` for all placements.
           
           The code will iterate through the angles and calculate the rotation dimensions. For each angle I'll also calculate the center ranges so I can determine the coordinates to place the object on the surface.
           
           To summarize, I'm using geometric analysis of a square, and I'm generating a diverse set of placements to ensure stable placements across a range of orientations.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for Object 7**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to find 50 stable, collision-free placements for object 7 on surface 0, avoiding object 5.
           
           First, I know object 5 is already placed at (0, 0) with a theta of 0, and I have its AABB extents. I'll use this to avoid collisions.
           
           Object 7 is nearly square, with dimensions very close to each other (about 0.0825). Surface 0's bounds are (-0.135, -0.135) to (0.135, 0.135).
           
           My approach is to generate a bunch of candidate placements and then check each one for collisions with object 5. I will rotate object 7 and consider 10 angles for theta, from 0 to 2*pi (with equal spacing, `theta = k * 2 * pi / 10`).
           
           For each angle, I’ll calculate the rotated AABB for object 7. Then, I need to figure out the possible (x, y) coordinates for the object's center, while keeping it inside the surface's bounds. I'll then generate 8 specific candidate center positions for that theta: the four corners of the valid center region, and four midpoints inside each of the four "safe" zones, away from object 5. This will make 8 * 10 = 80 total placements.
           
           The four corner positions are guaranteed to not collide with object 5, because those corners are constrained by the surface bounds and must be sufficiently far away from the center object 5 is positioned. The four midpoints that I will generate are the centers of the "safe zones" away from the object 5 AABB.
           
           For each candidate center, I'll calculate the AABB of object 7 and check if it overlaps with object 5's AABB. I'll use a standard AABB collision check.
           
           If there's no collision, I'll keep that (theta, x, y) placement. I'll keep doing this until I have 50 unique, non-colliding placements. The generated candidate points should give me 50 collision-free placements relatively quickly. This should be a robust and efficient method.

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements**
           
           My goal is to find 50 stable placements for a new square object (ID 4) on surface 0, while avoiding collisions with two existing objects: object 5 and object 7. I'll utilize the AABBs of these objects (which are just 0-rotated bounding boxes given our setup), the dimensions of the surface, and the square dimensions of object 4. Since object 4 can rotate, and surface 0 is a square, I'll calculate the rotated AABB for the given square object.
           
           First, I define the AABBs for the already-placed objects (objects 5 and 7). I calculate the `half_w`, and `half_h` of the bounding boxes, given the object size, and center coordinates. Then, I calculate `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` for the AABB based on the center. Then, I define the Surface's bounds as `surf_min_x, surf_max_x, surf_min_y, surf_max_y`.
           
           Next, I'll iterate through a set of angles (10 angles spaced evenly from 0 to π) and for each angle, calculate the rotated dimensions, effectively the bounding box's dimensions, called `W_rot`, and `H_rot`, for object 4. Since the object is a square, the computation will be simple. Then I'll calculate the valid ranges for the center point of object 4, which is simply `(valid_cx_min, valid_cx_max)`, `(valid_cy_min, valid_cy_max)`, while making sure to stay within the surface limits. 
           
           Next, I need to check for collisions: a given placement `(x, y, theta)` collides with either object 5 or object 7 if the AABBs overlap. So, I will calculate the current object's AABB for the current center and angle. Then, I will iterate through candidate center points. To check for overlap, I'll use the AABB collision check where `obj4_max_x > other_obj_min_x` AND `obj4_min_x < other_obj_max_x` AND `obj4_max_y > other_obj_min_y` AND `obj4_min_y < other_obj_max_y`.
           
           I'll generate 9 candidate points for each angle, using a simple grid inside the valid bounding box. I will check for all collisions with objects 5 and 7. If there is no collision, then that's a valid placement, and I add it to the final result.
           
           Finally, I'll continue generating placements until I have 50 non-colliding placements.

(Thoughts: **Summary of Placement Strategy for New Object (ID 6)**
           
           My task is to find 50 stable placements for a new object, ID 6, on a surface. This surface is a square, and I must consider previously placed objects as fixed obstacles. I know the exact size and position of these obstacles, and I've converted their positions into axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) for efficient collision detection.
           
           To find suitable spots, I'll employ a grid-based approach with rotation. For each of the ten angles I'll test, I'll calculate the minimum and maximum boundaries where the new object’s center must lie. Within these boundaries, I'll create a grid of potential center points (a 6x6 grid per angle, creating 36 candidates per angle). I then iterate through each of the generated candidate locations, checking it against the axis-aligned bounding boxes of the three fixed obstacle objects. If the generated object's AABB is not colliding with any of the three fixed objects, that location is added as a valid placement. Once I have found 50 valid placements, I will stop and return these stable locations. I have made sure to have some error handling in the generation of the grid points so that they work even in cases of no valid ranges. This approach should efficiently and reliably find 50 stable placements.
