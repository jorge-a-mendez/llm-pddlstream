           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable: A Domain Limitation**
           
           Okay, so I'm presented with a planning problem. The goal is straightforward: I need to have five specific objects, v8, v12, v14, v16, and v18, all *on* object v20.  Now, *on* is defined by two predicates: *supported* (which means something is holding the object up) and *atpose* (meaning the object is at a specific pose or location).  Essentially, I need to get each object at a pose where it's *supported* by v20.
           
           Looking at the initial state, all these objects are currently *on* v11.  My mental model tells me I'd need to manipulate them – *pick* them up from v11 and *place* them on v20.  I can see that from the provided data, all these objects are already *supported* by v20 at a specific pose (#o2).  So, conceptually, the plan is simple: pick each object, place it on v20 at that known pose.
           
           However, here's the critical constraint: I'm only allowed to use a very specific set of actions, as provided. These are the *valid action instances*.  And the only action I'm *given* is  `((move_base v3 v3 #o0))`.  This action, based on my understanding of the domain, simply moves the base from location v3 to location v3. It doesn't actually change anything relevant to the objects' positions or their relationship to v20.
           
           Now, my expert judgment kicks in. This tells me that to achieve the *on* predicate and manipulate objects, I would need *pick* and *place* actions. But these crucial actions are *not* provided in my list of *valid action instances*.
           
           This presents a paradox. I need to move and place the objects to achieve the goal, but I'm only allowed to use a move-base action that does nothing of the sort. This strongly indicates a fundamental limitation within the given planning scenario or domain. Therefore, given the available actions, the goal is simply *unreachable*. I can’t change the state to meet the conditions required. I am not able to pick up objects and place them.
