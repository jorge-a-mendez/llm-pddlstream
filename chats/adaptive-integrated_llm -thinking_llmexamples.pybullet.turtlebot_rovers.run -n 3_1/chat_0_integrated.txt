           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).
           
           The initial state is given by the following facts:

           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachable Due to Action Constraints**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`. Examining the axiom definition, I need to establish several facts: `receivedimage` for three objectives, and `receivedanalysis` for two specific rocks (one stone, one soil type).  Easy enough, theoretically.
           
           I've got two rovers at `atconf` locations, and they're `free` at store `v16`.  Perfect. But here's the kicker:  to get those `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` facts, I need `send_image` and `send_analysis` actions, respectively.  And those actions require other actions: `take_image`, `calibrate`, and `sample_rock`.
           
           However, the allowed actions are explicitly limited to `move` and `drop_rock`. No `take_image`, no `calibrate`, no `send_image`, no `sample_rock`, and therefore, no `send_analysis`. Those required actions are simply *not* available within the stated constraints.
           
           Looking at the problem again, the instruction says in plain terms, "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan." The axiom also contains no recursion, meaning I can't derive these crucial actions from those that are available.
           
           Since I can't use the actions necessary to generate the required facts, the goal is, unfortunately, *unachievable* given the provided action set. I've confirmed all the initial state elements are true, but all the goal state elements that aren't already true require actions not permitted. My analysis reveals a fundamental constraint violation making the goal impossible to meet within the scope of permitted actions.
