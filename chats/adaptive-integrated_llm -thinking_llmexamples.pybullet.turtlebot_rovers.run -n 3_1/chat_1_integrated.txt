           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Summary of my Reasoning for the Plan**
           
           Okay, so I'm aiming to achieve this `new-axiom@0()` goal. Breaking it down, I see it involves getting images and analysis results, and ensuring the rovers end up in their original configurations.
           
           First, I need to get images for the objectives using the camera mode. I see that the `receivedimage` predicates require the `send_image` action. To do that I need to `take_image` which in turn requires `calibrate`. So the plan for the imaging should consist of: moving to the image config, calibrating, taking the image, repeating for other objectives, moving to the communication config, and sending the images.
           
           Next up, I need the analysis. I see the `receivedanalysis` predicates need the `send_analysis` action. To send analysis I need to sample. So I will have the rover sample the stone and soil and then move to a communication config and send the analyses.
           
           I had to be careful here: the problem states rovers must end at initial configs, so I need to account for this and make sure they're back. Also, the `free` condition on store v16. So I added a `drop_rock` to ensure the store is free at the end.
           
           The tricky part is choosing the correct configurations for the rovers. I need one config to image (let's say `#o3`), and one to communicate (`#o0`). Then I need the sample location (called #o5).
           
           Also, I've got to ensure the continuous coordinates are correctly chosen and are feasible: I'm making sure these locations are within range, and will not cause collisions in terms of communication or image visibility.
           
           For my plan I decided on these continuous values:
           *   `#o3` (imaging):  (-1.5, 1.9), this is where v12 will go to image the targets.
           *   `#o0` (comms): (-0.5, -2.0), this is where the two rovers will communicate.
           I am interpreting the need for multiple continuous values to refer to different configuration names. Since all my actions utilize a single `#o3` and a single `#o0`, I only need one continuous value for each, not several, even though several images or sends are made from these poses.
           
           Therefore, this plan achieves the goal: it gets the images and results, ensures both rovers are in their right places at the end, and leaves the store free. I believe it is the right plan.

(Thoughts: **Okay, here's my understanding of the situation and the plan I've come up with. It's a bit complex because the instructions seem contradictory in places, but I've done my best to follow the spirit of the task.**
           
           The main problem is that I need to pick valid positions for two rovers (`v12` and `v14`) to complete a set of tasks: imaging, sampling, analyzing, and communicating. The tricky part is that I'm given specific action instances to use and also constraints on *how* to define these positions. The feedback says that some previously tried positions were invalid (e.g., collisions).
           
           Here's the breakdown of what I'm thinking, based on the problem's details:
           
           1.  **Imaging Rover (`v12`)**:  Rover `v12` has to take images of three targets (`v17`, `v18`, `v19`). The problem requires that I use `#o3` for the imaging operations. However, the catch is that the targets are spread out. The distance limit for taking images is also 2. To get a valid imaging plan, I need to pick three valid positions that allow `v12` to "see" each target.
           
           2.  **Sampling and Analyzing Rover (`v14`)**: Rover `v14` needs to sample and analyze rocks (`v3` and `v5`). The core idea is that both rovers must share a communication location for transmission. I need valid locations for `v14` to carry out the sampling and analyze operation.
           
           3.  **Variable Interpretation**: The initial instructions say that I should provide a different continuous value for *each* (rover, target object) pair for `imagevisible`. And this is where it gets interesting, as it is *not* what the action instances and object descriptions suggest.
           
           4.  **Conflicts**: The main point of contention is whether to follow strictly the *syntax* of the PDDL actions or the *instructions*. I'll try to find an *implicit* way to *re-interpret* the variable `#o3`'s meaning, that should be interpreted based on the different object pairs.
           
           Here's my approach:
           *   I will provide the necessary values for the variables `o0`, `o3`, and `o5`. The way I assign these values to targets and rover pairs will define how I solve the imaging part.
           *   For imaging the targets, I'll need three separate `#o3` configuration points for `v12`. I need to ensure that the `#o3` positions are reachable and collision-free to make the `take_image` actions executable.
           *   For sample and analyze, the process will follow the same pattern: a target location for sampling and for analysis.
           *   I need to ensure the communication point does not cause a collision with an obstacle. The best option is `(-1.0, -2.0)`.
           
           *   The PDDL syntax uses literal `#o3` and `#o0`, but I'm going to follow the continuous instruction's advice to ensure that each pair has different values, even if the code calls the same variable name.
           
           *   I'll make each plan as clear as possible by moving the rover to a specific `#o` location for each task. The objective is to make sure the target can be acquired by the robot (range and line of sight) without causing collision with an obstacle.
           
           In summary, I'll pick several configuration points, one for each (rover, target) combination. To make this work, the interpretation is that `#o3` (and `#o5`, `#o0`) *implicitly* become different configurations in the continuous layer depending on the specific action or state predicate. This way, I can ensure collision-free motion and line-of-sight for all tasks while staying within range. The problem is well-defined, and the plan *must* work.

(Thoughts: **A Refined Strategy for Rover Operations**
           
           Okay, so I've been given feedback that my previous configurations were running into some trouble, mainly because of those unreachable positions or collisions. So, I need to rethink everything, keeping in mind the starting points of my rovers, the AABB of the obstacles, and the necessary ranges for image capture (up to 2 units) and communication (up to 4 units).
           
           Here's the new plan: I'm focusing on two rovers. Rover v12 will handle imaging tasks and also sample a soil specimen. Rover v14 will perform a similar role for rock analysis and image capturing.
           
           First, I need to get v12 in position to image two objects: `v18` and `v19`. I've set up a sequence:
           1.  From the start, v12 will go to position `(0.75, -0.6)` to sample a soil specimen, `v5`, a clear path.
           2.  Next, it will move to `(1.8, 1.9)` for `v18`.
           3.  Then to `(0.4, 1.8)` for `v19`.
           4.  Finally, it needs to get into position `(0.5, -2.0)` to send all images and soil analysis to the base for its goals to be satisfied.
           This route will avoid any problems with obstacle `v21`
           
           Rover v14 will follow a different plan. It starts at (-1.0,-1.75).
           1.  Move to `(-1.6, 1.8)` to image `v17`.
           2.  Then sample the stone `v3`. Position `(-0.99, 0.7)`.
           3.  Then position at `(-1.5, -2.0)` for base communication
           
           This separation of tasks makes sense, and is efficient. The paths are now clear. The roles are defined and clear.
           
           I've made sure to calculate the distances to the imaging targets and communication points. They are all within range.
           
           I need to make sure the continuous values make sense with motion and calibration!

Model:     The goal for this task remains `new-axiom@0()`, requiring:
           1.  Rovers `v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`.
           2.  `v16` stores free on both rovers.
           3.  Received images of `v17`, `v18`, `v19` by `v9` in mode `v11`.
           4.  Received analyses of one stone (`v2`) and one soil (`v6`) type rock.
           
           From the initial state:
           *   `v12` is at `v13` (1.0, -1.75).
           *   `v14` is at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75).
           *   Both `v16` stores are free.
           *   `v10` is the camera, `v11` the mode, `v9` the lander.
           *   Objectives: `v17` (approx. (-1.80, 1.93)), `v18` (approx. (1.97, 2.10)), `v19` (approx. (0.50, 1.91)).
           *   Rocks: `v3` (stone, type `v2`, approx. (-0.99, 0.67)), `v5` (soil, type `v6`, approx. (0.75, -0.58)).
           
           Obstacles to avoid:
           *   `v21`: AABB((-0.05, -2.5), (0.05, 2.5)) - vertical barrier at x=0.
           *   `v20`: AABB((-0.59, -1.86), (-0.45, -1.72)).
           *   `v22`: AABB((1.75, 1.75), (2.25, 2.25)).
           *   `v23`: AABB((0.25, 1.75), (0.75, 2.25)).
           *   `v24`: AABB((-2.25, 1.75), (-1.75, 2.25)).
           *   `v19` (objective itself) is an obstacle at (0.46, 1.87).
           *   `v9` (lander itself) is an obstacle at (-2.40, -2.34) to (-1.39, -1.65).
           
           The strategy is to keep `v12` on the positive x-side and `v14` on the negative x-side due to `v21`. We need to carefully select configurations to avoid all new obstacles and ensure reachability.
           
           **Rover `v12` Plan (starts at (1.0, -1.75)):**
           1.  **Sample `v5`**: Move `v12` to `(#o5 v12 #o2 v5)` at `(0.75, -0.5)`. This is very close to `v5` (0.75, -0.58). This is reachable from `v13` and avoids `v21`.
           2.  Sample `v5`.
           3.  Drop `v5`.
           4.  **Image `v18`**: Move `v12` to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v18)` at `(1.6, 2.0)`. This needs to be clear of `v22` (1.75, 1.75 to 2.25, 2.25). Target `v18` is (1.92, 2.05). A configuration at (1.6, 2.0) should be good for imaging.
           5.  Calibrate `v10` and take image of `v18`.
           6.  **Image `v19`**: Move `v12` to `(#o3 v12 #o4 v19)` at `(0.9, 1.8)`. This needs to be clear of `v23` (0.25, 1.75 to 0.75, 2.25) and `v19` itself (0.46, 1.87). Target `v19` is (0.46, 1.87). A configuration at (0.9, 1.8) gives line of sight while avoiding collision.
           7.  Calibrate `v10` and take image of `v19`.
           8.  **Communicate**: Move `v12` to `(#o0 v12 #o1 v9)` at `(0.1, -1.5)`. This configuration is on the positive x-side of `v21`, avoids `v20`, and is close enough to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0) for communication.
           9.  Send image `v18`, `v19`, and analysis `v5`.
           10. Move `v12` back to `v13`.
           
           **Rover `v14` Plan (starts at (-1.0, -1.75)):**
           1.  **Sample `v3`**: Move `v14` to `(#o5 v14 #o2 v3)` at `(-0.9, 0.65)`. This is very close to `v3` (-0.99, 0.67). This is reachable from `v15` and avoids `v21`.
           2.  Sample `v3`.
           3.  Drop `v3`.
           4.  **Image `v17`**: Move `v14` to `(#o3 v14 #o4 v17)` at `(-1.6, 1.5)`. This needs to be clear of `v24` (-2.25, 1.75 to -1.75, 2.25). Target `v17` is (-1.84, 1.89). A configuration at (-1.6, 1.5) provides good line of sight and avoids `v24`.
           5.  Calibrate `v10` and take image of `v17`.
           6.  **Communicate**: Move `v14` to `(#o0 v14 #o1 v9)` at `(-0.5, -1.5)`. This configuration is on the negative x-side of `v21`, avoids `v20` and `v9` itself, and is close enough to `v9` (-1.9, -2.0) for communication.
           7.  Send image `v17` and analysis `v3`.
           8.  Move `v14` back to `v15`.

(Thoughts: **Revised Plan for Rover Missions**
           
           Okay, so I've gotten feedback that some of my previous configurations aren't working. It looks like the main issues are collisions with fixed obstacles and reachability constraints – the rovers might not be able to physically get to those spots. I've re-evaluated the layout and the previous failures to come up with some new, hopefully more viable, plans.
           
           First, I need to keep in mind the obstacles: `v21`, a vertical wall at x=0; `v20`, `v22`, `v23`, `v24`, and `v19`/`v9` itself, which are all specific bounding boxes. I have also re-checked the initial rover positions: `v12` at `v13` (1.0, -1.75) and `v14` at `v15` (-1.0, -1.75). The targets are still `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, `v3`, `v5` and `v9`.
           
           My assumption for reachability is that rovers can move freely within their respective x-halves (x > 0 for `v12`, x < 0 for `v14`), and that moves should be kept relatively small and logical to avoid potential pathfinding issues or violating some implicit map boundary. The robot base's reach is more about pathfinding.
           
           **Revised Rover Configurations:**
           
           *   **Rover `v12`:**
               *   **Sample `v5` (soil):** Instead of (0.75, -0.5), I'm trying **(0.8, -0.8)**. This is a bit further from the rock, but hopefully, the direct path is more accessible and it will satisfy the "above" predicate.
               *   **Image `v18`:** Previous attempt `(1.6, 2.0)` collided with obstacle `v22`. Now I'll try **(1.7, 1.5)**, which is outside the obstacle but close for imaging.
               *   **Image `v19`:** Previous attempt `(0.9, 1.8)` collided with obstacle `v23`.  I am now aiming for **(0.8, 1.5)**, outside `v23`.
               *   **Communicate `v9`:**  Previous failed on collision with `v21`. The new position is **(0.1, -1.0)**, just outside the obstacle region to allow communication with `v9`.
           *   **Rover `v14`:**
               *   **Sample `v3` (stone):** Previous failed, tried  `(-0.9, 0.65)`. Now I'm trying **(-0.8, 0.5)** to sample.
               *   **Image `v17`:**  Previous attempt  `(-1.6, 1.5)` failed. Trying **(-1.7, 1.5)** to avoid collisions with  `v24`, and be within 2 for imaging.
               *   **Communicate `v9`:**  Previously failed at `(-0.5, -1.5)`. I'm trying **(-0.7, -1.0)**, outside the collision zone and in the communication range.
           
           The plan structure stays the same, focusing on sampling/imaging, moving, and communication steps, but all the coordinates are updated to resolve previous failures. The main challenges are staying collision-free, having line-of-sight/comvisibility, and making sure the robot is reachable from its initial position (which might imply having the robot move at any reasonable point-to-point path, within limits). I've double-checked that the robot is both in a reasonable range (imagerange 2, comrange 4) and collision-free from each target, and that the movements between steps look plausible with `dx` and `dy` calculations that look reasonable, with potentially long vertical moves. The failure might be the initial specific path of motion, so I'm assuming that the robot base can move between *any* two coordinates.
           
           The new coordinates, after double checking, still seem correct with respect to all objects. If these fail I'll have to investigate further into the reasoning behind the specific `not reachable` errors, but I believe that these plans are now ready.

(Thoughts: **Plan Refinement for Rovers Domain**
           
           Okay, so the initial request is for a plan in the `rovers` domain to satisfy `Atom new-axiom@0()`. This demands a series of actions focused on two rovers, specifically involving positioning, sampling, imaging, and communication. The key challenge lies in navigation due to the presence of obstacles and constraints.  We're working with two rovers (`v12` and `v14`) and several key locations: the starting points of the rovers (`v13` and `v15`), the objectives, obstacles, and the lander (`v9`).
           
           The fundamental issue in previous attempts was non-reachability – either the rovers were colliding with obstacles or couldn't navigate to the specified locations. The major obstacle is a wall at `x=0` (`v21`), necessitating the rovers to maintain their respective sides of the axis.
           
           Given these constraints, I've redefined the target configurations for each rover.  I've chosen new coordinates, checking if the rovers can navigate to each new location, while simultaneously sampling `v3` and `v5` and maintaining line of sight to the requested objectives.
           
           For `v12` (starting at (1.0, -1.75)), the plan now involves:
           
           *   Sampling soil (`v5`) from (0.9, -0.7).
           *   Imaging the two objectives: `v18` from (1.5, 1.9) and `v19` from (0.9, 1.4).
           *   Communicating with the lander (`v9`) from (0.2, -1.5).
           
           For `v14` (starting at (-1.0, -1.75)):
           
           *   Sampling stone (`v3`) from (-1.0, 0.5).
           *   Imaging objective `v17` from (-1.5, 1.9).
           *   Communicating with the lander from (-0.6, -1.0).
           
           These coordinates are specifically chosen to avoid collision with both the barrier and the other objectives and obstacles. For instance, the proposed target for communication from the rovers (the lander) has been checked to ensure that it doesn't overlap with any other obstacle.
           
           Each sampling and imaging phase is followed by dropping the sampled rocks.
           
           The final communication phase will send the images and analysis results to the lander. The plan assumes line of sight between the rovers and the lander for communication.
           
           In essence, these chosen waypoints should now provide a feasible path, mitigating the previously encountered reachability issues. We must also remember that each image must be taken after recalibrating the camera.

(Thoughts: **My primary concern right now is the "not reachable" error when trying to achieve the `new-axiom@0()` goal in the `rovers` domain.** I've been through multiple iterations, and while the action sequences seem logically sound, the key is finding feasible continuous configurations for the rovers.
           
           The goal requires both rovers at specific configurations, free stores, receiving images of objectives, and analysis of rocks. The initial state gives us a solid starting point, the rovers at their home bases, stores free, and ready to roll.
           
           The challenge is the "not reachable" error. The most critical constraint is the vertical wall at x=0, which mandates that the rovers strictly operate on opposite sides of it. Moreover, the positions of the objectives relative to each other and surrounding obstacles require careful planning.
           
           I've reevaluated the proposed configurations several times, adjusting them based on the objective locations and the positions of surrounding obstacles, like the lander or the vertical wall. The main idea is to start with locations that are reasonably close to the previous point, and avoid obstacles. This is iterative process, since the scene is dynamic in that we want to observe a moving target.
           
           A key understanding from analyzing the `motion` predicates is the crucial relationship between the abstract configurations `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, and their associated continuous values. The planning system works with *abstract* configurations that must eventually be linked to specific continuous locations in the environment. So, the coordinates I specify in the `--Configurations--` section are what the planner will instantiate and use to verify the feasibility of paths.
           
           I'm confident in the structure of the plan, as it aligns with the instructions and the logic for the `sample`, `drop`, `take_image`, and `send_image` actions. The only missing part is continuous parameters for each of those.
           
           I've revised the coordinates to attempt to make the robot configurations more reachable. The "not reachable" error is likely due to my lack of insight into the finer details of the simulation model such as robot kinematics or implicit, unmodeled obstacles. I've chosen configurations by attempting to find points reasonably near target objects, and not too far from the previous location, while strictly avoiding specified obstacles.
           
           With these refined configurations, I'm hoping to overcome the "not reachable" problem and get a working plan. I'll construct a new plan with the coordinates below.
