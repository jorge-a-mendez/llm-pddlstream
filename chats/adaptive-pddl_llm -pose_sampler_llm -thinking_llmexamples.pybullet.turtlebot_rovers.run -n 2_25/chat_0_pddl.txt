           The goal expression is `Atom new-axiom@0()`. Given these elements, the list of available action instances is:
           
           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))
           ((drop_rock v12 v16))
           ((drop_rock v14 v16))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment of the Planning Problem**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to achieve `new-axiom@0()`, a conjunctive goal involving several conditions, primarily focusing on receiving images and analyses of specific rocks and soil samples.  The initial state provides some key facts, like the rovers' initial configurations (`v12` at `v13` and `v14` at `v15`), and that the stores are free (`free(v12, v16)`, `free(v14, v16)`).  The problem lies in how restrictive the available *actions* are.
           
           My initial thought was to devise a plan using the standard actions for image acquisition, analysis, and data transmission. That would involve using `take_image`, `send_image`, `sample_rock`, and `send_analysis`. However, the problem specifies a very limited set of "valid action instances." This list consists of only two no-op "move" actions (for the two rovers) and two `drop_rock` actions. The latter require the state `full(v1x, v16)` which is false in the initial state, rendering them unexecutable.  Moreover, the crucial sentence "Any action instance that is not in the given list is not allowed to be used in the plan" makes it extremely clear that I *cannot* use the standard image and analysis actions.
           
           Given these strict constraints, the problem appears *unsolvable*. The goal contains conditions that are not met in the initial state, and my available options, even the executable ones, do not facilitate those goals. The move actions are no-ops that cannot change the world state in any meaningful way. It's essentially an impossible task: I have a desired end state, but I am provided zero valid paths to achieve it.
