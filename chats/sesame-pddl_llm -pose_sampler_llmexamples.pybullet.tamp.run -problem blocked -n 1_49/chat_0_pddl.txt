           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     The scene consists of a single surface, surface 0, which is a rectangular area. The object is a small square with dimensions 0.07 x 0.07. I need to find 50 stable placements for this object on surface 0.
           
           Since the object is very small relative to the surface and is square, its orientation (theta) doesn't significantly change its footprint, but I should still vary it for diversity. I will place the object at various (x, y) coordinates within the bounds of surface 0, ensuring it's fully contained. The center of the object will be at (x, y).
           
           For a stable placement:
           `surface.lower_x <= x - object_width/2`
           `surface.upper_x >= x + object_width/2`
           `surface.lower_y <= y - object_height/2`
           `surface.upper_y >= y + object_height/2`
           
           Given:
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           Object width = 0.07
           Object height = 0.07
           
           So, for surface 0:
           `x_min = 4.2 + 0.07/2 = 4.2 + 0.035 = 4.235`
           `x_max = 4.8 - 0.07/2 = 4.8 - 0.035 = 4.765`
           `y_min = -0.6 + 0.07/2 = -0.6 + 0.035 = -0.565`
           `y_max = 0.0 - 0.07/2 = 0.0 - 0.035 = -0.035`
           
           I will generate placements by varying x and y within these safe ranges, and also vary theta.

           Please provide a valid placement for the object on one of the surfaces.

Model:     I have received feedback on previous placements. It appears that many of the "unstable" placements were due to the object's AABB exceeding the surface bounds, particularly when placing it very close to the edges. This is likely due to floating-point precision issues or a stricter definition of "contained" than my initial calculation. I need to be more conservative with the placement boundaries.
           
           The previous object (ID: 5) was 0.07x0.07. The current object (ID: 10) is slightly larger at approximately 0.0828x0.0828. This means the safe placement range will shrink further.
           
           For the new object (ID: 10):
           Object width = 0.08281940708407554
           Object height = 0.08281940708407498
           
           Let's use a slightly more conservative buffer, say 0.045 for the half-dimensions, to avoid the edge issues that caused previous failures. This will ensure the center is further from the edges.
           
           Surface 0: `((4.2, -0.6), (4.8, 0.0))`
           
           `x_min_new = 4.2 + 0.08281940708407554/2 + 0.005 = 4.2 + 0.0414 + 0.005 = 4.2464`
           `x_max_new = 4.8 - 0.08281940708407554/2 - 0.005 = 4.8 - 0.0414 - 0.005 = 4.7536`
           `y_min_new = -0.6 + 0.08281940708407498/2 + 0.005 = -0.6 + 0.0414 + 0.005 = -0.5536`
           `y_max_new = 0.0 - 0.08281940708407498/2 - 0.005 = 0.0 - 0.0414 - 0.005 = -0.0464`
           
           I will now generate 50 placements for object ID 10 within these adjusted, more conservative bounds. I will also vary the angles. Since it's still a square, the angle has less impact on its overall AABB, but it's good practice for diversity.
