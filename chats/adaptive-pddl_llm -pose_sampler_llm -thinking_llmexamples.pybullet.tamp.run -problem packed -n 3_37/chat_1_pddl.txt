           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Here's my plan to achieve the goal of having objects `v8`, `v12`, and `v14` on `v16`:**
           
           Initially, I see that these three objects are each supported by another object on `v11`. I also see that each of the objects can be *supported* by `v16`. Since all three need to be supported by `v16`, and I can only perform actions like `pick` and `place` in this PDDL subset, it's clear I need to use the robot arm (`v4`) to move each object individually.
           
           Each of these actions requires that the object be at a certain "pose" and be supported. `Kin` facts exist that bind these objects to particular grasp and base configurations. My plan is simple:
           1.  **Pick** `v8` from its current pose (`v9`) using `arm v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           2.  **Place** `v8` onto `v16` at pose `#o2` using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           3.  **Pick** `v12` from its current pose (`v13`) using `arm v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           4.  **Place** `v12` onto `v16` at pose `#o2` using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           5.  **Pick** `v14` from its current pose (`v15`) using `arm v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           6.  **Place** `v14` onto `v16` at pose `#o2` using arm `v4` with grasp `#o1`.
           
           Each of these steps requires that the arm be empty and the objects be at the pose specified in the `atpose` predicates. I can see that `kin` facts exist with the matching grasps for those objects for the `pick` and `place` actions.
           
           I also observe that the robot's base is at configuration `v3` and there is `atbconf(v3)` which satisfies the `atbconf(#o3)` requirement in the `kin` facts, which I'm assuming is the configuration to pick. Because there is a `move_base` action that moves to the current location, this action doesn't seem necessary, especially given that its effects could be problematic.
           
           Given that I have these conditions, the `move_base` action is not needed and the plan is a simple sequence of *pick* and *place* actions.

User:      The plan you provided contains the following invalid actions: `(pick v4 v8 v9 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v8 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v12 v13 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v12 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4), (pick v4 v14 v15 #o1 #o3 #o4), (place v4 v14 #o2 #o1 #o3 #o4)`. Recall that you are only allowed to use valid actions from the following list: 
           
           ```
           ((move_base v3 v3 #o0))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state using only the valid actions and adhering to the response format.

(Thoughts: **My Assessment: Unsolvable Problem Due to Action Restriction**
           
           Okay, I see the issue. The previous plan was flawed because it included actions that aren't permitted according to the provided action instance list.  The *only* allowed action is `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)`.  I've re-evaluated this action and verified that its preconditions are satisfied in the initial state.  Specifically, `basemotion(v3, #o0, v3)`, `atbconf(v3)`, and `canmove()` are all true. The effect of this action removes `canmove()`, making the agent unable to move after executing the allowed action.
           
           The problem lies in the goal.  We are aiming for `on(v8, v16)`, `on(v12, v16)`, and `on(v14, v16)`. To achieve `on(?o, ?p)`, we need to make `atpose(?o, ?p)` true for a particular placement, given that `supported(?o, ?p, v16)` is true. I know this from my understanding of the problem's axioms. Currently, the objects are at different poses than the goal poses.  The only way to re-orient them is via the place action, which in turn depends on having picked up the object.  I need place and pick actions.
           
           The root of the problem is the severely limited action space. The permitted action `(move_base v3 v3 #o0)` moves the base, and in this specific case, doesn't actually change the base's position. This is useless for manipulating objects and the plan.  This action cannot pick up or place anything. It only moves the base, which makes `canmove()` false. Since `pick` and `place` are not in the list of allowed actions, it is *impossible* to achieve the goal state.  The goal, therefore, is unreachable given the current constraints.  This is a problem that requires an expanded action space to even approach a solution.
