(Thoughts: **Stable Placement Strategy for Object ID 4**
           
           Alright, let's get this done. I need to place this object (ID 4) 50 times stably on this surface. The object's bounding box is about (0.08067, 0.08067), which I'll call `obj_size_x` and `obj_size_y`. The surface, `surf_0`, is a simple square, -0.135 to 0.135 in both x and y.
           
           My strategy is to find a set of placements that satisfy these conditions:
           
           1.  **Fully Containment:** The object must be entirely inside `surf_0`.
           2.  **No Collisions:**  It can't overlap with any other previously placed or fixed obstacles. (Ignoring the collision check for now since I have no information on existing objects/obstacles.)
           
           Since the object is almost square, I'll first assume a rotation of 0 or PI/2, keeping the bounding box at a minimum. For these rotations the object's effective size is (`obj_size_x`, `obj_size_y`), and I know that the surface size is 0.27 x 0.27 centered at (0,0). So, to be inside the surface, I need to ensure the object's center is within a certain range:
           
           `x_center >= -0.135 + obj_size_x/2` and `x_center <= 0.135 - obj_size_x/2`
           `y_center >= -0.135 + obj_size_y/2` and `y_center <= 0.135 - obj_size_y/2`
           
           I calculated the 'half size' of the object is roughly 0.0403382. Then, the usable center range for `x` and `y` are the same (due to it being almost square):
           `x: [-0.09466176, 0.09466176]`
           `y: [-0.09466176, 0.09466176]`
           
           To generate a nice spread, I'll create a 7x7 grid of placements in that valid range at `theta=0`. That gives me 49 placements. I can add a final one at `(0, PI/4, 0.0, 0.0)`.
           
           Here's the detailed plan:
           
           1.  **7x7 Grid:**
               Calculate the step size for `x` and `y`.
               `x_step = 0.18932352852027012 / 6 = 0.03155392142004502`
               `y_step = 0.1893235285202701 / 6 = 0.031553921420045016`
           
           2.  **Placements:** Generate all (0, 0.0, x_i, y_j) using those `x_vals` and `y_vals` for (i, j) = 0 to 6.
               `x_vals`: -0.09466176426013506, -0.06310784284009004, -0.03155392142004502, 0.0, 0.03155392142004502, 0.06310784284009004, 0.09466176426013506

(Thoughts: **Generating Stable Placements for Object ID 5**
           
           Okay, so I'm focusing on placing this new object, ID 5, stably on `surf_0`.  Since there's no interference from object ID 4 (as far as I know), I only need to consider the surface constraints.  The surface is a square, centered at the origin, with dimensions of 0.27 x 0.27. The new object is almost a square with dimensions approximately 0.09896 x 0.09896.
           
           To ensure stability, I need to make sure the object's axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) stays within the surface's AABB.  I'm going to generate a list of potential placements based on this constraint.
           
           **Strategy for Placement Generation:**
           
           *   **Theta = 0 (and multiples):**  I'll start with the object oriented directly.  I've calculated the valid x and y ranges for the object's center. It looks like it should be a 6x6 grid of placements within this range, 36 in total.
           *   **Theta = PI/2 (90 degrees):** Rotating the object by PI/2 doesn't change the bounds in this case. I will use a smaller 3x3 grid centered in the same range.
           *   **Theta = PI/4 (45 degrees):** Rotating the object by 45 degrees changes the AABB, so I'll also generate placements for this case using the new AABB values. The center of the object will be in a smaller box.  I'll add 5 placements here at 45 degrees.
           
           **Placement Details:**
           
           I've calculated the x and y ranges for the object's center for theta = 0, which are approximately [-0.0855, 0.0855] x [-0.0855, 0.0855].  With this, I've generated a set of valid x and y coordinates for our first placement grid, and will use that to create 36 placement candidates. For the PI/2 and PI/4 rotations, I'll calculate the appropriate center points. This strategy will guarantee 50 placements.

(Thoughts: **My Strategy for Placing Object ID 6**
           
           Okay, so I've got a new request for Object ID 6 on Surface 0.  My main objective: find 50 stable placements, and absolutely no collisions with the previously placed objects, ID 4 and ID 5. This will be tricky, as I need to account for their shape and position.
           
           First, I looked at the surface and the new object. Surface 0 is a square, 0.27 x 0.27. Object ID 6 is almost square, with dimensions of about 0.075 x 0.075.
           
           I've already got successful placements from the past:
           *   ID 4, at (-0.0946, -0.0946)
           *   ID 5, at (-0.0855, -0.0855)
           *   ID 5, at (-0.0855, -0.0513)
           *   ID 4, at (-0.0946, -0.0631)
           *   ID 5, at (-0.0855, -0.0171)
           
           To ensure no collisions, I have to figure out the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) of these existing objects (which are to be treated as obstacles). I calculated the AABBs of those existing objects.
           * AABB of ID 4 placements cover a large rectangular block.
           * AABB of ID 5 overlaps with the ID 4 placements.
           
           The problem statement indicated the previously successful placements are fixed, and should act as obstacles.  My prior assessment of collision detection might have been slightly off - I need to ensure *this* new object doesn't collide with these existing objects. The task is to avoid any collision between Object ID 6 and the AABBs of IDs 4 and 5. This simplifies the approach.
           
           Since all previous successful placements were at theta=0.0, the AABB is simply `(center_x - half_size_x, center_y - half_size_y)` to `(center_x + half_size_x, center_y + half_size_y)`.
           I calculated AABB for each of the placements.
           
           Next, I need to come up with a placement strategy.
           
           I determined that for `theta = 0`, the center of ID 6 has to fit within the surface boundaries.
           
           I saw the obstacle and the surface and realized that since the existing objects are placed in the bottom-left, that limits my placement options. I need to get clever.
           
           I have come up with two key strategies.
           1. Find placements to the "right" of the existing obstacle (i.e. to ensure `cx - half_sx6 >= O_xmax`)
           2. Find placements that are "above" the existing obstacle (i.e. to ensure `cy - half_sy6 >= O_ymax`).
           
           Given that the current obstacle is rectangular, and the space left over is also rectangular, I will discretize those spaces by dividing up the two regions with regular grids.
           
           I have to carefully construct these grids so I can reach 50 *valid* points.
           
           I determined I could place 35 points to the "right" of the obstacle and 14 above to meet my 50 count.
           
           The plan is to generate 81 points in total, and keep the ones that don't collide.
           *   5 by 7 points in the right region, and 4 by 2 for the above area. This gives a total of 49.
           *   The 50th point can be a `theta = PI/4` point with `center_x = 0.04947834211862913` and `center_y = 0.0`. This will be in the open space. I validated that this new point will *not* collide, too.
           
           So, I'm going to follow this: build the grid, check for collision with AABBs, and make the 50 points (I have 49 already for `theta=0`). This looks like a solid plan.  I am confident that I can execute it.

           I have to carefully construct these grids so I can reach 50 *valid* points.
           
           I determined I could place 35 points to the "right" of the obstacle and 14 above to meet my 50 count.
           
           The plan is to generate 81 points in total, and keep the ones that don't collide.
           *   5 by 7 points in the right region, and 4 by 2 for the above area. This gives a total of 49.
           *   The 50th point can be a `theta = PI/4` point with `center_x = 0.04947834211862913` and `center_y = 0.0`. This will be in the open space. I validated that this new point will *not* collide, too.
           
           So, I'm going to follow this: build the grid, check for collision with AABBs, and make the 50 points (I have 49 already for `theta=0`). This looks like a solid plan.  I am confident that I can execute it.
