           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           ```
           ((move v12 v13 #o2 v13))
           ((move v14 v15 #o2 v15))

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **Goal Unreachability Analysis**
           
           Okay, here's what I've distilled from this problem: We're dealing with a goal, `new-axiom@0()`, which essentially boils down to getting some images and analyses sent to the lander. The initial state gives us a solid starting point with the rovers at known configurations and some objectives and modes already defined. The core challenge lies in the actions required to achieve the `receivedimage` and `receivedanalysis` predicates.
           
           To get those images and analyses, we need the rovers to communicate with the lander. That requires taking images, analyzing rocks, and then transmitting the results. Let's break down the dependencies: Taking an image requires calibrating the camera and having it *imagevisible*. Transmitting the data requires the rover to be *comvisible*. Analyzing a rock relies on being *above* the rock.
           
           Now, the crucial point: the initial state tells us the rovers are at the *atconf* facts. The problem provides *move* actions: The rovers can only move from their current configuration to their current configuration. They cannot move to different configurations (the required `conf` predicates for image taking, image sending, or rock sampling and analysis). The rovers start in the current state with the appropriate setup.
           
           Given the constraints on the *move* actions and the need to be in different *conf* states to satisfy preconditions, it's clear the rovers simply cannot get to the necessary configurations to complete the image taking, transmitting, and rock analysis tasks. We are limited to the actions provided, and it's impossible for the rovers to change their configuration.
           
           Therefore, the `new-axiom@0()` goal is demonstrably unreachable given the available actions and the initial state. No plan can be constructed to achieve it, and it does not matter if the objectives, modes, and other conditions are fulfilled, it is impossible for the rovers to operate.
