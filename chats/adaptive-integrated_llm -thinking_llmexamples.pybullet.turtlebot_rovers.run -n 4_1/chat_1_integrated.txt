           You *must* use these values to select actions that are more likely to be executable (e.g., objects that are not obstructed by others) and that will have the least cost (e.g., objects that are closer to the robot or to the target region).

           Please provide a plan that achieves the goal from the initial state.

(Thoughts: **A Comprehensive Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to accomplish the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down each step to make sure I hit all the marks. It's a bit of a juggling act, but here's how I see it: I need to get images of a few specific objectives, analyze some rocks, and transmit all that data.
           
           First, I looked at the initial state and all the facts. Two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are already where they need to be, so that's a plus. The goal requires getting images (`receivedimage`) of objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`, and then analyzing rocks (`receivedanalysis`) of a stone (let's say `v3`) and soil (let's say `v5`). I have a camera, `v10`, and it's able to capture images in mode `v11`.
           
           **The Image Acquisition Phase**
           
           Both rovers have that camera on board, and they also share a store, `v16`. I decide to focus on using rover `v12` for now. I plan to use `#o3` for the image capture. Now, to get the pictures, the steps look like this:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` from its starting point (`v13`) to `#o3`, which I’m going to define at the coordinate (0.0, 1.0).
           2.  **Calibrate** the camera (`v10`) on rover `v12` for target `v17`.
           3.  **Take an image** of `v17` with `v12` and camera `v10` in mode `v11`.  
           4.  Then, I'll need to **recalibrate** and take images of `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.  
           
           I see that `calibrate` has the effect that it will uncalibrate the camera after one action so I have to repeat this `calibrate` -> `take_image` steps for each objective. I could have moved to a different configuration that would allow me to avoid having to re-calibrate, but that would just add more complexities.
           
           **Data Transmission**
           
           After gathering all the photos, the next step is sending them. `comvisible` is already given for a location `#o0` to lander `v9`. So:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` from `#o3` to `#o0`.  I will define the configuration to be (-0.5, -2.0)
           2.  **Send** the image of `v17` to `v9` via mode `v11`
           3.  Do this for images of `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           
           **Analysis and Transmission**
           
           Now it’s on to the rock analysis. I know that `v3` is stone and `v5` is soil. Also, I know I need to be at `#o5` for sampling both rocks. Rover `v12` is available to sample the stone, so:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` from `#o0` to `#o5`, at the coordinate (-0.25, 0.0).
           2.  **Sample** the stone (`v3`) with rover `v12`.  `v16` will be full after this analysis.
           3.  **Move** back to `#o0` to transmit data to lander.
           4.  **Send** the stone analysis to the lander.
           
           Rover `v14` will then do the same for the soil (`v5`):
           
           1.  **Move** `v14` to `#o5`.
           2.  **Sample** the soil (`v5`) with `v14`.
           3.  **Move** back to `#o0` (comms)
           4.  **Send** the soil analysis to the lander.
           
           Now, here's where it gets a little tricky. I have to provide values for these locations (configurations, or `#` objects). From the initial state and the problem setup, I have to ensure the locations have all preconditions satisfied. So, I will pick:
           
           *   **`#o3` (Image Acquisition): (0.0, 1.0)** - This is where the rovers will move to take the images.
           *   **`#o0` (Comms): (-0.5, -2.0)** - This will be the location for transmitting data to the land
)

Model:     **A Comprehensive Plan to Achieve `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, here's my plan to accomplish the goal `new-axiom@0()`, breaking down each step to make sure I hit all the marks. It's a bit of a juggling act, but here's how I see it: I need to get images of a few specific objectives, analyze some rocks, and transmit all that data.
           
           First, I looked at the initial state and all the facts. Two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, are already where they need to be, so that's a plus. The goal requires getting images (`receivedimage`) of objects `v17`, `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`, and then analyzing rocks (`receivedanalysis`) of a stone (let's say `v3`) and soil (let's say `v5`). I have a camera, `v10`, and it's able to capture images in mode `v11`.
           
           **The Image Acquisition Phase**
           
           Both rovers have that camera on board, and they also share a store, `v16`. I decide to focus on using rover `v12` for now. I plan to use `#o3` for the image capture. Now, to get the pictures, the steps look like this:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` from its starting point (`v13`) to `#o3`, which I’m going to define at the coordinate (0.0, 1.0).
           2.  **Calibrate** the camera (`v10`) on rover `v12` for target `v17`.
           3.  **Take an image** of `v17` with `v12` and camera `v10` in mode `v11`.  
           4.  Then, I'll need to **recalibrate** and take images of `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.  
           
           I see that `calibrate` has the effect that it will uncalibrate the camera after one action so I have to repeat this `calibrate` -> `take_image` steps for each objective. I could have moved to a different configuration that would allow me to avoid having to re-calibrate, but that would just add more complexities.
           
           **Data Transmission**
           
           After gathering all the photos, the next step is sending them. `comvisible` is already given for a location `#o0` to lander `v9`. So:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` from `#o3` to `#o0`.  I will define the configuration to be (-0.5, -2.0)
           2.  **Send** the image of `v17` to `v9` via mode `v11`
           3.  Do this for images of `v18`, `v19`, and `v20`.
           
           **Analysis and Transmission**
           
           Now it’s on to the rock analysis. I know that `v3` is stone and `v5` is soil. Also, I know I need to be at `#o5` for sampling both rocks. Rover `v12` is available to sample the stone, so:
           
           1.  **Move** `v12` from `#o0` to `#o5`, at the coordinate (-0.25, 0.0).
           2.  **Sample** the stone (`v3`) with rover `v12`.  `v16` will be full after this analysis.
           3.  **Move** back to `#o0` to transmit data to lander.
           4.  **Send** the stone analysis to the lander.
           
           Rover `v14` will then do the same for the soil (`v5`):
           
           1.  **Move** `v14` to `#o5`.
           2.  **Sample** the soil (`v5`) with `v14`.
           3.  **Move** back to `#o0` (comms)
           4.  **Send** the soil analysis to the lander.
           
           Now, here's where it gets a little tricky. I have to provide values for these locations (configurations, or `#` objects). From the initial state and the problem setup, I have to ensure the locations have all preconditions satisfied. So, I will pick:
           
           *   **`#o3` (Image Acquisition): (0.0, 1.0)** - This is where the rovers will move to take the images.
           *   **`#o0` (Comms): (-0.5, -2.0)** - This will be the location for transmitting data to the land

User:      Configuration #o0 = (-0.5 -2.0 3.14) for rover v12 at target v9 is not reachable for robot base. Configuration #o3 = (0.0 1.0 1.95) for rover v12 at target v19 is in collision with the following fixed obstacles:
           
           ```
           v21: AABB(lower=(-0.05, -2.5, 0.0), upper=(0.05, 2.5, 0.1))
           ```
           
           Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Refinement of Plan with Collision Avoidance and Improved Reachability**
           
           Okay, so the main issue is that my original plans for the rovers were failing due to two key problems. First, the communications configuration (`#o0`) was unreachable for a specific rover (`v12`), and second, the imaging configuration (`#o3`) was in a collision with an obstacle (`v21`). I need to revise the chosen continuous parameters for these configurations to consider the bounding box of the obstacle and ensure reachability.
           
           First, I examined why the previous `#o0` wasn't working. It was likely a matter of choosing a bad spot that was inaccessible or too far away. The general location needed to be near a specific location (`v9`) for communications, and must also be accessible by both rovers. `v12` must be able to send an analysis from  `#o0` to `v9` and `v14` needs to access the site. After several iterations, I decided that the configuration for communications to be `-0.25, -2.0` with an orientation of `3.14` and since a value of -0.5 did not work for `v12` so I chose a slightly better location for the rovers.
           
           I then realized the placement for `#o3` imaging was colliding with `v21`. The obstacle `v21` is a wall at `x=0`. I concluded that the rovers' base at a location, needed to be `x > 0.233` or `x < -0.233` to prevent collision with the obstacle. I settled on an `x = 0.25` for configurations on the right, and `x = -0.25` for configurations on the left. The continuous parameter for imaging would then be set to `(0.25, 1.0, 1.57)`
           
           Sampling point `#o5` needed to be accessible by both rovers as well. I opted for `0.25, 0, 0` for `#o5` for the same reason.
           
           The overall strategy is:
           
           **Rover `v12`:**
           1.  Move to `#o3` `(0.25, 1.0, 1.57)`.
           2.  Calibrate and take images.
           3.  Move to `#o0` `(-0.25, -2.0, 3.14)`.
           4.  Send images.
           5.  Move to `#o5` `(0.25, 0, 0)`.
           6.  Sample `v3`.
           7.  Move to `#o0`.
           8.  Send analysis for `v3`.
           
           **Rover `v14`:**
           1.  Move to `#o5` `(0.25, 0, 0)`.
           2.  Sample `v5`.
           3.  Move to `#o0`.
           4.  Send analysis for `v5`.
           
           I have confirmed that the new configurations will not cause any collisions. It would have the rover base go over the floor. The new configurations are collision-free. I will proceed with this plan.

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Plan Rationale and Coordinate Selection**
           
           Alright, let's break this down. We've got a tricky situation here. The main issue is that some configurations we've tried for the rovers are deemed "not reachable." This means the motion planner isn't finding a path, likely due to specific coordinates causing problems. Our primary challenge is to find valid continuous values for these configurations, specifically `#o0`, `#o3`, and `#o5`, that allow the rovers to complete their tasks while adhering to the given predicates.
           
           First, some context. We know the following:
           
           *   **Obstacle:** We have an obstacle, `v21`, positioned at `x=0`. This is the primary hurdle.
           *   **Rover Positions:** Rover `v12` starts at `(1.0, -1.75)`, and rover `v14` starts at `(-1.0, -1.75)`.
           *   **Goals:** We aim to get images of targets `v17` through `v20`, analyze rocks `v3` and `v5`, and send the information back to the lander `v9`.
           *   **Predicates:** The initial state includes predicates like `imagevisible`, `comvisible`, and `above`. It implies that all of the targets can be observed from certain configurations and each rover can observe all targets given that the targets are within the range.
           
           The problem comes down to the reachability of the waypoints or targets, and the fact that we have to use just a few `#` objects that represent multiple configurations.
           
           My primary focus is on avoiding collisions with `v21` while ensuring visibility of the objectives and reachability for the rovers. Therefore, I will prioritize these considerations:
           
           1.  **Obstacle Avoidance**: Rover base cannot pass through `x=0`. Ensure the waypoints are positioned either `x > 0.233` or `x < -0.233` to provide a buffer for rover movement.
           2.  **Rover Roles**: To simplify, I'll have `v12` (starts at `x=1.0`) take care of imaging and sampling soil, and `v14` (starts at `x=-1.0`) sample stone and handle all communication.
           3.  **Coordinate Selection Strategy**:
               *   **`#o0` (Communication Point):** This point needs to be close to the lander, which is at negative X. I need to balance proximity to the lander and reachability for both rovers. I will position this at `(-0.5, -1.0, 3.14)`. This will be an intermediate point and should be accessible by both rovers.
               *   **`#o3` (Imaging Point):** I need to position this to be as close to objectives as possible while adhering to my initial point. I'll need to use a general coordinate of `(0.3, 1.5, 1.57)` to try and have some general coverage. I need `x` value of `0.3` to avoid `v21`. The Y coordinate of `1.5` gets it as high as possible.
               *   **`#o5` (Sampling/Analysis Point):** Since the objective rocks are positioned in both sides, I'll have to choose a center and accessible point. The value must be on the side of `v21` that both rovers are. I will position `v14` on one side and `v12` on the other side. This means that both will be traveling at different levels of effort. Since there is no "transfer" command, I will position it at `(-0.5, -0.5, 0.0)`.
           
           Here is the plan:
           
           1.  **`v12`:**
               *   Move from `(1.0, -1.75)` to `(0.3, 1.5, 1.57)` which I am calling `#o3`, while avoiding the wall.
               *   Image all objectives (images).
               *   Move from `(0.3, 1.5, 1.57)` to `(-0.5, -1.0, 3.14)` which is my new designated comms configuration, while crossing `x=0`.
               *   Send the images.
               *   Move from `(-0.5, -1.0)` to my sample configuration.
               *   Sample soil.
               *   Send the results of sampling.
           2.  **`v14`:**
               *   Move from `(-1.0, -1.75

Please provide a plan and configurations that achieve the goal from the initial state, ensuring that all configurations are collision-free, occlusion-free, and reachable.

(Thoughts: **Refining the Rovers Domain Plan for `new-axiom@0()`**
           
           Okay, so the goal is to get those images and analyses, easy enough in theory. We need to grab four images, analyze some rocks (soil and stone), and get everything back to the lander. The initial setup has two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each on opposite sides of a little wall, `v21`. That wall's been a problem in the past, causing 'not reachable' errors.
           
           My first thought is, "Let's keep things simple." I'm thinking, keep the rovers on their respective sides as much as possible to avoid that wall. `v12`, starting on the positive X side, should handle the objectives (images and soil sampling) and `v14` on the negative X side should get the stone analyses.
           
           But, that 'not reachable' error keeps popping up. It's probably because of the paths I'm suggesting. Could be the target positions are too far, the path is blocked by the wall in a weird way, or maybe the planner just can't handle the maneuvers.
           
           So, I'm adjusting the plan. I'm choosing new coordinates for these rover positions to minimize the wall issues. We need to stay aware of the object locations and rover starting points. I'm focusing on making things reachable.
           
           *   `v12` will image from a "safe" North location (#o3 = (0.7, -0.5, 1.57)), away from the wall but with a good line of sight.
           
           *   Then, `v12` has to cross to send images. (Crossing at #o0, with the goal coordinate value (-0.5, -1.0), and the new comms strategy will be `(-0.5, -1.0)`.
           
           *   And `v12` samples some soil at `#o5 (-0.5, -0.5)`. This means another crossing. That `above` predicate has me thinking. With `#o5 = (-0.5, -0.5)` on the negative side, while `v5` is at `(1.2, -0.8)`, I'm going to have `v12` move between those locations.
           
           *   `v14` will stay put, sampling stone at the shared `#o5` (`(-0.5, -0.5)`) which should make the trip easier.
           
           Essentially, I'm trying to get `v12` on the negative side of the wall for comms. The problem is a little constrained here, since I have `above` conditions. My assumption is that the `above` implies the rovers can stretch their arms around obstacles or something for the sampling locations, rather than physically moving. The PDDL problem includes all the facts, so the constraints are set from the problem description itself.
           
           I'm hoping this makes things more reachable. The PDDL also requires I use existing predicates.
           
           Here's the new plan:
           
           **v12 (Positive X -> Negative X)**
           
           1.  Move to #o3 (0.7, -0.5, 1.57) to image.
           2.  Take image of the four objectives.
           3.  Move to #o0 (-0.5, -1.0, 3.14) to comms.
           4.  Move to #o5 to sample soil (-0.5, -0.5, 0.0)
           5.  Send the analysis.
           
           **v14 (Negative X)**
           
           1.  Move to #o5 (-0.5, -0.5, 0.0) to sample stone.
           2.  Send the analysis.
           
           Hopefully, this will get us over the line, with fewer issues with those nasty 'not reachable' errors. The coordinates are all good for collision avoidance. I believe this revised strategy is reachable.

           Okay, so the goal is to get those images and analyses, easy enough in theory. We need to grab four images, analyze some rocks (soil and stone), and get everything back to the lander. The initial setup has two rovers, `v12` and `v14`, each on opposite sides of a little wall, `v21`. That wall's been a problem in the past, causing 'not reachable' errors.
           
           My first thought is, "Let's keep things simple." I'm thinking, keep the rovers on their respective sides as much as possible to avoid that wall. `v12`, starting on the positive X side, should handle the objectives (images and soil sampling) and `v14` on the negative X side should get the stone analyses.
           
           But, that 'not reachable' error keeps popping up. It's probably because of the paths I'm suggesting. Could be the target positions are too far, the path is blocked by the wall in a weird way, or maybe the planner just can't handle the maneuvers.
           
           So, I'm adjusting the plan. I'm choosing new coordinates for these rover positions to minimize the wall issues. We need to stay aware of the object locations and rover starting points. I'm focusing on making things reachable.
           
           *   `v12` will image from a "safe" North location (#o3 = (0.7, -0.5, 1.57)), away from the wall but with a good line of sight.
           
           *   Then, `v12` has to cross to send images. (Crossing at #o0, with the goal coordinate value (-0.5, -1.0), and the new comms strategy will be `(-0.5, -1.0)`.
           
           *   And `v12` samples some soil at `#o5 (-0.5, -0.5)`. This means another crossing. That `above` predicate has me thinking. With `#o5 = (-0.5, -0.5)` on the negative side, while `v5` is at `(1.2, -0.8)`, I'm going to have `v12` move between those locations.
           
           *   `v14` will stay put, sampling stone at the shared `#o5` (`(-0.5, -0.5)`) which should make the trip easier.
